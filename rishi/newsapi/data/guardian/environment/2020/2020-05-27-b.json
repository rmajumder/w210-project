  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global confirmed deaths near 355,000</h2> <p>The confirmed number of fatalities from Covid-19 around the world now stands at 354,944, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The number of confirmed cases is 5,682,389.</p> <p>The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to represent a significant underestimate of the true scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting.</p> <h2>US passes 100,000 confirmed deaths</h2> <p>According to figures from Johns Hopkins University, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-deaths-toll-1000000\">US death toll as a result of Covid-19 was 100,047</a>.</p> <p>Donald Trump, the US president, had said earlier this month that such an outcome would be horrible, but with yet a considerable amount of extra deaths likely to occur the final toll could well in excess of this grim milestone.</p> <h2>Pressure grows on UK prime minister and chief of staff</h2> <p>Boris Johnson, the UK\u2019s prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/tory-anger-at-dominic-cummings-grows-as-dozens-of-mps-defy-boris-johnson\">remained under pressure</a> from his own party to sack Dominic Cummings as more Conservative MPs and senior figures in the party called for the controversial adviser\u2019s head.</p> <p>At least 61 MPs out of 365 have either called for him to resign or be sacked, or have expressed anger at his actions. Penny Mordaunt, a current minister, said in a letter to a constituent that there were \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Cummings\u2019 account and apologised for how recent days have \u201cundermined key public health messages\u201d.</p> <h2>BBC drops presenter from programme after Cummings remarks</h2> <p>The lead presenter of the BBC\u2019s late-night news show Newsnight, Emily Maitlis, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/27/bbc-switches-emily-maitlis-in-newsnight-episode-over-cummings-remarks\">dropped from fronting the show on Wednesday night</a> having delivered an address to viewers the previous evening that was seen to attack the government\u2019s handling of Dominic Cummings\u2019 lockdown trip to Durham.</p> <p>The show\u2019s editor, Esme Wren, denied that Maitlis had been replaced by Katie Razzall as hundreds of users of Twitter criticised the corporation.</p> <h2>Argentina \u2018cordons off slums\u2019 after surge in cases</h2> <p>Security forces in Buenos Aires <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/argentina-cordons-off-coronavirus-slum-ghettoes-for-poor-people\">cordoned off one of the city\u2019s largest and poorest slums</a>, stopping inhabitants from entering or leaving Villa Azul, on the outskirts of the Argentinian capital, after a surge of Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>Police officers erected barriers on Monday after widespread testing was launched in Villa Azul. By Wednesday 174 of 301 tests come back positive, and officials feared the 4,000 or so inhabitants of the neighbourhood could spread the virus to other areas.</p> <h2>Chechen leader makes first public outing in nearly a fortnight</h2> <p>Chechnya\u2019s strongman leader Ramzan Kadyrov made his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/ramzan-kadyrov-appears-in-public-after-covid-19-illness-reports\">first public appearance in nearly a fortnight</a> following reports that he had flown to Moscow for coronavirus treatment.</p> <p>He was filmed on Tuesday in Grozny, Chechnya\u2019s capital, holding a government meeting on the region\u2019s response to the pandemic, and in a post on Instagram on Wednesday, he refused to say of he had contracted the virus but offered a vigorous defence of his right to fall ill.</p>",

Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest news:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>More than 40 Tory MPs have now called for Dominic Cummings to go. </strong>With Downing Street continuing to defend him, the senior government minister Penny Mordaunt also said there were \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Cummings\u2019 account of his actions and apologised to her constituents for how recent days were distracting from key public health messages. The former de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green criticised Cummings, but stopped short of calling for him to go.</li> \n   <li><strong>The former home secretary, Amber Rudd, added her voice to those calling for Cummings\u2019 departure.</strong> Rudd, who stood down as an MP in December, told ITV\u2019s Peston programme that Cummings\u2019 continued presence in No 10 was making the government\u2019s job more difficult at a time of national crisis.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson said an independent inquiry into Dominic Cummings\u2019 actions wouldn\u2019t be a good use of official time.</strong> The PM was grilled on the Cummings affair and his government\u2019s response to the pandemic by the powerful liaison committee. Under forensic questioning and several times facing the charges of putting political concerns before the nation\u2019s health and of underestimating the public\u2019s anger, the prime minister said it was time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the \u201cvery frustrating\u201d episode. He also didn\u2019t give a clear answer on whether he was saying that if people don\u2019t have access to childcare they could do what Cummings did.</li> \n   <li><strong>The NHS test and trace programme goes live at 9am on Thursday.</strong> If you get a call from a contact tracer because you\u2019ve been in contact with an infected person, you must isolate for 14 days, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms. The government has said these instructions must be followed. Though they will be voluntary at first, they will be made mandatory if necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s your civic duty to follow test and trace instructions,\u201d Matt Hancock said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Officers are reporting people breaking lockdown rules and using Dominic Cummings as an excuse, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner said. </strong>David Jamieson told the BBC in the last few days the public has pushed back and the police\u2019s ability to enforce the rules has been undermined. He said people are telling officers that \u201cif it is OK for Cummings, it is OK for us\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Most people now believe there is \u201cone rule for them, and one rule for us\u201d after Cummings remained in post despite breaching the lockdown, a government adviser said. </strong>Prof Stephen Reicher, who advises the government on human behaviour during disease outbreaks. He has told Channel 4 News: \u201cAnd all the research on compliance with authority shows that it depends critically on thinking that authority is part of us, is with us, is for us. And so, once you create that sense of \u2018us and them\u2019, you undermine trust and you undermine compliance.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you\u2019d like to read yet more, head over to our global pandemic live blog, which is still running:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/27/coronavirus-live-news-spain-begins-10-days-of-mourning-as-global-deaths-near-350000\">Coronavirus live news: US deaths from Covid-19 have passed 100,000</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T23:08:13.779Z\">at 12.08am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eceec948f0898700351d890\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T22:42:23.505Z\">11.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>McGuinness said Cummings\u2019 actions had undermined the goodwill needed to maintain the lockdown.

It is vital that adequate support is on hand, to enable all directors of public health and Public Health England consultants leading these local systems, to deliver this effectively.</p> \n   <p>The safety of the public and key workers is paramount and given the limits of the test itself, self-isolation of those with symptoms and their contacts is even more vital. This will require good communication with the public at a national level.</p> \n   <p>Establishing local test, track and trace is a step in the right direction but will require significant resources, monitoring and vigilance to ensure that it is working effectively across the country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eced6db8f087e3ca0f64ac8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T21:22:08.609Z\">10.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Alicia Kearns</strong>, the Tory MP for Rutland and Melton, is another to criticise Cummings, while stopping short of calling for his departure.

I would not have done the same.</p> \n   <p>Mr Cummings believed he was protecting his family, and not just from his fear of not being able to care for his child, but from the abuse his family was enduring at their home. I know what it is to be a worried parent, but his actions have caused much disappointment.</p> \n   <p>Mr Cummings has accepted that he could have done better. I agree.</p> \n   <p>With regards to his travelling to County Durham, he was acting within the very limits of what Deputy Chief Medical Advisor Dr Harries OBE set out at the daily televised press conference on 24th March when she said \u2018clearly if you have adults that are unable to look after a small child, that is an exceptional circumstance\u2019.</p> \n   <p>It is for the police, not me, to determine whether Mr Cummings breached the lockdown guidelines.

Leaving women behind means we risk no economic recovery at all.</p> \n   <p>What this study shows is that we are going backwards and that is extremely worrying. There is also the real prospect of two-tier workplaces as the lockdown is eased with men getting back into work and women still left at home caring for children, without nursery places or schools fully open for months. </p> \n   <p>Government must now prioritise strategic investment to create a childcare infrastructure, reform parental leave, to equalise parenting in a child\u2019s first year and normalise flexible and remote working in the post-Covid economy.

  "<p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 28 May.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>The&nbsp;New South Wales&nbsp;government has quietly paid out millions of dollars to more than a dozen former schoolchildren who it admits were abused by a paedophile</strong> teacher who rose through the ranks of the state\u2019s public school system over three decades while preying on young Indigenous boys. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/28/nsw-government-secretly-paid-millions-victims-teacher-paedophile-cletus-oconnor-indigenous-men\">Since April 2018, lawyers from the state\u2019s education department have signed out-of-court settlements with 14 men from across western&nbsp;NSW</a>. The men, who are all Indigenous, are predominantly based in Dubbo. The department has never publicly disclosed the settlements, which in some cases included confidentiality clauses preventing disclosure of the value of the payouts. Nor has it acknowledged the existence of a serial paedophile in the public school system, a step that might have encouraged others to come forward.</p> \n<p><strong>360 people have been arrested in Hong Kong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-trump-china-security-crackdown-protests\">as thousands of armed police clashed with demonstrators</a> engaged in day-long protests,</strong> sparked by China\u2019s plans to introduce sweeping anti-sedition laws in the former British territory. Those arrested have been charged with offences including unauthorised assembly and possession of objects such as petrol bombs, with police firing pepper-spray bullets into assembled crowds, gathered to prevent the passing of a law criminalising ridicule of China\u2019s national anthem. The EU has called on China to respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, but on Wednesday US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-china-autonomous-us-pompeo-security-law\">paved the way to revoke the territory\u2019s&nbsp;preferential trade and financial status</a>, telling Congress the Trump administration no longer regards Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China.</p> \n<p><strong>Two-thirds of Australians in households where the main breadwinner has lost employment are living below the poverty line,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/28/poverty-findings-heighten-calls-to\">a major new report has found</a>.

  "<p>White police officer <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/what-we-know-about-derek-chauvin-and-tou-thao-two-of-the-officers-caught-on-tape-in-the-death-of-george-floyd/570777632/\">Derek Chauvin</a> pinned George Floyd to the concrete as he hollered that he could not breathe. George screamed. Screamed for his mother. Screamed for his breath. For his life.</p> <p>For many watching the footage, George\u2019s cries echoed Eric Garner\u2019s \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d New York police department officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Garner a couple of weeks before a Ferguson police officer killed Michael Brown. George\u2019s plea reminds me of another black man shot by police: Eric Harris. In 2015, Tulsa reserve deputy Robert Bates told Harris \u201cfuck your breath\u201d.&nbsp;That same year, Fairfax county law enforcement tased Natasha McKenna four times while she sought help during a mental health crisis. As they were brutalizing her, she said, \u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t kill me.\u201d For me, the image of the white officer kneeling into George\u2019s back reminds me most of Freddie Gray. Baltimore police severed Gray\u2019s spine through an intentional rough ride in the back of a police van.</p> <p>George, like <a href=\"https://www.vibe.com/2020/05/sean-reed-black-man-killed-by-indianapolis-police\">Dreasjon Reed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-killing-of-breonna-taylor-fuels-calls-to-end-no-knock-warrants-11590332400\">Breonna Taylor</a> and other black people killed by police this year, should be alive and breathing. This cycle \u2013 murder, protest, calls for justice, non-indictments \u2013 is revelatory. We must join others to reduce police power before, during and after these viral killings. Police reform is not enough. We need abolition.</p> <p>In recent years, news stories broke about how Immigrations and Customs Enforcement use raids, detentions and deportations to threaten immigrants in the US. Calls to \u201cAbolish Ice\u201d could be heard from the streets to the halls of Congress. Ironically, there were no calls to have more Latino and black Ice agents. Mayors did not call for community-driven deportation or raids, like we see for community policing. Non-profits did not call to strengthen relationships between border patrol and immigrants; cities did not fund Ice and ice-cream trucks to pass out treats to immigrant children. Liberals did not point out that there were good apples and bad apples in border patrol enforcement. These programs cannot reform Ice, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/15/alex-vitale-interview-the-end-of-policing/\">nor can they reform police.</a></p> <p>If we can understand that the calls to abolish Ice actually means that this country needs a new, transformational immigration system, then why dismiss police abolition as a viable option for a transformative society?&nbsp;</p> <p>One major difference is the mainstream narrative around dreamers: immigrants hoping for a better life and fleeing persecution and violence in their homeland. To be clear, the fight for immigrant justice is crucial and inseparable from the fight against racial police violence. Immigrants, especially undocumented black immigrants, are vulnerable to police violence and face the risk of prison, deportation and death. Yet black Americans, like indigenous and First Nations people, represent particular reminders that white settlers looted land, committed genocide and enslaved people to build a democracy. As a result, black and indigenous bodies remain a public nuisance to be disappeared, exploited, imprisoned and killed by white people and police alike. They want us to live in constant fear of those possibilities for a reason. Thus, black resistance matters, against police and white supremacy alike.</p> <p>Abolitionist organizers in Minnesota are informed by a history of resistance that dates back to&nbsp;1867 when the Minneapolis police department was first formed to surveil black people and Native Americans. Since then, MPD has murdered or beaten black people \u201csavagely\u201d for acts ranging from inviting white women to a dance to refusing to \u201cmove on\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/wp-content/themes/mpd150/assets/mpd150_report.pdf\">Per a report </a>by MPD150, the Minneapolis police department has garnered several accolades over time, including the nation\u2019s most homophobic police department at one point. In recent memory, officers in the city arrested black people at rates 10 times higher than white people for the same offenses.</p> <p>After a Minneapolis police department officer shot and killed Jamar Clark in 2015, activists occupied their local police department for more than two weeks. This activism spurred organizing that continued after the cameras went away. Through struggle, organizations like MPD150 and Reclaim the Block pushed the mayor and city council to shift more than <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/11/30/mpls-budget-amendment-removes-million-dollars-police\">$1m from police departments </a>to communities. Unquestionably, this organizing since 2015 influenced the mayor\u2019s unprecedented decision to ensure that the police chief fired all four officers responsible for George Floyd\u2019s killing, almost immediately after it happened.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story is not over. On Tuesday night, <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-20200527-ix72khibnvayjcelxpmbo6uvc4-story.html\">MPD teargassed</a> and shot rubber bullets at protesters who took to the streets to decry the murder. The fact that residents were willing to risk their lives during a global pandemic to protest against this injustice demonstrates that the race is not given to the swift nor the strong, but to the organizers who resist until the end.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a movement lawyer, activist and Guardian US columnist.</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>A group of clubs, led by Liverpool, will argue against paying a \u00a3330m rebate to Sky and other broadcasters at a meeting to discuss the matter on Thursday, despite the Premier League\u2019s recommendation that it should be accepted.</p> <p>The finance directors of all 20 clubs were informed on Wednesday of the sum by the Premier League, whose head of broadcasting, Paul Molnar, is leading negotiations. Sky is the prime broadcaster with rights to show 128 live matches a season, followed by BT Sport with 52, and Amazon with 20.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/premier-league-return-edges-closer-as-clubs-approve-contact-training\">Premier League clubs approve return of contact training</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because of the rights terms, 50% of money is divided equally with 25% awarded for live appearances and the other 25% dependent on league finishing position. This means the top six Premier League clubs will have to pay more back \u2013 around \u00a330m each \u2013 compared to the approximate \u00a310.75m by the other 14. Broadcasters have suggested staggering payments of the rebate over the next two seasons to help clubs hit financially by the pandemic.</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s chairman, Tom Werner, questioned the rebate at a previous conference with the Premier League executive and he will do so again when the meeting commences on Thursday at 11am, with growing dismay at the size of sums involved.</p> <p>A rebate is being sought because of contractual obligations going unfulfilled following the suspension of football in England in mid-March. The broadcasters also argue that given the remainder of the season will be behind closed doors should it, as hoped, be played out next month, the value of the product they have paid many millions for will be devalued.</p> <p>Liverpool, along with a number of other clubs \u2013 Tottenham and West Ham among them \u2013 dispute this idea. They believe fans not being able to attend games will increase the premium on live televised matches, with interest in any game shown heightened by the paucity of other live sports. The temporary lifting of the 3pm blackout on matches in the UK means the broadcasters will be able to show more live and clubs believe the value of their investment will increase.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Saturday 3pm has been the holy grail of football rights selling for 50 years \u2013 showing games now might set a precedent</p> <footer> <cite>David Kogan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As things stand, Sky and BT have rights to 47 remaining games \u2013 the other 45 will be shared, with Sky wanting to broadcast 32, BT Sport wanting to show eight and the remaining five being split between Amazon and the BBC.</p> <p>The desire of broadcasters to leverage dressing-room and technical-area cameras will also receive pushback from the clubs, with the stance being that if agreed now it will be difficult to deny similar access when the next rights sales occur.</p> <p>Despite opposition from some clubs to paying the \u00a3330m rebate, David Kogan, who was the Premier League\u2019s chief media rights adviser from 1998 to 2015 and a key architect of its global financial success, insists the full amount will have to be met. He told the Guardian: \u201cThe clubs are going to have to pay it whatever it is and there will be a formula that will be followed. Sooner or later they\u2019re just going to have to pay the money out. They\u2019ll have insurance, I imagine, to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Clubs will already be more concerned, Kogan believes, over whether or not the next round of TV rights, due to be negotiated this year, will match the \u00a39bn generated for the three-year period up until 2022 given the fallout from the current crisis. \u201cWhat is the Premier League\u2019s capacity to earn another \u00a39bn-\u00a310bn over a three-year period?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s the UK broadcasters: why would Sky, now owned by Comcast, or BT, necessarily want to spend \u00a35bn on these rights when there\u2019s very little competition? Secondly, there\u2019s 200 other overseas broadcasters. If they\u2019ve been affected by the pandemic, which they will have been, why are they going to go on bidding 20% more they\u2019ve been doing up until now?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf the Premier League isn\u2019t going to bring in that money, where is the flexibility to find new cash? Ticket sales? Clubs are already costing their fans a fortune. Hospitality? It\u2019s already been priced to the max. So the only way that clubs can then survive is by looking at costs. And the massive costs are agents\u2019 fees and players, and at that point you\u2019re affecting the product.\u201d</p> <p>New ideas may have to be considered, Kogan believes, to keep broadcasting deals on a par with what preceded the pandemic. \u201cSaturday 3pm has been the holy grail of football rights selling for 50 years \u2013 [showing games now] might set a precedent,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever the history used to be, money is a huge incentive for change and it\u2019s not just the PL [that\u2019s] going to lose money because of the pandemic, the FA will, too. I wouldn\u2019t count it out at all.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Isle of Man\u2019s approach to enforcing a coronavirus lockdown has been branded \u201cauthoritarian\u201d after residents who breached the rules were locked up in allegedly \u201cinhuman\u201d conditions without showers or exercise.</p> \n<p>Juveniles are among those who have been detained for breaches of the prohibition on movement regulations on the island, such as leaving home more than once for exercise, having dinner in another household, and drinking on a beach.</p> \n<p>The juveniles are held at a secure unit in Douglas, as distinct from the adult prison.</p> \n<p>The island\u2019s government strenuously denied allegations of breaches of human rights, saying its actions had been proportionate and necessary, aimed at keeping people safe in response to the unprecedented global health crisis. </p> \n<p>There have been 24 deaths linked to Covid-19 on the Isle of Man and 336 confirmed cases. The island has a population of about 85,000.</p> \n<p>More than 700 people have been warned for breaching the regulations, of whom 78 were arrested, including nine children. In total, 26 offenders have been jailed for breaching the emergency powers, although 11 of them also faced other charges. All those arrested had received earlier warnings.</p> \n<p>The Isle of Man said levels of enforcement were consistent with the UK. However, a key difference in the approach is that in the first five weeks of the crisis, fixed penalty notices were not available to the police force.</p> \n<p>Ian Kermode, a criminal barrister on the island, labelled the approach \u201cauthoritarian\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe real trouble started on the 31 March with the prohibition on movement regulations,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Isle of Man mirrored the rules in England save for one very important part, which was fixed penalty notices, the mechanism for enforcing those regulations in England, was omitted and replaced with either a fine of \u00a310,000 or three months in jail.\u201d</p> \n<p>As a consequence, the police were \u201carresting people right, left and centre\u201d, Kermode said. The typical sentence handed down is about 28 days.</p> \n<p>Among those held were a 14-year-old boy, an 18-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl, Kermode said.</p> \n<p>Other examples include: a 27-year-old man sentenced to 35 days in jail for being absent from home, and a 42-year-old woman sentenced to 35 days in jail for being absent from home; a 31-year-old man jailed for five weeks for instigating a gathering; and a 35-year-old man, who had received a previous warning, was jailed for 30 days for drinking at a friend\u2019s house.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The lawyer said he was shocked when he discovered the conditions some of his clients were facing in prison.</p> \n<p>The prison introduced a 14-day self-isolation regime for all new arrivals. Due to automatic release at the midway point of the sentence, most of the people jailed for lockdown breaches were spending the whole sentence in isolation.</p> \n<p>The isolation regime meant some inmates faced 14 days without showers or exercise. The only time the cell door was opened was to deliver 24 hours\u2019 worth of meals.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe prison population averages between 80 and 90 \u2013 all of a sudden they were faced with a sudden influx of 20 and 30 prisoners in little over a month,\u201d Kermode said. \u201cThe very time when prisons around the world were releasing prisoners to reduce prison crowding, the IoM prison was suddenly faced with 20 to 30 prisoners.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kermode said there was potential for those imprisoned to bring cases in the higher Manx courts and even the European court of human rights, as he alleges there may have been breaches of article three of the European convention on human rights, which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment.</p> \n<p>Since complaints have been raised, procedures at the jail have been altered and the island\u2019s government eventually introduced fixed penalty notices. However, Kermode says they have not been well used.</p> \n<p>The government said it refuted allegations that prisoners received \u201cinhuman or degrading\u201d treatment, adding prisoners were given in-cell exercise regimes and access to in-cell sanitation facilities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile this regime affected a small cohort of prisoners, the remaining wings in the prison operated on a less rigorous regime, designed to mitigate transmission of coronavirus, but still retained access to exercise, showers and legal advice,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government strenuously refutes any allegations of breaches of human rights.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Isle of Man prison has a capacity of 144. In England and Wales, the government has reduced the headcount in prisons by about 3,000 as it attempts to prevent the spread of Covid-19 behind bars. Other nations have released prisoners early to ease the burden.</p> \n<p>Phil Matthews, the chair of Amnesty International Isle of Man, said: \u201cThese are exceptional circumstances, but we know that emergency powers can sometimes be misused, and this must not give a green light to trample on our basic human rights and liberties.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reports are incredibly concerning and could suggest a heavy-handed application of the emergency powers. These allegations should be investigated as a matter of urgency.\u201d</p> \n<p>Allan Hogarth, Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of advocacy and programmes, added: \u201cThe unjustified detention of anyone in the midst of a global pandemic is cruel and gravely irresponsible. Alternatives to detention should be considered for anyone who does not pose a threat to themselves or society.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 May 2020 to clarify that children have been held in a secure facility, separate from the adult prison.</p>",
  "<p>Dozens of towns and cities across England will lose their own distinctive local radio stations later this year, after the commercial group Bauer announced plans to fold almost 50 regional outlets into a national radio network.</p> <p>Stations such as York\u2019s Minster FM and the West Midlands\u2019 Signal 107 will lose their identities and be rebranded under the Greatest Hits Radio name from September.</p> <p>Rather than producing their own shows, the stations will largely carry syndicated programmes made in London featuring national presenters playing classic pop music.</p> <p>The stations will still be obliged to broadcast some regional content in order to meet the requirements of their licences. However, this quota will be fulfilled by producing a small number of a regionally produced programmes covering large areas such as the whole of the nort-west of England, rather than on a local station-by-station basis.</p> <p>Bauer would not comment on the number of jobs that would be affected by the decision, although the industry news site Radio Today <a href=\"https://radiotoday.co.uk/2020/05/most-of-acquired-bauer-stations-to-become-greatest-hits-radio/\">estimated</a> about 160 of the 200 on-air presenters across the stations were facing redundancy, without taking into account off-air support staff and producers.</p> <p>The current state of the media industry means it could be difficult for staff to find jobs elsewhere, with many of the affected stations located in mid-sized settlements where there are no other stations.</p> <p>Local journalist and travel reporter roles on the stations are likely to be largely unaffected by the decision, with the national programmes cutting away to offer local news bulletins. This is in line with the industry belief that local news updates are what is really valued by listeners, rather than knowing that a presenter on a music station lives near them and can talk about local events in between songs.</p> <p>Bauer said the decision would provide the \u201coptimum mix of local content that listeners highly value alongside content from nationally known presenters, while also providing significant scale for advertisers\u201d.</p> <p>The industry-wide move towards consolidating local stations into de facto national outlets has been under way for years, with the move exacerbated as Britons increasingly listen to the radio via DAB radio and smart speakers such as Amazon\u2019s Echo rather than FM radio.</p> <p>The consolidation approach was pioneered by Bauer\u2019s rival Global, which turned Capital and Heart into national brands by buying up regional stations and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/26/scores-of-uk-radio-stations-to-lose-local-programmes\">slowly reducing the amount of local content</a>.</p> <p>Combining stations into national outlets has generally been a success when it comes to boosting listenership, although it usually comes at the expense of hearing regional accents on air and substantially reduces the number of media jobs outside London.</p> <p>The shadow culture minister, Chris Matheson, raised concerns about the decision. He said: \u201cThis kind of erosion of local independent broadcasting, with stations&nbsp;assimilated into larger groups, means they lose&nbsp;their distinctive and important voice.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still waiting for the government to confirm what support will be provided as advertising revenues plummet across the industry. Without it, more independent stations will fall away and communities will lose out.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the stations affected by Wednesday\u2019s announcement were bought by Bauer last year and were often founded in the commercial radio boom years of the 80s and 90s.</p> <p>The company said a small number of stations with particularly strong local followings \u2013 such as Cornwall\u2019s Pirate FM and Lincolnshire\u2019s Lincs FM \u2013 will keep their existing line-ups.</p> <p>Other outlets such as Bradford\u2019s Pulse 1&nbsp;and Swansea\u2019s The Wave will be allowed to keep their branding and local breakfast shows before becoming part of Hits Radio for the rest of the day.</p> <p>BBC local radio stations are seizing on this consolidation in the commercial radio market to reposition themselves around personality-led local programmes, with the corporation\u2019s 40 local outlets across England increasingly presenters from former commercial rivals.</p> <p><strong>Bauer-owned stations rebranding as Greatest&nbsp;Hits&nbsp;Radio</strong><br>The Beach (Great Yarmouth &amp; Lowestoft)<br>The Breeze (Alton, Petersfield, Haslemere &amp; Bordon)<br>The Breeze (Andover)<br>The Breeze (Basingstoke)<br>The Breeze (Bath)<br>The Breeze (Bridgwater &amp; West Somerset)<br>The Breeze (Bristol)<br>The Breeze (Cheltenham)<br>The Breeze (Newbury)<br>The Breeze (Reading)<br>The Breeze (Shaftesbury)<br>The Breeze (Torbay)<br>The Breeze (Warminster)<br>The Breeze (Weston super Mare)<br>The Breeze (Yeovil)<br>Compass FM (Grimsby)<br>Dearne FM (Barnsley)<br>Dream 100 (Tendring)<br>Eagle Radio (Guildford)<br>KLFM (Kings Lynn)<br>Minster FM (Northallerton)<br>Minster FM (York)<br>Mix 96 (Aylesbury)<br>North Norfolk Radio (North Norfolk)<br>Peak FM (Chesterfield)<br>Pulse 2 (Bradford &amp; Huddersfield)<br>Radio Norwich (Norwich)<br>Ridings FM (Wakefield)<br>Rother FM (Rotherham)<br>Rutland Radio (Rutland)<br>Sam FM (Swindon)<br>Signal 107 (Kidderminster)<br>Signal 107 (Shrewsbury &amp; Oswestry)<br>Signal 107 (Telford)<br>Signal 107 (Wolverhampton)<br>Signal 2 (Stoke-on-Trent)<br>Spire FM (Salisbury)<br>Spirit FM (Chichester)<br>Stray FM (Harrogate)<br>Swansea Sound (Swansea)<br>Tower FM (Bolton &amp; Bury)<br>Trax FM (Bassetlaw)<br>Trax FM (Doncaster)<br>Wave 96.5 (Blackpool)<br>Wessex FM (Weymouth)<br>Wire FM (Warrington)<br>Wish FM (Wigan)<br>Yorkshire Coast Radio (Bridlington)<br>Yorkshire Coast Radio (Scarborough)</p> <p><strong>Bauer-owned stations retaining their name and own breakfast shows but broadcasting Hits Radio during the rest of the day:</strong><br>Pulse 1 (Bradford &amp; Huddersfield)<br>Signal 1 (Stoke-on-Trent)<br>96.4 The Wave (Swansea)<br>Fire Radio (Bournemouth)</p> <p><strong>Bauer-owned stations remaining as stand</strong><strong>alone outlets:</strong><br>Lincs FM (Lincolnshire)<br>Pirate FM (Cornwall)<br>Sam FM (Bristol)</p>",

  "<p>The European Union executive has called for a \u20ac750bn (\u00a3671bn) recovery plan to help the hardest hit countries find a way out of the unprecedented economic downturn caused by the pandemic.</p> <p>The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU faced a defining moment, never seen in its 70-year history. \u201cThe crisis has huge externalities and spillovers across all countries and none of that can be fixed by any single country alone.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Addressing the European parliament, where MEPs wore face masks and sat further apart than usual under mandatory physical-distancing rules, von der Leyen said the sum would be split into \u20ac500bn of grants for EU member states and \u20ac250bn of loans.</p> <p>Under the commission\u2019s blueprint, Italy would get \u20ac82bn in grants, Spain \u20ac77bn, France \u20ac39bn, Poland \u20ac37bn and Germany \u20ac29bn.</p> <p>The money would be raised by the EU borrowing on capital markets on a far bigger scale than ever before, meeting a key demand from France and Germany, but provoking opposition from fiscal hardliners opposed to shared debt.</p> <p>In an attempt to convince governments that are against handing out large grants to their neighbours, von der Leyen told MEPs the money would go through the EU budget, meaning it would be subject to checks and controls. \u201cA struggling economy in one part of Europe weakens a strong economy in another part,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The commission claims its proposals could unleash \u20ac3.1tn of investment in the EU economy and is pledging to intensify spending on the European Green Deal, the pre-crisis plan to meet the demands of the climate emergency.</p> <p>It has promised to add \u20ac30bn to the \u20ac10bn \u201cjust transition fund\u201d, intended to help coalmining regions move away from fossil fuels.</p> <p>But officials face a political fight to persuade all 27 member states that shared debt is the right approach. Battle lines were drawn last week, after Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron called for a \u20ac500bn recovery fund, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/franco-german-plan-for-european-recovery-will-face-compromises\">as the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/franco-german-plan-for-european-recovery-will-face-compromises\">chancellor broke a long-held German taboo against common EU debt</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, a group labelled the \u201cfrugal four\u201d, think the recovery fund should offer stricken countries loans, not grants. While Danish and Swedish finance ministers have spoken of the need for compromise in recent days, they remain opposed to mutualised debt.</p> <p>Responding to von der Leyen\u2019s plan, one EU diplomat argued the commission had favoured southern and eastern Europe. \u201cBy moving to the south and the east the commission has avoided any difficult decisions or compromises at this stage. As a result the leaders will have been set back significantly in their efforts to reach an acceptable compromise fast.\u201d</p> <p>None of the money would be available until next year, so the commission is calling on member states to agree an extra \u20ac11.5bn spending under the current EU budget. This would not affect the UK, as its liabilities are capped under the Brexit withdrawal agreement.&nbsp;</p> <p>Separately, the commission published an outline for a revamped \u20ac1.1tn EU budget for 2021-27. EU leaders failed to agree their long-term spending plans in February, in a sign of deep divisions between the \u201cfrugals\u201d and more free-spending countries, before the crisis took hold.</p> <p>The plan takes the commission into new territory, borrowing on capital markets on a far bigger scale than ever before. Officials hope to take on debt with a maximum maturity of 30 years, and not start repayments until 2027.</p> <p>Under the proposal, debts would be serviced by new EU taxes, such as corporate levies, a plastics tax or charges on imported goods with a high carbon footprint.<br>If EU countries failed to agree on common EU taxes, they would have to contribute more to future EU budgets or see cuts in EU programmes. Von der Leyen argued that neither of these were attractive options, urging member states to agree new \u201cown resources\u201d for the EU.</p> <p>In recent years, EU governments, generally wary of ceding revenue-raising powers to Brussels, have rejected an EU digital tax and \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/20/european-commission-tax-avoidance-crackdown-pierre-moscovici\">a common consolidated corporate tax base</a>, a prerequisite for corporate taxes at EU level.</p> <p>\u201cMember states hate [EU taxes] because they basically lose power,\u201d Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP, told the Centre for European Reform thinktank on Wednesday. But he expressed hope EU finance ministers would change their attitudes. \u201cI think that the pandemic and this recovery plan are gamechangers and if we agree to borrow together we will need to reimburse together \u2026 in a way the pandemic opened doors that many believed totally shut up until now.\u201d</p> <p>Central and eastern European countries, who are net beneficiaries of EU spending, are worried about losing money to southern Europe. The Czech prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/czech-pm-andrej-babis-must-resign-if-conflict-of-interest-say-meps\">Andrej Babi\u0161</a>, has said it would be \u201cunfair to be penalised for being successful\u201d referring to the low number of coronavirus cases in his country.</p> <p>Lud\u011bk Niedermayer, a Czech MEP and vice-president of the European parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affairs committee, said such comments were \u201cunfortunate\u201d.

  "<p>Boohoo has defended its accounting practices after criticism by an investor known as the \u201cDark Destroyer\u201d hit the online fashion specialist\u2019s share price.</p> <p>The ShadowFall hedge fund led by Matthew Earl, a specialist in taking positions that bet against a company\u2019s share price, issued a 54-page report accusing Boohoo of misleading investors about profits and cashflow.</p> <p>The report also claims that a recent \u00a3200m fundraising effort by Boohoo could be handed over in dividends or buyout costs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/03/a-fairytale-brand-prettylittlething-joins-fashion-a-list-umar-kamani\">Umar Kamani</a>, the son of Boohoo\u2019s chairman and co-founder, Mahmud Kamani, who owns about a third of the group\u2019s Pretty Little Thing (PTL) brand. ShadowFall also suggests the funds could be used to buy up I Saw it First, an online fashion business set up by Jamal Kamani, the chairman\u2019s brother.</p> <p>The report, published on Tuesday, claimed that an option to buy out a remaining stake in the PLT site could cost Boohoo nearly \u00a31bn, and raised concerns about the presentation of profits and cashflow relating to PLT, which it said inflated the brand\u2019s value. Boohoo paid \u00a33.7m to buy a 66% stake in PLT in 2016.</p> <p>Boohoo said on Wednesday it \u201cstrongly refutes\u201d the allegations made by ShadowFall. Shares in the company, which fell nearly 6% yesterday on news of the intervention, fell a further 4.5% on Wednesday.</p> <p>The company said it intended to use the proceeds of its share placing \u201cto take advantage of numerous opportunities that are likely to emerge in the global fashion industry over the coming months, particularly following the disruption caused by the onset of Covid-19\u201d. It said it was reviewing a number of possible opportunities.</p> <p>Boohoo denied it had understated costs incurred by PLT and thereby overstated the brand\u2019s profitability. It said the group had not inflated PLT\u2019s contribution to profits in its accounts but said it had added all the brand\u2019s profits to one measure of the group\u2019s profits \u2013 adjusted profit after tax \u2013 \u201cto allow its shareholders and readers of the accounts to fully understand PLT\u2019s underlying profitability\u201d.</p> <p>Analysts downplayed ShadowFall\u2019s allegations saying that most professional investors and analysts would not have been confused by Boohoo\u2019s presentation of cashflow and profits.</p> <p>Eleonora Dani, a retail analyst at Stifel, said ShadowFall had a \u201cfair point\u201d in questioning the valuation at which the remaining 33% of PLT could be bought in 2022. But said it was \u201chard to prove\u201d the practices ShadowFall alleged Boohoo had used to artificially inflate PLT profit and potential value.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe think the report raised fair points but missed the mark in identifying underlying business issues to justify a short position.

  "<p>The world\u2019s largest all-electric aircraft is about to take to the skies for the first time.</p> <p>The Cessna Caravan, retrofitted with an electric engine, is expected to fly for 20-30 minutes over Washington state in the US on Thursday.</p> <p>The plane can carry nine passengers but a test pilot will undertake the inaugural flight alone, cruising at a speed of 114mph (183km/h). The engine maker, <a href=\"https://magnix.aero/\">magniX</a>, hopes the aircraft could enter commercial service by the end of 2021 and have a range of 100 miles.</p> <p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, aviation was one of the fastest growing sources of the carbon emissions that are driving the climate emergency.

But he said: \u201cBattery [energy] density is not where we would like to see it. While it is good for ultra-short flights of 100 miles on a retrofit aircraft and over 500 miles on a new design aircraft like <a href=\"https://www.eviation.co/\">the Alice</a>, there is plenty of untapped potential in batteries.

It was him who called Abdool Karim to head the Covid-19 team.</p> <p>If Mkhize\u2019s sure-footed response to the Covid-19 pandemic has earned him praise, his handling of Aids was more chequered. As the KwaZulu-Natal executive council member responsible for health from 1994 to 2004, he opposed a court application to force government to roll out medicine to pregnant women to prevent HIV transmission to their babies, because he wanted the trials to finish first. But he also permitted government clinics in his province to roll out Aids medicines at a time when the national government had not yet allowed such a move.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e4b75139a79ce2e8744c0ac9bbf29d3d01fbc83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e4b75139a79ce2e8744c0ac9bbf29d3d01fbc83/0_250_4061_2436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zweli Mkhize\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zweli Mkhize\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic earned him praise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Themba Hadebe/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just before his 2017 presidential campaign, Mkhize <a href=\"https://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/hivaids-why-mbeki-should-apologise--zweli-mkhize\">unsuccessfully called</a> on Mbeki to apologise for his view that HIV did not lead to Aids. \u201cHe led the country astray with a wrong view, which he was made to believe was true,\u201d Mkhize said.</p> <p>Mkhize\u2019s cabinet colleague responsible for promulgating the fierce lockdown regulations, local government minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, was also in the team leading South Africa\u2019s early Aids response. As Mandela\u2019s health minister from 1994 to 1999, she was tasked with reforming the public health system while trying to come to grips with the new pandemic.</p> <p>Some of her early ideas around Aids prevention were considered pioneering, but her later support for the toxic industrial solvent, Virodene, as an Aids cure, and the misspending of taxpayers\u2019 money on an Aids prevention musical, tarnished her reputation.</p> <p>Later she became Africa Union Commission chair and pushed for the founding of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention after the 2014 Ebola outbreak in parts of the continent. It now plays an important role in supporting African countries on Covid-19.</p> <p>She has earned praise for the clear and simple way she explained the government\u2019s plans to gradually ease the lockdown in her mother tongue, Zulu, the biggest first language in South Africa.</p> <p>Also prominent in South Africa\u2019s Covid-19 crisis are activists like Mark Heywood, who edits a news site focusing on human rights and social justice civil society organisations called <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/\">Maverick Citizen</a>. He was among those who led the fight to make Aids medication affordable and widely available. Of late, he\u2019s also provided advice to the local <a href=\"https://twitter.com/covidcoalition?lang=en\">C19 People\u2019s Coalition</a>, one of the biggest civil society Covid-19 responses in the world.</p> <p>As an Aids activist he learned how important it is to build alliances between those living with the disease, the health sector, trade unions, the media, and government. \u201cCovid-19 is a social ill as much as it affects individuals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to address it socially, not just through individual behavioural interventions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8406451756bd87b7e860088a3b8e5cd9e83bf98a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8406451756bd87b7e860088a3b8e5cd9e83bf98a/0_0_6450_4408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young children wait to receive food donations without their parents during a handout in Johannesburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young children wait to receive food donations during a handout in Johannesburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heywood foresees the looming possibility of a big battle around access to Covid-19 treatment and vaccines, similar to the battles for Aids medicines. \u201cBillions of people are going to need the vaccine when it arrives. How do you make sure it hasn\u2019t been patented and doesn\u2019t become some company\u2019s private intellectual property?\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you ensure that developing countries are not last in the queue to receive it?\u201d</p> <p>Thus far the government\u2019s prompt and scientific response to Covid-19 means the battle hasn\u2019t been as intense as when Aids was \u201cturned into a political fight\u201d and activists \u201cwere pushing against power to try and get something done\u201d, says Heywood.</p> <p>During the most difficult days of the Aids pandemic, activists witnessed death on a big scale and attended multiple funerals every weekend. \u201cWhen you looked at the graves, you would see the ages were all young,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange inversion, because this time it\u2019s older people.\u201d So far South Africa\u2019s confirmed Covid-19 death toll is more than 480.</p> <p>Mia Malan, editor-in-chief of the Bhekisisa Centre for Health Journalism, who reported extensively on Aids as a health reporter for the South African Broadcasting Corporation, says leaders are doing things better this time around. But the government\u2019s past failures to provide an effective and early HIV response has left South Africa with millions of HIV infections that could have been prevented. As a result people with weaker immune systems (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911250/\">four out of 10</a> HIV-positive South Africans are untreated) could be more vulnerable to developing Covid-19, she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe most obvious lesson is the difference an early response can make. With HIV, the government started an evidence-based response much too late.\u201d South Africa only had 550 coronavirus cases when it closed borders and decided on a strict lockdown that lasted at least five weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f312e9297fa47a93b62c777facb5c89a6e3ab6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f312e9297fa47a93b62c777facb5c89a6e3ab6f/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurse performs a swab test for Covid-19 on a health worker at the Vlakfontein Clinic in Lenasia, Johannesburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa managed to flatten its coronavirus curve through an early response and lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michele Spatari/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Communicating a clear and unambiguous message from government was another lesson, and partnerships have been struck with the media to make this possible \u2013 and to fight disinformation. \u201cActivists and the media were the complete enemy during that time [of Aids], but now the minister of health at his briefing would thank the media for being partners,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t criticise them, but we are on the same side.\u201d</p> <p>Putting science above politics is also crucial, she says. \u201cAbdool Karim was world-renowned at that time [during the Aids pandemic] already, and he was rejected. Now he is chair of the [government\u2019s Covid-19 advisory] committee.\u201d</p> <p>Compassion is vital. When child activist Nkosi Johnson died of Aids-related complications aged 12 in 2001, Mbeki was silent. Now, Malan says, Mkhize offers deep condolences in every statement announcing new Covid-19 deaths. \u201cMkhize and [president Cyril] Ramaphosa will come out of this and it will possibly define their legacy \u2013 very much the opposite to Mbeki and Manto.\u201d</p>",

There are only 2,400 eastern bristlebirds in the wild and about 140 in the Howes Flat population near Mallacoota.</p> \n  <p>They caught the birds, described by the ecologist <strong>Dr Rohan Clarke </strong>as ground-dwelling weak flyers that were \u201crelatively cryptic\u201d animals with a \u201cloud and distinctive metallic call\u201d using mist nets and bluetooth speakers.</p> \n  <p>One speaker would be set up to play the eastern bristlebird\u2019s call and then, when it sounded as if the real birds had approached the speaker, the sound would be remotely switched to a second speaker, which would draw the birds into the path of the fine cotton net. </p> \n  <p>The fire stopped on the edge of the Howes Flat habitat, but another bristlebird population a short distance away, crossing the border with NSW, appears to have been destroyed. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T07:45:36.407Z\">at 8.45am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

<strong>Josh Taylor</strong> at the bushfire Senate committee hearing ...</p> \n  <p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet faced questions at the Senate committee hearing on the 2019-20 bushfires over whether the prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, had been adequately briefed about the bushfires during the fire season last year.<br></p> \n  <p>PM&amp;C hadn\u2019t provided verbal or written briefings to him while he was in Hawaii from 15 to 21 December (he cut his trip short by two days), but that doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that PMO was updating the PM on the situation.</p> \n  <p>The department secretary, <strong>Phil Gaetjens</strong>,<strong> </strong>told the committee that the PM was in Australia when the fires in Victoria, NSW and South Australia flared up in late November, and back when the state of emergency declarations were made in four states on 30 December, so it was incorrect to say he was absent during the crisis.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a correct interpretation to say that the prime minister was not here in the crisis,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Gaetjens himself was on leave for half of December, he told the committee.</p> \n  <p>The department confirmed that before Morrison left on holidays in Hawaii he was \u201cvery well informed\u201d about the bushfire situation via a series of teleconference meetings with the head of Emergency Management Australia and others in November.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt seems to me that what you were telling us is that he would have had considerable knowledge about how extreme the crisis was and what was unfolding, yet he still decided to go off on holidays,\u201d the Greens senator <strong>Janet Rice</strong> replied.</p> \n </div> \n <p

The need to fund more domestic places so young people, and the thousands of other Australians whose jobs have disappeared, have tertiary education as a viable option. Past recessions have shown that, as unemployment rates soar, those who cannot earn enrol to learn.<br></p> \n  <p>2. The proposed \u201csafe corridors\u201d to bring international students into Australia needs to be implemented as soon as is safely possible so there is at least some chance of international students getting to Australia and clearing quarantine for the second part of this year. Failure to do this swiftly will add to the devastation of our international education, which contributed $40 billion to our economy each year before COVID-19.<br></p> \n  <p>3. International students, who are already in Australia, should be supported and encouraged to remain here. Community groups, state and local governments and have stepped up to support those who have been hard hit by job losses and exclusion from JobSeeker and JobKeeper. They do however need practical, ongoing help, coordinated at the national level that shows how we value them for their contributions to the Australian economy.</p> \n  <p>4. Cuts of up to 21000 jobs are underway as universities yet the Federal Government has ensured that universities \u2013 unlike other large businesses and some private universities \u2013 are ineligible for the JobKeeper subsidy. This does not make sense.</p> \n  <p>5. Researchers urgently need government assistance to ensure that they can continue and not waste work already done. Many research projects have already been suspended.</p> \n  <p>International researchers, who are very important to the sector, may not return to Australia to finish their work. Much of the $4.7 billion that universities put into research each year has been funded by revenue from international education. That revenue has now evaporated from a sector that is likely to take years to recover.<br></p> \n  <p>6. There is a need to re-start infrastructure projects that have been suspended as universities try to stop their financial haemorrhaging. The Victorian Government has allocated $350 million, which will greatly assist universities with capital projects in that state, but what about the rest of the nation?<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T23:25:08.432Z\">at 12.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecda35e8f0852d72995058d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T23:19:50.747Z\">12.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hundreds of masks and plastic containers have washed up on Sydney\u2019s eastern beaches overnight.

  "<p>If this global catastrophe has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we are not always who we think we are. As Pamela Druckerman <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/05/12/pandemic-marriage-menage-me/\">wrote in a recent essay</a>: \u201cEveryone I know seem[s] to have a new \u2018pandemic personality\u2019. A friend who used to complain constantly is now delightful; an intrepid foreign correspondent is these days suddenly afraid to leave his house.\u201d</p> <p>During the lockdown, you may have discovered your own new personality<strong>, </strong>and while you may feel it is unique, there are certainly some trends that have emerged.<strong> </strong>So what\u2019s yours? Choose from the list below, or leave yours in the comments.</p> <h2><strong>The </strong><strong>smug </strong><strong>introvert</strong></h2> <p><em>What they say: \u2018I know this is bad, but this is also \u2026 kind of a dream for me?\u2019</em></p> <p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with introverts, but it is annoying to see how much some are enjoying lockdown. You\u2019ll know a smug introvert when you meet one, because they\u2019ll start talking about how great their life is within seconds of saying hello.</p> <p>You see, they didn\u2019t even like going out to bars and clubs before the pandemic. Nothing is actually different for them right now. But they want to you to know that they are, like, really suited to this indoor lifestyle (which is exactly the same as the one they had before).</p> <h2><strong>The </strong><strong>urban </strong><strong>escape </strong><strong>artist</strong></h2> <p><em>What they say: \u2018This is what my study has always looked like!\u2019</em></p> <p>Ladies and gentlemen! We are currently witnessing a golden age of escapology and illusion. Watch in wonder as the urban escape artist begins lockdown trapped inside their spacious and expensive city home. They magically disappear, before turning up several hours later in an even bigger and more expensive home outside the city, while never saying a word about it.</p> <p>How do they pull off such an audacious trick? Is it inherited wealth? A cushy finance job? A sense of gross entitlement that could endanger at-risk groups? Sometimes it\u2019s all three.</p> <h2><strong>The </strong><strong>radically </strong><strong>progressive </strong><strong>traditional </strong><strong>housewife (or </strong><strong>radwife)</strong></h2> <p><em>What they say: \u2018It\u2019s my choice </em><em> to make </em><em>50 batches of banana bread this month. And if my partner is the one who brings home the sourdough starter, so be it.\u2019</em></p> <p>If you\u2019re a committed feminist you may feel yourself facing questions similar to those in an outdated women\u2019s magazine. Is it feminist to stay indoors and bake all day? Is it OK to enjoy the distraction of cleaning and cooking? So long as there\u2019s a fair division of labour in the household, the radwife (not to be mixed up with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/27/tradwives-new-trend-submissive-women-dark-heart-history\">tradwife</a>) says yes. Whether you\u2019re a man or a woman, what else is there to do except cook and rearrange your room like your sanity depends on it?</p> <h2>The <strong>project </strong><strong>person</strong></h2> <p><em>What they say: \u2018It\u2019s been pretty amazing learning another new language while finishing my book</em><em> \u2026\u2019</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b98601be34281da5a7daeb7935cbb8df473b0131\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b98601be34281da5a7daeb7935cbb8df473b0131/0_1566_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It\u2019s almost as if the Project Person has been waiting for the world to shut down\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s almost as if the project person has been waiting for the world to shut down.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While many of us are currently finding it hard to finish films, let alone novels others are using this as an opportunity to become the 2.0 version of themselves. Being productive is fine, but the project person has decided to be insufferable about it. It\u2019s nice that they have managed to read so much while redecorating their home and getting a new job (\u201csome personal news!\u201d) but what\u2019s astonishing is that they still have time to slap it into conversation every five minutes, too.</p> <h2><strong>The </strong><strong>shamer</strong></h2> <p><em>What they shout at you: \u2018</em><em>I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d come within 30ft of me in this empty park without a mask!</em><em>\u2019</em></p> <p>It\u2019s good to call people out who are breaking the rules. But if you\u2019re a shamer, you often make up your own rules, and will admonish people even when they\u2019re not doing anything wrong. Shamers will do things like shout at people who aren\u2019t wearing masks, even though they\u2019re a safe distance away in a quiet park, or call out exhausted parents for not clapping for health workers every evening.</p> <h2>The hibernator</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f8bd826aae9587ab1f30a854a98b622634f105d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f8bd826aae9587ab1f30a854a98b622634f105d/0_0_5118_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Hibernator\u2019s coping mechanisms aren\u2019t the most advanced\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hibernator\u2019s coping mechanisms aren\u2019t the most advanced.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cavan Images/Getty Images/Cavan Images RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>What they say: \u2018What have I been up to? Good question</em><em> \u2026\u2019</em></p> <p>The hibernator has dealt with the stress of the pandemic by shutting down as much as they possibly can. When they\u2019re not carrying out essential tasks like work, childcare or cooking, they\u2019re hanging out in their special \u201cno thoughts or feelings\u201d zone. This may involve staring out into the distance, playing mindless video games, or browsing Netflix for hours at a time.</p> <h2>The <strong>certainty </strong><strong>expert</strong></h2> <p><em>What they say: \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot \u2013 have you not </em><em>read the footnotes on the latest footnotes on the latest Harvard study?\u201d </em></p> <p>Certainty experts talk about coronavirus with great authority, using complex terms such as \u201ccurves\u201d, \u201cmodels\u201d, \u201cR\u201d, and \u201cwell, actually \u2026\u201d . They\u2019ve even looked up how to pronounce epidemiologist, and take all opportunities to use it. They\u2019ll be the first to tell you that there are too many amateur epidemiologists giving their opinions, before telling you when exactly the country is going to reopen, according to their analysis of what various epidemiologists have said.</p> <h2><strong>The one with a totally amazing life you need to know about</strong></h2> <p><em>What they say: </em><em> \u201cIt\u2019s so weird how I always manage to have the most fun, even in quarantine!\u201d</em></p> <p>There\u2019s a very specific type of person whose entire existence rests on giving you fomo (the fear of missing out) and gaining clout. Before the pandemic they were always at press parties, on weekend trips or with their best friend who happens to be a model, activist and podcaster with 100,000 followers on Instagram. You know all of this because they made a point of sharing all of it in detail.</p> <p>Lockdown hit them hard to begin with, but now they can be found uploading screenshot after screenshot of their virtual social engagements, whether it\u2019s a Zoom party or trendy book club. \ufeff</p>",

None of these companies would comment when approached by the Guardian to discuss any enhanced biosecurity measures they are implementing at facilities in China.</p> <p>Meanwhile urgently needed preventive action is being delayed, partly, ironically, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cIn order to protect the pig sector, and the people who rely on it, the only available course is global coordinated actions at all levels \u2013 this includes accelerating vaccine research, increasing biosecurity and surveillance, and enforcing policies for safe trade and cross-border movement,\u201d said Rozstalnyy.</p> <p>\u201cAt the same time there are some instances in which political or economic sensitivity could lead to unwillingness to report cases,\u201d he said. \u201cTackling ASF in a globally coordinated way, where all countries can benefit from stronger multi-sectoral support, will require as much transparency and openness as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Pfeiffer believes the ASF virus is now almost \u201cunstoppable\u201d and fears are growing among pig producers in the US and Europe that it is only a matter of time before the disease reaches their pig herds from continuing outbreaks in China, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of it is about just a chance event,\u201d Zoe Davies, chief executive at the National Pig Association in the UK, told the Guardian. \u201cI believe it is here already. It\u2019s just whether that chance event would happen, that somebody would go out into the countryside, and either put [contaminated meat] in a bin or chuck something over a hedge that the pigs got access to.

Research by Universities UK found that <a href=\"https://www.comresglobal.com/polls/universities-uk-value-of-university/\">almost 60% of students and recent graduates</a> felt the social element of the campus experience helped them broaden their life experience, become more independent and confident, and develop skills like teamwork and time management.</p> <p>Charles Craig, who studies music business at Leeds College of Music, worries about the lack of networking and entrepreneurship opportunities if the rest of his degree is delivered online. \u201cEngaging with the content and tutors is more difficult online. I hate the distortion you get on video calls and the awkward sound delays make it hard to speak at the right time,\u201d he adds.</p> <p>\u201cLearning remotely isn\u2019t the same as the visceral experience of expressing and debating ideas in a physical space,\u201d agrees Jesper Ryyn\u00e4nen, a student at the London School of Economics (LSE). \u201cI chose LSE for its public events and renowned speakers, yet there\u2019ll be none of that this semester.\u201d</p> <p>Some students may feel that paying the same fees for digital versions of their courses would be poor value. The tuition for Ryyn\u00e4nen\u2019s one-year MSc at the LSE is \u00a329,000 \u2013 far more expensive than fully online options from renowned names like Harvard University and Wharton Business School. </p> <p>Craig doesn\u2019t think he would have applied had he known. \u201cShorter courses and masterclasses run by industry experts might have been a better option than an online degree,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Craig\u2019s view reiterates an international survey in 2019 commissioned by Pearson, which suggested that <a href=\"https://monitor.icef.com/2019/10/global-survey-reveals-growing-interest-in-shorter-programmes-and-lifelong-learning/\">today\u2019s learners are increasingly interested in vocational and shorter programmes</a>, especially online. If they move online, universities will have to compete with new formats, including coding bootcamps like Le Wagon, Codeworks and Northcoders. These offer quicker, cheaper courses in subjects such as web development and data science with in-built industry connections. </p> <p>But moving university courses online due to the coronavirus pandemic is expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/25/degrees-of-separation-can-universities-adapt-in-the-rush-to-online-learning\">cost the higher education sector \u00a31bn</a>. UK universities will be keen to ensure their investment in digital transformation is for the long term, especially after years of <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/what-will-higher-education-look-like-after-coronavirus\">lagging behind</a> universities in other countries.</p> <p>One barrier could be cultural change. When Times Higher Education surveyed 200 university leaders in 2018, all of them agreed that <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/will-coronavirus-make-online-education-go-viral\">online learning could never replace the physical university experience</a>. </p> <p>Kendrick Oliver, a professor at the University of Southampton, agrees. \u201cNothing can replace the classroom experience. Being physically together in a space means rich communication, and more energy and experimentation from everyone involved.\u201d But he acknowledges: \u201cHabit and routine are powerful. Months of online working will make digital more of a default.\u201d</p> <p>There are also reputational risks to moving online, says Jovana Karanovic, a researcher in digital platforms at VU Amsterdam in the Netherlands. \u201cOnline learning may produce a precarious gig economy to connect students and educators,\u201d she explains. \u201cThis competitive, fragmented learning landscape could raise accountability issues, prompt a loss of academic expertise and lower teaching standards.\u201d She adds that universities will also need to invest in proper staff training.</p> <p>But there are benefits to online learning: it can widen access to education to people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to go. This is already happening in the US, where online education is more established, especially among lower-income students. Last month, Southern New Hampshire University, the country\u2019s fastest-growing university, announced that it has used online learning to enable it to <a href=\"https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/2020/04/full-tuition-scholarships-for-incoming-freshmen\">slash its tuition fees by 61%</a>. </p> <p>This may echo the recent shift in the UK away from the \u201cboarding school\u201d model of higher education and towards more students commuting to campus. Research by the Sutton Trust highlights that the number of <a href=\"https://www.suttontrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Home_and_away_FINAL.pdf\">students choosing to live at home while they study</a> has increased, largely to save money. </p> <p>The future of UK universities may lie in mixing online curriculums and offline experiences, known as blended learning. Many are already planning to introduce this to enable social distancing on campus. \u201c[This] can enhance students\u2019 experience of studying,\u201d says Michael Horn, co-founder of the Christensen Institute, a global education thinktank. \u201cI expect to see a lot more universities offering blended courses post-pandemic.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/25/degrees-of-separation-can-universities-adapt-in-the-rush-to-online-learning\">No campus lectures and shut student bars: UK universities' \u00a31bn struggle to move online</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prior to the pandemic, some innovative UK universities already offered blended learning. Among these is the University of East Anglia (UEA), which introduced online modules to reach the most disadvantaged students, and plans to scale them up post-pandemic. Its crime fiction MA, for example, is delivered primarily through virtual learning but includes intensive \u201cresidencies\u201d on campus to meet industry professionals and participate in a national crime fiction festival.</p> <p>Henry Sutton, designer of the crime fiction programme, says the university recognised the potential of new course approaches early on. \u201cThe MA launched in 2015 using the technology we already had,\u201d he explains. \u201cStudents tell us they like the flexibility, they find the residential aspects valuable, and their communication with peers is more considered.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3afe3429abc974efed3a2d3e7f06d3584439bdf2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3afe3429abc974efed3a2d3e7f06d3584439bdf2/0_643_5329_3197/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Sutton introduces UEA\u2019s annual national crime fiction festival, Noirwich.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry Sutton introduces UEA\u2019s annual national crime fiction festival, Noirwich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Hutchins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, other universities are following suit. A consortium of 10 universities led by Coventry was recently <a href=\"https://www.coventry.ac.uk/business/business-news/coventry-university-led-consortium-awarded-3.7m/\">awarded </a><a href=\"https://www.coventry.ac.uk/business/business-news/coventry-university-led-consortium-awarded-3.7m/\">\u00a33.7m</a> to develop partly online postgraduate conversion courses in artificial intelligence and data science. </p> <p>According to Sarah Barrow, UEA\u2019s pro-vice-chancellor for arts and humanities, the pandemic represents \u201ca revolutionary moment\u201d. She expects the shift online to kickstart a lifelong learning agenda. This has already been discussed as a way to skill up employees whose jobs will become automated in the future, but which universities have been slow to implement.</p> <p>The challenge now is the scale and pace of change. \u201cWe\u2019ve adapted and brought forward our plans, but this is disruption on an unprecedented scale,\u201d says Barrow. \u201cIt normally takes two years to create a new course or module. Now we\u2019re designing and launching online options in a matter of weeks.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The human fingerprint on the climate is now unmistakable and will become increasingly evident over the coming decades, the UK Met Office has confirmed after 30 years of pioneering study.</p> <p>Since the 1990s, global temperatures have warmed by half a degree, Arctic sea ice has shrunk by almost 2 million km2, sea-levels have risen by about 10cm and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 60 parts per million (17%), according to figures exclusively compiled for the Guardian to mark the 30th anniversary of the Met Office\u2019s Hadley Centre for climate science and services.</p> <p>The data highlights how a young generation has grown up in a climate unprecedented in a millennium. Future projections suggest that by mid-century a 60-year-old Briton is likely to be living in a climate 1.2C warmer than when they were born.</p> <p>Scientists at the Hadley Centre, which has been on the global frontline of climate monitoring, research and modelling since it opened in 1990, said early theories about fossil-fuel disruption have been proven by subsequent facts.</p> <p>\u201cThe climate now is completely different from what we had 30 years ago. It is completely outside the bounds of possibility in natural variation,\u201d said Peter Stott, a professor and expert on climate attribution science at the centre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee58be8bad35ccbb75bc1bad4e091937484b9c31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee58be8bad35ccbb75bc1bad4e091937484b9c31/0_69_1417_851/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Thatcher with Sir John Houghton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Thatcher, with Sir John Houghton, opening the Hadley Centre.

Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are also higher than anything seen in million-year-old ice cores. \u201cWe are seeing an unprecedented climate,\u201d Stott said. \u201cThe human fingerprint is everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>The impact was less obvious in 1990, when the centre opened in conjunction with the publication of the first report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - both were overseen by the UK scientist John Houghton, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/08/sir-john-houghton-obituary\">who died earlier this year</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902Wbd5jto0Pa0f/\" data-alt=\"sea ice graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902Wbd5jto0Pa0f/\">sea ice graphic</a> </figure>  <p>At the inauguration, the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, said the UK needed a world-leading climate centre to assess the \u201cserious consequences\u201d of greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cWhat it predicts will affect our daily lives. Governments and international organisations in every part of the world are going to have to sit up and take notice and respond,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/108102\">she said</a>.</p> <p>Thatcher, who studied science at Oxford, needed little convincing, but she had to overcome a sceptical cabinet. Atmospheric physicists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/09/half-century-dither-denial-climate-crisis-timeline\">had been warning oil companies and policymakers about the dangers of fossil fuels for decades</a>, but the \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d was still a relatively novel concern for the broader public. Nobody felt a change. The world had already warmed by about half a degree from pre-industrial levels, but this was low enough to be within natural variation.</p> <p>Few people knew the difference between short-term \u201cweather\u201d and the \u201cclimate\u201d, which is usually measured over a much longer period of 30 years.</p> <p>Back then, there was also considerable scepticism about the ability of meteorologists to forecast change, even on a daily basis. Memories were fresh of the BBC weatherman Michael Fish infamously reassuring viewers that fears of a hurricane were unfounded, just hours before the fiercest storm in generations hit the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902O3IuGbFuW52B/\" data-alt=\"sea level graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902O3IuGbFuW52B/\">sea level graphic</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was unglamorous\u201d recalls James Murphy, a science fellow who was posted to the Hadley Centre from the beginning. \u201cBut the mood in the first decade was one of great excitement, because it was a chance to do a lot of pioneering research in a growing field.\u201d</p> <p>As acceptance and importance grew, so did scepticism. Critics, often funded by oil firms, pushed back against climate science because they did not like its political and economic implications. Ahead of the climate summits in Kyoto (1997) and Copenhagen (2009), fossil fuel companies funded misinformation campaigns to cast doubt on climate models.</p> <p>The Hadley Centre remained focused on science. Researchers expanded and refined their models by incorporating new knowledge on biological carbon cycles and the likely impact of fossil fuels not only on temperature, but on Arctic ice, sea-level rise, flooding, storms, droughts and other atmospheric phenomena.</p> <p>Supercomputer advances enabled much greater precision. Early models mapped the impact on grid cells of 300km on each side. Today that is down to 2.2km, which allows detailed predictions of which stretches of river basins and coastlines will need the most protection.</p> <p>Researchers are discovering the impacts go far beyond the initial focus on average temperature. Heat records are being set with increasing frequency. Rainfall patterns are noticeably shifting beyond natural variation. Arctic ice is shrinking faster than expected. The rising seas have already left some places, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/18/this-is-a-wake-up-call-the-villagers-who-could-be-britains-first-climate-refugees\">Fairbourne in Wales</a>, below spring-tide levels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902g16bjpfxakSN/\" data-alt=\"world temperature graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902g16bjpfxakSN/\">world temperature graphic</a> </figure>  <p>By 2050 \u2013 the year the UK plans to achieve carbon neutrality \u2013 the direct impact on Britain will be moderated by the surrounding ocean and there may be opportunities to plant new crops, but these benefits will be dwarfed by trade disruption, migration, humanitarian disasters and shifting ecosystems.</p> <p>\u201cOverall it\u2019s bad. The negatives outweigh the positives,\u201d said Richard Betts, a Met Office scientist who is leading scientific analysis for the next UK climate change risk assessment. \u201cIt stands to reason that if the world keeps gets hotter and hotter, sooner or later we\u2019ll reach the point where it is first uncomfortable and then hard to function. This won\u2019t be seen in the UK, but in parts of the world that are already hot and humid it could increasingly get too hot to function.\u201d</p> <p>The Hadley supercomputer calculates myriad possible pathways depending on how much carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases enter the atmosphere. The good news is that the worst-emissions scenario, known as RCP 8.5, is considered less likely than before because the global coal industry has not grown as feared. The bad news is current emissions trends (which lie between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 6 pathways) could take the planet to 2C warmer than pre-industrial levels by mid-century, which will increase storm damage, heatwaves, sea-level rise and the already great risk that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer.</p> <p>The climate trends are based on multiple-year averages rather than year-on-year comparisons, which are more subject to natural variation.</p> <p>Even the current best-case scenario \u2013 RCP 2.6, which is roughly in line with the Paris agreement \u2013 would leave the world hotter than today.</p> <p>\u201cWhat stands out is that even in the lowest current scenario, we get warming. We\u2019ll need to prepare and adapt,\u201d says Jason Lowe, the head of climate services at Hadley. He predicts extreme summer heatwaves, such as those seen in 2018, will become the norm rather than an exception.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-39025uyCP6ByMePF/\" data-alt=\"UK temperature graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-39025uyCP6ByMePF/\">UK temperature graphic</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs a scientist, I want to narrow the uncertainty so the information is as good as possible so we can plan. I think of the generations to come. I have a nine-year-old daughter. I find myself wondering which of these pathways we will be on when she is 80 or 90.\u201d</p> <p>More extreme results are possible at both ends of the spectrum. The next set of climate assessments will introduce a more ambitious best-case scenario (RCP 1.9) that would mean a faster transition to zero-carbon energy and a greater chance of holding temperature rises below 1.5C. But the situation could worsen rapidly if the climate hits tipping points, such as the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet.</p> <p>\u201cThere are still dangers out there that we don\u2019t fully understand,\u201d said Stott. \u201cMuch of the uncertainty lies on the bad side. It could be terrifying. Can we grow enough crops to feed the population? Can we cope if some places are battered by storm after storm?\u201d</p> <p>Such concerns explain why the anniversary cannot be entirely triumphant. Despite growing evidence of climate risks, governments have been slow to act. Apart from downward blips such as the 2008 financial crisis and the coronavirus lockdown, emissions have steadily increased. The Hadley Centre\u2019s work now is not only about predicting impacts, but preparing for them.</p> <p>\u201cReality has proven that what we were saying 20 to 30 years ago was right. As scientists, that is vindication. But on a personal level, I hoped we would track a different emissions trajectory from where we are now,\u201d Stott said.</p> <p>\u201cThe worry is that we are now taking risks globally that we don\u2019t fully understand ... there will be no winners of climate change if we continue. Scientific evidence has been around for a while.

  "<p><em><br></em>Police in Karachi last week allegedly shot at hundreds of unarmed garment workers protesting outside a factory supplying denim for global fashion brands.</p> <p>Garment workers such as Abdul Basit, 35, claimed to have been charged by police with batons outside a factory which is reported to have fired more than 15,000 workers since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Nasir Mansoor from the National Trade Union Federation. He said some workers had been terminated without written notice.</p> <p>The workers were chanting slogans demanding better conditions and wages when police arrived. Closures and job losses and the suspension of the normal holiday bonus, which enables rural migrants to travel home before the Eid holiday marking the end of Ramadan, had left many of the demonstrators close to despair.</p> <p>Basit, 35, who works at the factory where the protests took place, told the Guardian he hadn\u2019t been paid since March. \u201cWe\u2019re insecure workers and we can be fired at any time,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/11/bangladesh-garment-factories-reopen-despite-coronavirus-threat-to-workers\">Bangladesh garment factories reopen despite coronavirus threat to workers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like many workers, Basit doesn\u2019t have a direct contract with the factory, leaving him vulnerable.

This has precipitated a devastating crisis for Pakistani suppliers, who are passing the impact along to those least able to weather it: labourers living on meagre wages, campaigners say.</p> <p>In Lahore, hundreds of garment workers were reported to have <a href=\"https://fifthinternational.org/content/pakistan-workers%E2%80%99-protests-workers%E2%80%99-revolt\">organised a strike </a>last week against the non-payment of salaries at multiple factories and activists claim factory owners are treating workers as expendable commodities.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Known global deaths pass 350,000</strong></h2> <p>More than 350,000 people have now lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The current toll stands at 350,456. The number of confirmed cases is 5,589,932, after the number of declared cases doubled in a month, with more than one million new cases registered in the last 11 days. There were 500,000 cases registered in just 48 hours, between Sunday, when cases passed 5 million, and Tuesday, when cases passed 5.5 million. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. The US alone accounts for less than a third of the global toll, with 98,916 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Tory unrest increases pressure on PM to sack Dominic Cummings</strong></h2> <p>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/tory-unrest-increases-pressure-pm-sack-dominic-cummings\">growing revolt within Boris Johnson\u2019s party</a> over his refusal to fire Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, over his lockdown breach.

Eight more Tory MPs were publicly critical of Cummings\u2019 actions and three said privately that he should be forced out, according to the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/heatherstewart\">Heather Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\">Rowena Mason</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-proctor\">Kate Proctor</a>.</p> <h2><strong>The WHO says the Americas are the new epicentre of the disease</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization\u2019s regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/global-report-who-says-the-americas-are-centre-of-pandemic-as-cases-surge\">accelerating in countries such as Brazil</a>, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began.

The neighbours have been discussing the possibility of a travel bubble between them as both have slowed the spread of the novel coronavirus to levels well below those in United States, Britain and some other European countries. New Zealand has also reported a fifth consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19.</p> <h2><strong>South Korea reports biggest daily jump in almost 50 days</strong></h2> <p>South Korea South Korea has reported 40 new coronavirus cases for its biggest daily jump in nearly 50 days, causing alarm in a country where millions of children are returning to school. All but four of the new cases came from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to nightclubs, karaoke rooms and an e-commerce warehouse. Three cases were linked to international arrivals. South Korea has also jailed a man for four months for breaking quarantine rules, in the country\u2019s first such prison sentence.</p> <h2><strong>Vietnam to readmit foreigners</strong></h2> <p>Vietnam will resume issuing e-visas to citizens from 80 countries from 1 July, the government said, though it was unclear whether quarantine measures would be lifted. The country imposed a blanket ban on foreigners entering the country in March as part of its aggressive response to the pandemic, which has also involved mass quarantines and expansive contact tracing.So far, Vietnam has not reported any coronavirus deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Macron unveils \u20ac8bn French auto rescue, champions electric cars</strong></h2> <p>President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday announced an \u20ac8bn (US$8.8bn) plan to revive France\u2019s auto industry by making it the European leader in electric cars, boosting a sector brought to its knees by the coronavirus. Macron said the package would include one billion euros in subsidies to encourage purchases of electric and hybrid cars and set a target of France producing a million green cars annually by 2025.The \u201chistoric\u201d intervention will aim to turn France\u2019s rechargeable car industry into Europe\u2019s biggest, the president said.</p> <h2><strong>Germany extends distancing rules to end of June</strong></h2> <p>Germany has extended social distancing rules aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus epidemic to 29 June, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government said on Tuesday. Merkel\u2019s government had been embroiled in disagreements with the least-affected states, some of which wanted to ditch the measures and open up entirely. Germany\u2019s virus caseload now tops 181,200 with just over 8,372 deaths - much lower than European counterparts such as Britain, France, Spain and Italy.</p> <h2><strong>India backs hydroxychloroquine for virus prevention</strong></h2> <p>India\u2019s top biomedical research body has backed the use of the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine as a preventive against coronavirus, after the WHO suspended clinical trials of the drug over safety concerns. The endorsement from the Indian Council of Medical Research came a week after US President Donald Trump said he was taking the drug as a preventative measure. India - which accounts for 70% of global production of hydroxychloroquine - on Tuesday reported 145,380 cases of the virus including 4,167 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Spain begins 10 days of mourning</strong></h2> <p>Starting on Wednesday, the country will mourn for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus in the country. Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June.

Drug-related deaths in England and Wales had already hit a record high before coronavirus struck.</p> \n<p>Lorraine Maden, lead clinical pharmacist at We Are With You, said the click-and-collect service was under consideration prior to the pandemic as a means to reach out to people who had not previously engaged with services but added \u201cCovid-19 has accelerated it\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we provide the equipment it\u2019s about the interventions we can have, the conversation to get people into treatment and recovery longer term,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>People who inject drugs including heroin and steroids are able to access a web portal and request a wide range of needles and equipment including foil packs, needles for different types of veins and specially designed spoons that do not burn when users heat them up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>They will then be able to collect them from an arranged address where they will be met by staff, who have personal protective equipment (PPE) who will provide the delivery using social distancing measures.</p> \n<p>Many users of drugs have underlying health conditions, Maden said, and require delivery to the door.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of our clients our heroin users and have COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung condition],\u201d she said. \u201cThe age of users, particularly if they have smoked crack and heroin over the years, some of them are having to shield.\u201d</p> \n<p>Needle sharing facilitates the passing of blood-borne viruses and so, by providing clean equipment, levels of a wide range of diseases, including Hepatitis-B, Hepatitis-C and HIV, can be reduced and consequently relieve the burden on healthcare.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe more that we can do to reduce those costs is a benefit to society as a whole,\u201d Maden says, adding there is also a risk factor with Covid-19 and sharing drug equipment.</p> \n<p>Dr Rachel Britton, director of pharmacy at the charity, said across the country they have had to individually assess clients who require daily supervised consumption to see if they can switch to collecting the medication weekly or even fortnightly. Across England, the number of users of drugs who require supervised consumption has reduced from 51% as of January to 16% now.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cWe moved away from people having to attend the pharmacy every day to collecting their medication either weekly or in some cases every two weeks, so moving quite quickly away from the need to go to the pharmacy every day. That obviously helped the pharmacy as well.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always safer for clients to have OST available to them rather than be off it and use street drugs. That was the overarching principle. People are on supervised consumption, if we remove that how do we keep them safe?\u201d</p> \n<p>But there are risks in taking people off daily supervised consumption, Britton said, with risks of clients taking a week\u2019s worth of methadone in one day or selling methadone to other individuals, known as diversion.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were particularly concerned about people who had a recent history of overdose, particularly if that was intentional,\u201d she said. \u201cGiving that group of individuals a large quantity of opiates is not a safe thing to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shortly after lockdown measures were introduced, the government announced plans to allow pharmacists to provide OST medication without a prescription but many weeks past before the legislation was laid \u2013 and even then a \u201cpush the button\u201d clause was written in, meaning a secretary of state has to formally enact the measure.</p> \n<p>Britton said the legislation \u201cwould have made a difference done at the beginning\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe would still like that legislation enacted,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough there\u2019s no massive crash of the system, and that includes us, at the beginning it would have been valuable.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A young violinist joins an award-winning ensemble led by a famous composer, only to find out that all of the musicians aren\u2019t actually playing their instruments but are simply miming along to a CD instead. It is an incredible premise for a memoir, and might even make a great Coen brothers film, but <a href=\"https://www.jessicahindman.com/\">Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman</a> says this astonishing story happened to her.</p> <p>At 21, she found herself alone in New York, working two jobs and selling her own eggs to fund her way through Columbia University, where she was studying to be a war correspondent. Hindman finally caught a break in 2002, one that allowed her to monetise her talent as a violinist. She was hired to play in an orchestra by a man she calls only The Composer. But she says she quickly realised the truth: she was to \u201cplay\u201d in front of a dead microphone beneath a booming CD player, and her audiences, whether in a concert hall or a shopping mall, would never twig. \u201cSounds like Titanic!\u201d someone gushed after one gig. The music did sound a little like the film\u2019s soundtrack, and the line gave Hindman the title of her memoir. She did this job for four years. She was, as she writes, Milli Violini.</p> <p>Performing under a backing track is not illegal, as everyone from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/22/beyonce-obama-inauguration-lip-synch\">Beyonc\u00e9 to Yo-Yo Ma </a>knows. And The Composer, who has sold millions of records and performed in New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall, is no evil genius. He is often generous, talking to his fans for hours after shows. His tours have raised millions for charities. But he is also an exploitative boss, she says, and surprisingly ignorant. When Hindman puts Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony on in their rickety tour bus, he says: \u201cI like this music. What is it?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"73a7fe4bdbe112864029af542f2281d0bd7875dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73a7fe4bdbe112864029af542f2281d0bd7875dc/0_0_1632_2068/789.jpg\" alt=\"Hindman playing violin at a friend\u2019s wedding.\" width=\"789\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Back to her roots \u2026 Hindman playing violin at a friend\u2019s wedding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was a gentler, kinder scam,\u201d says Hindman, who is now 39, with a laugh, \u201calmost as if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/14/fyre-netflix-documentary-festival-disaster-review\">Fyre </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/14/fyre-netflix-documentary-festival-disaster-review\">festival</a> had been for charity and everyone had enjoyed themselves. I think it is much more widespread than people understand. It is funny how outraged people get. Even the word \u2018scam\u2019 implies he was motivated by money, and I don\u2019t think he was. He was motivated by the desire to be famous and praised, to be seen as a very good person, and I love that so much more. But it can lead you down a dark path, to the point that you turn off microphones in front of really good musicians because you are so obsessed with perfection.\u201d</p> <p>With the ensemble, Hindman says, she travelled up and down the country, playing eight hours straight at booths selling The Composer\u2019s CDs. In 2004, she joined him on a three-month tour across 54 cities, playing in packed concert halls in front of footage of a bald eagle. Despite such close proximity, The Composer frequently calls Jessica \u201cMelissa\u201d. He only eats Cap\u2019n Crunch cereal and apples, and no food after noon. He rarely touches an instrument, and spends his days writing a Christian musical. He asks questions like: \u201cWhat is Barcelona?\u201d</p> <p>He demands unity from his musicians, buying them all matching jackets, and starts each show by asking them to smile more. During one concert, Hindman studies his face, twisted in a rictus as he waltzes with an audience member he has pulled on stage, and realises that he doesn\u2019t resemble a celebrity as she had first thought \u2013 he looks like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was so silly. He had these world-class musicians and he wasn't using them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Composer wanted the musicians to mime, Hindman says, because that way \u201cwe sounded perfect, never had to rehearse and he could switch us up like socks\u201d. The musicians, some of whom had PhDs from Juilliard, accepted it because, like Hindman, they couldn\u2019t find full-time work and needed the money. \u201cI was the least qualified person in the ensemble,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what made it so silly. He had these world-class musicians and he wasn\u2019t using them. Some of the violinists sounded great! But no one could hear them.\u201d</p> <p>Dedicated to \u201cthose with average talents and above-average desires\u201d, Sounds Like Titanic has its own darker undercurrent. The book is really about millennial work culture, US healthcare and many other things that would push a young woman to mime to a CD for four years.</p> <p>Hindman grew up in rural southern Appalachia, receiving her first violin at the age of eight. Her family spent hours driving her through mountains to get her to 30-minute lessons. While prodigies were performing in renowned concert halls, she played in the school gym where people told her she had real talent. She loved the approval. And in the US, where everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/oct/26/disney-offers-baby-einstein-refunds\">Baby Einstein</a> to Hollywood movies have bolstered the notion that there is a link between classical music and intelligence, playing violin is a way for a young woman to get respect.</p> <p>\u201cAn understanding of classical music \u2013 something adults say they wish they knew more about but don\u2019t \u2013 gives a girl weight in a world that wants her to be weightless,\u201d she writes. But after 13 years of lessons, her real strength, she realised, was not natural talent but supportive parents \u2013 \u201ca gift more practical than celestial, more akin to a Dodge minivan than to a fiery-winged angel of music\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11f11d86234cfe927d0c8c40b5fdf43622af66d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11f11d86234cfe927d0c8c40b5fdf43622af66d4/0_293_4032_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman as child, in the pink skirt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Classical music \u2018gives a girl weight in the world\u2019 \u2026 Hindman as child, in the pink skirt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hindman had got a partly funded scholarship to Columbia and was studying in Cairo in 2001 when 9/11 happened. Returning to the US, she found a country where people were desperate for comfort and assurance, and largely backed a military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was the perfect environment for an all-American composer selling emotionally stirring music, and a bad one for careful reporting on a complex situation. \u201cWhat you really hate,\u201d she writes, \u201cis the fact that in the middle of two catastrophic wars, it is easier to hold a job fake fiddling, playing calming music for Americans while Baghdad burns, than it is to get a job reporting from the middle of the blaze.\u201d</p> <p>The real story behind Sounds Like Titanic is a willingness in the US to pick the most charismatic guy over the most qualified. One of Hindman\u2019s fellow musicians calls The Composer\u2019s music \u201ccrap\u201d since it has \u201call the popularity of rap with the respectability of classical\u201d. It is hard not to wonder what would have happened if Hindman had joined the ensemble a decade later. \u201cPeople see Trump and fake news all over this book, but I finished the manuscript in 2013.\u201d</p> <p>Hindman became addicted to amphetamines and cocaine, buying them to stay awake so she could work yet more hours. Selling $5,000 in CDs would get her a $50 bonus. On the three-month tour, she earned $3,000 after tax and expenses. On stage in Arkansas, she had the first of many panic attacks. Finally burned out at 26, Hindman left the ensemble and moved back to her parents\u2019 house. \u201cI survived the tour physically intact,\u201d she writes. \u201cI lost my grip on reality.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"46c6bd4e554eea8d4fdb5dde3550844cc271a00d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46c6bd4e554eea8d4fdb5dde3550844cc271a00d/0_0_2697_3370/800.jpg\" alt=\"Had to sell her eggs ...

Healthcare helped her recover from the stress, the graduate school helped her write the book. \u201cYou know, it doesn\u2019t take that much support to create a work of art,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the end, it took a $20,000 dissertation fellowship and health insurance. And that was life-changing.\u201d</p> <p>Hindman has not named The Composer because she says the book is not about him. It is about a culture that has allowed people like him to thrive. \u201cI really wanted him to stand as his own character, apart from the person he is based on. Now I can see a lot of myself in him. We both had an enormous drive to succeed and a need to be praised. We were both born in a country that says you can do anything if you set your mind to it. And that just isn\u2019t true, not just because of class, race or gender, but because of our abilities. He could compose, but only a little bit. And I could play violin, but I wasn\u2019t very good at it. So what do you do, when you know what you want to do with your life and you aren\u2019t very good at it?

  "<p>A fantasy preview screening of the BBC\u2019s powerful new drama Sitting in Limbo would have a handful of home secretaries lined up in the front row: Theresa May, Amber Rudd, Sajid Javid and Priti Patel \u2013 with David Cameron invited to sit alongside them. Further back, there would be places for the civil servants who devised immigration policy over the past decade, senior immigration enforcement officers and the governors of Britain\u2019s immigration detention centres.</p> <p>This memorable evening will, of course, never happen because of lockdown, and possibly also because this isn\u2019t how the BBC organises its screenings. But I hope that these politicians and officials force themselves to watch the one-off drama at home when it airs in early June. They may find it uncomfortable viewing.</p> <p>In 90 minutes, it tells the story of Anthony Bryan, 62, a builder who was mistakenly classified as an illegal immigrant by the Home Office in 2015, just as the government turned up the volume on its hostile environment policies, introduced to cut immigration numbers by making it very difficult for those without the correct documentation to continue living in Britain. Bryan was sacked from his job, twice arrested and twice sent to immigration removal centres, where he spent a total of five weeks, before being booked on a plane to Jamaica, a country he hasn\u2019t visited since he moved (entirely legally) to London as an eight-year-old in 1965.</p> <p>The drama, beautifully written by Bryan\u2019s younger brother, the novelist Stephen Thompson, captures the catastrophic consequences of getting placed on the Home Office list of suspected illegal immigrants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"027f2f17e1b1637bada9e1ef79e1178cce11da41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/027f2f17e1b1637bada9e1ef79e1178cce11da41/209_68_5791_3475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Robinson as Anthony Bryan in Sitting in Limbo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Robinson as Anthony Bryan in Sitting in Limbo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Left Bank Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The casually sceptical language used by Home Office staff during their many interviews with Bryan is hard to listen to in the film. They repeatedly suggest he is lying when he sets out his life story. They refer to his children as his \u201calleged children\u201d, and the headteacher who has dug up a photo of him at primary school in the 1960s as \u201cthe man you claim is your ex-headmaster\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just doing my job,\u201d one of the officials tells him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that your job ruins people\u2019s lives?\u201d Bryan asks.</p> <p>I watched the film with a rising fury, and was immensely upset by it, which is surprising because I\u2019m already very familiar with the story. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/man-detained-threatened-with-removal-after-52-years-in-the-uk\">I met </a>Bryan and his partner, Janet McKay, in December 2017, days after he had been released from his second stint in immigration detention, when he was still fighting a deportation order. His son had contacted the Guardian after reading about another long-term UK resident, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/28/i-cant-eat-or-sleep-the-grandmother-threatened-with-deportation-after-50-years-in-britain\">Paulette Wilson</a>, who had also arrived in the UK from Jamaica as a child in the 1960s and who had also been sent to immigration detention and was trying to fight off deportation to a country she hadn\u2019t visited since she was 10.</p> <p>During a long interview, Bryan mentioned that he knew several other people who were being similarly harassed by the Home Office: friends from childhood who had also been misclassified as illegal immigrants, had been sacked from their jobs and were struggling to prove a mistake had been made. Over the next few weeks, he and McKay put me in touch with Hubert Howard, Tyrone McGibbon and Jeffrey Miller, all of whom had moved to the UK legally from Jamaica in the 1960s. Interviews with them and dozens of others triggered a government apology, Rudd\u2019s resignation and multiple promises to set things right.</p> <p>Two years on, things have not been resolved. The last figures published show that only 36 people affected have received compensation (totalling \u00a363,000 from a pot that officials expected to pay out between \u00a3200m and \u00a3500m). Bryan is still waiting.</p> <p>The actor Patrick Robinson, who plays Bryan, says he was in tears as he read the script. \u201cI knew this was happening to lots of people,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to be involved with the film in any shape or form.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The arguments our parents had in the 1950s and 1960s \u2026 I never thought we would be fighting them again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Robinson had a friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/windrush-generation-tell-of-holidays-that-led-to-exile-and-heartbreak\">Junior Green</a>, who was refused re-entry into Britain after visiting Jamaica, despite having lived in the UK for 60 years, since arriving as a five-month-old. Green missed his mother\u2019s funeral while he was stuck in Jamaica for five months, trying to persuade officials that he was British and should be allowed to travel home.</p> <p>\u201cI was aware of it before it hit the news. The whole West Indian community was just collateral damage in the debate on immigration. The government\u2019s apologies are like putting a little piece of sticking plaster on a great big, gaping, festering wound,\u201d he says. </p> <p>His portrayal of Bryan\u2019s shifting emotions, from bemusement to desperation to silently mounting rage, is extremely moving. Robinson says his performance was fuelled by his anger at a scandal that could easily have touched his own family. His parents came from Jamaica in the 1960s; his four older siblings were born in Jamaica, while he and two younger children were born in the UK, where his father tried to continue his career as an electrician, but later accepted work as a bus driver. \u201cHe kept getting laid off.\u201d Was it racism? \u201cProbably. He wouldn\u2019t speak much about it. The history of people coming to the so-called motherland, and the history of double-standards that followed, is very close to me.\u201d</p> <p>Bryan is worried that most people have already forgotten the Windrush scandal, which is why he is so pleased that the film has been made. \u201cPeople find it hard to believe that this happened.

He wants to emphasise that his is just one story that illustrates what thousands have been through, and hopes that the film will push the issue back on to the political agenda. \u201cI\u2019d like immigration people to watch this to see what they put so many people through \u2013 people who shouldn\u2019t be locked up in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>The film opens with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/immigration-bill-theresa-may-hostile-environment\">clip of Theresa May</a>, when she was home secretary, standing behind a podium marked with the slogan \u201cFor Hardworking People\u201d, announcing in an eminently reasonable tone: \u201cThe government will soon publish the immigration bill which will make it easier to get rid of people with no right to be here.\u201d<strong> </strong>We see the then prime minister, David Cameron, remarking: \u201cWe would like to see net immigration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands.\u201d And we hear him self-righteously declaring: \u201cYou put into Britain, you don\u2019t just take out.\u201d</p> <p>Bryan and Thompson\u2019s mother, Lucille, who put a lot into the UK during her time working as a cleaner in an east London hospital, appears on screen shortly afterwards. She struggles to understand why her son has been arrested. Bryan says: \u201cMy mum used to say: \u2018Why are the police arresting you? You must have done something wrong.\u2019\u201d For a while, when everyone was questioning his story, he began to doubt his own memories.</p> <p>\u201cIt made me angry again watching it,\u201d McKay (who is played by Nadine Marshall) says. \u201cI think it will make people get up in arms against the Home Office and the system when they see the injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson recalls his horror when McKay called him in 2016 to tell him that his older brother had been arrested. \u201cI thought there must have been a mistake; I couldn\u2019t get my head around the idea of deportation. It had seemed to be a case of mistaken identity, and felt like a vague, nonserious threat \u2013 until Janet made it quite clear that he would be deported.\u201d He watched what Bryan was going through, as the whole family rallied to try to get him out of detention.</p> <p>He has reassessed his sense of how far Britain has moved on from the racism endured by his parents\u2019 generation on arrival from the Caribbean. \u201cThe arguments our parents had in the 1950s and 1960s \u2026 I never thought we would be fighting them again; I thought we had won those arguments.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, he spent days talking to Bryan, nudging him out of a stoical refusal to dwell on his mistreatment. \u201cHe was very forthcoming on the facts, but he had to be cajoled into opening up personally. It\u2019s not just about losing your job, can\u2019t pay your bills, can\u2019t claim benefits. There has been a real emotional cost, too, and as he has gone along, he has become more open about the effects of it.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson\u2019s film shows Bryan enduring all the exhausting humiliations of a system that is designed to grind people into submission: the interminable queueing at Home Office reporting centres, where officials won\u2019t listen to you, and \u2013 if they do \u2013 aren\u2019t inclined to believe what you say; the hours wasted on hold to call centres in search of officials who might help; the financial difficulties that follow from being sacked, and told you aren\u2019t eligible for benefits (despite having paid UK taxes for years); the embarrassment of having to rely on your children for food. It is a shattering portrait of a system that aims to wear its targets down until they begin to think the idea of self-deportation (back to a country they haven\u2019t been to for half a century) is possibly the most sensible way out.</p> <p>\u201cHe got a sense that, no matter what documentation he provided, it was not going to help,\u201d Thompson says. He worries that the long delay in paying compensation is beginning to take its toll on Bryan. \u201cMy brother is naturally the forgiving and accepting type; he doesn\u2019t do embittered. But the unfortunate reality is that the longer this goes on, and the longer the government drags its heels over the next stage, it will be hard for him to stay that way. There has been a slow, steady erosion of his desire to see the good in everything,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cHe is trying to be patient, but the truth is that they are in very, very bad straits financially. He feels let down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8c5b926b725630bd7bdbe5c0f5e710645180b603\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c5b926b725630bd7bdbe5c0f5e710645180b603/216_239_4058_2435/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Bryan at home with his family in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Bryan at home with his family in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been talking to McKay and Bryan periodically for two and a half years (and for a few startling seconds towards the end of the film, I\u2019m figuratively on screen with them, played by Anna Madeley, somehow made to look disconcertingly like me). I\u2019ve also witnessed a shift from optimism to disillusionment as the compensation process drags on.</p> <p>Nothing here has been exaggerated. In some ways, the film\u2019s strength lies in its subtlety. Many other Windrush victims had even more extreme experiences \u2013 exiled for years in unfamiliar countries, forced into destitution or made homeless.</p> <p>And the Windrush issues explored here remain acutely relevant. It was the same hostile environment priorities that prompted the government in 2015 to introduce the NHS surcharge (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">which was partly withdrawn last week</a> amid anger at the number of international healthcare staff forced to pay to access the NHS services they were working to provide and already paying taxes to fund). These policies also meant a Commonwealth veteran (who had served the British army for a decade in Afghanistan and Iraq) was this month charged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/british-army-veteran-faces-27000-nhs-hospital-bill\">\u00a327,000 for an emergency operation</a> to remove a brain tumour. Despite all the apologies, none of the legislation that underpins it has been repealed.</p> <p>Ideally, the fantasy screening of this film would also see invitations sent to those affected. The BBC might need to book a larger venue to have room for the 12,000 people who have been granted documentation by the Windrush Taskforce over the past two years, proving that they are not (and never were) illegal immigrants. Invitations should go to people such as Trevor Johnson, who was forced to beg on the streets of south London to feed his children, after officials decided he was here illegally, and Joycelyn John, who was frightened by years of Home Office intimidation into accepting a \u201cvoluntary removal\u201d back to Grenada, a country she had left aged four, 53 years earlier. At the end of the screening, there would be time for politicians to discuss the film with them.

  "<p>As a climbing frame with incentives, the hazel in our garden had drawn visitors all through the day. Every time I glanced over, there was a bird in the bush \u2013 a robin, a dunnock, six sparrows. They dived in, using it for shelter, as a song post, a meeting place, a launching pad for the pond. And, most of all, as a feeding station, a thousand green plates offering takeaway dinners.</p> <p>Here was incontrovertible proof that suckers grow on trees: a myriad of bugs, walking, crawling, puncturing the soft greenery of May to drink of its goodness. More bugs eating those bugs, and birds eating them all up, yesterday, today, every day since those leaves first burst forth. And now, late in the afternoon, the sun lit up the leaves\u2019 bleeding wounds, the glinting stickiness of aphid honeydew.</p> <p>I thought by then that the birds would have exhausted the bush\u2019s bounty, but I reckoned without its habitual fringe player.

The bough bowed but held, the tit pecked, then sidestepped to the next terminal twig, and then the next, depressing each in turn as if it were walking along a piano keyboard.</p> <p>Springing to a last twig, the blue tit flipped upside down as it landed, claws locked on its high wire, its throat stretching to jab at something on the underside of a leaf.

The slowdown in spending on key clean energy technologies also risks undermining the much-needed transition to more resilient and sustainable energy systems.\u201d</p> <p>The IEA said at the start of the year it forecast global energy investment would rise by 2% in 2020, the biggest annual rise in six years. It is now expected to plummet by 20% year-on-year.</p> <p>Oil accounts for most of the decline as lockdowns and travel curbs across the globe wipe out demand, with investment due to plummet by a third, about $250bn, this year.

However, the IEA said that in the first quarter the number of wind and solar projects given the financial go-ahead fell to a three-year low. Spending on rooftop solar panels by homes and businesses has been strongly affected, it said.</p> <p>There will be a 9% decrease in spending on electricity networks this year, a \u201cworrying signal\u201d for the development of more secure and sustainable power systems. The report also said that investment in natural gas plants is stagnating and spending on battery storage is levelling off.</p> <p>Birol said the longer-term knock-on effect of reduced investment could threaten the ability of electricity grids to handle future supply shocks.</p> <p>\u201cElectricity grids have been a vital underpinning of the emergency response to the health crisis, and of economic and social activities that have been able to continue under lockdown,\u201d said Birol. \u201cThese networks have to be resilient and smart to ward against future shocks.

One day the neurologist kindly told me I\u2019d be able to go home soon, and I ruined what should have been a good news moment by saying, \u201cUgh, I don\u2019t want real life.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d become more than a little fond of lying in bed all day, excused from homework, while my friends sent me chocolates and volunteers brought big fun dogs to play with. The neurologist raised a knowing eyebrow and said \u201cthat\u2019s what we call \u2018secondary benefits\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Secondary benefits, as in, not the benefits my hospital stay was designed for. As in, not the kind of benefits that we care about prolonging.</p> <p>You\u2019re certainly not alone in experiencing some secondary benefits of quarantine. I heard some people referring to it as \u201ccocooning\u201d, since it felt more like being safely wrapped up than being deprived. Maybe for you this felt like government permission to do what you secretly always want to: go home, shut the door and be alone. Maybe it was just plain alienating to watch other people act as if this time was a cacophony of chaos when at last you felt like you had silence. And maybe now you don\u2019t really want to open the door again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/13/in-lockdown-i-do-far-more-domestic-work-how-do-i-convince-my-partner-his-laziness-is-harming-me\">'In lockdown, I do far more domestic work.

But it is surprising that many of us don\u2019t want to go back to the real world right now. What we\u2019re going back to is our friends, our parties, the outdoors. These aren\u2019t meant to be the homework of the adult world; they\u2019re meant to be the chocolate and the dogs. They\u2019re meant to be the things we want to lie around with all day.<br><br>So what can we do about the fact that they feel like homework? What can we do to make the prospect of opening the front door again feel less \u2013 as you describe it \u2013 like \u201csmall talk\u201d and \u201cunexpected visits\u201d?</p> <p> It can help to ask what exactly makes these things feel tiresome. I have a friend who thought, for a long time, that she didn\u2019t like going to pubs. It turns out she was just going with bores who spoke over her all the time. It\u2019s very easy to conclude \u201cI\u2019m an introvert\u201d when in fact what we should conclude is \u201cmy friends are tedious and I want some new ones\u201d.</p> <p>The fact that the pre-lockdown ways of experiencing other people weren\u2019t fun for you doesn\u2019t mean that they can\u2019t be. Do not conclude that you\u2019re the variable: being out in the world should be fun. If your world makes you want to retreat, it\u2019s worth changing that world.</p> <p>The other place to start is with the knowledge that you do not actually need government permission to do the thing you most want to. When you want to go home, you can. When you want to close the door, you can. This time has reordered many people\u2019s priorities; you won\u2019t be alone if you want to tell people it\u2019s reordered yours.</p> <p>If this pandemic has taught us one thing, it\u2019s that life is very fragile.

The death toll stands at 346,700. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. </strong>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>The UN refugee agency said Covid-19 had pushed its humanitarian work to near \u201cbreaking point\u201d in Yemen, a country devastated by five years of war</strong>. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-uupdates-who-drops-hydroxychloroquine-trial-as-mexico-death-toll-questioned?page=with:block-5eccf3f38f08a1782fa81a50#block-5eccf3f38f08a1782fa81a50\">said</a> a growing number of families were resorting to begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. A separate UN agency said it had only received around 15% of the funding required for the $3.38bn (\u20ac3bn) aid package for Yemen this year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. </strong>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK death toll passed 47,000, according to new figures from the country\u2019s Office for National Statistics</strong>. This figure is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-uupdates-who-drops-hydroxychloroquine-trial-as-mexico-death-toll-questioned?page=with:block-5ecce3d88f0886ce4f5da681#block-5ecce3d88f0886ce4f5da681\">higher</a> than the latest figure given by the UK government \u2013 nearly 37,000 \u2013 because it includes deaths in which Covid-19 is given as a \u201csuspected\u201d cause. The UK government figure only includes deaths of patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russia reports record one-day rise in deaths. </strong>Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342.</li> \n   <li><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. </strong>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.</li> \n   <li><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. </strong>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.</li> \n   <li><strong>UK PM\u2019s aid refuses to apologise or resign over lockdown breach. </strong>The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">also admitted to having taken a second trip</a>, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">check his eyesight</a> was good enough for the longer drive back to London.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO suspends hydroxychloroquine trial. </strong>The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients</a> due to safety concerns.

See you all tomorrow!</p> \n  <p>My colleague Simon Burnton will take it from here. In the meantime, these are the main developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed cases worldwide near 5.5m. </strong>According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,495,061. The death toll stands at 346,232. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. </strong>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. </strong>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</li> \n   <li><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. </strong>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.</li> \n   <li><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. </strong>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.</li> \n   <li><strong>UK PM\u2019s aid refuses to apologise or resign over lockdown breach. </strong>The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">also admitted to having taken a second trip</a>, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">check his eyesight</a> was good enough for the longer drive back to London.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO suspends hydroxychloroquine trial. </strong>The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients</a> due to safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/22/hydroxychloroquine-trumps-covid-19-cure-increases-deaths-global-study-finds\">a paper published last week in the Lancet</a> that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not taking it. In light of the study, he said, the organisation would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial.</li> \n   <li><strong>Coronavirus measures \u2018disastrous\u2019 for children, says Dutch watchdog. </strong>The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group said on Tuesday. School closures left boys and girls more vulnerable to child labour, early marriage and teenage pregnancy, while millions would fall into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus outbreak, the NGO KidsRights said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u2018anytime soon\u2019. </strong>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u201canytime soon\u201d, the PM, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday, but added the country would continue its discussions with neighbouring New Zealand about a trans-Tasman safe travel zone. \u201cI was speaking with Prime Minister Ardern this morning, and we\u2019ll continue to have our discussions about the trans-Tasman safe travel zone,\u201d Morrison told the National Press Club in Canberra.</li> \n   <li><strong>Masks too dangerous for children under two, Japan medical group says. </strong>Children under the age of two shouldn\u2019t wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, a Japan medical group has said, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis.</li> \n   <li><strong>Saudi Arabia to revise curfew times. </strong>Saudi Arabia will revise curfew times this week, and lift them entirely across the kingdom with the exception of the holy city of Mecca, starting on 21 June, state news agency reported in a statement early on Tuesday. Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both the government and private sector will be lifted, starting 31 May, the statement added. For Mecca, the curfew time will be adjusted to 3pm-6pm and prayers will be allowed to be held in mosques from 21 June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Iceland eases national alert. </strong>Iceland eased its national alert against the coronavirus on Monday, allowing for public gatherings of up to 200 people and night clubs and gyms to reopen as the country nears complete recovery from the outbreak. Iceland, which limited the virus spread through a meticulous test-and-trace strategy and a full lockdown, has confirmed 1,804 infections and 10 deaths. But there have been only five reported new cases in May, and more than 99% of infected persons have recovered.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-26-may\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T06:22:11.474Z\">at 7.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecca31d8f0864e579f17a87\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T05:56:05.986Z\">6.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Global report: 'disaster' looms for millions of children as WHO warns of second peak</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group has said, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> warned of an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d in cases if restrictions were lifted too soon.</p> \n  <p>Millions of children would fall into extreme poverty because of the outbreak, which has left governments short of money for health and education for the young, Dutch NGO KidsRights said.</p> \n  <p>The NGO\u2019s warning came as the WHO emergencies head, Dr Mike Ryan, spoke of a potential second wave of infections at any time, especially if measures to halt the first wave were lifted too soon.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave.

WHO emergencies head Dr Mike Ryan told an online briefing, \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave.

They were applied \u2013 hours after the tweets initially went out \u2013 because Trump\u2019s tweets violated Twitter\u2019s \u201ccivic integrity policy\u201d, a company spokeswoman confirmed, which bars users from \u201cmanipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes\u201d, such as by posting misleading information that could dissuade people from participating in an election.</p> <p>Trump responded on Tuesday evening with a pair of tweets that repeated his false claims about voting and accused Twitter of \u201cinterfering in the 2020 Presidential Election\u201d. \u201cTwitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265427539008380928\">wrote</a>. <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/230\">Federal law</a> protects the rights of internet platforms to moderate the third-party speech they publish.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tweets include numerous false statements about California\u2019s plan to expand access to voting by mail in November due to the coronavirus outbreak. The tweets now feature a light blue exclamation point icon, with the message \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d. The alert label may not be visible when the tweets are embedded in another web page, such as below.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255845358645254\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">....living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255845358645254?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 26, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Clicking on the alert will link users to a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/events/1265330601034256384\">Twitter-curated page</a>\u201d that variously describes Trump\u2019s claims as \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and false. The Twitter page also aggregates tweets from a number of journalists and publications explaining why Trump\u2019s statements are false.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s claims about California on Tuesday were blatantly wrong. The state is not sending a ballot to anyone who lives in the state but rather those registered there. Sam Mahood, a spokesman for the secretary of state, Alex Padilla, said in an email only active voters in the state would be mailed ballots.</p> <p>As states prepare for an unprecedented surge in mail-in voting because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Trump has repeatedly made baseless claims that this will lead to fraud. Voter fraud is <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">extremely rare</a> and one analysis found just <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/494189-lets-put-the-vote-by-mail-fraud-myth-to-rest\">143 convictions involving</a> mail-in ballot fraud since 2000, representing 0.00006% of the ballots cast during that time period.</p> <p>Trump, who voted by mail in Florida in March, has made it clear that he opposes any effort to make it easier to vote by mail for all eligible voters, including sending an absentee ballot application to all voters, a measure the Republican National Committee does not oppose. In March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">he said</a> Democratic efforts in Congress to expand mail-in voting would make it so \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d. Studies have shown neither Democrats nor Republicans benefit from a switch to a vote-by-mail system.</p> <p>Trump also attacked efforts to increase mail-in voting in Michigan and Nevada last week. He falsely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/20/trump-threatens-cut-states-election-funding-mail-in-ballot-plans\">said Michigan</a> was sending absentee ballots to all registered voters; in fact the state was only sending an absentee ballot application. Trump later deleted his tweet and reposted a new one accusing the secretary of state of unlawfully sending the applications, something the secretary of state says is well within her authority.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, lambasted Twitter\u2019s decision in a statement, framing it as an attempt by \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d to \u201cobstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters\u201d. Parscale also asserted that Twitter\u2019s \u201cclear political bias\u201d was a reason that the Trump campaign pulled its advertising from Twitter \u201cmonths ago\u201d.</p> <p>Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/twitter-ban-political-advertising-us-election\">banned all political advertising</a> in November 2019, more than six months ago. At the time, Parscale decried the global policy change as \u201canother attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/twitter-ban-political-advertising-us-election\">Twitter to ban all political advertising, raising pressure on Facebook</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Experts on misinformation raised questions about whether Twitter\u2019s measure would be effective. Mike Caulfield, head of the Digital Polarization Initiative of the American Democracy Project, noted that the \u201cGet the facts\u201d phrasing could further entrench misinformation with its \u201clegitimizing tone\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGet the facts implies there is a debate where facts are being marshalled in evidence,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holden/status/1265406538602053632\">wrote</a> on Twitter. \u201cIt elevates the claim.\u201d</p> <p>Claire Wardle, the director of First Draft News, also questioned whether Twitter\u2019s information page would be effective in changing any minds.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are to consider the reasoning behind this, it\u2019s not a belief that this will change anyone\u2019s minds, it\u2019s to provide necessary context to a tweet that should be taken down, but if they did that would lead to more conspiratorial thinking,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re stuck between a rock and hard place.\u201d</p>"
