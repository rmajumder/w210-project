private firms and medical associations ahead of a probable scenario where public hospitals run out of critical care beds. <br></p> \n  <p>Providers will be able to charge a daily fee of up to 16,000 rand ($950) for Covid-19 patients that get treated in critical care beds in private hospitals, <strong>Anban Pillay</strong>, the health ministry\u2019s deputy director-general for national health insurance, told Reuters. <br></p> \n  <p>The fee includes the cost of using the bed, paying a team of specialists to treat the patient and additional services including pathology and radiology. <br><br> Estimates vary widely as to how many critical care beds there are in the country.

pressure to ease restrictions further across the country ahead of the end of its three-week progressive <em>deconfinement </em>programme, after the country\u2019s scientific advisory committee

tourists and France\u2019s borders remain closed except for essential business and personal reasons. Ch\u00e2teau staff said there was a rush on the place on Saturday, but even so they have 4,000 visitors instead of the 20,000 a day on a normal June weekend.</p> \n  <p>France reported 31 new deaths from Covid-19 in the 24 hours to Saturday, bringing the total to 29,142 since March.

  "<p>Downing Street fears that Michel Barnier has lost his grip&nbsp;on the fishing negotiations, throwing doubt over Boris Johnson\u2019s hopes of a summer of swift and definitive progress towards a trade and security deal with the EU.</p> <p>The bloc\u2019s chief negotiator had been expected to present a compromise proposal on access to British waters during the talks last week but was blocked at the last minute by member states with large fishing communities.</p> <p>British sources said an unexpected decision by fisheries ministers at a meeting with Barnier to reject a move away from their hardline position had \u201cskewed things late in the process\u201d, preventing a middle ground being found.</p> <p>Despite four rounds of talks on fisheries by videoconference call last week, a time commitment unmatched for any other issue, both sides confirmed on Friday that there had been no progress towards a deal. </p> <p>Barnier said \u201cthe EU wants the status quo, the UK wants to change everything\u201d, but called for discussions \u201csomewhere between\u201d.</p> <p>As a result of the surprise logjam, recent discussions between the sides on moving the negotiations into a new intensive phase of face-to-face talks between Barnier and his counterpart, David Frost, in July have become more difficult.</p> <p>Downing Street wants to swiftly enter a \u201ctunnel phase\u201d over the summer during which member states would entrust Barnier to thrash out a trade and security deal without constant intervention by the EU capitals.</p> <p>France, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, Germany and Sweden have not yet offered their negotiator any flexibility on the key issue of fishing rights despite Barnier\u2019s public calls for both sides to move from their \u201cmaximalist\u201d positions.</p> <p>The EU now expects the talks to drag into October, a suggestion that senior UK sources insist is unacceptable given the need for businesses on both sides to prepare for the new trading environment that will come from any deal.</p> <p>Downing Street hopes Barnier will try again to move the EU capitals towards compromise. </p> <p>\u201cWe are now at an important moment for these talks,\u201d a government spokesman said. \u201cIf we are to make progress, it is clear that we must intensify and accelerate our work.&nbsp;Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK\u2019s well-established position on the so-called level playing field, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to fishing rights, the EU wants to emulate the strictures of the common fisheries policy (CFP) from the end of 2020 when the UK leaves the transition period during which it has remained in the bloc\u2019s single market and customs union.</p> <p>Under the CFP, the total allowable catch figures for different species of fish are negotiated annually by fisheries ministers. The respective share that each member state\u2019s fleet then takes is based on catches recorded in the 1970s.</p> <p>British fishing communities have long claimed that the policy has left them with far too few fish to catch with notable inequities including that French fishermen have 84% of the cod quota in the English Channel.</p> <p>The UK is insisting it will be an independent coastal state from the end of 2020 and that there needs to be a new relationship with the EU in this area, similar to that enjoyed by Norway.</p> <p>The British negotiating side wants fishing rights to depend on where the fish live \u2013 a model known as zonal attachment.</p> <p>Frost has informed Barnier, however, that other factors such as the effect on coastal communities and longstanding rights could be a factor in annual negotiations to ensure that European fishing communities are not left bereft.</p> <p>Barnier had been expected to provide some data on how such external factors would affect the rights to catches but sources said that failed to materialise in the last week.</p> <p>\u201cUntil they give us some more, there is no way of using that to derive hard information about the numbers,\u201d one UK source said. \u201cThat appears to be the difficulty.

These are the students who are highly self-motivated, highly literate and are working above the standard in the classroom. They are the students who require extension and enrichment as they lightly hopscotch through the curriculum.</p> <p>Learning from home has also been a positive for some students with social anxiety, who were given a reprieve from the struggles of managing multiple interactions in a day and dealing with fraught exchanges with peers. There are also the individual needs students who are also requiring individualised support based on their academic and social skills. These students too might be happy to be at home completing basic literacy and numeracy skills.</p> <p>The students who generally work at a standard level are a mixed bag. These students all overwhelmingly wanted to return to school either because of the challenges of remote learning or because they miss the social interactions with their peers. This group should have been able to manage remote learning due to their basic literacy, however they have different points of need. Some of them are able to manage the work after an explanation, some of them struggle and remain mute, suffering in silence and the errors only became apparent when their work was submitted for assessment.</p> <p>In the classroom these students are more easily supported because I can see from their notebooks as I walk around the classroom who is struggling, or the students themselves would be able to understand the task requirements because they had multiple opportunities for instruction through my modelling and then by viewing the notebooks of their desk mates. In individual digital silos, they lost so much support.</p> <p>Then there are the students who have poor organisation and work skills. They require a teacher\u2019s constant reminders and face-to-face interactions in order to complete the work they need to pass the subject.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/19/home-schooling-everyones-finding-their-feet-and-we-need-to-be-gentle-with-each-other\">Home schooling: 'Everyone's finding their feet and we need to be gentle with each other'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We make the assumption that young people are literate with technology because of their interaction with various platforms and social media, however their basic digital literacy is quite poor when it comes to downloading files, naming files, accessing files from Google Drives or school platforms, saving and uploading files, inserting photos or other media, using formatting functions such as changing the colour of fonts or highlighting. There is the need to provide multiple explanations and demonstrations constantly.</p> <p>The students who work at lower levels are the ones eager to return to school and who have found remote learning difficult.</p> <p>Some of these students have been identified as below standard and have been placed on modified programs. Others have low ability due to concentration and their inability to process multiple instructions at once and need a slow, step-by-step instructional model, which remote teaching does not lend itself to. Flicking up and down a digital document disrupts their ability to process the learning task and they get lost and frustrated.</p> <p>These students are the ones who are already at risk of falling through the cracks in the classroom and are exposed to many intervention strategies, learning programs and engagement programs in order to support them. They succeed because of the school environment that supports them and the relationships they develop with their teachers, and when this is removed from the equation through the digital learning environment they flail and sink.</p> <p>Now that I have been remote teaching for seven weeks I know one unequivocal and indisputable truth: remote teaching can never replace the face-to-face model for secondary students.

Some of the cats that end up in foster care are house cats or kittens that have been surrendered for some reason or other, but others lack socialisation and/or have underlying health and behavioural problems.&nbsp;</p> <p>The latter category is at greatest risk of euthanisation, and working with them is a slow process of building trust and confidence. It can be difficult and frustrating, and at times you can feel as though you\u2019re getting nowhere.

The case numbers lags behind only the US, Brazil, Russia, UK and Spain.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we open Delhi hospitals for patients from all over, where will Delhi residents go when they get infected with coronavirus?\u201d Kejriwal said. Typically, about 60%-70% of patients admitted to hospitals in Delhi are people travelling from other states to get treatment at the city\u2019s hospitals.</p> \n<p>Other countries, such as <strong>Iran</strong> and <strong>Panama,</strong> were dealing with a resurgence of the virus after seemingly having turned the corner. Panama announced on Saturday it would reintroduce restrictions&nbsp;on the movement of people in two provinces following an increase in the number of new cases.</p> \n<p>Iran said its fresh cases were a result of wider testing. \u201cThe main reason for rising numbers is that we started identifying [people] with no or light symptoms,\u201d said the health ministry\u2019s head epidemiologist, Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya.</p> \n<p>The <strong>Singaporean</strong> prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said in a televised address on Sunday that his country needed to prepare for a more difficult future with higher unemployment and less global trade and travel. \u201cCountries will have less stake in each other\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d Loong said. \u201cThey will fight more over how the pie is shared, rather than work together to enlarge the pie for all. It will be a less prosperous world, and also a more troubled one.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Pope</strong> <strong>Francis</strong>&nbsp;broke from his prepared text in an address on Sunday, warning <strong>Italians</strong> to not let their guard down against coronavirus now that infection rates had fallen, and urged them to obey government rules on social distancing and the wearing of masks.</p> \n<p>Francis, addressing several hundred people in St Peter\u2019s Square for his Sunday blessing, reacted to applause that broke out when he said their presence, albeit reduced, was a sign that Italy had overcome the acute phase of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cBe careful. Don\u2019t cry victory too soon,\u201d he cautioned them.</p> \n<p><em>Agencies contributed to this report</em></p>",

  "<p>For those not directly affected, the ability to breathe more easily and see further has perhaps been the greatest consolation amid the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>As city after city begins to emerge from lockdown, urban planners and environmental campaigners are grappling with how to keep the clean air and blue skies that have transformed our view of the world. \u201cCitizens around the world can see change is possible,\u201d says Zoe Chafe, an air quality specialist with the C40 group of global megacities. \u201cJust put yourself on the rooftop and imagine seeing mountains for the first time, and thinking how amazing it feels to realise this is possible.\u201d</p> <p>That rooftop could be in Kathmandu (where residents were astonished to <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/lockdown-effects-mt-everest-visible-from-kathmandu-after-decades-as-pollution-level-goes-down/as75802249.cms\">make out Mount Everest for the first time in decades</a>), Manila (where the <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2020/04/manila-gets-its-skyline-back-as-air-quality-improves-amid-covid-19-lockdown/\">Sierra Madre became visible again</a>) or dozens of other cities across the world.</p> <p>Not everywhere has seen air quality improvements in recent months. In some Asian cities, such as Hanoi and Jakarta, pollution has become worse. But, for the most part, people across the world are experiencing a healthier alternative to the smoke and smog that are responsible for an estimated 3 million deaths a year.</p> <p>Having seen the shroud lift, there is a growing clamour not to let it fall again. Cities across the world are exploring ways to permanently reduce pollution. Chafe says there is no quick, one-case-fits-all solution, but there are lessons \u2013 on environmental justice, community activism, urban design, climate ambition, technological innovation and municipal leadership \u2013 that can be learned from the cities and states that were making progress even before the lockdown. Here are three.</p> <h2>Copenhagen</h2> <p>Copenhagen has the world\u2019s most ambitious plan to cut emissions: carbon neutral by 2025. This is pushing the Danish capital to go beyond the existing model of smart, clean urban design and cycle-centred transport that has turned it into one of the cleanest cities in the world.</p> <p>Grassroots activism, pragmatic government and high taxes have been the drivers for change. Old photographs prove the city had as much of a car culture as any European city in the 1970s, when more than 100,000 citizens demonstrated in R\u00e5dhuspladsen (City Hall Square) to demand their streets back. Since then, town planners have steadily reduced parking spaces and widened areas for pedestrians and bicycles.</p> <p>Jeppe Juul, of the Danish Eco Council, says it is a question of priorities. \u201cIt feels good to walk around Copenhagen,\u201d he says, adding that in some areas of the city \u201cpedestrians have more space than bikes, and bikes have more space than cars.\u201d The city now vies with Amsterdam for being the most bicycle-friendly city in the world.&nbsp;This means traffic lights with resting bars that riders can hang on to without touching the ground, take-away coffee containers designed for bikes, and groups that organise parent\u2019s shifts for schools runs on \u201cminibus-like\u201d bicycles that can take up to six children at a time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"092c89d06533c44221a0defd163b9382de17190d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/092c89d06533c44221a0defd163b9382de17190d/0_224_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HC Andersens boulevard in Copenhagen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HC Andersens boulevard in Copenhagen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Forsberg/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Copenhagen\u2019s 2025 target depends largely on replacing coal-fired heating with biomass, wind and geothermal energy. A new district-heating infrastructure will allow neighbourhoods to scrap home boilers. Urban planners aim to use carbon capture and storage technology to trap emissions from the main municipal waste incinerator.</p> <p>Some still doubt the city will be zero-carbon within five years, but Mikkel Krogsgaard Niss, from the mayor\u2019s office, says sceptics have been proved wrong in the past. \u201cFrom 2014-20, we reduced carbon dioxide by&nbsp;more than 50%, so we are on our way,\u201d he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>These shifts will create up to 35,000 jobs, with most of the money coming from public coffers. Residents already pay some of the highest rates of tax in the world, but this is seen as <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-01-20/why-danes-happily-pay-high-rates-of-taxes\">an investment in health and quality of life</a>. The city\u2019s wastewater plant was also expensive, but now that it is operational, residents can swim in the harbour \u2013 something unthinkable in urban waterways elsewhere. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200419-coronavirus-five-countries-with-the-best-healthcare-systems\">Danes are consistently </a><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200419-coronavirus-five-countries-with-the-best-healthcare-systems\">ranked among the world\u2019s healthiest and happiest people</a>.</p> <p>The municipality also wants to completely phase out combustion engines by electrifying the bus fleet and banning petrol and diesel cars within five years. After that plan ran into opposition from the national government, local environmental NGOs lobbied for a revolutionary new traffic management scheme that hugely decreases the convenience of car use. The \u201cdistribution plan\u201d, which was pioneered in the Belgian town of Ghent, divides the urban centre into a handful of zones and prohibits drivers from going directly from one to another. Instead, they have to go via the suburbs. \u201cIt means there is no such thing as a short drive to the bakery or wherever in this system,\u201d says Jens M\u00fcller, the air quality manager of the Transport &amp; Environment NGO. As a result, walking, cycling and public transport become more appealing. \u201cIt\u2019s the most radical thing you can do apart from creating a no-car zone,\u201d says Juul.</p> <p>Copenhagen is in a group of European cities, including Amsterdam, Paris, London and Oslo, that are trying to set the global pace for air quality improvements. M\u00fcller says London is a leader on ultra-low emission zones, Oslo on promoting use of electric cars, while Paris is exploring radical plans for \u201ca city of 15 minutes\u201d that aims to ensure every resident can get the shops and services they want within a short walk or bicycle ride. Cities in Germany are pioneering pop-up infrastructure and tactical urbanism that allow communities to block roads at certain times for certain events. In Brussels, residents now have a say in when to close roads for children\u2019s parties and barbecues. M\u00fcller says this reduces pollution because people spend more time outside their homes.</p> <p>The foundation, he says, is community activism by previous and current generations. Amsterdam may now be aiming for zero-carbon boats and yet more bikes, but \u2013 like Copenhagen \u2013 the origins of its strong air-quality ambition was the parents\u2019 movement in the 1970s, which campaigned against the number of road traffic accidents with banners demanding: \u201cStop murdering our children.\u201d More recently, Madrid has seen a fierce political contest for control of the streets, with 20,000 people rallying last year to oppose plans by the ruling rightwing coalition to reopen the city centre to cars. The \u201cMadrid Central\u201d zone in the Spanish capital had achieved more <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/news/people-power-and-courts-fight-first-ever-attempt-scrap-low-emissions-zone\">nitrogen dioxide reductions than any city in Europe</a>. So far, people power has kept the cars out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6b2b9062e178fe60d7165966216fb4edfc8b200\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6b2b9062e178fe60d7165966216fb4edfc8b200/0_125_4171_2503/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oakland \u2026 harnessed the power of environmental activism.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oakland \u2026 harnessed the power of environmental activism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melpomenem/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>California (Oakland and Los Angeles)</h2> <p>The importance of grassroots activism has recently been enshrined into law in California, where campaigners have persuaded the government that if it wants to improve air quality it needs to empower low-income BAME neighbourhoods, which are worst affected because they often live closest to pollution sources.</p> <p>California has made impressive strides since the 1980s, when Los Angeles, Oakland and San Jose were notorious for a toxic haze that blanketed the city for more than 200 days of the year. These days, thanks to tighter regulations, higher petrol standards and less reliance on coal, there are usually fewer pollutants in the air and about 60 more days of blue skies a year. Several cities have also launched \u201cgreen new deals\u201d. Even the car capital of the world, Los Angeles, is trying to nudge commuters on to an upgraded public transport system.</p> <p>But perhaps the most impressive work is being done at the community level by local activists in hotspots of pollution. The leading light in this initiative is Margaret Gordon, who has spent almost 30 years campaigning for environmental health and social justice in her West Oakland neighbourhood, a part of the San Francisco Bay Area that sits between two highways, a busy port, factories and the proposed site of a coal terminal.</p> <p>She first realised how badly her mostly black and Latino community was affected in 1992 when she started working part-time at a local school where she saw shoeboxes full of asthma inhalers, each with the name tag of a different child. \u201cThat was the start,\u201d she recalls in a Zoom chat interrupted by her coughing. \u201cAfter that, I went to a local meeting to express my righteous outrage about the conditions in the neighbourhood.\u201d</p> <p>Gordon began monitoring the numbers of trucks that passed through on their way to the port. She later received training and funding to measure levels of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 that can enter the bloodstream and cause respiratory disease. Even inside her home, the readings were unhealthily high.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf139ca45917963ed9c33f9820babec2e7c952f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf139ca45917963ed9c33f9820babec2e7c952f5/0_0_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margaret Gordon \u2026 has managed to get laws changed to improve the environment.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margaret Gordon \u2026 has managed to get laws changed to improve the environment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of WOEIP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She founded the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, and worked with scientists, who collected data to prove what she had long believed \u2013 that low-income minority communities are far more likely to suffer the ill effects of air pollution (later including higher vulnerability to Covid-19) than other sectors of society.</p> <p>The pressure has reaped results. The California Air Resources Board ordered the port to take action. There is now stricter regulation of trucks, the port has electrified its facilities and the planned coal terminal has been blocked. Air pollution is 74% lower than in 2008, according to the port. Gordon wants more. \u201cThe windowsills have gone from black to grey. But there is still a long way to go. We still have hotspots.\u201d</p> <p>Her biggest achievement, however, may have been to help draft state law AB617, which passed in 2017 and put local communities at the centre of emissions reductions planning. West Oakland is now one of three Californian neighbourhoods that have drafted their own action plan for dealing with pollution sources. Air quality activists hope this will also address the tendency for wealthy white communities to go low carbon by offloading pollution towards poorer black and Latino areas. Of the two north-south highways in Oakland, it is no coincidence that trucks are banned only on the 580, which passes through a more affluent part of the city. Gordon says the goal is environmental equality.</p> <h2>Mexico City</h2> <p>Among air quality wonks and urban planners, perhaps the greatest buzz of excitement is about Mexico City. The Central American megalopolis was named the world\u2019s most polluted capital in 1992, but it has since managed to improve air quality despite the pressures of an extra 5 million inhabitants.</p> <p>Today it has perhaps the most environmentally savvy mayor in the world. <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/can-environmental-engineer-poised-become-mayor-fix-mexico-city\">Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo</a>, the first woman to hold the office, is an energy scientist who won the Nobel peace prize in 2007 for her work on the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p> <p>In a previous stint as the director of the city\u2019s environment department, she oversaw the introduction of the Metrobus, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit\">rapid-transit</a> bus with dedicated lanes. Now she is aiming higher. Last year, she announced a six-year environmental plan, including a 30% cut in air pollution, a 40bn-peso (\u00a31.5bn) modernisation of the metro and a campaign to plant 15m trees. Her government has banned the use of single-use plastic bags and plans to gradually phase out other single-use items, such as straws, cups and balloons.</p> <p>The city\u2019s biggest challenge is traffic. Cars must be off the road for part of the week under the city\u2019s widely replicated Hoy No Circula system, which restricts when vehicles can be on the road based on their number plates. But this has had mixed results because wealthier people simply buy more vehicles to get round the restrictions. The number of vehicles almost doubled between 2006 and 2016, and now account for about 70% of emissions and most nitrogen dioxide pollution in the metropolitan area. Previous administrations have lessened the impact by tightening gasoline standards, expanding monitoring and restricting access to the central corridor in the heart of the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78a4ed1d9dbce060922ab5a42a9c9d35918ef639\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78a4ed1d9dbce060922ab5a42a9c9d35918ef639/0_458_4016_5020/800.jpg\" alt=\"Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo \u2026 the world\u2019s most environmentally sensitive mayor?\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo \u2026 the world\u2019s most environmentally sensitive mayor?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Israel Gutierrez/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are still dreadful smog spikes, particularly when forest fires in the surrounding hills add to exhaust fumes. Last year, the air was so unhealthy that the government closed schools, temporarily banned tens of thousands of cars from the road and forced professional football games to be rescheduled.&nbsp;But, overall, there have been long-term gains. Since 1988, ozone is down 46% and the amount of larger PM10 particles has fallen by 74%, according to Marco Balan, an adviser to the city\u2019s air quality general director. \u201cThe view out of my window has improved,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we have a long way to go.\u201d</p> <p>Sheinbaum wants to go further by raising emissions standards for new vehicles, promoting use of hybrid and electric vehicles and investing more in the metro system, cleaner buses, light railways and cable cars so that people no longer have to rely on informal \u2013 and often dirty and overcrowded \u2013 minivans. Campaigners say a more important step would be to end fuel subsidies. Without that, the cycling scheme, known as EcoBici, will always seem like an afterthought and the Via Verde \u2013 a project to plant vertical gardens on the pillars of elevated roads \u2013 will inevitably be dismissed as window dressing.</p> <p>\u201cMexico City is a stunning example of air quality improvements,\u201d says Chafe. \u201cThey are dealing with it in a holistic way. They know they have many sources and realise it has a huge impact on life expectancy and quality of life. The situation is not perfect, but they have made really impressive progress.\u201d</p> <p>Building on that \u2013 here and elsewhere \u2013 will be the key after lockdown, she says. \u201cWe have seen an improvement in air quality in the past few months. It has been happening for the wrong reasons and in a sad situation. I hope we can now find a way to achieve the same results in a socially fair and feasible way.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2020 to clarify that the quote from Jeppe Juul about pedestrians having more space than bikes only applies to some areas of Copenhagen, not the whole city as an earlier version had implied.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cTikTok tadpole influencer\u201d is not a career path that Hannah McSorley would have been told about at school. In lockdown, however, with her GSCEs on hold, the 17-year-old has turned a time-honoured pastime \u2013 collecting frogspawn \u2013 into a potentially lucrative online empire.</p> <p>McSorley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@.baby.frogs/video/6813383245439274246?lang=en\">hypnotic daily videos</a> of her tens of thousands of tadpoles have attracted 535,000 followers on TikTok as <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@.baby.frogs\">@.baby.frogs</a>, leading to a deal with a US influencer agency.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m honestly amazed by the following I have,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the simple things: tadpoles, frogs. People find it fascinating.\u201d</p> <p>A week into isolating with her family at their home in the countryside near Omagh in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, McSorley came upon a patch of frogspawn at risk of drying up in a shallow puddle. She took it home in a jar, thinking it could be an educational experience for her nine-year-old brother.</p> <p>Another clutch followed a week later, necessitating an upgrade in housing from one tub to two tubs, and now a paddling pool filled with plants and rocks.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI always say there\u2019s 37,928,\u201d McSorley said. \u201cI call it a generous estimate.\u201d</p> <p>What was intended as a project to keep her busy during lockdown has sparked a TikTok sensation, with videos of McSorley tending to her writhing brood drawing hundreds of thousands of views and many requests for help. She has written her own how-to guide for those wishing to start their own \u201cjourney with tadpoles\u201d.</p> <p>After extensive online research and consulting the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), McSorley began feeding her tadpoles boiled lettuce or spinach daily and changes their pool water fortnightly. \u201cA good rule of thumb is four tadpoles per litre of water,\u201d she writes, a large enough quantity to protect against losses.</p> <p>She has recorded three casualties in 72 days. \u201cUnfortunately that\u2019s just nature,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they are remembered, and I do funerals for them.\u201d Her <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@.baby.frogs/video/6817084994608057606?lang=en\">heartfelt burial of one tadpole, named </a><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@.baby.frogs/video/6817084994608057606?lang=en\">Fred, </a>has attracted <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@.baby.frogs/video/6817084994608057606?lang=en\">more than 1.8m</a> views.</p> <p>McSorley says she was a TikTok skeptic before lockdown, watching more than she posted, \u201cbut then I found my niche of tadpole videos\u201d. Her account has started a trend, with 34.6m views to the #tadpole hashtag across TikTok. The biggest account, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tadpolegirl\">@tadpolegirl</a>, from the US, has nearly 900,000 followers.</p> <p>McSorley is interested in training as a vet, but also has plans to launch an educational YouTube channel in time to capitalise on frogspawn season early next year. In the meantime she has signed with the US influencer agency Markerly to grow her reach.</p> <p>McSorley believes the appeal of tadpoles is that they are \u201ctotally nonpolitical\u201d, though she did pause posting on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/blackout-tuesday-dominates-social-media-millions-show-solidarity-george-floyd\">#blackouttuesday last week in solidarity</a> with the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>\u201cI find the tadpoles very peaceful to watch. People love the wholesomeness of my videos and their simplicity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about tadpoles living their best lives.\u201d</p> <p>Not for long though. The first tadpoles sprouted legs last week, suggesting to McSorley she has two or three weeks before she has a pool full of frogs. \u201cNot the easiest thing to look after,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Her followers had already expressed concern. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stephen_cass_/status/1265429446850379776\">One Twitter user said</a> there would soon be one frog for every three people in Omagh, \u201cstraight from the book of Exodus\u201d.</p> <p>One person who saw McSorley\u2019s videos made an anonymous complaint to NIEA, who contacted her parents to discuss her intentions. \u201cHonestly, my mum is the biggest fan of it all. She checks in on them before I do in the morning. She appears on my livestream sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>McSorley already has a strategy for the emergence of the frogs. She plans to release them in batches in ponds and streams within a two-mile radius of her home, so as not to overwhelm any one area, though she notes that numbers are already down because of the unseasonably warm spring.</p> <p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t as many frogs as people might think. It\u2019s a very sad thing.Most of them will end up being eaten by birds, but some will come back to lay their eggs next year.\u201d</p> <p>McSorley intends to be ready for them: \u201cI\u2019m really hoping my dad will build me a pond,\u201d she said.</p>",

In order to defend slavery, John C Calhoun, seventh vice-president of the US, leaned on Aristotle\u2019s theory of natural slavery, the history of Greek democracy and the glory of the Roman empire.

But they will reach the wrong conclusions, as Remnick did, when he ended on the note that the way forward is \u201cto struggle honorably and fiercely in the name of American ideals\u201d. There are not two competing visions of America battling it out. There has always been one \u2013 under Trump, Obama or whoever is to come next. And its ideals have always been the same: to deny its black population the human rights it extends to its white one, and whenever it is caught doing so graphically, brutally, undeniably on camera, convince itself that this is the exception and not the norm.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> \n<p>\u2022 On Tuesday 9 June at&nbsp;7pm BST (2pm EDT) the&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;is&nbsp;holding a&nbsp;live-streamed&nbsp;event&nbsp;about the meaning of George Floyd\u2019s killing,&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;journalists including&nbsp;US southern bureau chief&nbsp;Oliver Laughland, reporter&nbsp;Kenya Evelyn, writer&nbsp;Chris McGreal and columnist&nbsp;Malaika Jabali.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-the-killing-of-george-floyd-107707269342\">Book tickets here</a></p>",
  "<p>At the outset, Covid-19 and the lockdown disoriented organised crime and its activities as much as the rest of us. But organised crime is not only adapting to the present, it is preparing to carve a lucrative future out of the crisis.</p> <p>A week before lockdown in the UK, many drug dealers noticed a massive surge in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/life-after-coronavirus-panic-buying-cocaine-drug-dealer-spaceman-therapist\">panic buying</a> of cocaine, heroin and marijuana. Drugs were the toilet rolls of Britain\u2019s criminal world. With good reason: a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/13/gangs-still-forcing-children-into-county-lines-drug-trafficking-police-covid-19-lockdown\">county lines</a>\u201d operator in west London who normally supplied cocaine and heroin to towns in Hampshire explained that, as soon as the government ordered people to stay at home, these drug networks closed down because it was too risky for the dealers to move around.</p> <p>Cocaine and heroin prices registered the sharpest increase in the pre-lockdown period on the reasonable assumption that there would be a massive disruption to the supply chain from overseas. \u201cThe prices for heroin and coke have definitely gone up in my city,\u201d said a darknet vendor, CocaineBrain. \u201cEveryone I know has had a harder time getting the supply they need but they are paying more.\u201d Sales of marijuana, by contrast, have been largely unaffected. \u201cBusiness is booming for me. People mainly buying weed and benzos,\u201d said DWtripadvisor. \u201cMy weed is grown in the UK so the price has stayed the same for now.\u201d Drugs sold online over the darknet have seen a significant uptick in activity. Vendors on these markets, which are mainly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/26/uk-organised-gangs-profit-most-in-europe-from-darknet-drugs-sales-report\">based in the UK</a> and the Netherlands, are doing a brisk business. Their top sellers are synthetic drugs such as MDMA, ecstasy, which can be produced in local laboratories. </p> <p>The National Crime Agency has scored<strong> </strong>significant successes in slowing down the traffic in class-A drugs (chiefly cocaine). Since lockdown, it has seized<a href=\"https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/millions-of-pounds-and-tonnes-of-drugs-seized-during-lockdown\"> 25 tonnes and \u00a315m in cash</a>,<strong> </strong>which is notably more than during the first three months of the year. \u201cCovid-19 restrictions have made criminal groups take additional risks in moving cash around,\u201d according to an NCA statement. \u201cThe closure of many cash-based businesses in recent weeks has robbed OCGs [organised crime groups] of an opportunity to stash or launder their cash, making it harder for criminals to conceal the proceeds of their crimes.\u201d</p> <p>When it became clear how serious Covid-19 was, there was an immediate drop in the level of organised criminal activity in <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-crime-rate-fall-latest-update-a9460846.html\">the UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/de/corona-kriminalit\u00e4t-in-der-krise/a-53094260\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-france-records-sharp-drop-in-crime-during-lockdown\">France</a> of around 20%. \u201cCriminals are humans too,\u201d said Graeme Biggar, economic crimes lead at the NCA, \u201cand they are abiding by the rules.\u201d He added that a disproportionately high percentage of the agency\u2019s organised crime targets suffer from underlying medical conditions and are taking self-isolation seriously.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the first sign that organised crime was adjusting to the new circumstances was to be found on the internet. Online crime has been rising steadily for some years now but Covid-19 is accelerating the trend. Just two weeks into lockdown the NCA reported a huge increase in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52310804\">Covid-19-related scamming sites</a>: 70,000 sprang up, selling everything from personal protective equipment and hand gel to snake-oil remedies. These goods were either stolen, counterfeit or non-existent, ie simple scams to lure cash from people desperate to protect themselves from the virus.</p> <p>The shift to working from home has placed a strain on IT security teams. A company office will have a well-defined network perimeter that security engineers can monitor easily. At home, employees may be sharing sensitive data with their main system across routers through which their teenagers are downloading dodgy content. This drastically multiplies the vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit to enter a company\u2019s system. This in turn increases the threat from ransomware, malware that can lock computer files and open them only on payment of a ransom.</p> <p>In Italy, where the lockdown was much more rigorously enforced than here, Covid-19 contributed to an unexpected success in the fight against organised crime. On 12 March, police noticed a car driving to an abandoned house near Locri on the Calabrian coast. That evening they spotted the light from a cigarette and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11175733/wanted-mafia-godfather-busted-coronavirus-lockdown-smoke/\">raided the property</a> to discover 42-year-old Cesare Antonio Cord\u00ec, a senior boss of Calabria\u2019s notorious crime group, the \u2018Ndrangheta, and one of Europe\u2019s most wanted men.</p> <p>Law enforcement officers around the world need no reminding that the initial hiatus in activity was always going to be temporary: major political or economic crises represent a huge opportunity for organised crime. A pandemic with a cataclysmic impact on the global economy is the jackpot. There is massive disruption to supplies of all manner of goods and services both licit and illicit, which leads to dizzying growth in the black market. This in turn generates secondary markets in counterfeit and fake products.</p> <p>This combines with a second catalyst: the resources of the state, including the police, are being diverted to cope with the consequences of the disease. While officers are busy stopping members of the public from congregating in parks, they have less time to track down criminals. Meanwhile, in countries where the state is weak and unable to provide essential goods and services to distressed communities, organised crime will step into the vacuum. There is already plenty of evidence that this is taking place across <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200502-faced-with-the-covid-19-crisis-the-italian-mafia-sees-business-opportunities\">southern Italy</a>, the favelas of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/latin-american-criminal-gangs-helping-battle-covid-19-outbreaks-200507104108199.html\">Brazil</a> and the extensive territories controlled by the Mexican drugs cartels.</p> <p>The other major activity the major Italian mafias have been engaging in from the start is money-lending. Nicola Gratteri investigates the \u2018Ndrangheta in Calabria. <a href=\"https://www.ansa.it/documents/1587677637600_ItalianConnection.pdf\">Talking to the Global Initiative against Organised Crime</a> last month, he explained that \u201cthe usurers from the \u2018Ndrangheta initially come in with offers of low interest rates, because their end goal is to take over the business, via usury, and use it to launder their illicit proceeds.\u201d It\u2019s a watertight business model because, as Gratteri added: \u201cTheir collateral is the borrower\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-mafia-taking-care-of-everyones-business-in-pandemic\">Why the mafia are taking care of everyone's business</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The weakness of state structures is critical for criminals involved in one of the most damaging trades of all, the trafficking in endangered wildlife species. An early theory about the virus was that it originated with pangolins whose meat is illegally sold in Chinese wet markets. A critically endangered species, these weirdly beautiful creatures\u2019 protective scales, made from keratin, are used in traditional Chinese medicine, despite having no pharmaceutical properties. Along with rhino horn (also keratin, just like our finger nails), ivory and tiger bones, hundreds of tons of pangolin scales have been seized by authorities in China, Laos and Vietnam in the past three years.</p> <p>The Wildlife Justice Commission in The Hague, which maintains a remarkable intelligence network tracking the trade, has warned that criminals are stockpiling material and that lockdown is allowing poachers in sub-Saharan Africa a free rein. There is an overwhelming moral and environmental case for a multilateral effort to stifle this business. It is also worth remembering that Ebola, HIV, Sars, H1N1, Mers and Sars-CoV-2 are all reportedly zoonotic diseases, which jumped species because of intense proximity between humans and the original carriers. We must now recognise a hitherto relatively unimportant branch of organised criminal activity has the capacity to bring the entire world to a standstill.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Misha Glenny is the author of McMafia, </em><em>and a Fellow at the Berggruen Institute thinktank</em></p>",

  "<p>The failure to consider air pollution as a factor in the higher rates of coronavirus deaths among minority ethnic groups is \u201castonishing\u201d and \u201cwholly irresponsible\u201d, according to critics of a Public Health England review.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/calls-mount-for-public-inquiry-into-uk-bame-covid-19-death-rate\">PHE report</a> released on Tuesday confirmed the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on people from ethnic minorities but did not mention air pollution.

The review therefore wrongly projects the idea that [minority ethnic] communities may be more susceptible to coronavirus, when it should instead say they are put into harm\u2019s way by living in more polluted areas and by being overrepresented amongst frontline workers.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Jonathan Grigg, of Queen Mary University of London, a member of the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants, which advises the government, said: \u201cAir pollution absolutely should be part of the consideration. It\u2019s entirely plausible [and] we should at least ask the question.</p> <p>\u201cYou might get a double hit\u201d from long- and short-term exposure to dirty air,\u201d he said. \u201c[Exposed groups] will have a vulnerability due to air pollution coming into Covid, so it will contribute to some extent, but it is difficult to say to what extent.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Francesca Dominici, of Harvard University in the US, also said pollution was an important factor. \u201cWe have a large body of evidence that health risks associated with air pollution exposure are higher among ethnic minorities.\u201d Her research has shown that even a small increase in previous pollution exposure is <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502v2\">linked to an 8% rise in Covid-19 deaths</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The PHE report was heavily criticised for a lack of recommendations on how to reduce the disproportionate impact among people from ethnic minorities and for removing a section detailing responses from third parties, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/03/censorship-row-over-report-on-uk-bame-covid-19-deaths\">many of whom highlighted structural racism</a>. On Thursday the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52913539\">rejected claims that \u201csystemic injustice\u201d</a> was the reason for the disparities. Scientists say it is unlikely that any genetic factors play a major role.</p> <p>Badenoch said it was clear \u201cthat much more needs to be done to understand the key drivers of the disparities\u201d, and said PHE did not make recommendations because the data needed was not available. On Friday the Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/uk-equality-watchdog-to-launch-inquiry-into-entrenched-racism\">carry out an in-depth analysis</a> and develop urgent recommendations to address the loss of lives of people from ethnic minorities.</p> <p>A PHE spokeswoman said: \u201cThe review looked at factors including age, sex, geography, ethnicity, occupation and deprivation. These were set out in the <a href=\"https://khub.net/documents/135939561/287909059/COVID-19+Impact+Review+ToRs.pdf/611bea2c-0cbe-4c71-57fe-abfeccdbf273?t=1588688788954\">terms of reference for the work</a>.

The data shows the affected groups transcend the classical definitions of both race and ethnicity. That is not to say when we examine all the data in the future we will not find a very tiny sub-population with a mutation which makes them more susceptible. But many find it easier to use race rather than racism as an explanation, partly because you can link it to something inherent in the victims.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/genetics-bame-people-die-coronavirus-structural-racism\">Genetics is not why more BAME people die of coronavirus: structural racism is | Winston Morgan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dominici said: \u201cI really doubt that genetic factors play a bigger role than environmental and societal factors and racism.\u201d</p> <p>Issy Bray, a health statistics expert at the University of the West of England, said: \u201cWe cannot rule it out, as other diseases do affect certain ethnic groups for genetic reasons, eg sickle cell anaemia. However, it is already clear that the relationship between ethnicity and risk of coronavirus is at least partially explained by a range of societal factors, and it is these inequalities that we should be tackling.\u201d</p> <p>The scientists said the influence of air pollution could be singled out if carefully analysed alongside other important factors such as population density, deprivation, occupation and obesity, ideally using data on individuals. Bray said smartphone apps that monitor symptoms could be useful by providing large amounts of personal and location data.</p>",
  "<p>Even before the arrival of Covid-19, the future for Britain\u2019s high streets looked bleak. For at least two decades there has been talk of how town centres need to be rethought. The pandemic has made the need for action critical.</p> <p>The next few weeks are not going to be a problem. Consumers, having been cooped up for so long, will be out in force when non-essential stores open for business on 15 June. Even though consumer confidence is extremely low, the lack of spending opportunities since the country went into hibernation in late March means that many people are both cash rich and in need of some retail therapy. High streets will get the benefit of a post-lockdown sugar rush.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak</a> has provided help for the retail sector by providing grants, a business rates holiday, a deferral of VAT payments and wage subsidies for furloughed workers. These, though, are only short-term fixes from the chancellor. The VAT still has to be paid; the business rates holiday will end; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">furlough scheme is being wound up</a> at the end of October.</p> <p>Before too long, the old familiar problems \u2013 and some new ones \u2013 will need to be addressed. Problem number one is that the shift of big retailers to edge of town locations has meant there is excess retail capacity in many high streets. Put simply, in many town centres there are now far too many shops given the amount of spending that is actually taking place.</p> <p>Problem number two is digital disruption: the ever-increasing share of spending that is happening online. The future of the traditional department store looks bleak because any consumer can have the department-store experience on their laptop or smart phone, only with lower prices and without the inconvenience of getting the bus into town or finding somewhere to park the car.</p> <p>Problem number three is that even those consumers who were late adopters to the idea of online shopping have now had a taste of it during the lockdown. Retailers fear that even those who like the physical pleasure of leafing through the books in Waterstones or trying on a dress in Jigsaw will bridle at having to mask up if they want to use public transport and wait in a socially distanced queue before they can be safely admitted to a shop. Given how easy the alternative is, those fears are well-merited.</p> <p>The outlook is bleaker in towns than in big cities, and bleakest of all in the old industrial towns, where the hollowing out of manufacturing in the 1980s has been followed out by the hollowing out of retailing in the past two decades. Getting town centres humming again is central not just to economic regeneration but to improving wellbeing. The boarded-up shops, the pawnbrokers and the fast food outlets, according to a paper on England\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/publications/townscapes-englands-health-inequalities/\">health inequalities by the Bennett school of public policy</a> at Cambridge University, are closely linked to their inhabitants\u2019 health outcomes.</p> <p>The paper found that the built environment of towns, including the provision of green spaces and the kind of retail options they provided, made a real difference to life expectancy, prevalence of lung cancer and levels of obesity among children. In the more deprived towns, the previous upward trend in life expectancy had stalled or even gone into reverse.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of a higher incidence of Covid-19 in the poorer parts of the country, the authors of the paper conclude: \u201cThere is an overriding need for policies to address the large and widening gaps in the health and economic fortunes of many towns, and these should be integral to the \u2018levelling up\u2019 and economic recovery agendas.\u201d</p> <p>Thus far, it has to be said, there doesn\u2019t appear to be much of an economic recovery agenda. There is plenty of crisis management going on and a sense that the government is responding to events rather than planning for the future. Hence the weekend talk of speeding up the reopening of the hospitality sector because of fears of massive job losses.</p> <p>The wartime coalition government found time to commission the Beveridge report, rethink education policy and sketch out plans for post-war full employment. A similar approach will be needed to reinvigorate town centres as part of a wider regeneration programme.</p> <p>Some things are obvious. In most parts of the country, town centres will be about more than retail. Instead, the idea should be to make the middle of towns and smaller cities places were people live and work, not just shop. That would help in two ways: it would reduce the average age of the population, and it would encourage the growth of businesses to cater for the demands of young, working people with money to spend.</p> <p>Nicholas Falk, who founded Urbed in the 1970s \u2013 a consultancy that specialises in urban development and regeneration \u2013 made a number of suggestions that would make a difference, noted in a recent article for the <a href=\"https://journal.academyofurbanism.org.uk/news/reinventing-town-centres/\">Academy of Urbanism journal</a>. These included the redevelopment of redundant retail space and surplus car parks into homes, workplaces and community hubs or social spaces. Local authorities, he says, should take over key buildings if they lie empty too long, as happened in bomb-damaged Comprehensive Development Areas after the second world war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhere town centre development is no longer viable, retailing will have to contract so better uses can take over. This requires government to play a more proactive role. Publicly owned land could be pooled, as it is in Copenhagen and Hamburg, with compulsory purchase orders used as a threat.\u201d</p> <p>All sensible stuff. What is needed is a government strategy for urban regeneration that involves the devolution of both power and money to a local level, plus a recognition that the time to act is now.</p>",

For seven agonising weeks I cut my diet, trained three times a week and shed 12kg of flab, which culminated in having hi-res topless shots of myself being printed in this very magazine. Suddenly, the world could see my jaunty little man boobs at their most taut and preened. At least a thousand of those people were shown them by me after I\u2019d produced my phone and flicked between \u2018fat me\u2019 and \u2018toned me\u2019 in a casual, humble kind of way that was probably very charming.</p> <p>But what then? How was I to maintain this fitness without the motivation provided by the threat of another newspaper spread of my reincarnated flab? I suggested to my editors that they commit to printing a full page picture of my body every six months or so \u2018to keep me interested\u2019, but they stopped answering my emails, and in the end I found that running was the one thing I could stand doing. Even though I can\u2019t really stand it at all.</p> <p>So I run, alone, on a deserted and uneven patch of ground beside a rugby pitch. It\u2019s painful, tedious and tiring, but in the end it has rewards. Not least in challenging me to write about a boring experience in a way that isn\u2019t boring itself. Perhaps fatherhood has trained me for fitness after all.</p> <p><em>Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Frustrated by the returns offered by high street banks and even further frustrated by being forced to stay indoors as a result of the lockdown, investors are looking in unique places to salt away their money. Memorabilia, antiques and other collectibles have seen a mini boom in the last few months. Those with spare cash have been trying to get some positive returns as they have the time to search for opportunities.</p> <p>But while the want is clearly there \u2013 antique auction website thesaleroom.com reports demand up by almost a fifth \u2013 there is the potential for problems. With no regulation and a prevalence of scams, alternative investments could lead to huge losses. Even if you do decide to sell them on, you need to find someone else to buy that unique piece of football memorabilia. For others, looking at rates of barely above zero, the risk is worth it.</p> <h2><strong>Memorabilia&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Perhaps it is having more time on their hands or the fact that some have taken a fresh look at their mortality since the pandemic took hold but there has been a renewed sense of nostalgia about in recent weeks.</p> <p>Tom Meyrick at Paul Fraser Collectibles has seen heightened demand for football memorabilia from 1966 when England won the World Cup, as well as items associated with icons of the 1980s and 1990s. A menu signed by all 11 England players from the winning World Cup lineup recently sold online for \u00a33,950.</p> <p>\u201cA big growth area is the period that appeals to Generation X \u2013 those who grew up in the 1970s, 80s and early 90s. Kurt Cobain and Steve Jobs\u2019 autographs, Star Wars figures and vintage video games are popular,\u201d says Meyrick. \u201cThis generation \u2013 now in their 40s and 50s \u2013 have more disposable income and are looking back fondly on their youth.\u201d</p> <p>Savvy purchases can reap rewards. Liam Stacy of Movie Figures, which sells high-end movie and action figures, says many buyers are looking for potential investments. \u201cThe Hot Toys Marvel and Star Wars hand-painted statues sell out fast \u2013 The Mandalorian and The Child deluxe model has been a favourite, costing \u00a3355, and is likely to increase in value,\u201d he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Only trade with reputable dealers with a track record. \u201cUnfortunately fraudsters have used the lockdown as a chance to sell more fakes online,\u201d says Garry King of Autographs.co.uk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9d3593f8ef52f1a518f4c5f09d0b835a6df1fede\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d3593f8ef52f1a518f4c5f09d0b835a6df1fede/17_0_1639_2048/800.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Smith with his boxing memorabilia.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Smith with his boxing memorabilia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Colin Smith from Bournemouth used the lockdown to add to his collection of boxing memorabilia, buying a signed Muhammad Ali belt from the US for \u00a3800. He also has a signed Ali glove (bought for \u00a3500) and one signed by the Four Kings of Boxing \u2013 Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns and Roberto Dur\u00e1n \u2013 worth \u00a3650. \u201cFor me, this is a passion. You have to trust who you are dealing with,\u201d says Smith.</p> <h2><strong>Antiques</strong></h2> <p>Antique sales and auctions shifted online during the lockdown while maintaining interest from punters. \u201cOur website had a record number of inquiries in May. Dealers also report the average age of buyers has fallen,\u201d says Robert Young of the British Antique Dealers\u2019 Association (Bada), who believes people are also looking to antiques in a reaction against the \u201cthrow-away society\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBuyers are looking for quality materials \u2013 furniture that will last. It\u2019s not just about finding something rare that will rise in value,\u201d says Young. \u201cThese buyers are comfortable and confident doing their research and buying online. One recent trend is for funky, textured materials and metals, such as bronze.\u201d</p> <p>Items attracting an unlikely amount of interest has been glassware. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen huge demand, such as Baxter Whitefriars\u2019 coloured glass. Popular pieces, such as drunken bricklayer vases, were worth \u00a3130 but they have tripled in value in recent months,\u201d says auctioneer Richard Winterton.</p> <h2><strong>Vintage jewellery&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Nicola Whittaker at Fellows Auctioneers reports a \u201cstaggering increase\u201d in bidders for watches and jewellery, with items from \u00a330 to \u00a360,000.</p> <p>\u201cBuy something in impeccable condition, not damaged or restored,\u201d says Sandra Cronan, a specialist in rare and antique jewellery. \u201cTimeless classics, such as a pair of diamond earrings, are a good option. A pair of antique one-carat diamond earrings bought for about \u00a33,000 could rise by 10% to 20% over five years. There will always be buyers for classic items.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a big return in popularity of the brooch. One we sold recently had an estimate of \u00a3400-\u00a3500 but, after intense bidding, it went for \u00a32,296,\u201d says Whittaker.</p> <h2><strong>Fine wine&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Many have coped by drinking more during lockdown but for some wine enthusiasts, recent years have been profitable. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 100, the global fine wine index, shows growth of 23% over the past five years, although performance can be volatile.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gary Owen at wine merchant Berry Bros and Rudd, says many clients have used the lockdown to review their investments. \u201cWe store wine for our investors, but some have taken delivery to drink during the lockdown. Others have seen it as a buying or selling opportunity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b35cffd4ad955c756f6918778815a7bd50eadf3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b35cffd4ad955c756f6918778815a7bd50eadf3e/0_448_2007_2506/801.jpg\" alt=\"Rare bottles of champagne can fetch very high prices.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rare bottles of champagne can fetch very high prices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Wenig/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Will Hargrove at trader Corney &amp; Barrow says some fine wine prices have softened in recent months and investors have taken advantage.</p> <p>Investment should be viewed in the long term \u2013 five years minimum \u2013 to get best returns, with many holding them for decades.</p> <p>Owen says champagne from 2002 and 2008 from houses such as Dom P\u00e9rignon and Krug are a solid investment as it is an excellent vintage and should rise in value. Three magnums of 2008 Dom P\u00e9rignon would cost about \u00a3930 \u201cin bond\u201d \u2013 stored in optimum conditions by the wine merchant. There is no duty or VAT to pay. Some fine wine dealers offer cellar plans, where you can build a portfolio investing from \u00a350 or \u00a3100 a month, and the wine is held in bond.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Art&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Buying art to make money is risky. Tastes and fashions change over time and are hard to predict. That said, contemporary art, in particular, has fared well in recent years.&nbsp;</p> <p>Joe Kennedy, co-founder of Unit London, a gallery that champions contemporary artists, says social media has made it much easier to research up-and-coming talent.</p> <p>\u201cYou can follow galleries and artists on Instagram. There is much greater transparency on price. You can see which artists the galleries are supporting, which gives an indication of what might rise in value. I was selling work by Julie Curtiss a few years ago for around \u00a33,000, for example, and she is now being represented by White Cube gallery and her work sells for hundreds of thousands of pounds.\u201d</p> <p>The Affordable Art Fair, which has three sales in London each year, is another good place for first-time buyers. \u201cAll work is capped at \u00a36,000 and you can pick up original work and limited-edition prints from around \u00a3100,\u201d says Elizabeth Dellert, UK Fair director.</p> <h2><strong>What you need to know</strong></h2> <p><strong>Fees \u2013 </strong>If you buy at auction there will be fees to pay (typically about 20%) and then postage or transportation costs.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Buyer beware</strong> \u2013 Fraud and scams are rife. Ask to see condition reports and any provenance history, where appropriate. There is no regulation in these markets, which means little recourse if things go wrong.</p> <p><strong>Maintenance</strong> - If it is an artwork or autograph that is going to be on display, it is advisable to use specialist glass that will protect the image from sunlight.</p> <p><strong>Tax</strong> \u2013 There could be capital gains tax (CGT) to pay when you sell, depending on the item and the profit made. Individuals have a \u00a312,300 CGT allowance so the tax only applies once your profit exceeds this threshold. Some \u201cwasting assets\u201d are exempt, such as classic cars and antique clocks. <br></p>",
  "<p>I picked up Dara McAnulty\u2019s <em>Diary of a Young Naturalist</em> with a degree of trepidation. It\u2019s a hard thing to review the work of a teenager, harder still when his writing has been praised effusively by nature writers and naturalists alike. The diligent reviewer feels the need to balance kindness with serious critical examination, to see past the novelty of the backstory. McAnulty\u2019s book follows a year in his life \u2013 from spring equinox to spring equinox, from his 14th to 15th birthday \u2013 as he and his family move from their home in County Fermanagh to a new life on the other side of Northern Ireland, in the shadow of the Mourne Mountains in County Down.</p> <p>Four of the five members of McAnulty\u2019s family are non-neurotypical \u2013 only Dara\u2019s conservationist father isn\u2019t autistic. McAnulty was diagnosed with autism and Asperger\u2019s as a child and his condition is intimately tied up in both his writing and his interest in nature. His prose is both spirited and spiritual, performing an intensive phenomenological survey of the wildlife around his home, bringing the reader into deep, occasionally uncomfortably close communion with the insects, plants and, above all, the birds of Northern Ireland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Any concerns I had about McAnulty\u2019s book were dissolved by the first few pages of careful, lyrical, closely observed nature writing. McAnulty admits halfway through the book that he doesn\u2019t \u201chave a joy filter\u201d and the depth of his feeling illuminates every page of this miraculous memoir. It\u2019s a book that succeeds in describing the deep and complex pleasure of immersion in nature, written by an author who describes himself as having \u201cthe heart of a naturalist, the head of a would-be scientist, and bones of someone already wearied by the apathy and destruction wielded against the natural world\u201d. Comparisons with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\">Greta Thunberg</a> have been made, and Chris Packham is a fan and an obvious touchstone, but I reached back further for a point of reference. I was reminded repeatedly while reading <em>Diary of a Young Naturalist</em> of the work of the great <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Hudson\">WH Hudson</a> \u2013 a brilliant and eccentric nature writer who lived and wrote with the same deep and authentic sense of emotional engagement with nature as McAnulty.</p> <p>The move from the west of the country to its eastern edges prompts a psychological crisis for McAnulty. He finds change difficult and the loss of his favourite local nature spots \u2013 particularly the reserve at <a href=\"https://discovernorthernireland.com/Big-Dog-Forest-Big-Dog-Walk-P23397/\">Big Dog Forest</a> \u2013 is felt as a kind of wound. The story of the book is how the triumvirate of family, books and, above all, nature, conspire to help drag McAnulty out of his slump.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His portrait of loving parents raising three neurodivergent children on poetry, punk and puffins is profoundly moving</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>McAnulty describes his family as \u201cclose as otters\u201d, and the portrait he draws of loving, enlightened, unconventional parents raising three neurodivergent children on a diet of poetry, punk and puffins is profoundly moving. This is also a book about the power of books to shape vision, and McAnulty regularly invokes the work of Seamus Heaney to help him summon up his world. There\u2019s a lovely passage where he listens to a blackbird and then the blackbird stops singing. He feels the loss of the song and finds that he can only recover the beauty of the voice in literature: \u201cbooks helped bridge my blackbird dream\u2026 reading taught me that the blackbird would come back\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>The most powerful passages in the book, though, are about McAnulty\u2019s ecstatic moments of self-dissolution in the natural world. He longs for family trips to Rathlin Island, where there are seabird colonies and seals, although his time there is shadowed by the knowledge that he will have to return to his suburban home. He describes in galloping, joyful prose a field trip to survey goshawks in Scotland.</p> <p>McAnulty is fiercely attuned to his own moods, and at a time when we\u2019re increasingly aware of the health benefits of the outdoors, his ability to medicate with nature strikes a powerful chord: \u201cmy head is pretty hectic most of the time, and watching daphnia, beetles, pond skaters and dragonfly nymphs is a medicine for this overactive brain\u201d. A few hours reading this intimate, sensitive, deeply felt memoir had the same effect on me, lifting my spirits and giving me a great deal of hope for the future, simply that young people like Dara McAnulty are alive and writing in the world.</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;<em>Diary of a Young Naturalist</em>&nbsp;by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Toller Books (\u00a316).

  "<p>Last month, with more time at home than usual, Charlotte Harris, one half of the landscape design duo <a href=\"https://www.harrisbugg.com/\" title=\"\">Harris Bugg</a>, decided to dig up her paved front garden in Newham, east London. \u201cIt was a discussion we\u2019d been having for a while,\u201d says Harris, who gardens with her girlfriend Catriona Knox. They\u2019d already removed the paving from the back garden of their house, which is in a densely populated area of the city undergoing vast amounts of regeneration. \u201cAround here every bit of green space feels precious,\u201d she says. \u201cObviously there are parks, but I think each of us has to take responsibility for any space we have.\u201d</p> <p>As you\u2019d expect in a city, the new front garden needs to work hard to accommodate bins, bikes and a composting hot bin, but Harris is determined to plant as much as possible in the rest of the space, including a small tree (on the shortlist are a Sichuan pepper tree, hawthorn or a Chinese fringe tree) underplanted with perennials and bulbs.</p> <p>In an area where 50% of the front gardens have no plants, the ones that do provide moments of joy. Harris\u2019s neighbours include a couple who boast \u201cthe most beautiful magnolia\u201d in their shady spot, while on the opposite side another front garden has been turned over to an abundant veg patch complete with frames and climbing squash. \u201cThey were the inspiration, really,\u201d adds Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s the ultimate in gardening altruism, because your back garden is for you to enjoy, but your front garden is about improving everyone\u2019s experience.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past couple of months, the front garden has gained a powerful new significance. For many it has become the point of contact \u2013 a socially distanced greeting over the garden gate, a conversation with friends or family delivering supplies, or catching up with a neighbour you\u2019d hardly spoken to before. It has become a safe place where you could still engage with the outside world or join in community events, such as clapping for carers. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07275b943cb737fb39b4a70855f31dab7c16f27f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07275b943cb737fb39b4a70855f31dab7c16f27f/0_618_6200_6649/932.jpg\" alt=\"On our doorstep: neighbours Casey, Mike, Noreen and Wolfgang at the Railway Cottages in north London.\" width=\"932\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On our doorstep: neighbours Casey, Mike, Noreen and Wolfgang at the Railway Cottages in north London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Earlier this year, before Covid-19 struck, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) highlighted this vital social space when it announced its <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/news/2020/rhs-garden-for-friendship\" title=\"\">Garden for Friendship, which was due to be unveiled at the Chelsea Flower Show in May</a>. Designed by <a href=\"https://www.jothompson-garden-design.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Jo Thompson</a>, the scheme was based on an urban street with verdant balconies and window boxes filled with annuals, roses and beautiful multi-stem trees, as well as herbs and vegetables that could be shared with neighbours and friends. During the planning stages the RHS conducted a survey on gardening\u2019s ability to combat loneliness, which found that it was the young who were suffering most, with 68% of 18 to 24-year-olds surveyed having felt lonely compared to 41% of over-55s. This semi-public space, the RHS argued, could help enormously.</p> <p>\u201cFront garden spaces are so important,\u201d says Thompson, whose concept was partly inspired by communal spaces in Italy with their clusters of pots and window boxes as well as the famously verdant Bonnington Square, in Vauxhall, south London. \u201cThey provide a common interest, a starting point for talking. But it also gives you the chance to be in the presence of people even if you don\u2019t want to talk \u2013 just seeing someone is good for you.\u201d</p> <p>Thompson chose plants that were easy and accessible including an exuberant mix of annuals \u2013 poppies, nemesia, cornflowers \u2013 that can be grown quickly from a \u00a32 packet of seeds, and imagined that her gardens\u2019 owners could leave out their excess flowers or produce \u2013 bunches of sweetpeas, punnets of tomatoes or a few courgettes. \u201cThat generosity, whether it\u2019s sharing things or just knowledge, is so important,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cMore people are walking locally at the moment and they really do appreciate something pretty to look at. It lifts the spirits and changes the whole feel of a house and area,\u201d says designer Alexander Hoyle, who creates gardens for private clients as well as displays for firms such as Herm\u00e8s and Sibyl Colefax &amp; John Fowler. He regularly posts images of his extraordinary flagstoned front garden on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alexander.hoyle/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram</a>, charting its evolution through the seasons via an assemblage of chunky rattan planters, cast iron window boxes and trees, shrubs and roses. \u201cOutdoor space in cities is at a premium, so why not use all you\u2019ve got?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aecda77f8794ac680792c12c4eceb4d6d450255f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aecda77f8794ac680792c12c4eceb4d6d450255f/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gardener and writer Arthur Parkinson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gardener and writer Arthur Parkinson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Parkinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, the gardener and writer Arthur Parkinson uses his family\u2019s front garden in Nottinghamshire for a year-round display in dolly tubs and galvanised baths (the shadier back garden is managed by his mum). Earlier this year his tulip extravaganza in rich Venetian colours was such a hit, it had its own segment on <em>Gardeners\u2019 World</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s really a defence against these dead zones of paving and Astroturf,\u201d says Parkinson of his exuberant patch that is also a wildlife magnet. \u201cPeople catch a glimpse of it and smile, and I hope it encourages them to just get pots and grow like mad.\u201d Now that the spring bulbs are finished, he is busy creating a fresh display using snapdragons (the Sonnet series), <em>Helichrysum</em> \u2018Dragon Fire\u2019 and \u2018Apricot Peach\u2019 as well as sunflowers, dahlias, sweetpeas and the gorgeous cup and saucer vine, <em>Cobaea scandens</em>. In other words a t jungle of colourful planting that gives him a sense of privacy from his close neighbours.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Dorset Road, north London, a Victorian terrace of railway cottages originally built for workers at the nearby Alexandra Palace station, typifies how cottage garden style can work in urban settings. With fragrant herbs and shrubs, climbing roses, honeysuckles and, in some cases, raised beds for veg growing, these picturesque gardens are a soothing, restorative and sometimes productive antidote to city life. They are also great sources of inspiration and in a normal year this row of friends and neighbours would be opening collectively for the <a href=\"https://ngs.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Garden Scheme</a>. This year would have been Dorset Road\u2019s 12th year and they\u2019ve raised almost \u00a315,000 for the NGS\u2019s charitable causes, which include <a href=\"https://www.mariecurie.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Marie Curie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macmillan.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Macmillan Cancer Support</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"827c6a656d9058eed219a83fd8fac92aded9eb4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/827c6a656d9058eed219a83fd8fac92aded9eb4d/0_0_6200_8272/750.jpg\" alt=\"Full bloom: Cathy, north London\u2019s Railway Cottages.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Full bloom: Cathy, north London\u2019s Railway Cottages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At this time of year, Instagram is rich with inspiration from other people\u2019s gardens, as wisteria, clematis, honeysuckle and climbing roses flower in succession across the best-dressed homes. Front gardens, of course, have long been a source of pride, from formal Victorian townhouses to the sweeping front lawns of suburbia or the garden cities, such as Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City that emerged in the first half of the 20th century. \u201cThe front garden was traditionally where you showed the world your best face,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/education-learning/staffprofile?ID=283\" title=\"\">Fiona Davison</a>, head of libraries and exhibitions at the RHS. \u201cAnd our version of what a front garden should be is very coloured by the Victorian ideal of a romanticised cottage garden.\u201d</p> <p>As the suburbs developed in the 20th century it was labour-intensive bedding plants, such as petunias or exotic cannas and monkey puzzle trees, that were all the rage. \u201cThese were gardens where people would demonstrate their wealth, taste and respectability,\u201d adds Davison. In other words, keeping up appearances.</p> <p>But the effects of these cared-for spaces on a sense of pride, community and wellbeing are huge. The RHS is currently trying to quantify the impact of front gardens with a controlled study in which the residents of one Salford terraced street are given money and advice to do up their front gardens. The study will monitor the mood and perceptions of those who pass by, as well as residents.</p> <p>In the past few decades, as car ownership has rocketed, the front garden has been usurped by characterless parking spaces. These grey areas are not just a depressing eyesore, they increase urban temperatures and diminish biodiversity by removing plants and habitat (in 2017 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/16/urban-butterfly-declines-69-compared-to-45-drop-countryside\" title=\"\">study</a> found that over the previous 20 years, butterfly numbers had fallen by 69% in built-up areas). Five years ago, when the RHS announced its <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/get-involved/greening-great-britain\" title=\"\">Greening Grey Britain</a> campaign, a quarter of our front gardens had already been paved over for parking.</p> <p>Covering front gardens with impermeable paving or concrete also contributes to flooding hotspots. When there are no borders, hedges and trees to soak up surface water it all drains into a system that was never designed to take such high volumes. In Edinburgh alone, around 11.3 hectares of green land (the equivalent to 15 football pitches) are lost each year, partly from the paving of private gardens. In 2018, researchers at Heriot-Watt university published a report on how valuable front gardens are in controlling surface water run-off and advised that homeowners should be encouraged to de-pave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec87b2aa2e12d82fdf503a5ec045974096d6212b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec87b2aa2e12d82fdf503a5ec045974096d6212b/0_2629_6200_5643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street views: Eddy and Jane, Railways Cottages.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"910\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street views: Eddy and Jane, Railways Cottages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Community groups, such as the <a href=\"http://www.ealingfrontgardens.org.uk/home-page\" title=\"\">Ealing Front Gardens Project</a>, have formed to educate homeowners about the devastating environmental effects of paving; in 2017 they surveyed two years\u2019 worth of pavement crossover applications in Ealing and found that 79% of these gardens had been almost entirely paved over. Last year grants were introduced to install home-charging points for electric vehicles, a green initiative but one which will further encourage front-garden paving. The car isn\u2019t going anywhere, but there are ways to accommodate plants, wildlife and vehicles much more harmoniously. Jo Thompson has recently completed a gravelled front garden in the seaside town of Camber that has scattered, low-growing plants that can exist alongside cars. The plants seed themselves over time and create a more naturalistic look. </p> <p>What is certain is that the lockdown has given many of us time to take a look at the world on our doorsteps, whether we are lucky enough to have our own front garden or simply to look out and admire someone else\u2019s hard work. \u201cWhen I walk up the path of my neighbours\u2019 garden that\u2019s beautifully planted and green and cool I just think how much better you would feel if you came home to it each evening,\u201d says Charlotte Harris. \u201cWhat gardens have taught us during this time is how important they are at lifting our spirits and genuinely giving us all pleasure.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d722b378d4d3b5364ad7a81775f208cd471add2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d722b378d4d3b5364ad7a81775f208cd471add2/0_196_5557_3334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garden designer Alexander Hoyle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garden designer Alexander Hoyle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boz Green</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Designer Alexander Hoyle\u2019s top tips for front gardens</h2> <p><strong>Focus on structure </strong>Think about evergreen foliage and seasonal interest. If you can only plant a few things into soil, then plant hedging, and add containers with other things in them.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Nothing is low maintenance </strong>Do you have access to a tap or hose at the front? If not, choose slow-growing, drought-resistant plants, such as aeoniums, grasses, agave, succulents, lavender and rosemary (all of which will work equally well on <br>a sunny balcony).</p> <p><strong>Layer your plants </strong>Cover walls in climbers, such as clematis, honeysuckle or vines, add texture with grasses. Take the same approach to window boxes and choose trailing plants that will spread gracefully.</p> <p><strong>Create a focal point </strong>Plants with structure \u2013 melianthus, euphorbias, ferns, <em>Salix exigua</em> \u2013 provide a dynamic backdrop and will work equally well in pots.</p> <p><strong>Choose hard-working trees </strong>If you\u2019ve got space, choose a tree for year-round interest. Hawthorn and crab apples offer spring blossom, fruits, autumn colour and stay a good size or can be pruned into a desired shape.</p>",
  "<p>Art mirrors life, but it also works the other way round. Then again, sometimes there is little difference between the two. When David Tennant and Michael Sheen perform on screen together remotely this week, they will be playing the parts of actors who are trying to work from home against the odds. And appearing alongside them in <em>Staged</em>, a new <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/staged\">six-part comic drama</a> for BBC One, will be Georgia Tennant, who happens to be married to Tennant, and Anna Lundberg, who is locked down in Wales in real life with her partner, Sheen, and their new baby.</p> <p>The faces of the parents, partners and children of many household names have started to become familiar to viewers. When Chris Packham presented his scaled-down <em>Springwatch</em> on BBC Two this season, he did it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/an-opportunity-to-experts-urge-us-to-take-a-closer-look-at-nature-aoe\">alongside his stepdaughter</a>, the wildlife expert Megan McCubbin, while the comedian Romesh Ranganathan has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/10/we-never-visit-you-saw-us-three-days-ago-romesh-ranganathan-and-his-mum\">his mother, Shanthi</a>, up there on a screen beside him, the ultimate in reliable sidekicks, on BBC Two\u2019s hit topical show <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/19/tv-tonight-sally-wainwrights-irresistible-queer-period-drama\">The Ranganation</a></em>. And last month when Charlie Brooker presented a one-off side-swipe at current affairs on the same channel\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/14/charlie-brooker-antiviral-wipe-review-urgent-exasperated-perfection\">Antiviral Wipe</a></em>, his wife, Konnie Huq, handily provided a comic domestic cameo or two.</p> <p>In Huq\u2019s case, of course, the camera is no stranger. She began presenting <em>Blue Peter</em> at the age of 22. Georgia Tennant and Lundberg are also accustomed to performing. Lundberg, from Sweden, studied acting in London, and Tennant, as well as bringing up five children with her husband, has a television career. All the same, making <em>Staged</em> has been an exposing experiment.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted it to be as real as possible, but at the same time not too revealing of our own lives,\u201d said Tennant. \u201cAfter all, we are in our own house, filming it with our children around us. We are opening up before the nation, but you do want to retain something.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65a7e0ba741fb9cdddcd7483eb71d4f6d5891a70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65a7e0ba741fb9cdddcd7483eb71d4f6d5891a70/0_792_3840_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Romesh Ranganathan and his mother, Shanthi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Romesh Ranganathan and his mother, Shanthi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tennant, also one of the producers of the show, was born into acting, since her parents are Sandra Dickinson and Peter Davison, the other former Doctor from <em>Doctor Who</em> in her life. She has appeared on screen with her father before, but this time, opposite her husband, the stakes are higher since she portrays a version of her own life. The plot of <em>Staged</em>, written by Simon Evans and Phin Glynn, revolves around the efforts of the two men, Tennant and Sheen, to rehearse remotely for a West End show during lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cIn the first drafts of the script, I was much more supportive,\u201d she explained. \u201cDavid plays a more pathetic version of himself, and I just thought I would lose patience with him if he was like that. So I decided to play someone not as indulgent.\u201d</p> <p>The strategy also affords some protective distance from the relationship being displayed on screen.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to think about what to show of the house. Michael and Anna were much smarter than us though,\u201d said Tennant. \u201cThey cleverly set up their camera in one corner of their kitchen. But about a third of our stuff is done on iPhone, so moves all around the place. Some of the footage comes from quite strange places, as we had to find somewhere that wasn\u2019t occupied at that moment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10cbb00883324e4bd3b636f0c9aff1f9078ac339\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10cbb00883324e4bd3b636f0c9aff1f9078ac339/85_0_2701_1622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Packham with his stepdaughter Megan McCubbin on Springwatch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Packham with his stepdaughter Megan McCubbin on Springwatch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For other lockdown relatives of the famous, such as McCubbin, a zoolologist, facing a primetime television audience alongside her stepfather from the garden of their Hampshire home required a sudden change of gear. But the two seemed happy to tease each other. McCubbin had not been doing the washing up, Packham suggested. \u201cCome on, you can identify 46 UK ladybirds, but you don\u2019t even know where the saucepan lives,\u201d she parried.</p> <p>Meanwhile, online, a grateful nation has had cause to applaud another handy stand-in. When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/mar/24/why-35-million-people-want-joe-wicks-to-be-their-pe-teacher\">YouTube star Joe Wicks</a> hurt his hand and was unable to lead his daily exercise class, it was his wife, Rosie, who stepped up to the plate, with her husband on the sidelines. \u201cI\u2019ve had to call in a supply teacher,\u201d he posted online. \u201cRosie\u2019s kindly agreed to come on the livestream with me to demonstrate the moves as I really need to let my hand rest for a few days. It\u2019s totally out of her comfort zone, so I have got so much love and respect for her right now.\u201d</p> <p>For Ranganathan\u2019s mother, the learning curve has been approached at a sedate pace. She started working with her errant son on his BBC Three show <em>Asian Provocateur</em>, and now takes pride of place on an acclaimed lockdown adaptation of <em>The Ranganation</em>. Her brand of impromptu motherly disapproval shapes the programme\u2019s appeal, and her son admits she now presents a challenge. \u201cDoes it grate slightly when people go on about how naturally funny she is? Yes it does,\u201d he has said. \u201cBut she loves it, she loves getting recognised, and I\u2019m happy for her to be successful. Up to a point.\u201d</p> <p>And making the show work from behind the scenes is Debra Blenkinsop, director of operations at the production company Zeppotron. \u201cWe treat Shanthi more like one of the other invited star guests,\u201d she explained. Mrs Ranganathan gets makeup tutorials before the shoot and a direct feed from her home into the studio \u2013 set up in her son\u2019s garage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"463947b7cd050706bafc15ba8ed7aea9b08bcb02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/463947b7cd050706bafc15ba8ed7aea9b08bcb02/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosie and Joe Wicks on Good Morning Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosie and Joe Wicks on Good Morning Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe were helped by the nature of the show, and lucky that Romesh had a garage. You have to make sure the family are happy when you film in their home, and you have to keep neighbours informed too. We let them know when the trucks will be there,\u201d said Blenkinsop, who has speedily become an expert in lockdown production.</p> <p>On Friday, she shared her know-how in an online masterclass staged by <a href=\"https://www.screenskills.com/\">ScreenSkills</a> for those making unscripted television. \u201cWe set it all up meticulously, with specialist gear and gloves. Even the pizza for the crew has to be delivered to a station where the boxes are sanitised first.\u201d</p> <p>Blenkinsop suspects the family dynamic is essential to the mood of the show. \u201cIt is an insight into a tiny facet of the Ranganathans\u2019 lives, but they can choose what we see. It looks incredibly intimate.\u201d</p> <p>Also taking newfound screen fame in her stride is Grayson Perry\u2019s other half, the psychotherapist and writer Philippa Perry. The Turner prize-winning ceramicist has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/23/grayson-perry-launches-channel-4-art-club-to-battle-the-boredom-of-lockdown\">hosted </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/23/grayson-perry-launches-channel-4-art-club-to-battle-the-boredom-of-lockdown\">Art Club</a></em> for Channel 4 from his home studio, and his wife is there to cast an eye and join in with a weekly artistic challenge. Their presentation of home life, so apparently natural, is also a key to the tone of the show. Like <em>The Ranganation,</em> it puts the experiences and reactions of a selection of viewers at its heart, offering something inclusive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4856ab6a92542b8842128e6a6fadb11c99d2d2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4856ab6a92542b8842128e6a6fadb11c99d2d2f/0_189_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philippa and Grayson Perry on Art Club.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philippa and Grayson Perry on Art Club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CHANNEL 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen you are separated from society, you want to emphasise the common ground,\u201d said Georgia Tennant. \u201cYou see people on social media home-schooling with perfect hair. And I am not like that, so we left things as they are.</p> <p>\u201cYou become quite \u2018unvain\u2019, which is good. You can\u2019t worry about filming from the right angle, you just have to do it when you can.\u201d The process has also had mental health benefits, she suspects. \u201cWhen it has all been schooling the kids, which has been hideous, talking to the other producers felt like having some social life again.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><br>The menacing sight of heavily armoured US military vehicles and personnel seizing control of the streets is a familiar one for residents of Baghdad and Kabul. Last week, citizens of Washington and other American cities experienced similar treatment \u2013 at the hands of their own government.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s alarming over-reaction to the mostly lawful protests that followed George Floyd\u2019s death produced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/aclu-lawsuit-trump-protesters-church-white-house\">powerful backlash</a> among political and military leaders. It also highlighted increased US reliance, at home and abroad, on the aggressive use of force as a first resort.<br></p> <p>The militarisation of US police forces, and American society as a whole, is rooted in the response to the 9/11 attacks, when George W Bush plunged the country into a state of perpetual war. Paradoxically, his \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d intensified international and domestic insecurity.</p> <p>It sparked a huge, parallel expansion in the powers and reach of the homeland security apparatus. As <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/12/19/pentagon-finally-gets-its-2020-budget-from-congress/\">Pentagon spending</a> grew to a whopping $738bn this year, total <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/police-and-corrections-expenditures\">police and prison budgets</a> have also soared, reaching $194bn in 2017. About 18,000 law enforcement agencies employ 800,000 officers nationwide. Many are armed to the teeth.<br></p> <p>Deserving or not, members of the US armed forces are routinely described as heroes by Trump and others. Amid high levels of gun violence, many on the frontline of domestic law enforcement plainly feel they are worthy of similar status and protection.</p> <p>Yet when police officers are uniformed, equipped and armed like soldiers, it is unsurprising that they act with soldier-like impunity, treating civilians as the enemy in what Mark Esper, the defence secretary, calls the <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/06/01/secdef-encourages-governors-to-dominate-the-battlespace-to-put-down-nationwide-protests/\">urban \u201cbattlespace\u201d</a>. In the past week, there were multiple incidents of police combat and resulting gratuitous violence.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s panicky actions further blurred the line between military and civil power, by linking patriotism and militarism. He is not the first president to wrap himself in the flag. But this Vietnam draft-dodger who is commander-in-chief exhibits scant understanding of what fidelity to country and constitution means.</p> <p>Trump boasts about US military power and his bigger, better nuclear weapons. He sought personal legitimacy by hiring savvy generals such as HR McMaster and James Mattis, then rejected their advice. He recklessly threatens states such as North Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d. He mounts <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-48877172\">military parades</a> to glorify himself.<br></p> <p>But the problem is not simply Trump or the police. Since declaring cold war victory in 1991, an unfettered America has increasingly relied on the continuous projection of military force overseas, downgrading diplomacy, mediation and \u201csoft power\u201d approaches.</p> <p>This militarist mindset, ever focused on warfare, conflict and supremacy (or \u201cdomination\u201d, to quote Trump), has had an inevitably&nbsp;corrosive impact at home. The bill fell due last week.<br></p> <p>James Madison, one of the founding fathers, warned of the danger over 200 years ago. \u201cOf all the enemies to public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded \u2026 In war, the discretionary power of the executive is extended \u2026 No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/359542-of-all-the-enemies-to-public-liberty-war-is-perhaps\">Madison wrote</a>.<br></p> <p>The belief that unchecked militarism is inimical to liberty has been usefully explored in recent years by Andrew Bacevich, a Boston university historian and former army colonel and Vietnam veteran.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More dangerous is the damage to American leadership and the global cause of democratic governance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cToday as never before in their history, Americans are enthralled with military power,\u201d he wrote in his 2005 bestseller, <em><a href=\"https://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?id=569\">The New American Militarism</a></em>, which excoriated Bush\u2019s \u201cimmoral, illicit and imprudent\u201d Iraq invasion. The quest for supremacy always ended in degeneracy.<br></p> <p>\u201cAmerica will surely share the fate of all those who in ages past have looked to war and military power to fulfil their destiny. We will rob future generations of their rightful inheritance. We will wreak havoc abroad. We will endanger our security at home. We will risk the forfeiture of all that we prize,\u201d Bacevich warned.</p> <p>Neo-conservatives hated his message. But with present-day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/james-mattis-comdemns-trump-george-floyd-protests\">generals up in arms</a> about Trump\u2019s abuse of military power, and the nation enraged at the actions of paramilitary police, maybe the right is listening now.<br></p> <p>Patriotism and pride in one\u2019s country are not the issue here. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with saluting the flag and supporting the troops \u2013 or the police, if they do their job right.</p> <p>But when it becomes a fetish, when it\u2019s obligatory, when such natural instincts are hijacked by demagogues such as Trump, when militarism, ultra-nationalism and hateful jingoism, fuelling entrenched racism and xenophobia, take hold \u2013 that\u2019s when catastrophe looms.</p> <p>It renders the US a threat to itself and others, and weakens its global influence. Perhaps the police and social reforms urged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/obama-george-floyd-remarks-protests-trump\">Barack Obama</a> will gain traction as anger over Floyd subsides. Internationally, the harm done to US standing looks serious.<br></p> <p>Scornful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/mr-president-dont-go-hide-china-goads-us-over-george-floyd-protests\">Chinese and Russian claims of hypocrisy</a>, and the appalled reaction of allies in Europe, Canada and Australia, are galling but manageable. More dangerous is the damage to American leadership and the global cause of democratic governance.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s repressive action \u201cgives a tool to dictators, autocrats and thugs\u201d, Jake Sullivan, senior adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, told a <em>Foreign Policy</em> magazine webinar. \u201cIt leads them to believe they are righteous, that they don\u2019t have to listen to complaints about human rights, equality and democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Ironically, it also undermined US national security, Sullivan said. \u201cThe US cannot be a secure country if it is not capable of being a just and equal country.\u201d</p> <p>That warning was echoed by Richard Haass of the US Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe US is and appears to the world divided, diminished and distracted,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHard to believe we will not be challenged somewhere, somehow by someone wanting to take advantage of these circumstances. These are truly dangerous times.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, as a militarised America turns its fire on itself, outside enemies take aim.<br></p>",
  "<p>One of the more pertinent statements made during this past extraordinary week appeared in one of the last places I would have thought to look \u2013 in the pages of <em>Vogue</em>, not a publication I instinctively turn to at a moment of profound political tension.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cRacism is a global issue. Racism is a British issue. It is not one that is merely confined to the United States \u2013 it is everywhere, and it is systemic,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/edward-enninful-racism\">wrote</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/edward-enninful\">Edward Enninful</a>, the editor-in-chief of the magazine\u2019s British edition. The ubiquity of racism has been brought to stark and sudden attention by the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> and by the unprecedented wave of protests, demonstrations and rioting that followed.</p> <p>Filmed by many witnesses and now viewed millions of times, the killing of Floyd by a Minnesota policeman, a 21st-century lynching, is so sickening a crime that the revulsion it has induced has become a global phenomenon.</p> <p>The demonstrators and activists who have taken to the streets have, however, been motivated by more than revulsion. They have also been stirred to action by acknowledging a fundamental truth \u2013 that the killing of Floyd has to be understood as a symptom of systemic racism. By building their campaign around that reality they have promoted radical and challenging conversations \u2013 in countries on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 about the nature of racism and the actions that people of all races can take in eliminating it. These are conversations that we have needed for a very long time.</p> <p>Led by young people, many of them inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, and involving people of all ethnicities, the protests have morphed into a worldwide anti-racist movement. No longer is this moment solely about police violence nor is it limited to America. Both online and on the streets it is calling out racism, wherever it exists and in whatever forms it is found. In both the US and in Europe, people are asking, tentatively, if this might be a defining moment of change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a9daf1e6546231cf57669c8a5976a9c05849b35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a9daf1e6546231cf57669c8a5976a9c05849b35/0_120_5399_3241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The British actor John Boyega speaks at a Black Lives Matter protest in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The British actor John Boyega speaks to the crowd during a Black Lives Matter protest in Hyde Park on 3 June 2020 in London, England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet in the immediate aftermath of Floyd\u2019s death there was little reason to imagine anything would be any different this time around. For African Americans, one of the most appalling aspects of Floyd\u2019s murder was that they had seen it all before. The same story with the same outcome, all that changed was the name of the victim \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/breonna-taylors-death-black-women-killed-police-encounters/story?id=71057133\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/sandra-bland\">Sandra Bland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tamir-rice\">Tamir Rice</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philando-castile-shooting\">Philando Castile</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/walter-scott-shooting\">Walter Scott</a>.</p> <p>For many black Britons, Floyd\u2019s death stirred memories of another list of names, those of the members of their community killed or rendered disabled in similar circumstances at the hands of the British police or immigration officers. On Tuesday, the <a href=\"https://blackculturalarchives.org/blog/2020/6/1/a-statement-from-bca-our-lives-matter-its-time-for-change\">Black Cultural Archives</a> in Brixton, south London \u2013 the closest thing we have in this country to a museum to the black British experience \u2013 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bcaheritage\">tweeted</a> the names and the photographs of some of them \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\">Mark Duggan</a>, Sheku Bayoh, Sean Rigg, Sarah Reed, Cherry Groce, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-51587151\">Leon Briggs</a>, Christopher Alder, Brian Douglas.</p> <p>Yet almost instantly a predictable chorus of voices, emanating from predictable corners of British public life, rose up to dismiss the whole thing as an irrelevance. Using a familiar playbook, they accused those black Britons who see reflections of their own situation in the experiences of African Americans of making false comparisons.</p> <p>The US situation is unique in both its depth and ferocity, they say, so that no parallels can be drawn with the situation in Britain. The smoke-and-mirrors aspect of this argument is that it attempts to focus attention solely on police violence, rather than the racism that inspired it. Those who make it usually point to the ubiquity of firearms in US law enforcement, as proof that the US reality is beyond meaningful comparison. But firearms had nothing to do with the killing of George Floyd. Neither were they a factor in the death of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-32400497\">Freddie Gray</a> or the sidewalk killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a>, who, like Floyd, pleaded for his life, saying 11 times to the officers who pinned him down: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, the same words Floyd used in his final moments. Nor were guns involved in many of the cases when black people have <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\">died in custody or during arrest</a> in Britain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Excusing or downplaying British racism with comparisons to the US is a bad habit with a long history</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When black Britons draw parallels between their experiences and those of African Americans, they are not suggesting that those experiences are identical. Few people would deny that in many respects life is better for non-white people in the UK than in the US. The problem is that it is not as \u201cbetter\u201d as some like to believe. Black men are stopped and searched at nine times the rate of white men. Black people make up 3% of the population of England and Wales but account for 12% of the prison population and not since 1971 have British police officers been prosecuted for the killing of a black man, and even then they were charged with the lesser crime of manslaughter and that charge was later dropped.</p> <p>To say that the racism that infects parts of our police force and criminal justice system is less virulent than that which poisons the lives of 40 million African Americans is not much of a boast. Is that really the extent of our ambition \u2013 to be a somewhat less racist nation than one led by a man who describes white nationalists and members of the Ku Klux Klan as \u201cvery fine people\u201d? Surely we who dwell in what the actor Laurence Fox recently assured us is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/18/question-time-clash-lecturer-tells-of-hate-mail\">the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe</a>\u201d have higher hopes?</p> <p>Excusing or downplaying British racism with comparisons to the US is a bad habit with a long history. It began in 1807, with the abolition of the slave trade and picked up steam three decades later with the end of British slavery, twin events that marked the beginning of 200 years of moral posturing and historical amnesia. The Victorian readers who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/feb/22/review-harriet-beecher-stowe-uncle-toms-cabin\">rightly wept</a> over <em>Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin</em>, for example, conveniently forgot which nation had carried his ancestors into slavery and didn\u2019t dwell on the fact that most of the cotton produced by American slaves like him was shipped to Liverpool.</p> <p>For two centuries, we have deployed American racism as a distraction. It\u2019s as if we find it easier to recognise American forms of racism than we do our own&nbsp;home-grown varieties.

  "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s tragic that we won\u2019t have a vaccine ready for this epidemic,\u201d <a href=\"https://science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Hotez%20Testimony.pdf\">Peter Hote</a><a href=\"https://science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Hotez%20Testimony.pdf\">z told a US congressional committee</a> in <a href=\"https://science.house.gov/hearings/beyond-coronaviruses-understanding-the-spread-of-infectious-diseases-and-mobilizing-innovative-solutions\">March</a>. Tragic, because we could possibly already have had one.</p> <p>Hotez is <a href=\"https://www.texaschildrens.org/find-a-doctor/peter-jay-hotez-md-phd\">director</a> of the Center for Vaccine Development at the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital. In 2016, he and his team developed a vaccine for <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/\">Sars-1</a>, the virus that first appeared in <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/\">China in 2003</a>. Today\u2019s coronavirus, Sars-Cov-2, Hotez observes, is \u201cabout 80% similar [to Sars-1]\u201d. But by the time he developed the vaccine, Sars was no longer a public health issue and nobody was interested in funding the work. Hotez is now working to \u201crepurpose our Sars-1 vaccine to fight Sars-2\u201d. But had \u201cinvestments been made previously, we potentially could have [had] a vaccine ready to go now\u201d.</p> <p>We could, of course, have prepared for many things better with hindsight. But Hotez\u2019s point is not simply about Sars or Covid-19. It speaks to a broader problem with the production of medicines. Pharmaceutical companies only make products that are profitable, not socially necessary or scientifically possible. \u201cBefore I took this role,\u201d says Anna Mouser, policy and advocacy lead for vaccines at the medical research charity <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/\">Wellcome Trust</a>, \u201cI would not have imagined that there would be diseases where there is scientific potential to advance vaccines but that this doesn\u2019t progress due to the lack of economic incentives.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, London hosted a <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/world-leaders-make-historic-commitments-provide-equal-access-vaccines-all\">summit of Gavi</a>, the global vaccine alliance supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Gates Foundation, among others, to raise funds for immunisation programmes and the fight against Covid-19. It\u2019s one of many organisations, including <a href=\"https://cepi.net/\">Cepi</a>, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, launched in 2017 to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines, which seek to fill the gaps created by the dysfunctional pharmaceutical market.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The company has refused to share the research or trail data with a WHO initiative to pool Covid-19 knowledge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The work of such organisations is of enormous importance, especially for people in low-income countries. Yet filling the gaps often also means propping up a rotten system. As <a href=\"https://msfaccess.org/msf-any-future-covid-19-vaccines-must-be-sold-cost-and-accessible-all\">M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) notes</a>, governments and philanthropic organisations have so far \u201cgiven over $4.4bn to pharmaceutical corporations for research and development for Covid-19 vaccines. However, by and large, no conditions for access or affordability have been included as a precondition to any of that funding.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-04-30-landmark-partnership-announced-development-covid-19-vaccine\">much-acclaimed deal</a> between Oxford University\u2019s Jenner Institute and the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to manufacture, if successful, the Covid-19 vaccine being pioneered at the university, has been greased by government funding to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/funding-and-manufacturing-boost-for-uk-vaccine-programme\">tune of \u00a384m</a>. Despite this, and the research being carried out at a university, as the campaigning group <a href=\"https://justtreatment.org/news/covid19-vaccine-a-blank-cheque-for-pharma\">Just Treatment</a> points out, AstraZeneca \u201cnow owns the intellectual property rights and can therefore dictate the price\u201d. The company has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-vaccine-uk-big-pharma\">refused to share</a> the research or trial data with <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/covid-19-technology-access-pool/solidarity-call-to-action/\">a WHO initiative</a> to pool Covid-19 knowledge.</p> <p>This is not unusual. A decade ago, Gavi helped set up a fund providing $1.5bn in subsidies to Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline to supply pneumonia vaccines for low-income countries. Nevertheless, MSF argues, many such countries were still <a href=\"https://msfaccess.org/msf-any-future-covid-19-vaccines-must-be-sold-cost-and-accessible-all\">unable to afford the prices</a> that the companies charged.</p> <p>Medicines are a public good, but they are manufactured and traded like common commodities, as if they were apples or cars. The policies pursued by organisations such as Gavi and Cepi are largely attempts to circumvent this fundamental conflict between public goods and private profits.</p> <p>Perhaps we should tackle it head on, by <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/04/socialize-big-pharma-antibiotics-artificial-intelligence\">nationalising pharmaceutical production</a>. Even the former Conservative minister Jim O\u2019Neill has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/27/nationalised-drug-companies-may-be-needed-to-fix-antibiotics-market\">made the case</a> for partial nationalisation. After all, the key reason Britain established the National Health Service was to ensure that all citizens should have access to free decent health provision. If health services can be socialised, why not the production of medicines, too?</p> <p>The problem is that, even if such a policy were politically viable, the dysfunction of the pharmaceutical market cannot be resolved at a national level. The problem is global and requires a global solution. Indeed, attempts to find a solution at the national level may exacerbate what many call \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d \u2013 attempts by richer countries to grab medicines for themselves.</p> <p>There are no easy answers to this conundrum. At the minimum, pharmaceutical companies should, in return for public funding, be forced to set affordable prices and be more transparent, for instance by opening their books so we can see the <a href=\"https://msfaccess.org/msf-any-future-covid-19-vaccines-must-be-sold-cost-and-accessible-all\">actual costs</a> of drug production. Medicines are a human necessity, not a profit-making machine.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson has rolled the dice. Last Monday, schools and some non-essential shops reopened. On 15 June more children will go back to class and many more shopkeepers will raise their shutters. The prime minister is gambling that easing the lockdown will not lead to another outbreak. Soon we will find out if he was right, if infections and deaths continue to fall, two weeks after the measures were lifted.&nbsp;But if he\u2019s wrong, are we ready?</p> <p>Senior clinicians, frontline NHS staff and public health experts agree that Britain needs a plan to deal with a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections. But the most senior leaders, who talk regularly to the government, are not convinced there is one.</p> <p>\u201cI think the criticism that we can\u2019t see a strategy is a legitimate criticism,\u201d said Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a criticism at all of thoughtful people trying to do their best, but it is a criticism of the political agenda.\u201d</p> <p>In England, the relentless focus by Johnson and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on meeting their self-imposed target of 100,000 then 200,000 daily tests has got in the way of practical matters, according to Marshall and some of his counterparts at the royal colleges. Developing a strategy is now a matter of urgency.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a strategy for test and trace, for PPE, for the use of technology, for maintaining Covid services and opening up non-Covid services,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cClinicians working on the ground find it tiresome and difficult to work in an environment where things are changing every day and there\u2019s no sense of direction as to where we\u2019re heading.\u201d</p> <p>The official death toll passed 40,000 last week but new infections have been dropping substantially. Is the latest figure, of 1,650 positive tests released on Friday, low enough? No, according to Prof Maggie Rae, president of the Faculty of Public Health.</p> <p>\u201cThe number is falling, but it\u2019s still high,\u201d she said, saying the objective needs to be zero infections spread in the community. She is most concerned that the joint biosecurity centre, intended to be part of NHS test and trace and designed as an early warning system, will not be working for some time. </p> <p>When Covid-19 first hit the UK, ministers were worried the NHS would be overwhelmed. \u201cA promise to avoid a second peak implies we can accept another wave of around 50,000 deaths,\u201d she said. \u201cThis promise is not reassuring.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think the public understand that capacity in the NHS is dropping dramatically</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Katherine Henderson, Royal College of Emergency Medicine</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said that the numbers were going in the right direction. \u201cSo we certainly wouldn\u2019t jump in and say this is too early, you\u2019re not doing it right. On the other hand, I think we absolutely don\u2019t want any more relaxation till we are confident that the test and trace system is working both at national and local level.\u201d</p> <p>A second wave may not arrive and some epidemiologists, such as Prof Sir Hugh Pennington, believe the Covid-19 will not come in waves as the Spanish flu did, but may be more like Sars, which <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-original-sars-virus-disappeared-heres-why-coronavirus-wont-do-the-same-138177\">disappeared after a public health campaign</a>.&nbsp;Yet many believe there is a serious risk that Covid-19 will either remain endemic with local outbreaks, or come back harder as a second epidemic.</p> <p>Even without any escalation in cases, the NHS faces many immediate pressures, and emergency departments are starting to fill up again.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the public understand that capacity in the NHS is dropping dramatically,\u201d said Dr Katherine Henderson, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine and a consultant at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. The need for social distancing means far fewer people can stay in the waiting area.</p> <p>\u201cMy urgent-care centre hits capacity at 16 patients now. In the past, we would have had 40 patients in there. People know they need to queue outside Tesco and M&amp;S. Are they going to cope with the concept of queueing outside the emergency department?\u201d</p> <p>The backlog of cancelled appointments, with up to 8 million patients waiting for surgery by autumn, is also putting the NHS under strain. Prof Derek Alderson, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said patients needed to be confident they could go to hospital without becoming infected.</p> <p>He wants backing for acute trusts trying to create Covid-light sites \u2013 a model used effectively by some cancer hospitals. \u201cThe model could work for other conditions, other types of surgery,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Retaining the NHS\u2019s deal to use private hospitals is vital, Alderson added. \u201cWe need to keep this extra capacity, if we can, to deal with the backlog as well as the work that would normally be coming our way,\u201d he said. The deal ends on 30 June, although there is a rolling one-month notice period.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/serco-wins-covid-19-test-and-trace-contract-despite-1m-fine\">Serco wins Covid-19 test-and-trace contract despite \u00a31m fine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many also believe that those doctors and nurses who came out of retirement to help need to be retained. Prof Ravi Mahajan, president of the Royal College of Anaesthetists, said there was also a need for doctors to be trained in other medical skills as a \u201creserve\u201d force, so they could be redeployed in an emergency.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw that if you shut down some NHS operations, staff become available,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for example, they are not trained in intensive care. So we need to plan how we can get staff cross-skilled and trained so they can be redeployed.\u201d</p> <p>Yet these immediate pressures pale into insignificance compared with the nervousness clinicians have about winter. A combination of Covid-19 and winter flu could be devastating, they fear.</p> <p>Alderson said the country \u201ccertainly can\u2019t handle a second wave that takes us into the beginning of the winter months\u201d, while Rae is concerned that if people are afraid to go to their GP, flu vaccine take-up may be lower.</p> <p>\u201cThere need to be even more aggressive public health campaigns about flu,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cA good flu immunisation programme will make it easier to identify and treat Covid.\u201d</p>",

Despite this, I find myself forensically checking friends\u2019, acquaintances\u2019 and nemeses\u2019 pictures and analysing offhand comments for any sign they may, in fact, be working on a novel or starting a new business on the sly.</p> <p>Because I have developed a new paranoia: that people who say they haven\u2019t achieved anything in lockdown are lying. I fear they are the adult equivalent of those kids who, having loudly proclaimed they hadn\u2019t revised at all for the test, quietly ace it. I will be lulled into believing everyone is watching <em>Grand Designs</em> all day coated in Dorito dust, but they will emerge with a six-pack, a moving trilogy that redefines contemporary literature or the next Airblade (intellectual property lawyers are reporting a steep increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/eureka-moment-law-firms-report-rush-to-patent-ideas-in-midst-of-uk-lockdown\" title=\"\">patent applications</a>).</p> <p>I know it\u2019s irrational, but the sense we should be achieving creates an insidious thrum of unease on top of our real worries.

Surely one of the few advantages of 2020 is that it\u2019s OK to lack discipline.

So I\u2019ve decided to shake my torpor and try a little self-improvement. The only thing I have mastered recently is clear insight into my character flaws, so I\u2019m trying to address them with some post-lockdown resolutions\u2026</p> <p>Direct my limited energies better: I have spent approximately 496 hours this month trying to buy discontinued oversized mugs (ah yes, that\u2019s where all my time went). I already have three, but recent scarcity madness infected me and I am irrationally fixated on giant tea receptacles. As I write, my husband has come in holding two newly acquired specimens and asked how many mugs I have bought (I don\u2019t like his tone). The answer is: \u201cNot enough!\u201d I don\u2019t know what use this mug reserve will be in the end times: maybe they\u2019ll be the new shell money when global capitalism collapses. It\u2019s a long shot. Remedy: I\u2019ve relinquished my eBay password to my husband who will presumably use it for his own stockpile (lightbulbs). Mug cold turkey is easy. But not replacing it with something unhelpful (being so furious at the government my head feels as if it will split open like a watermelon, perhaps) may prove harder.</p> <p>Stop getting high on my own sanctimony: disapproving of park barbecues or crowded beaches is not my thing, but not because I am a compassionate person who accepts others may be fighting battles of which I know nothing. No, it is because I exhaust my judgmental impulses at home. I have become the wastefinder general. Exuding the sourly parsimonious energy of the landlady of a seedy postwar boarding house, I try to catch people eating fresh food then brandish a single clingfilmed Linda McCartney sausage or sliver of cheese hardened to fingernail consistency and exhort them to \u201cbe mindful of food waste\u201d and \u201cthink of the planet\u201d. Remedy: I must confess to my family I lied about the availability of avocados and ate one alone in secret, thereby losing all credibility as the food tsar.</p> <p>Lighten up: recent evidence has confirmed I am a controlling fun sponge. I instigated pizza night as an attempt at family entertainment, but within minutes my insistence on everyone doing it exactly my way turned it into the kind of joyless high-stakes cookery show where someone cries over a poorly deboned quail. We ate our \u2013 perfectly executed \u2013 pizzas in funereal silence. Remedy: I\u2019ve banned myself from supervising group activities (and possibly also taking part in them).</p> <p>Finally, my grotesque laziness:<strong> </strong>I used to do yoga. Now I click on links to classes then ignore them. The only asana I have mastered post-corona is what I\u2019m calling \u201cmodified corpse pose\u201d. You lie flat on your back holding your phone an inch from your face with one hand and a Twix in the other (it\u2019s very restorative). At least I haven\u2019t used \u201cI fell down a wombat hole\u201d as an excuse, as happened during a friend\u2019s yoga session, but the rot must stop.

  "<p>In the chaos of a pandemic and scenes in the United States of police brutality against protesters protesting against police brutality, clarity can arise from unexpected places.

It\u2019s something I have known since I met her \u2013 she came to my academy at 10. I spoke to her, I had an individual one-on-one discussion with her.

Mouratoglou\u2019s Ultimate Tennis Showdown was one of the first such events announced, marketed as a \u201crevolutionary\u201d departure from the main tour.</p> <p>\u201cWe are clearly failing to renew our fanbase so we are not very attractive to the younger generations and new fans because the world has changed around us,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that tennis has changed at all \u2026 a few weeks ago we realised that there was no live events in sports and I thought maybe we can have a window to showcase tennis differently.\u201d</p> <p>Since Mouratoglou\u2019s announcement, the summer calendar has been awash with so many new events that it can be difficult to tell them apart, but the Frenchman insists his tennis league will endure once the regular events return. The \u201crevolutionary\u201d aspects cited by Mouratoglou includes players interacting with both fans and coaches through headsets during their matches and fewer behavioural restrictions, allowing players to emote more. Players will receive a higher proportion of the broadcast and advertising revenue than at regular ATP events.</p> <p>Additionally, he says the Cincinnati tournament potentially moving to New York immediately before the US Open, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/sports/tennis/us-open-new-york.html?smid=tw-share\" title=\"\">according to</a> the New York Times, reminds him of UTS, which will take the form of a league over five weekends and includes players such as Stefanos Tsitsipas, Matteo Berrettini and F\u00e9lix Auger\u2011Aliassime.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea, I\u2019m happy to see that UTS has inspired people,\u201d says Mouratoglou. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the ideas \u2013 to stay in the same place, don\u2019t have players move around everywhere.

The US Open\u2019s plans include charter planes from a select few cities to New York, significantly limited entourages with players potentially using only tournament physios and even the elimination of the qualifying event. The ATP\u2019s decision on its proposals is imminent.</p> <p>Herwig Straka, a tournament representative on the ATP board, says: \u201cEven if there are no fans in the whole tournament, I understand why they still want to run it because it\u2019s the main event in the whole year [in the US]. There is sympathy for that. However, we as a tour need to think bigger and we need to find a good way to balance those interests. It is sometimes forgotten about, but the health and security of the players is still the ultimate goal for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>There are many questions about how such rules would function. The potential health issues still seem enormous, from the simple risk of players being treated by the same physios to the potential for litigation in the US should anybody become gravely ill.</p> <p>Top players who travel with large entourages will be disproportionately affected; it seems unlikely Serena Williams would attend an event that forbids her from travelling with her daughter. Mouratoglou, however, does not agree.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any player will miss a grand slam if they can play,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially at the moment, most of them would not have any competition until the US Open. If the US Open can take place, I think they will go. Whatever the conditions are.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/i-was-lost-coco-gauff-depression-tennis\">'I was just lost': Coco Gauff says rapid rise and hype led to depression</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those sceptical about the US Open would point to the cautious tone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/04/rafael-nadal-would-not-travel-to-new-york-today-to-play-tennis\" title=\"\">set by Rafael Nadal</a>.

For sure, my feeling when I talk to players is that it is not at the price of risking health.\u201d</p> <p>When tennis does return, the question on the tip of every tongue will centre around age. Williams will turn 39 in September. It could be that she returns after the break refreshed, or face another struggle to re-establish her top level again. Mouratoglou simply shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t think six months is gonna make a big difference,\u201d he says. \u201cSix months ago, she was 38 and a half and she\u2019s going to be 39.

  "<p>Covid-19 has now been afflicting humans for six months \u2013 first in China and later in other nations as the virus embarked on its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-covid-19-cases-and-deaths\">global conquest</a>.&nbsp;The experience has been a grim one for our species. To date, more than six million people have been infected and an estimated 400,000 have died, a toll that will inevitably continue to rise for years to come.</p> \n<p>Our world has been transformed in the process. Lockdowns have been imposed, borders have been closed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/care-home-dead-government-systematic-ageism-uk-covid-19\">care homes</a> for the elderly have been ravaged by illness, and national economies placed under extreme strain.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"134c6037-2f86-41ab-a672-1986189fb60e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus\">1918 influenza pandemic</a>&nbsp;that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet we have only reached the halfway point of the disease\u2019s progress towards its first anniversary, timing that raises a host of concerns and questions about our ability to navigate our way through this pandemic. What exactly have we learned about Covid-19 over the past six months? How quickly and how well have we responded to the challenges posed by it?</p> \n<p>And, much more importantly, what questions do we most urgently need to answer over the next six months? Answers from researchers and doctors should tell us how we might survive one of the worst crises to affect humanity in modern times.</p> \n<p><strong>Were we ready?</strong></p> \n<p>One emphatic response from scientists stresses that it is now clear we were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/britain-emergency-planners-pandemic-government\">very badly prepared</a> for the arrival of Covid-19. \u201cThis disease has turned out to be much worse than any of the pandemics that we had been anticipating and making plans to counter,\u201d said Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has a 1% death rate and it is highly transmissible, features that were considered to be highly unlikely for any new emerging disease we thought we might face. Such features represent the worst possible realistic scenario that we could envisage and lie at the very limit of what we thought we should expect. So the pandemic we have got now is about as bad as we thought it could ever get. It is a very sobering prospect.\u201d</p> \n<p>This point was also stressed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/dont-bet-on-vaccine-to-protect-us-from-covid-19-says-world-health-expert\">David Nabarro</a>, professor of global health at Imperial College London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19. \u201cWhen we first encountered this disease, we thought it was just a respiratory illness that affected the upper part of the chest. Now it is clear that it can cause illnesses of the sinus; can affect the lining of blood vessels and can lead to blood clots developing. The disease has also been linked to extreme fatigue, kidney damage and heart attacks \u2013 and quite often&nbsp;in relatively young people. This is not a disease to be underestimated.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa8569ed7f4f390fd696665c02d99d5d15205fb1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa8569ed7f4f390fd696665c02d99d5d15205fb1/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On 13 March, huge crowds gathered at the Cheltenham Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On 13 March, huge crowds gathered at the Cheltenham Festival.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nor is it likely to disappear in the near future, added Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University. \u201cHaving lived with Covid-19 for six months now, the most important thing we have learned is that we are going to have to live with it for an awful lot longer. Essentially we are six months into a lifelong relationship.\u201d</p> \n<p>In such circumstances, lockdown \u2013 which Woolhouse described as \u201ca panic measure\u201d but a necessary one \u2013 is no longer sustainable and the problem we face over the coming months is to find ways to keep the disease at bay without recourse to imposing lockdown restrictions and their associated economic and emotional harm. And that will not be easy \u2013 as has been made clear from other lessons learned over the past six months, Woolhouse added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Disease of old age</strong></p> \n<p>\u201cThe one key feature that we have come to appreciate about Covid-19 is that it is a disease of old age,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chance that a person over 75 will die from it is actually 10,000 times greater than it is for a 15-year-old who gets infected. It is really striking.\u201d</p> \n<p>The problems concerning the disease\u2019s impact on adults start when a person reaches 50 and get exponentially greater for each additional year of age. \u201cThat means a significant proportion of our population \u2013 those over 75 \u2013 need protecting from this virus because its consequences for them are extremely serious,\u201d added Woolhouse. \u201cBut is it right to lock up grandchildren to save their grandparents? In a sense that is what we have been doing up until now.\u201d</p> \n<p>One idea would be to put extremely strict biosecurity systems around care homes to ensure the coronavirus never gets into them. Staff \u2013 from cleaners to carers \u2013 would be tested constantly for the presence of the virus. \u201cNobody would be allowed to enter without a same-day test,\u201d said Woolhouse. \u201cIt is as simple as that.\u201d</p> \n<p>But as Woolhouse acknowledged, the vast majority of those over 75 don\u2019t live in care homes. They live in their own houses. \u201cThat means we are going to have to invent the concept of household biosecurity for these people. That is one of the most urgent tasks we now face.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Test, test, test</strong></p> \n<p>Implementing such ideas has only become feasible because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/us-germ-warfare-lab-creates-test-for-pre-infectious-covid-19-carriers\">virus testing technology</a> has improved both in accuracy and scale over the past couple of months. And that offers other advantages and opportunities to understand other questions about Covid-19, said Anne Johnson, professor of epidemiology at University College London.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cUntil now we have been relying heavily on mathematical models to try to understand how the virus is behaving and spreading through communities. However, mathematical models are only as good as the data that underpins them.\u201d</p> \n<p>With the development of new virus and antibody tests, there should therefore be far greater, data-based understanding of the appearance and spread of Covid-19 cases in Britain. She said: <strong>\u201c</strong>Simple details of time, place and person \u2013 we are crying out for that information in order to really understand this epidemic. We have got to be forensic in our efforts to pinpoint chains of transmission so we can stamp them out.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Mathematical models are only as good as the data that underpins them</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Anne Johnson</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A major problem in trying to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/covid-19-second-wave-may-be-avoided-with-track-and-trace-says-uk-science-chief\">track and control</a> Covid-19 has arisen because infections are often being spread by symptomless carriers, Johnson added. \u201cAt first we did not realise that people could be transmitting unwittingly. That has been a key lesson of the past few months.\u201d</p> \n<p>Collecting detailed epidemiological data should now be a priority for coming months, said Johnson. \u201cWhat is the age, gender, ethnicity and the postal code of people who test positive? And is that infected person a healthcare worker, or are they a relative of one, or are they living with one? Once you can establish these facts quickly, then you will make an enormous difference in closing down the disease. In effect, we are entering the realm of the bug detective.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Immunity</strong></p> \n<p>And then there is the critical issue of the kind of immunity that has been acquired by those already infected by the virus. \u201cStudies suggest antibodies are raised in patients\u2019 blood after they are infected and these could provide protection against future Covid-19 infections,\u201d said Hibberd. \u201cReasonable estimates suggest protection might last for periods of between six months to a couple of years. However, we need to find out exactly how long such protection will last because it will have an important bearing on how the disease progresses through a population.\u201d</p> \n<p>The longer that antibodies provide protection then the slower the disease will spread. As a result, scientists are asking that those individuals who were among the first to be infected have their blood sampled and their antibody levels tested. \u201cHave numbers of antibodies in their blood held steady or have they started to go down after only a few months? That is key research and it needs to be done now,\u201d said Hibberd.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a2947b48bb3e571469293f2f3feefd3036832bc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a2947b48bb3e571469293f2f3feefd3036832bc/0_275_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People took no chances in Beijing after new year celebrations were cancelled in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People took no chances in Beijing after new year celebrations were cancelled in January.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For those who were on the front line dealing with Covid-19 cases when significant numbers began to arrive in hospitals in April, the battle to save patients overwhelmed by critical breathing difficulties was a fraught and often bewildering business. Slowly doctors and nursing staff have improved treatments, however. \u201cWe are much better now at pinpointing those who will need intensive care and those who can be sent home,\u201d said Tom Wingfield, a clinician based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd some promising techniques have emerged in the interim \u2013 such as the potential for continuous positive airway pressure machines, respirators that fit round your face, to help patients breathe. These are showing encouraging results.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Wingfield stressed there were still many unknowns about the impact of Covid-19 on patients. \u201cFor example, it has become clear that many patients are having blood clots, and the sicker you are the more likely it is you have one. But what we don\u2019t know yet is which patients should be given blood thinners from the day they arrive to counter this clotting. Nor do we know how long we should continue that treatment.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe crucial point is that we are gathering data all the time \u2013 from blood tests, oxygen levels, respiratory rates \u2013 and hopefully that will help us to predict who is likely to have the worst reaction to the virus and who should be given the most intense treatments. In another six months, we should be much better informed.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Room for optimism</strong></p> \n<p>In the long term a vaccine may emerge as humanity\u2019s saviour. However, most scientists believe it is a relatively far-off prospect \u2013 one that is unlikely to reach us for a year or two at best. As Woolhouse put it: \u201cA vaccine is a hope, not a strategy.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This point was also stressed by Nabarro: \u201cWe have got to get out of this mirage sense that all will be resolved when a vaccine appears at the end of this year to save us. That is not going to happen. And even when we do get a vaccine that is safe and works, there is still the issue of how we get it to the 7.8 billion people who inhabit our planet. The global eradication of a disease is a very, very difficult business. We managed it with polio eventually, but we are still trying to get rid of measles.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, there is still some room for optimism, say scientists. \u201cYes, a vaccine is some way off but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/uk-hospitals-trial-five-new-drugs-search-coronavirus-treatment\">antiviral therapies</a> look more hopeful,\u201d said Hibberd. \u201cTrials are now under way for a number of antiviral drugs that were developed to deal with other diseases but which are now being repurposed in the hope that they can be used to tackle Covid-19. Results are expected in a few months.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf successful, some of these could help cut death rates. We might get it from 1% right down to 0.1%. In combination with improved testing and greater understanding of our immune systems and antibody level responses to Covid-19, then I think we would find ourselves in a very different, much better position in six months. I am hopeful.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Britain is \u201cabsenting itself from the world stage\u201d by refusing to show leadership over Hong Kong residents, confront China or condemn President Trump over his handling of the fallout from George Floyd\u2019s killing, the shadow foreign secretary has warned.</p> <p>In her most stinging attack on Britain\u2019s foreign policy, Lisa Nandy said that the government was now displaying \u201ca pattern of behaviour that is becoming very, very troubling\u201d, and that the UK\u2019s actions were being noted by leaders around the world.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em>, Nandy suggested that the offer made by Boris Johnson to hand \u201ca route to citizenship\u201d to around three million Hong Kong residents eligible for a British National (Overseas) passport was too vague to be taken seriously by Beijing. Britain\u2019s reluctance to confront China was, however, part of a wider issue, she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8516c2a68ef851c94e56ff93c55336e647dd7a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8516c2a68ef851c94e56ff93c55336e647dd7a4/0_101_3437_2062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A National Guard solider and a demonstrator in Washington last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A National Guard solider and a demonstrator in Washington last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is a pattern of behaviour that is really deeply worrying,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have had the appalling scenes emerging from the US after the murder of George Floyd. Last weekend, the foreign secretary was asked what he made of that, and the way in which those protests have been handled. He said it wasn\u2019t appropriate for him to comment. The prime minister has been remarkably silent about that as well.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to me that we lose all moral authority to talk about police brutality in Hong Kong and elsewhere if we are not prepared to apply those standards equally to other parts of the world. This is a pattern of behaviour that\u2019s becoming very, very troubling \u2013 that the UK is absenting itself from the world stage at precisely the moment when we need to show global leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Nandy praised the work of former Tory foreign secretary William Hague, but warned that British foreign policy had been \u201centirely framed through the lens of growth and trade\u201d since his departure in 2014.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThat has led us into a position where we have been courting the Chinese government, praising the golden era of Sino-British relations, without paying due attention to the need to have strategic independence and to be able to speak from a position of our values. And it seems to me that we are repeating those mistakes in the bilateral relationships we are trying to strike up across the world in the wake of Brexit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d38b4c74b5c6927aa1ac3a0da346064c33671b28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d38b4c74b5c6927aa1ac3a0da346064c33671b28/0_164_5936_3563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers on guard in Hong Kong last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers on guard in Hong Kong last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Candela/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nandy said that while the prime minister\u2019s offer to Hong Kong residents last week was \u201ca big step forward from a standing start of absolutely nowhere\u201d, there was a lack of clarity that meant anywhere between 350,000 and seven million Hong Kong residents could be affected. The offer was made as he urged China to rethink its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">controversial security law</a>, which pro-democracy campaigners say threatens rights in Hong Kong.</p> <p>However, Nandy did not commit Labour to backing a scheme that would allow eligible Hong Kong residents to settle in the UK. \u201cThere\u2019s a moral case for ensuring that people who want to leave Hong Kong can and that they\u2019re provided with a safe haven elsewhere. But there is also a moral case to make sure that any sanctions that we pursue, while they have an impact on China, don\u2019t unduly harm the people of Hong Kong.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>She warned that the government\u2019s approach to the threat to Hong Kong was part of its wider reluctance to confront Beijing: \u201cWe need a strategy at home and we need a strategy abroad in relation to the rise of China \u2026 and at the moment, we\u2019ve got neither.\u201d</p> <p>She also criticised the decision to involve Huawei in the UK\u2019s 5G network, saying that a failure to develop domestic technology meant Britain was not in a \u201cposition of greatest strategic independence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is likely to bring forward a bill before the summer recess to chart a path forwards that will reduce dependence on Huawei in the 5G network. We would support that \u2013 we\u2019ll obviously have to see the detail.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Huawei, there will be other issues. I think there\u2019s been a naivety about Britain\u2019s approach to China in the past decade. I think perhaps we\u2019re starting to see that change. And that is long overdue.\u201d</p>",

It is absolutely vital we are able to use these laptops with pupils to try to level the field.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIf the vast majority of learning is accessed online, it is not surprising that children whose parents are able to go out and buy them a device will succeed more than a child who has to access all learning from a phone or shared device.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve moved completely offline because we weren\u2019t willing to sacrifice 25% of our kids</p> <footer> <cite>Vic Goddard, headteacher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>More than half (54%) of secondary school leaders say, as of this weekend, they have not received a single device, and 70% have not received the promised routers to give internet access for these pupils, according to a survey of 142 headteachers by the National Association of Headteachers. \u201cThis promise seems to be going unfulfilled,\u201d said Paul Whiteman, the union\u2019s general secretary. </p> <p>Vic Goddard, headteacher at Passmores Academy and a participant in the TV show <em>Educating Essex</em>, said a quarter of his Year 10 pupils have little or no access to the technology they needed for online learning during lockdown. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved completely offline because we weren\u2019t willing to sacrifice 25% of our kids. However, by doing that, the criticism we\u2019re open to is: you\u2019ve disadvantaged the advantaged kids.\u201d</p> <p>He has not received any of the devices he has requested, just emails from the Department for Education saying: you\u2019ll be contacted about how to order them. \u201cMy direct network would be about 50 heads from all over the country. None of them have heard anything different to that.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>A further six headteachers told the <em>Observer</em> they had not yet received any devices. Steve Howell, headteacher at the City of Birmingham School, is one of them. \u201cMore than three-quarters of our year 10 pupils do not have access, regularly and consistently, to a device or the internet at home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that a big announcement was made about this before there was a practical mechanism for rollout. The most disadvantaged pupils are hardest hit with IT poverty, and the fact this has taken so long is really making things worse.\u201d </p> <p>The government\u2019s failure to deliver is effectively putting children without any tech under pressure to take greater health risks and return to school earlier than their peers, warned Jolyon Maugham, a barrister and founder of the <a href=\"https://goodlawproject.org/\">Good Law Project</a>.&nbsp;\u201cPoorer families are overwhelmingly the victims of the pandemic. It\u2019s extraordinary to me that the government should make matters worse by denying those families a choice the middle class have, to educate their children at home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1f29d49ab7fe4bb865fdd0daf9c522296f7707c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1f29d49ab7fe4bb865fdd0daf9c522296f7707c/0_2_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gavin Williamson announced that the government would be given free laptops and tablets during a coronavirus briefing on 19 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gavin Williamson announced that the government would be given free laptops and tablets during a coronavirus briefing on 19 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/Crown Copyright/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are already signs that the partial return of schools will exacerbate the attainment gap between rich and poor, as new data obtained by the <em>Observer </em>shows greater numbers of primary school pupils returned to the classroom last week in affluent areas than in poorer neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Teachers at different schools were asked to identify whether less than a fifth of eligible pupils had returned to classrooms last week.

It\u2019s actually quite dramatic. We know that the home environment is unequal, but we also now know that who is coming to school is unequal.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education said Williamson had promised to deliver the devices at the end of May and throughout June, and its \u00a3100m programme to support pupils with remote education was \u201con track\u201d. \u201cThe Department is prioritising the delivery of devices to the most vulnerable children first \u2013 children with a social worker and care leavers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do whatever we can to make sure no child, whatever their background, falls behind as a result of coronavirus. \u201d</p> <h2><em><strong>James Johnson, a year 1 teacher in Kent shares his diary from the first week back at school with nine of his usual class of 30</strong></em></h2> <h2> <br></h2> <h2>Monday</h2> <p>Before the children arrive, I feel anxious about the day ahead. I wonder how the gap in their education is going to present itself and what has happened to them over the past 10 weeks. But my biggest anxiety is: is this going to work? Are we going to be able to keep everybody safe? Will all the children manage to stay in one \u201cbubble\u201d throughout the week?</p> <p>At the same time, I\u2019m feeling very, very excited. I always form such a strong connection to the children I teach and the thought that keeps going through my mind is: I\u2019m going to see some of them again. And the moment that I do, I feel overwhelmed with emotion. It was such a beautiful sunny day, and when each child came round the corner and we saw each other\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t stop smiling. Those were moments of complete and utter joy.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>I feel much less anxious today. The steps my leadership team has put in place have been very successful. The children may be only five or six years old, but they have learned to line up two metres apart, put hand gel on when they arrive and sit at individual desks spread out around the room. Normally, I teach the children through play, we don\u2019t have formal desks at all. But they are now taking pride in their desks and saying \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep it tidy\u201d.</p> <p>Throughout the week, the children seem fully aware of the virus and what\u2019s been happening. Today, when we speak about the continent of Asia, straightaway one of the children says: \u201cThat\u2019s where the coronavirus comes from.\u201d My teaching assistant and I look at each other. Asia has such a rich culture and history. For a child to immediately think of that\u2026 This is how the real world is imprinting itself on our young children.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>The children are learning about Saint George, so I get them to describe and draw their own dragons.</p> <p>Normally, I teach a mixed class of 30 Year 1 and Year 2 pupils, but only nine of them have come into school this week. We are all in one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/19/distanced-drop-offs-and-protective-bubbles-englands-new-school-rules\">\u201cbubble\u201d</a> together. My teaching assistant supervises them when I have my lunch or a break, and vice versa, so no other adult ever enters our bubble.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to keep your distance from a small child \u2013 sometimes they just want to come up to you and hold your hand. My biggest concern is to keep the children\u2019s anxieties to a minimum. That comes first, for me, so I am prepared to let them get a bit close.</p> <p>After a socially distanced ice-cream on the school playing field with other staff members, I hear on the news the death toll is rising again. My mother calls me to say she wouldn\u2019t have sent her child back to school this week \u2013 but she didn\u2019t have a choice. I find myself hoping, beyond anything, that going back was the right decision.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>We play socially distanced golf this morning. It\u2019s not a sport I\u2019ve taught before, it\u2019s not on our normal curriculum but it was fantastic. When the children\u2019s balls land in the \u201cpond\u201d I have created from a big water tray, they have to whack them out of the water \u2013 and they can\u2019t stop laughing.</p> <p>I can tell one little boy is missing his best friend though. Usually, they\u2019re inseparable \u2013 but his friend isn\u2019t coming in, so he seems a bit lost. I try my best to help. I miss the other children in the class, too.</p> <p>From the news that evening, I learn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/face-masks-to-be-made-compulsory-on-public-transport-in-england\">face masks will soon be compulsory on public transport</a>. Yet the government is happy for teachers to be confined in classrooms with up to 15 children all day long. That was interesting.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Today the children re-enact the Roman invasion of the hometown of Boudica, the warrior queen. Normally, we dedicate a whole term to a single topic or theme, but this week I\u2019ve been trying to spark their curiosity about learning again. There are no end of year assessments, like there usually are, so I can use this time to really explore and fill the different gaps in their knowledge.</p> <p>It takes a lot of energy to teach young children and when I leave, I am tired. I want to collapse on the sofa. But I have been back in the classroom, where I should be, seeing children smile again and having an impact on their learning. And that has felt incredible.</p>",
  "<p>Sonia Shah\u2019s last two books <em>Pandemic</em>, published in 2016, and <em>The Fever</em>, published in 2010, introduced her as a storyteller in a novel genre: travel books that went in search of the spread of disease - cholera in the former, malaria in the latter. That literature of track and trace, part detective story, part reportage, took Shah to remote corners of the world and to distant grid references of history. Her books were also prescient case studies of the way that human progress has been shaped by its love-hate relationship with microbes \u2013 how disease has caused empires to rise and fall and economies to stutter and implode.&nbsp;</p> <p>This book \u2013 a wandering narrative about why people wander \u2013 is likely to prove equally prophetic in the coming months and years, since it asks two questions that are already shaping our geopolitics: what causes human beings to migrate? And is such mass movement beneficial to more settled communities and nations?&nbsp;</p> <p>The \u201cnext great migration\u201d has been predicted by many \u2013 and feared by some \u2013&nbsp;ever since the end of the cold war.&nbsp;The national security expert <a href=\"https://www.robertdkaplan.com/\">Robert D</a><a href=\"https://www.robertdkaplan.com/\"> Kaplan</a> described it in a 1994 <em>Atlantic</em> magazine article as \u201cthe coming anarchy\u201d \u2013 the binary superpowers had held borders mostly in check, now people would start to move. \u201cThere would likely be 50 million on the move by 2020, experts at the United Nations University projected. Two hundred million by 2050, the environmental security analyst Norman Myers announced. One billion! the NGO Christian Aid projected.\u201d One result of those alarmist predictions had been the populist politics that has emerged with a single purpose in mind: how to make those people stay still. \u201cEnd freedom of movement!\u201d; \u201cbuild the wall!\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"http://soniashah.com/\">Shah</a> begins her history with a series of observations that become parables from the natural world. The first concerns the habits and behaviour of the checkerspot butterfly. The checkerspot, most abundant on the west coast of America, is not a powerful creature. It flies very low to the ground and only lives for 10 days. Because of its sensitivity to changes in habitat and environment, it also proved one of the first bellwethers of climate change. A celebrated paper in <em>Nature</em> in 1996 showed that in response to warming temperatures the edges of the population of checkerspots were moving northwards at a rate of 20km per decade. Shah joined the butterfly hunters marking that progress and along the way found evidence that myriad other species are also checking out of familiar territories: Atlantic cod, for example, are moving at a rate of 200km a decade toward the cooler poles.</p> <p>Shah confesses to a certain kinship with those migrations. Her parents \u2013 alone among their siblings \u2013 moved from India 50 years ago to fulfil a need for doctors in New York City, in the first wave of legal migration from the subcontinent. That migration instilled in Shah \u201can acute feeling of being somehow out of place\u201d; despite having been born American, \u201cI didn\u2019t consider myself as being \u2018from\u2019 that place, even though I\u2019d borne both of my children there\u201d. For a few years, she and her husband left to live in Australia and became doubly \u201calien\u201d. These feelings prompted questions in Shah: where did that concept of home originate? And was that a learned or an innate understanding?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nigel Farage\u2019s efforts to police the English Channel are about as likely to succeed as those of King Canute</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her compulsive investigation into these questions becomes a political history of the human urge to move from one place to another. It begins with the \u201cmitochondrial Eve\u201d identified as the African ancestor of all human societies \u2013 the prime mover of a species hardwired to migrate \u2013 and ends in the determined and futile efforts of contemporary politicians to deny that instinct in individual refugees with nowhere to go except somewhere else.&nbsp;</p> <p>Shah identifies the emergence of biological taxonomy, the naming of things, as the historical moment when we decided that nature, which had never stopped moving and evolving, was actually fixed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/13/wikipedia-influence-list-carl-linnaeus\">Carl Linnaeus</a>, \u201cthe sex-crazed Swedish taxonomist\u201d, becomes the founding father of a political principle of nativism that can be summed up simply: \u201cWe belong here. They belong there.\u201d She shows how this enlightenment control freakery gave rise not only to eugenics and \u201crace science\u201d but also to the underpinnings of fascism. Heinrich Himmler, in addition to masterminding the genocide of millions, issued rules for landscape design: \u201cThe head of the Reich central office for \u2018Vegetation Mapping\u2019 called the delicate flowering herb <em>Impatiens parviflora</em> a \u2018Mongolian invader\u2019 and recommended its extermination.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8724911c84b266d7e970e0fd988e941556b3feef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8724911c84b266d7e970e0fd988e941556b3feef/0_0_4016_6016/668.jpg\" alt=\"Sonia Shah: \u2018asks the questions that are already shaping our geopolitics\u2019\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonia Shah: \u2018asks the questions that are already shaping our geopolitics\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having established this history, Shah unpicks its pernicious effects on contemporary false narratives about immigration and the re-emergence of supremacist racial rhetoric in the political mainstream. It is only two decades since Bill Clinton stood on the White House steps and announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/jun/26/genetics13\">the sequencing of the human genome</a>, which offered incontrovertible proof that we not only have infinitely more in common than that which divides us \u2013 \u201cThe sequencers had found [that] a paltry 0.1% of the 3bn nucleotides strung together on our strands of DNA differed from any one person to the next\u201d \u2013 but that encoded in our DNA was the age-old urge to mix and move about.</p> <p>Towards the end of this fascinating study, Shah travels to some of the frontlines of the denial of that instinct. She meets the gravediggers of the Greek island of Lesbos, who bury the migrants who wash up on their shores, many of them children, in unmarked graves. She has no easy answers, except to argue that our biology and our history tell us a very different story to our politicians. Nigel Farage\u2019s efforts to police the English Channel are about as likely to succeed as those of King Canute. \u201cLife is on the move, today as in the past,\u201d Shah insists. \u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve suppressed the fact of the migration instinct, demonising it as a harbinger of terror. We\u2019ve constructed a story about ourselves, our history, our bodies, and the natural world around us in which migration is the anomaly. It\u2019s an illusion. And once it falls, the entire world shifts.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Next Great Migration: The Story of Movement on a Changing Planet</em> by Sonia Shah is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a314.99).

These are just three examples of ordinary people who have responded in extraordinary ways. Their actions speak of selflessness, defiance and bravery in the face of the invisible threat that hovers around us in the very air that we breathe. But they also provide us with glimpses of the immense human cost of the pandemic, the great well of loss, fear, sadness and grief beneath the mounting statistics.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Britain, as I write, 37,000 people have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/coronavirus-uk-map-the-latest-deaths-and-confirmed-cases-near-you\">lost their lives</a> to the Covid-19 virus, while 267,000 have experienced and survived the terrible uncertainty of infection. As a fragile normality slowly returns, many mental health experts are asking the inevitable questions: what will be the long-term emotional and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/urgent-studies-needed-mental-health-coronavirus-lockdown\">psychological cost</a> of such a sudden and seismic disruption of our way of life?</p> <p>\u201cHow the outside impacts on the inside is something that people like me think about all the time,\u201d says psychotherapist and author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/susie-orbach\">Susie Orbach</a>. \u201cBut now we are seeing it on a grand scale. The pandemic has been a prolonged assault from outside on our community. The state of uncertainty and unsafety it has created is new and utterly unfamiliar.

Those kinds of emergencies, she explains, are classed as \u201csingle events that occur within a limited time-frame and affect a defined population\u201d. A global pandemic does not fit that model.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For those with a history of trauma, it has been a particularly difficult time</p> <footer> <cite>Susie Orbach</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe word most often used is \u2018unprecedented\u2019,\u201d she says, \u201cand it looks increasingly likely that the long-term consequences will also be unprecedented in scale. Given that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/mental-health\">mental health services</a> have been starved of resources for years, one can only imagine the impact that a deep recession will have on an already beleaguered sector. So there is a lot of concern among health care professionals like myself about what will happen next.\u201d</p> <p>It is in the coming months and even years, then, that the psychological effects of the pandemic will become most apparent. \u201cTrauma occurs when you are overwhelmed by an event that you cannot process,\u201d says Julia Samuel, grief counsellor and bestselling author, whose latest book is titled <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/12/grief-works-stories-life-death-and-surviving-review-julia-samuel\">Grief Works: Stories of Life, Death and Surviving</a></em>. \u201cWhile the crisis is happening, you are in it and everything is uncertain and unpredictable. You don\u2019t have the emotional freedom to allow yourself to process the trauma, so it is held in the body. The most common reaction is to shut down and just exist somehow. It is only when the external world becomes more safe and predictable again that people may feel able to reach out for support.\u201d</p> <p>Those most at risk of suffering post-traumatic stress are the frontline medical staff who, in the first chaotic weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, may have felt overwhelmed&nbsp;by the dramatically increased levels of patient suffering and deaths, as well as at risk from infection from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/medical-staff-face-weeks-without-protective-gowns\">inadequate PPE</a> and anxious about bringing the virus home with them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Studies have also shown that, in ordinary times,&nbsp;patients who have spent time in intensive care are at a 20% increased risk of developing PTSD. \u201cAlready with some of the support initiatives that have been put in place, we are seeing survivors of Covid-19 showing post-traumatic symptoms,\u201d says Stubley. She explains that there is an accepted timeline for the&nbsp;treatment of post-traumatic stress. \u201cTime zero is the moment the trauma itself ends. In the first months or so afterwards, around 90% of those who experienced trauma will have PTS symptoms including feeling edgy or constantly on guard, sleeplessness, irritability and acute anxiousness. The Nice [National Institute for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a>&nbsp;and Care Excellence] guidelines state that we should not treat people in that first month as these symptoms can often pass.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f611ba1ff8dc340d8e21e94606dfb86a9129b8a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f611ba1ff8dc340d8e21e94606dfb86a9129b8a1/0_174_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Radiologists with a patient at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radiologists with a patient at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital in east Lancashire. \u2018Nurses and doctors will suddenly be thinking: \u2018My God!

There is so much about the pandemic that is disturbing and distressing on so many levels.\u201d</p> <p>The Royal College of Surgeons recently carried out research into the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on healthcare workers, gathering personal testimonies from nurses and doctors on the frontline. Many reported experiencing increased levels of anxiety, stress, depression as well as panic attacks and bouts of guilt about the amount of people who have died. \u201cI can\u2019t see how I can keep doing this...\u201d said one. \u201cI really wish I wasn\u2019t a doctor,\u201d said another.&nbsp;</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Guardian</em>, lead researcher and NHS doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/coronavirus-mental-health-storm-nhs-workers\">Ankur Khajuria</a> noted that even before the pandemic around 50% of doctors and 40% of nurses were suffering from stress-related psychiatric illness. \u201cA perfect storm is gathering,\u201d he warned.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lucy Warner is chief executive of NHS Practitioner Health, a confidential service that treats doctors with mental health issues. They expect to treat around 3,500 doctors a year. When I spoke to her a few weeks ago, she said they had already treated about a third of that annual number in the preceding few weeks \u2013 \u201cmostly through online spaces where people can connect, talk to each other, share their feelings and reflect.\u201d</p> <p>In the early stage of the pandemic, she says, \u201cthere was a lot of anticipatory anxiety. It was new and people didn\u2019t really know what was happening or how long it would go on, but they knew it was frightening.\u201d As the weeks have passed in long shifts and rising numbers of the sick and the dead, that gave way to \u201ca lot of emotional fatigue, a kind of mental and physical exhaustion. It was becoming a toil, it was becoming difficult for doctors to go on while not knowing how the pandemic would play out.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the last months, that state of mental and physical fatigue has for many become the default mode. \u201cIn a way, it no longer feels like a break with the norm,\u201d says Warner, \u201cit just feels normal.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a long game.

We are seeing the beginnings of a surge in mental health issues among frontline staff, but over the next year or more we are going to see a lot of people who thought they were OK suddenly realising that they are not. There will be some nurses and doctors suddenly thinking: \u2018My God! What did I go through?\u2019 That\u2019s when we may have to deal with a surge in PTSD symptoms, and those people will need individual support but also support on an organisational level.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>While the government and some media were quick to apply the language of wartime to the pandemic \u2013 heroic British frontline warriors battling an invisible enemy \u2013&nbsp;Jo Stubley told me of her and her colleagues\u2019 discomfort at that kind of distracting rhetoric. \u201cThe NHS is not the military,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cand nurses are not soldiers.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Like several others I spoke to, Warner was also uncomfortable with what she called \u201cthe hero narrative\u201d that has taken hold of the public imagination during the long weeks of lockdown. \u201cIt is unhelpful in some ways because you don\u2019t want doctors and nurses to feel they are superheroes, who have to pat themselves on the back when they are on the line and not sleeping or even having time for a pee. What can tend to get overlooked is that they are human beings who are entitled to a rest as much as we all are. They are ordinary people doing their very best, but we need them to be well to do their jobs well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"521f0dd019d70b6eb79df121b96e4960290a5608\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521f0dd019d70b6eb79df121b96e4960290a5608/0_0_6366_4244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctors hold a silent protest outside Downing Street on 28 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors hold a silent protest outside Downing Street on 28 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In response to the emergency of the last few months, several psychotherapists have set up online drop-in support groups for NHS staff, who may be feeling overwhelmed or emotionally exhausted. I spoke to one who, with a colleague, has created \u201ca support group for clinical staff\u201d in London. She asked for anonymity.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing to stress is that it is drop-in support, not psychotherapy \u2013 the midst of a crisis is not the time to start psychotherapy for clinical staff. What they need is a safe space to come together, share their thoughts and anxieties and listen to others experiencing similar challenges. To this end, everyone uses first names only and they do not have to say where they work. They can also choose to be seen on a screen or not.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, the take-up rate has been low and almost all those who have used the service are doctors rather than nurses. \u201cI think there are various reasons for that,\u201d she says. \u201cFirst, they are in it, and when they get home, they are utterly exhausted. Also, they are perhaps not aware of what help has been made available to NHS staff, even though there is actually a lot of help out there.\u201d</p> <p>The other more positive reason is that they may already be receiving support from their fellow workers, from the strength of being part of a team that is responding well in extremely difficult circumstances. \u201cThe way the nursing profession works is that you tend to get on with it,\u201d says Jo Stubley. \u201cYou are to a degree encouraged to feel that way, so even when the normal rules don\u2019t apply there is the sense that this is what you have been trained for. It\u2019s amazing in many ways, but it means that everybody seems to be coping on the surface, while underneath they may well be struggling.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c42b8375c853090a7e3e4273f60634fb6d232244\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c42b8375c853090a7e3e4273f60634fb6d232244/0_206_4687_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medical staff at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical staff at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first chaotic weeks of the Covid pandemic, many nurses and doctors felt not just overwhelmed, but threatened and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/worrying-event-deaths-of-nhs-doctors-from-covid-19-stark-reminder-of-pandemic\">unsafe</a>. There were serious issues over the lack of adequate PPE,&nbsp;leading to increased anxiety about contracting the virus and passing it on to family members. Both the workplace and the home thus became places that were unsafe and uncertain.&nbsp;</p> <p>The nurse from Sierra Leone quoted at the beginning of this article recalled her feelings of being alone, at risk and anxious. \u201cInitially it was chaos \u2013 we didn\u2019t have equipment, we didn\u2019t have senior support, we were short-staffed.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>For two long weeks, she and her colleagues worked in an environment she compared to a war zone, tending to patients who were \u201cvery unwell, very unstable, very sick... We didn\u2019t even have masks. We were tired, dehydrated, thirsty,\u201d she continued, still sounding traumatised. She recalled returning home each night to her daughters, thinking: \u201cWhat is happening? How far will this go?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>That anonymous nurse belongs to the BAME community who make up 20% of the NHS workforce.

More than six out of 10 victims were from BAME backgrounds. One of their number was urologist Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">18-year-old son voiced</a> what many inside the NHS were feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see NHS workers getting the recognition they deserve,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they should not have to give their lives, they should not have to go as martyrs. They did not sign up to battle on the frontline and give up their lives.\u201d</p> <p>In the coming second pandemic of mental health issues, it may well be those we heralded as heroes who will be among the most vulnerable, alongside key workers on low incomes who also toiled through this long emergency at considerable and often unnecessary risk to their health, their lives.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf we were prepared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/28/clap-for-our-carers-the-very-unbritish-ritual-that-united-the-nation\">clap for our health workers</a>, we should also be insisting that they are looked after in the wake of this emergency,\u201d says Jo Stubley. \u201cI want to be optimistic about that, but the market economy has been a disaster for the health service and, within it, mental health has always been the poor sibling. I have spent years saying to my managers, we need more resources, too many people are waiting. If there was no room in the system before this began, what will happen when it ends and we are in the middle of another recession?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Julia Samuel concurs: \u201cThe fear is that the system will be overwhelmed, not least because there is not the parity of resources in mental health that there is in physical health.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You don\u2019t expect to lose someone in this way.

In time to come, hard questions must surely be asked about the British death rate and the practical ways many thousands of those deaths might have been prevented. For now, it is the hardest aspect of the pandemic to grasp, much less make sense of. Only months ago, it would have seemed like the stuff of dark imaginings: gothic fiction or apocalyptic sci-fi.

Outside of wartime or other historical pandemics like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now\">Spanish flu in 1918</a>, there is no precedent for the number of lives lost within a relatively short period.&nbsp;</p> <p>The global virus has, in the most insidious and cruelly indiscriminate way, turned our world upside down, denting our faith in the infallibility of science and medicine, global capitalism and in progress itself. It has made us fretful for our lives and the lives of those around us, while simultaneously robbing us even of our traditional way of death. Relatives have not been allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/may/05/dying-surrounded-by-family-a-fundamental-right-says-uk-judge\">visit their loved ones in their final days</a> or to be present when they breathed their last.

Without a feathered kiss upon her forehead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Without the muted murmur of familiar family voices gathered around her bed...</p> </blockquote> <p>In composing that sad, defiant elegy, Duffy found a way to express her tumult of emotions in the face of the virus\u2019s assault on our collective sensibilities. In this, though, she was undoubtedly the exception. Countless others have not found a way to articulate their sorrow, their isolation and their disorientation. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to lose someone in this way,\u201d says Orbach, \u201cto not be able to say goodbye and then to be forced to grieve alone.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>For Orbach, the pandemic has also brutally exposed our culture\u2019s collective denial of the final inevitable. \u201cThe rituals are there to help us get through it,\u201d she elaborates, \u201cbut also because death is such a problematic idea in our culture, an almost impossible idea. We don\u2019t live with death, as it were. Instead, we live to a great degree in denial of it, particularly our own death. And suddenly, we are witnessing death on a grand scale. It has in effect cut through our belief systems, our expectations of what life is.\u201d</p> <p>As someone who specialises in grief, what does Julia Samuel think will be the lasting collective impact of so many deaths, but also of our prolonged proximity to the threat of death?</p> <p>\u201cThe impact will by no means be the same for everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cFor an older person to lose a long-term partner so suddenly and unexpectedly is a different experience to a family who have lost someone young who was expected to survive. Both traumas will leave a deep and lasting imprint on their family members.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Samuel points out that guilt is often a component of grief, and may be exacerbated by the ways in which people have died during the pandemic. \u201cTo be the only family member permitted to be present in an ICU is heartbreaking of itself, but then to have to be in full PPE, while your loved one is on a ventilator surrounded by medical staff who also look like astronauts. It is as good as it can be, but it is not the death that anyone would wish for.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Julia Samuel&nbsp;if there is any way to accurately predict what the long-term fallout of the pandemic will be\u2026</p> <p>\u201cAs humans, we are born to adapt,\u201d she says. \u201cBut while we are still in it and so much is still uncertain, I don\u2019t think we have a clue what the long-term consequences will be.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2a080c6ffeeaf817dc0dd88aaaf11df66121fb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2a080c6ffeeaf817dc0dd88aaaf11df66121fb7/186_396_5122_3073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A burial plot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fresh burial plot in Oxfordshire.

The badge of busyness, for instance, has to a degree lost its lustre. Being busy was somehow being important, but maybe people have realised that busyness is essentially an anaesthetic to feeling.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Susie Orbach the same question. She, too, attests to the power of not being frantic.&nbsp;\u201cThe lockdown certainly changed our relationship to time. In the beginning, there was a kind of panic about time running though our hands \u2013 it was two o\u2019clock and suddenly it\u2019s five o\u2019clock. How did that happen? I think not being frantic was a challenge for some people, but for others, the not-doing and simply being became almost mindful. To just be is actually quite liberating.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Will these small epiphanies be enough for the reorientation of our social and political values that some have suggested will be the necessary outcome of this global emergency?&nbsp;Writer and activist Arundhati Roy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10d8f5e8-74eb-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca\">has described the pandemic</a> as \u201ca portal, a gateway between one world and the next\u201d. We can, she suggested, \u201cchoose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.\u201d</p> <p>Orbach&nbsp;cautiously agrees. \u201cPart of me thinks that this is somehow a moment of possibility. Many of us who believe we need to work together to democratise our institutions saw that actually happen when the doctors and nurses took control on the ground, while management did not have a clue.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>She pauses for a moment, gathering her thoughts. \u201cIn terms of our political culture, we entered the pandemic with a government born of fright. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/the-observer-view-on-the-danger-posed-by-brexit-during-our-greatest-vulnerability\">Brexit</a> was essentially an act of fright, and the climate of fear that was created left so many people feeling marginalised in this swashbuckling, Darwinian, self, self, self culture. And yet, against all that, when the pandemic happened and real fear spread among us, people wanted to make a contribution, they wanted to be decent.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The experts agree that the psychological fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic will be felt for some time to come and that, as ever, the most vulnerable, no matter their recent sacrifices, will be most at risk. In the new normal, will we find ways to be fairer, kinder, more decent when this is all over, if it can ever be said to be truly over?&nbsp;Or will today\u2019s \u201cheroes\u201d become tomorrow\u2019s overlooked victims like the traumatised veterans of so many wars we willed ourselves so quickly to forget?&nbsp;</p> <p>Will we hold our political leaders to account when the coming economic crisis inevitably takes precedence over the psychological one and already limited resources are channeled away from a beleaguered NHS that nevertheless saved us from an even deeper, darker abyss?&nbsp;Or will we simply get on with it as before, finding ways to forget that, for a long, uncertain time, when time itself seemed out of joint, we lived amid the mounting dead in a world turned upside down. Ultimately, how we respond to this looming second pandemic may be the measure of how much the first one really taught us about ourselves and the kind of world we want to live in.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;<em>In the UK and Ireland,&nbsp;Samaritans&nbsp;can be contacted on 116 123 or email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

  "<p>The political obituaries of Donald Trump were all prepared. At the end of a week that has seen American cities convulsed by protests over the killing of <a href=\"heguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-hydroxychloroquine-live\" title=\"\">George Floyd</a>, the president would be faced with an increase in unemployment worse than anything seen in the Great Depression.</p> <p>Well, it didn\u2019t turn out like that. The US economy actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/us-unemployment-may-great-depression-job-loss\" title=\"\">created 2.5 million jobs in May</a> and the unemployment rate went down rather than up. The consensus among analysts was that it would shed 7.5 million jobs, a colossally wrong call. And a deeply significant one.</p> <p>Instead of Trump being the new Herbert Hoover \u2013 the one-term occupant of the White House from 1929-33 \u2013 the amazingly good jobs figures hold out the prospect of him stealing Bill Clinton\u2019s nickname and being the next comeback kid.</p> <p>The US has a reputation for bouncing back from adversity quickly, but even by its own standards the turnaround has been remarkable. If the data from the Bureau for Labour Statistics (BLS) are to be believed, large numbers of workers who lost their jobs when the economy went lockdown in March were rehired as restrictions were eased from mid-May onwards. On Thursday, the day before the official payroll data was released, there had been figures out showing almost 2 million Americans had filed jobless claims the previous week, taking the total to more than 40 million since the crisis began.</p> <p>Trump seemed as surprised as anyone by the news, but for once his hyperbole was fully justified. The president tweeted that the numbers were incredible, stunning and stupendous \u2013 as indeed they were. He also praised himself for the sudden reversal of fortune, which was less justified. If any one man can claim credit, it is the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who acted early and acted big to provide record amounts of stimulus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that this was good news for Trump at a time when he appeared to be overwhelmed by a triple-whammy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stock markets soared on the news. For days, equity prices have been rising amid optimism about a V-shaped recession, even though there has been little hard evidence to support this view. Now there is. The BLS said there had been sharp increases in hiring in those sectors especially hard hit by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">Covid-19</a> lockdown: hospitality, leisure, retail, construction and education. Average earnings also fell, a sign that the lower-paid employees that bore the brunt of the pandemic-induced layoffs have started to find work again.</p> <p>All that said, the labour market is still a long way from being in the sort of rude health that an incumbent president would wish it to be five months before an election. The number of job losses for March was revised up, meaning that employment in the US has fallen by 20 million since peaking earlier this year. The unemployment rate has almost quadrupled from 3.5% to 13.3% and social distancing is likely to mean that the pace of hiring will be slower than it would be otherwise. There could be a second wave of the virus when temperatures start to drop in the autumn.</p> <p>But there\u2019s no getting away from the fact that this was good news for Trump at a time when he appeared to be overwhelmed by a triple-whammy of coronavirus, street protests and rising unemployment. He will now be hopeful of further falls in unemployment as lockdown restrictions are eased in the densely populated north-eastern states, and that the better jobs news will continue to keep the stock market running hot.</p> <p>None of which is to say that Trump will get a second term come November. But if he does, the May jobs report will have proved to have been a decisive moment.</p> <h2>Facebook\u2019s stance on presidential tweets risks a staff exodus</h2> <p>Compare the responses of two social media giants to President Trump\u2019s threat to Americans protesting about the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d Trump tweeted, later claiming that he had been ignorant of the rhyme\u2019s racist origins.</p> <p>Both Facebook and Twitter hosted the message, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\" title=\"\">latter quickly distanced itself from the president\u2019s words</a>, hiding the post on the grounds that it glorified violence. In a bold move, a private company censored the White House.</p> <p>Facebook, on the other hand, took a long hard look at what Trump had said and shrugged its shoulders. Its founder and boss, Mark Zuckerberg, said Facebook was aware of the racist resonance of the president\u2019s comment but had a policy of allowing states to warn the public about the potential use of force.</p> <p>Reports of Facebook\u2019s demise are usually premature, but this could yet prove a defining moment.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t so much that Facebook risks sparking an exodus of socially conscious young people. After all, it is already the social network of their parents\u2019 generation rather than their own. Its users are, typically, a cohort who have little appetite for migrating to new platforms but who wield the kind of spending power that keeps advertising dollars rolling in.</p> <p>The Silicon Valley starlets who keep Facebook at the cutting edge of progress might prove more of a problem. Its staff are famed for their almost cultish devotion to Zuckerberg\u2019s empire but their dear leader\u2019s stance has sparked insurrection. Hundreds staged a walkout while several came forward to condemn Zuckerberg\u2019s stance. Some have even quit in disgust.</p> <p>Facebook has no shortage of brilliant engineers queuing up to work at the company. But in the fast-evolving world of Silicon Valley, it needs to attract and retain the very best. Many of them may now be looking elsewhere.</p> <h2>This crisis must not become a reason to postpone climate action</h2> <p>For those hoping the coronavirus crisis might be the moment to steer Britain towards a greener, cleaner future, the publication of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/04/chemicals-firm-basf-biggest-beneficiary-of-uk-coronavirus-loan-scheme\" title=\"\">list of companies who have benefited from the Bank of England\u2019s cheap Covid-19 loans</a> will have made depressing reading. Airlines and car manufacturers are among the major beneficiaries.</p> <p>That list was disclosed amid revelations that the government has been pondering car industry demands for a \u201cmarket stimulus\u201d, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/03/uk-car-industry-pushes-for-scrappage-scheme-to-help-buy-new-petrol-and-diesel-vehicles\" title=\"\">scrappage scheme</a>, that would not discriminate between diesel and electric vehicles.</p> <p>With the chill winds of an economic reckoning ahead, once the lockdown spring and summer is over, it could be tempting to simply boost demand and preserve any and all jobs. Right now, simply to restore a functioning economy and society might appear a sufficiently worthwhile and ambitious target for government. But the hard truth is that when the pandemic is over, the climate emergency will loom ever closer and larger \u2013 as even Boris Johnson acknowledged on Friday\u2019s World Environment Day.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1268843310162022402\" title=\"\">prime minister\u2019s tweets</a> had the scent of a Green New Deal, talking of a recovery that would help shape more resilient, relevant industries for the future. The world economy has now seen how its foundations can be rocked by a natural disaster \u2013 and, sooner or later, there will be another one. But few will now have faith that the government\u2019s actions will match its environmental rhetoric.</p> <p>So far, the only condition imposed on emergency funding appears to be demanding fare rises on Transport for London\u2019s public services. It would be perverse indeed now to refrain from the tough love of attaching environmental conditions to private firms. Any scrappage scheme that simply allowed the UK taxpayer to subsidise the purchase of more fossil-fuel cars, and did not attempt to significantly alter emissions and infrastructure, would be an appalling missed opportunity.</p>",

Activists who have long fought to cut law enforcement budgets say they are seeing an unprecedented wave of support for their ideas, with some elected officials for the first time proposing budget reductions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">divestments from police</a>. Here\u2019s what we know about the movement, and how cities and states are responding. </p> \n  <h2><strong>What does it mean to </strong><strong>\u2018defund the police\u2019</strong><strong>? </strong></h2> \n  <p>For years, community groups have advocated for defunding law enforcement \u2013 taking money away from police and prisons \u2013 and reinvesting those funds in services. The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Advocates argue that defunding is the best way forward since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">attempts to reform police practices</a> over the last five years have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-police-officers-fired-rehired-why\">failed</a>, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a>. Groups have a range of demands, with some seeking modest reductions and others viewing full defunding as a step toward abolishing contemporary police services. </p> \n  <h2><strong>How much does America currently spend on police? </strong></h2> \n  <p>In the past four decades, the cost of policing in the US has tripled and is now $115bn, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/america-s-policing-budget-has-nearly-tripled-to-115-billion\">recent analysis</a>. That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">cuts</a> to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more.

Black people have been shouldering this burden for 400 years,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThe only reason this nation has made the progress it has is because of the persistence, patience and effort of black people. The history of our nation from the very beginning in many ways was a lie, and we continue to this day, mostly black and brown people, to try to make that lie a truth so that it is no longer a lie.

It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities. We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when? We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.</a></p> \n     <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drewbrees/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Drew Brees</a> (@drewbrees) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-06T02:10:07+00:00\">Jun 5, 2020 at 7:10pm PDT</time></p>\n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n  </figure> \n  <p>\u201cTo @realdonaldtrump.

The league\u2019s commissioner, Roger Goodell, put out a statement admitting <strong>the league had been wrong not to listen to its players\u2019 opposition to racism</strong> (although, significantly, Goodell did not mention Kaepernick, who has been effectively exiled from the league). </p> \n  <p>Melissa Jacobs has written on the significance of Goodell\u2019s statement:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Goodell hardly deserves a parade for his change of tone. After all, his NFL is the one that tossed aside its moral compass and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/03/nfl-statement-george-floyd-death\">turned its back on Kaepernick</a> four years ago and every day since. Goodell\u2019s statement would have been far more powerful had he mentioned Kaepernick by name. Either way, the NFL\u2019s banishment of Kaepernick is a permanent stain on the NFL. Nothing can change that now.</p> \n   <p>Goodell\u2019s statement was not proactive but reactive to a litany of players who drew a line in the sand. But it was quick and decisive and achieved the unthinkable: The NFL gave Donald Trump the middle finger. It finally detached itself from Trump and his crazy, dangerous strategy of exploiting the flag and national anthem to suppress and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/what-is-antifa-trump-terrorist-designation\">demonize peaceful protest</a>.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>You can read the full article below:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/06/nfl-statement-wrong-players-racism-protests-roger-goodell-donald-trump-football\">The NFL did the unthinkable: it gave Donald Trump the middle finger</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-06T14:09:52.262Z\">at 3.09pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edb9db18f0883ec2fc1be2d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-06T13:56:31.851Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh has filed a grievance after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette <strong>pulled an African American reporter from its coverage</strong> of this week\u2019s protests <strong>because they believed she lacked objectivity</strong>.</p> \n  <p>In a tweet that went viral, Alexis Johnson compared the looting that has taken place at some protests over the police killing of George Floyd to the damage caused by fans at a concert by country singer Kenny Chesney. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/alexisjreports/status/1267081467731103749\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Horrifying scenes and aftermath from selfish LOOTERS who don\u2019t care about this city!!!!!<br><br>.... oh wait sorry.

  "<p>Last week, Britain became only the second country in the world whose official death toll from coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52925716\">exceeded</a> 40,000. The scale of the human tragedy is incomprehensible: at the pandemic\u2019s peak, almost 1,000 people were <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/\">losing their lives</a> a day. They have left behind more than 40,000 families who are mourning at a time when they cannot come together to share their grief.</p> <p>This is a pandemic that has tested the public health response of governments in every corner of the world. But the UK has performed poorly on any measure: the death toll is now more than double what the government\u2019s scientific advisers said would be a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-grim-milestone-of-20000\">good outcome</a>\u201d, and, at this point, it has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c53ab12-d859-4ceb-b262-f6a0221ca129\">one of the worst</a> excess deaths rates in the world.</p> <p>Yet the prime minister has offered no apology for the serious mistakes the government has made so far: its haphazard procurement of protective equipment for frontline workers; the tragedy it did too little to prevent unfolding in Britain\u2019s care homes; its unforgivably slow efforts to build up testing capacity. Last Wednesday, without a hint of contrition, he declared himself \u201cvery proud\u201d of the government\u2019s record on coronavirus, just the day before the chief operating officer of the NHS test-and-trace scheme told staff it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/04/nhs-track-and-trace-system-not-expected-to-be-operating-fully-until-september-coronavirus\">not be operating at full speed</a> for another three or four months. All along, there have been worrying signs that this was a government prepared to put politics above pandemic management; in the past two weeks, that sense has only intensified as Johnson has rushed in multiple lockdown relaxations in what looks like an attempt to distract from the rule-breaking of his top adviser. We cannot wait for a post-hoc public inquiry into what the government has got wrong.</p> <h2>Inadequate capacity to react</h2> <p>Just 10 years ago, Britain was considered to be a world leader in public health and pandemic management. Its public health rapid-response teams have been deployed to assist in emergencies around the world. But over the past decade, cuts in public spending have left local <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/public-health-cuts\">public health teams depleted</a>, funding on interventions to cut smoking and obesity has been <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/ending-the-blame-game\">reduced</a> and the tightest funding settlement in its 70-year history has left the NHS stretched beyond capacity.</p> <p>This hollowing-out of the state has left the UK far more vulnerable to the effects of a pandemic. In October 2016, the government ran a three-day simulation of an influenza pandemic. The conclusions were stark: Britain was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\">not ready</a> for a pandemic. Comprehensive recommendations were made, from increasing stocks of protective equipment for frontline staff to expanding the capacity of care homes to deal with patients in such an event. It is clear from what has happened since that these recommendations were not adequately implemented.</p> <p>On top of that, the weeks of warning we had when the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims\">in late January</a> were wasted. By early March, several other countries had significantly invested in expanding their testing capacity; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong\">the UK had not</a>. This forced the government to choose a different strategy from that which the WHO was imploring countries to take \u2013 to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d. Instead, it announced it was abandoning efforts to control the spread of the virus through testing and tracing, with its scientific advisers going on the airwaves to suggest that by allowing some spread of the virus they expected the population to build up a natural level of herd immunity. Large sporting and cultural events that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/we-were-packed-like-sardines-evidence-grows-of-mass-event-dangers-early-in-pandemic\">brought together many thousands</a> of people from Britain and abroad, including from virus-stricken countries such as Spain, continued to go ahead in the first half of March, a decision that some scientists now believe will have certainly resulted in avoidable deaths. The official scientific advice that informed this decision betrays an over-reliance on simplistic assumptions about how people interact that could have been counteracted by having more frontline public health specialists at the table. And the UK left it until very late in the day by international standards to impose the level of lockdown needed to reduce the spread of the virus. Both the political decisions and the scientific advice that produced this late decision have rightly come under intense scrutiny.</p> <h2>Logistical errors</h2> <p>These early strategic mistakes have since been compounded by a series of logistical failures. At first, it looked as though the government\u2019s efforts to expand the capacity of the state to deal with coronavirus were going well - the rapid expansion of critical care capacity via the network of Nightingale hospitals was extraordinary - but other problems quickly emerged. In particular, a shambolic failure to ensure adequate supplies of protective equipment for health and care staff exposed serious weaknesses in the NHS\u2019s decentralised procurement structures; it has taken far too long for the government to get a grip on this, allowing the infection to have spread more quickly throughout hospitals and care homes. The government has also been far too slow to increase testing capacity, focusing on meeting arbitrary targets through any means necessary; it has been criticised by the chair of the UK Statistics Authority for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/statistics-watchdog-ministers-still-misleading-public-on-coronavirus-tests\">continuing to mislead the public</a> on the number of tests being carried out. And the intense focus on increasing the NHS capacity was not extended to care homes, where there have been <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-the-number-of-excess-deaths-in-care-homes-and-hospitals-compared-with-normal-times-is-revealed-11991080\">twice as many deaths as usual</a> for this time of year.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the government\u2019s failure to acknowledge, let alone address, these errors, a similar set of mistakes seems likely with respect to its test-and-trace scheme. The effective operation of this scheme, which would allow local government to track and limit the impact of local outbreaks, will be critical in minimising a second wave of deaths from the virus as lockdown restrictions are relaxed. It is the most complex delivery project of the pandemic yet. But the government was for weeks too reticent to involve local councils, which already have contact tracing and public health expertise, instead choosing to outsource huge parts of the scheme to large contractors, such as <a href=\"https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/serco-pay-%C2%A323m-after-serious-fraud-office-probe-moj-electronic-tagging-scandal\">Serco</a>, which have a poor track record of delivering government contracts. The emphasis has been on recruiting large numbers of poorly paid, inadequately trained call centre staff. It is extremely concerning that the scheme will not be fully operational until the autumn, given the lockdown relaxations that are already under way.</p> <h2>Political expediency</h2> <p>If the government has failed to learn from its logistical failures, the same can be said of its failures to incorporate a sufficiently wide range of scientific thinking and evidence into its decisions. The number of scientific experts who say that the government left it too late to impose a lockdown has only grown. One might reasonably have expected the government to broaden the range of expertise it relies upon in response.</p> <p>Instead, it appears to be ignoring any politically inconvenient science. Last week, it began to relax several areas of the lockdown simultaneously, with more to follow in a week\u2019s time. Many scientists, including several prominent scientists who sit on the government\u2019s scientific advisory committee, have warned that a more cautious approach is needed while there are still thousands of new infections a day, the estimated reproduction rate of the virus remains dangerously close to one and before a test-and-trace system is fully operational. The government\u2019s scientific advisory committee has estimated that a limited reopening of schools alone \u2013 just one of the measures introduced last Monday \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-sage-half-class-rotas-safest-way-keep-r-down\">could increase the reproductive rate of the virus</a> by 0.2. Yet the government has pushed ahead, without setting out its calculation as to why these risks are warranted, in what appears to be an attempt to distract from the political row over the revelation that Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, broke lockdown rules at the height of the pandemic. Meanwhile, Johnson\u2019s failure to hold Cummings to account over his action sends a damaging message to the public that complying with the lockdown restrictions is optional.</p> <p>The events of the past week give further credence to the view that the government is putting populism before public health: the proposed introduction of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/03/the-tories-stumble-from-one-shambles-to-another-over-coronavirus\">a 14-day quarantine</a> for travellers coming into the UK appears to go against scientific advice and to have been motivated by the fact that Cummings believes it is regarded positively by the public. Similarly, the ridiculous scene of MPs queuing for more than a kilometre to physically cast their vote in parliament after the government ended virtual voting, even for those who are in the vulnerable category, suggests a government that is willing to ignore scientific advice when it goes against its own political interests.</p> <h2>Calls for public inquiry</h2> <p>All this points towards a depressing verdict. As the pandemic goes on, the government appears to be moving further away from, not closer to, the balance of scientific opinion; ministers are increasingly struggling with the huge logistical challenge of managing this pandemic, rather than learning from their mistakes; Johnson is approaching pandemic management more, not less, through the lens of the populist politics of the Vote Leave campaign that he and Cummings together led.</p> <p>We agree with the scientific and medical experts who wrote to the <em>Guardian</em> on Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/05/uk-experts-call-for-coronavirus-inquiry-to-prevent-deadly-second-wave\">calling for a rapid public inquiry</a>. Such an inquiry should be focused on producing practical recommendations for the autumn and could be conducted by a cross-party committee of senior parliamentary backbenchers. The government has so far proved too willing to take reckless risks with people\u2019s lives. It must be called to account for that sooner rather than later.</p>",
  "<p>You report the comment of the justice minister, Lucy Frazer, that there are increased risks in adult prisons because \u201cprisoners will spend more time in their cells, which we recognise may increase the risk of self-harm or violence\u201d (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/31/covid-causes-child-detention-crisis-and-a-timebomb-in-adult-prisons\" title=\"\">Fears grow for children in detention forced to spend most of day in cells</a>\u201d, News). This government has chosen lockdown as a deliberate strategy to avoid dealing with the political fallout from early release.</p> <p>Prisons are overcrowded and unhygienic. The secretary of state has publicly accepted that the prison population will need to be reduced and a substantial number of prisoners will need to be released in order to save lives in response to Covid-19. On present accommodation levels, between 10,000 and 15,000 would have to be released to achieve single-cell occupancy. As of 14 April 2020, according to figures from the Howard League, just 18 people had been released under the schemes. Meanwhile, 16 people (13 prisoners and three members of staff) had by then died as a result of Covid-19.</p> <p>Instead of early release, the Ministry of Justice has moved to implement a restricted regime. This stopped all social visits, education, training, access to gyms and general association, and introduced restrictions on numbers of people in exercise yards. In other words, the response to Covid-19 was to make prison life yet more restrictive, while allowing only a trickle of early releases. </p> <p>This government had the option of releasing low-risk prisoners to ease numbers and chose instead a policy that makes prisoners\u2019 lives worse, simply because it assumed it could get away with it.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Nick Moss</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\">London NW10<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"></p> <h2>Hockney\u2019s inconvenient truth</h2> <p>Defending smoking, David Hockney (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/dominic-cummings-actions-damage-public-health\" title=\"\">Letters</a>) reminds me of his fellow smoker John Comber in your Clacton-on-Sea vox pop (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/clacton-on-sea-british-common-sense-is-saving-us-from-covid-not-the-government\" title=\"\">It is common sense that is saving us now</a>\u201d, News).
