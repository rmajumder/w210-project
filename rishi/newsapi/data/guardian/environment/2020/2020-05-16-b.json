How they handle the pandemic may well be crucial at the presidential election this November too, writes my colleague David Smith.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Just as in the 2016, the swing states bring national trends into sharp focus.

Southern states such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgi\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas\">Texas</a> were among the first to allow shops and businesses to reopen.</p> \n   <p>\u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">Trump said in the White House rose garden</a> on Friday while announcing a major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/the-race-for-a-vaccine-how-trumps-america-first-approach-slows-the-global-search\">US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine</a>.</p> \n   <p>Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe fundamental problem for the Democratic party is that in order to defeat Trump, they almost have to cheerlead for a bad economy and they also have to cheerlead for new [coronavirus] hotspots in swing states. It sounds gruesome, but really that\u2019s so far what they\u2019re banking on to beat Trump.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAnd in this case, Trump is absolutely smarter than that and what he is offering, not only his base but voters in swing states, is hope. It\u2019d actually be reminiscent, in a much less articulate way, of Ronald Reagan.

Both of these shows are being broadcast live, so I have a very limited idea of what the format is; please bear with me as I attempt to navigate all the musical glitter cannons.</p> <p>As I said, there\u2019s no official competition this year \u2013 it\u2019s just a joyous celebration of what would have been a brilliant Eurovision year. I\u2019m gutted for the contestants and fans that it\u2019s not happening, but we still have the music, we still have the performers and we still have the amazing Eurovision community around the world.

  "<p>A few years ago, a pretty young woman approached me in the lunchroom of the building where I began work on my novel, The Weekend.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re writing about ageing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. I was, I said, smiling.</p> <p>She considered my 50 year-old face for a few long seconds before shuddering, \u201cI\u2019m terrified of ageing.\u201d</p> <p>I burst out laughing.</p> <p>But she\u2019s not alone. Looking down the tunnel to old age, it seems we\u2019re all afraid. But of what, exactly? How should we think about growing old?</p> <p>***</p> <p>At a dinner I sat next to a darkly witty gerontologist. He was under no illusions about very old age \u2013 at one point in our conversation there came some pragmatic deliberation about the best way to kill yourself when the time came. But he was also keen to stamp on a few old-people cliches.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/oct/23/what-is-it-about-ageing-that-is-so-confronting\">What is it about ageing that is so confronting? \u2013 Full Story podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He told me of an elderly man brought to an appointment by his children. They were deeply concerned, wanting him assessed for dementia. His major symptom was falling in love with a sex worker, moving her into his house, giving her money and property. The doctor reluctantly put him through rounds of rigorous tests \u2013 and found absolutely nothing wrong with his cognition or psychology. He was sane, he was loved, he was happy. The doctor hooted with delight as he told me this story.</p> <p>Later, he asked me: \u201cHow many years of your life would you trade for a Booker Prize?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?! None!\u201d I replied. I was surprised at the vehemence and speed of my answer, and that I knew it to be absolutely true.</p> <p>Then he asked, \u201cWhat if they were the years between 85 and 95?\u201d</p> <p>Hmmm.</p> <p>***</p> <p>My friend J reports on her mother, very slowly dying in a nursing home. She\u2019s in her late 90s, and so frail her heart has not the strength to push blood to the extremities of her body. Her hands and feet are bloodless, cold. Yet when she\u2019s wheeled into a patch of sunshine in the garden, she smiles with deep, sensual pleasure. \u201cHow lovely this is,\u201d she says, with relish. Soaking up the warmth, the sound of the trees moving above her.</p> <p>J\u2019s sister leaves a nursing home visit one day in bleak distress. \u201cI can\u2019t go in there any more,\u201d she says.</p> <p>J agrees that it\u2019s very hard, but is curious: What especially prompted this today?</p> <p>Her sister\u2019s expression is almost angry. \u201cIt\u2019s that she just \u2013 lies there. She\u2019s so \u2026useless.\u201d</p> <p>Another friend\u2019s mother, also in her 90s, was taken to inspect a potential nursing home. Through a doorway she saw some residents in an exercise class.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them?\u201d she barked loudly.</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d her daughter said. \u201cThey\u2019re just \u2026 old.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d said the mother viciously, \u201cthey look <em>retarded</em>.\u201d</p> <p>A different woman, unwell at 79, needed aqua therapy at a rehab centre but refused to enter the pool. \u201cI\u2019m not getting in that water. It\u2019s full of <em>disgusting old bodies</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone in the pool was visibly younger than she.</p> <p>A man in late middle age invited his 86 year-old father to live with him and his family. It hasn\u2019t worked out well. The son describes the sound of his father\u2019s walker creaking down the hall. \u201cI hate him,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Is this dread of the mirror so deeply rooted in all of us? Is it a biological imperative, to turn away as soon as we catch its reflection?</p> <p>***</p> <p>In 2015, a review in an Australian newspaper rebuked Edna O\u2019Brien for her wild, chaotic and (I thought) stupendously adventurous novel, The Little Red Chairs. The reviewer\u2019s main point was not so much that the book was flawed, though it surely is, but more importantly that the cause of these flaws was the author\u2019s advanced age. What I read, between the faux-respectful lines, was an unprinted command to O\u2019Brien: You\u2019re old. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself. Shut up.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien was 85 at the time. Now she\u2019s 89 and her new novel, Girl, about the Nigerian girls abducted by Boko Haram, was published in September 2019.</p> <p>Not shutting up, then.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Our predictions for old age foresee an epoch of physical incapacity and psychic misery, in contrast with our vital, flourishing youth. But last night on my couch I spent five minutes scribbling down a list of the troubles that plagued me and those in my social circle \u2013 middle class, well educated, well resourced \u2013 before we turned 50.</p> <p>The list: Major depression. Anorexia and bulimia. A birth malformation necessitating 15 years of agonisingly painful surgery and follow-up. Panic attacks and agoraphobia. Kidney disease. Broken arms and legs. Chronic, intensifying lung disease. Bipolar disorder leading to job and relationship loss, financial disaster. Endometriosis. Crohn\u2019s disease and irritable bowel syndrome with frequent hospitalisation. Asthma, fatal. Asthma, chronic, multiple hospitalisations. Excruciating diverticulitis. Migraines and an inability to hold a job. Severe postnatal depression. HIV/AIDs, mostly fatal. Type 1 diabetes and complications. Juvenile arthritis with attendant chronic immobilising pain. Major paranoid psychosis, forced hospitalisation and trauma. Cardiac problems, multiple open-heart surgeries. Schizophrenia causing lifelong inability to work and extreme social isolation. Melanoma. Bowel cancer, fatal. Breast cancer, fatal and non-fatal. Brain cancer, fatal and non-fatal. Stevens-Johnson syndrome caused by medical malpractice. Stomach cancer, fatal. Strokes, locked-in syndrome, fatal. Severe addiction to illegal drugs, alcohol, prescription painkillers. Chronic and acute immobilising pain in spine, knee, neck, foot. Knee and shoulder surgery, severely limiting mobility. High blood pressure. Car accidents, frequently fatal. Farm accidents. Multiple sclerosis. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Suicide attempts. Suicide.</p> <p>After five minutes I stopped scribbling. Excluding a couple of the cancers, almost all of these issues had first occurred before age 30; many have persisted into the fifth and sixth decades. Yet some cognitive dissonance allows us to perceive even long-term disorders in youth as somehow aberrant, manageable and far less horrifying than the potential \u201cdegradations\u201d of old age.</p> <p>I recently saw a birthday card carrying the image of a haughtily elegant middle-aged woman in 1950s attire. The caption read, \u201cHoney, you couldn\u2019t pay me to be 20.\u201d I bought it immediately.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The day I turned 50, I felt a mysterious surge of what I could only think of as power</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was not a happy or a healthy young person. I had chronic asthma exacerbated by smoking; I was unfit; my diet was ordinary. \u201cOrphaned\u201d by 29, I spent most of my 20s and 30s in grief. I was deeply anxious with little confidence, my fretful neediness causing relationship problems. For many of those years, I cried every week.</p> <p>The day I turned 50, I felt a mysterious surge of what I could only think of as power. A deep optimism, energy and peacefulness took up space inside me. Give or take a few crises since, it hasn\u2019t really left. In my mid-50s I\u2019m physically and emotionally stronger, healthier, more calmly loved and loving, more productive, more organised, smarter, wealthier and exponentially happier than I ever was in my youth. In the past four years I\u2019ve really cried about three times, on one occasion because a good friend died.</p> <p>I mentioned my mid-life happiness at a public event once. A woman in the audience called out cheerfully, \u201cYou think it\u2019s great when you\u2019re 50 \u2013 wait till you\u2019re 70!\u201d</p> <p>There are global studies showing what\u2019s called \u201cthe paradox of age\u201d, a U-curve revealing that from childhood onwards happiness declines, and then dramatically rises. We\u2019re most miserable in our 40s, but things pick up around 50; happiness at 90 far exceeds that at 18. This upswing is partly owing to life experience, but is also a direct result of getting older, <a href=\"https://www.margithenderson.com/the-paradox-of-aging-the-happiness-u-curve/\">say psychologists</a>: \u201cThe biological, cognitive and emotional changes of ageing itself \u2026 result in better emotional regulation, greater equanimity and compassion, more comfort with ambiguity, deeper gratitude and a focus upon meaningful engagement in the present.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4093739fbc5bcdacb5d3c510968d2dbc8edfb641\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4093739fbc5bcdacb5d3c510968d2dbc8edfb641/0_0_618_800/386.jpg\" alt=\"Birthday card with woman in retro suit and the phrase honey, you couldn't pay me to be twenty\" width=\"386\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birthday card from the website annetaintor.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: annetaintor.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having published a novel about older women, I\u2019m now seeing evidence of joyful, mischievous ageing everywhere I go. A woman at a book event tells me that at 77, she\u2019d resigned herself to a life that was winding down, finishing up. Instead, she says in astonishment, \u201cI can\u2019t stop the ideas coming. I just have ideas and ideas and ideas!\u201d She motions with both hands outwards from her head, in a delighted gesture of pouring abundance. Her husband sits beside her, beaming.</p> <p>Another day I overhear two women \u2013 perhaps they\u2019re 80 \u2013 outside a cinema. One tells the other she\u2019s being badgered to visit her daughter, a long drive away in the country. She looks into the middle distance, then says serenely, \u201cI think she wants me to go before I <em>lose my licence.</em>\u201d The two women look at each other for a second, then burst into wild cackles. They gather their bags and stride into the movie house.</p> <p>***</p> <p>What am I afraid of, when I think about old age? I\u2019d like to say nothing, but that would be untrue. Dementia, obviously. Relentless physical pain so bad it eclipses small pleasures. Being forced to live with people I dislike. Loss of autonomy. The kind of poverty that destroys autonomy. Unstinting boredom caused by an inability to read or hear.</p> <p>I fear becoming a bitter, self-pitying person. Taking up genealogy. Boring other people to death with my \u2018wonderful stories\u2019.</p> <p>What am I not afraid of? Living alone. Being \u201cinvisible\u201d. The body\u2019s gradual decline, notwithstanding the above. Death.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible I\u2019m completely deluded. When these things befall me, I\u2019ll probably be terrified.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In \u201cWhy we can\u2019t tell the truth about ageing\u201d, an article in the New Yorker, Arthur Krystal sneers at the recent proliferation of \u201cfeel-good\u201d books about getting older. It\u2019s sheer trendiness to put a positive spin on growing old, Krystal grouches: the truth is, it sucks \u2013 please let\u2019s stop the lying.</p> <p>Unconvinced by the U-curve, then.</p> <p>But he has a point. It\u2019s true that alongside the horror and revulsion there has now emerged quite a bit of jolly crusading about the fabulousness of old age. Like Krystal, I too find irksome the anti-ageism books refusing to acknowledge the downsides, those calling for a special new language with which to \u201ccelebrate\u201d ageing. Ditto the idiotic, sappy memes that pop up now and then on social media. (Wrinkles are engraved smiles? Jesus Christ.) Nor am I drawn to heartwarming movies in the genre that New York Times critic Neil Genzlinger calls Old People Behaving Hilariously. I cheer when Anjelica Huston sniffs her disdain for \u201capologetically humble or humiliating\u201d film roles, like one in \u201can old-lady cheerleader movie\u201d. I\u2019m with you, Anjelica, I think. When I\u2019m 67 I want my work taken seriously, too. But then I see a response from Jacki Weaver, who\u2019s in the old-lady cheerleader movie. When she read Huston\u2019s comments, Weaver says, \u201cI just laughed. And then I said, \u2018Well, she can go fuck herself.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I snort jubilantly into my coffee cup. Go, Jacki. I\u2019m with you, too.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Palliative care nurses have told me people almost always die as they live. A person who has lived with acceptance and gratitude will die in gracious acceptance. One who\u2019s lived in bitterness and entitlement and anger will likely die in the same state. Suddenly it\u2019s blindingly obvious to me that ageing is the same; all our prior years are practice for the hard stuff of getting old. When I think of the old individuals I know who express delight and curiosity, a sense of purpose and appreciation, in ordinary daily life, I realise that give or take a few tragedies, they\u2019ve always been this way. It\u2019s their default state. When I think of the unhappiest old people I know \u2013 victimised, spiteful, ungrateful for small pleasures, eternally dissatisfied and offended \u2013 I look back and see those traits governing their early and middle years too.</p> <p>Note to self: Practise hard.</p> <p>Question to self: When is it too late to change one\u2019s default state?</p> <p>***</p> <p>The Good Weekend magazine carries an account of life in a nursing home (\u201cone of the good ones\u201d) by a perceptive retired journalist in his early 80s. He writes brilliantly, the by-line is a pseudonym and the article is gloomy stuff.

More than 11,000 cases had been identified in Wisconsin as of Thursday night, according to a New York Times database, and at least 434 people had died. More than 63,000 cases had been identified in Pennsylvania as of Thursday night, along with about 4,300 deaths, the Times reported.</p> <p>Just as in the 2016, the swing states bring national trends into sharp focus. Democratic governors across the country have generally urged caution, particularly in major cities, citing concerns for public health from a virus that has killed more than 85,000 people in the US \u2013 more than any other country in the world.</p> <p>But Republican governors have tended to err on the side of reopening faster, alarmed that more than 36m Americans have submitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-unemployment-and-employment-statistics\">unemployment</a> claims since mid-March and retail sales dipped 16.4% last month. Southern states such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgi\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas\">Texas</a> were among the first to allow shops and businesses to reopen.</p> <p> \u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">Trump said in the White House rose garden</a> on Friday while announcing a major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/the-race-for-a-vaccine-how-trumps-america-first-approach-slows-the-global-search\">US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine</a>.</p> <p>Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps.</p> <p>\u201cThe fundamental problem for the Democratic party is that in order to defeat Trump, they almost have to cheerlead for a bad economy and they also have to cheerlead for new [coronavirus] hotspots in swing states. It sounds gruesome, but really that\u2019s so far what they\u2019re banking on to beat Trump.</p> <p>\u201cAnd in this case, Trump is absolutely smarter than that and what he is offering, not only his base but voters in swing states, is hope. It\u2019d actually be reminiscent, in a much less articulate way, of Ronald Reagan. He\u2019s basically saying, \u2018I got you to the promised land economically once, I will get you back to the promised land economically again\u2019.</p> <p>Schiller added: \u201cTrump will run on a message of hope from now until November, and he\u2019ll basically dare the Democrats to prove him wrong. And then he\u2019ll say, \u2018You don\u2019t believe in America. You\u2019re betting against America.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting corner that he\u2019s boxing the Democrats into and I think they\u2019re hoping that people realise that the mismanagement of messaging on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19\">Covid</a> and additional things like tariffs against China and supply chains undermine Trump, but those are very sophisticated arguments to make. When the Democrats have to make sophisticated arguments, the Democrats lose. The good news for the Democrats, the only saving grace, is that Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/13/joe-biden-trump-2020-election\">can speak swing state language.\u201d</a></p>",
  "<p>It is now 10 weeks since league football was last played in England, the longest suspension of the game since the inauguration of the League in 1888 (although there used to be a respectful pause for three months in the summer for cricket). Even during the wars, football did not stop for as long as this. As the Bundesliga resumes and the Premier League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/15/single-failed-covid-19-test-spells-quarantine-for-premier-league-squads\">steps up its plans for a restart</a>, it\u2019s worth considering why. Money may be a prime driving force now, but that hasn\u2019t always been the case; since it was invented there has been an urge to get football played.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/15/single-failed-covid-19-test-spells-quarantine-for-premier-league-squads\">Single failed Covid-19 test spells quarantine for Premier League squads</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. The following day, there was a full English league programme. A day later the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, large public gatherings were suspended and the season abandoned. Yet within two months, regional leagues had been established. Arsenal, for instance, hammered Sunderland 5-2 on 2 September and then beat Charlton 8-4 in their inaugural southern league fixture on 21 October. It is difficult to be sure of attendances, but in excess of 10,000 turned up for both their games against West Ham.</p> <p>The War Cup final on 8 June 1940 \u2013 which kicked off at 6.30pm despite fears of bombing raids \u2013 drew 42,300 to Wembley, the restrictions on public gatherings long since lifted. The remarkable aspect of football in the second world war is how much of it there was. In Germany, they kept playing until the end of April 1945. In France, war champions were declared each year, although the 1943-44 season was incomplete. The Netherlands missed only one season, Italy two.</p> <p>Hungary was invaded twice, first by the Germans and then by the Soviets, and yet football never stopped. At times the juxtaposition of detail becomes absurd. On 6 December 1944, with Nazi-occupied Budapest under bombardment from the Red Army, the Ujpest coach, Geza Kertesz, who was working with a resistance group that had been supplying details on troop movements to the United States, took a training session then held a press conference previewing the upcoming derby against Ferencvaros. That evening he was arrested by local fascists and handed over to the Gestapo; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07V2LG58T/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i2\">two months later he was executed</a> as the Germans prepared to retreat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a0e0bbd04fbab9e11951be66ed82ec171580478\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a0e0bbd04fbab9e11951be66ed82ec171580478/0_122_3120_1872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 1940 War Cup final, won 1-0 by West Ham against Blackburn at Wembley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1940 War Cup final, won 1-0 by West Ham against Blackburn at Wembley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Weston/Daily Mail/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which tell us what, exactly? First, that football is resilient. It adapts to circumstance and carries on, whether that means rejigging competitions and regulations, guest players or limited crowds. Second, and perhaps more pertinently, there has always been a demand for it, from both authorities and fans.</p> <p>After the German invasion of Ukraine, a league was quickly established as part of a process of \u201cnormalisation\u201d \u2013 which is what led ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/mar/11/europeanfootball.sport1\">to the \u201cdeath match\u201d</a> between Start, a bakery side that featured a number of former Dynamo Kyiv players, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007RG74YU/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i4\">a team representing the Luftwaffe</a>. The logic that encouraged the Hungarian authorities to keep football going is the same that led the British government to waive the restrictions on crowds so people could still gather to watch football. And that is the impact football has on morale.</p> <p>This is not something to be treated glibly \u2013 and there is an obvious difference with wartime in the risk of the virus being transmitted by the act of playing. Danny Rose is right to fear players <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/11/danny-rose-raheem-sterling-reveal-doubts-footballs-return-to-action\">being forced back prematurely</a>. But just because <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/52552667\">Dominic Raab says something</a> doesn\u2019t necessarily make it superficial nonsense; it can also be glib for amateur virologists to dismiss out of hand the attempt to create a safe environment for football.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/15/premier-leagues-covid-19-code-of-conduct-form-explained\">Premier League's Covid-19 code of conduct form explained | David Hytner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was much discussion of a poll last week that suggested <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/lifestyle/survey-results/daily/2020/05/11/7a47b/2\">73% of people</a> did not anticipate their morale being lifted by the return of football. But 19% did, which seemed even more remarkable: one in five people \u2013 13 million Britons \u2013 think they will be happier with football to watch and, perhaps more important, discuss.</p> <p>It may be that any football that is played ends up being tepid, that the sense of artificiality is overpowering, the absence of fans a huge turn-off. Once Liverpool have sealed their Premier League title, how engaging will the battle against relegation or for qualification to the Champions League be, particularly when it\u2019s far from clear if or in what form next season\u2019s Champions League will take place? On the other hand, the FA Cup may find itself reinvigorated.</p> <p>And, of course, the how is hugely complex. But if the infection rate falls, if the resources are available and if a safe environment can be created, then why would football not be considering a resumption? Every other industry is assessing how to restart as lockdown begins to ease: why not football?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24f4cbf592615ce5e959329a13bdf2543b6a0ef9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24f4cbf592615ce5e959329a13bdf2543b6a0ef9/0_10_3281_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newcastle\u2019s Danny Rose (left) is among the top-flight players to express concerns about a restart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newcastle\u2019s Danny Rose (left) is among the top-flight players to express concerns about a restart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Bundesliga\u2019s return is a huge test. Borussia Dortmund\u2019s managing director, Carsten Cramer, has said the protocols to protect players went far beyond the safety measures in most other industries. There\u2019s no reason for the Premier League not to match those standards. But Cramer also noted that, on top of the human cost, \u201cif we fail, the problems afterwards [for football] will be even bigger than before\u201d.</p> <p>Football was right to stop when it did but it\u2019s right for it to consider when and how it may return. Judging precisely when the risk has been sufficiently minimised is clearly enormously difficult, there is every reason for extreme caution, and players need to be fully involved in the process, but that doesn\u2019t mean the assessment should be shirked. If the necessary threshold of safety can be achieved, the palliative effect of resumption is potentially huge. This is not just about the game or money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and thebiggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>CS Lewis observed that literature exists to remind us we are not alone. Football fulfils a similar function. It is the currency in which a vast amount of social interaction is conducted. Governments recognised that in times of crisis throughout the 20th century but football has never been bigger than it is now. After weeks of isolation, there has perhaps never been a time when it has been more important to remember we are not alone. Football can be an awful, self-interested, avaricious game at times but it can, perhaps, help with that.</p>",
  "<p>In Leipzig the players bumped elbows and grinned like this was all a little bit silly. In Dortmund Erling Haaland scored the first goal of football\u2019s plague times and stood by the corner flag with his teammates around him in a celebratory pastiche of social distancing, a strangely haunting image that will, you suspect, be recycled many times.</p> \n<p>Welcome to the new abnormal normal. Which is, needless to say, a fairly strange place to be. And yet for all the oddity of its staging, something did seem to shift over the 90 minutes of Borussia Dortmund\u2019s 4-0 defeat of Schalke at Signal Iduna Park, one of six comeback fixtures to take place in the Bundesliga, two months since football \u2013 and that rather less urgent entity, the world \u2013 went into standby mode.</p> \n<p>There was encouragement here for the industry. By the end it wasn\u2019t too hard to see how televised football might re-emerge as a functioning entity. No spitting. No hugging. No fans. No noise beyond the constant muffled echo of managerial shrieking, like the sound of somebody being water-boarded in the flat upstairs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/16/haaland-leads-way-as-dortmund-win-by-a-distance-on-bundesliga-return-against-schalke\">Haaland leads the way as Dortmund win by a distance on Bundesliga return</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But still, it worked after a fashion. There were early moments of double-take. No doubt the sight of players arriving in protective gear on sparsely occupied buses will become commonplace in time.</p> \n<p>There was the deeply weird sight of the masked subs spread in a line in their large leather touchline seats, a row of ejected fighter pilots. Both sets of players grinned and shrugged as they warmed up in front of empty stands. At one point Haaland burst out laughing.</p> \n<p>Signal Iduna Park was a poignant venue in this respect, a ground that is as much as any in Europe an emblem of the importance of here and now and being present. This is an unshowy footballing giant, lodged in the leafy flatlands of the Ruhr and circled by low-lying industrial hubs. On match days the walkways are crammed with sausage stalls and beer taps. This is the essence of Dortmund, the place where the club\u2019s heart is located. They had 81,365 in here for the last home game, in February. The contrast in the opening seconds was stark. Why are we actually playing, you kept wondering as the ball was passed around with a forced sense of urgency and Dortmund in particular seemed to be playing through a laudanum haze.</p> \n<p>There is, of course, a note of weirdness in the basic idea of football as our first shared step to normality. There\u2019s a famous Dave Chapelle joke about MTV broadcasting the views of the rapper Ja Rule shortly after the Word Trade Centre was taken down. As Chapelle points out: \u201cI want some answers that Ja Rule might not have right now.\u201d Perhaps there are those among us who felt all along that one day Steve McManaman would be the voice to guide our first tentative steps out of a global pandemic. But then football was always likely to jostle its way to the front of this queue, to plonk its tankard down on the bar for first helpings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8dcabd9edd086f28c1289c6f0943166f0ebe682\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8dcabd9edd086f28c1289c6f0943166f0ebe682/119_0_2506_1504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schalke\u2019s players enter the stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schalke\u2019s players enter the stadium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Meissner/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And it must be said BT Sport\u2019s pared-back team did a fine job with a deeply odd occasion. James Richardson, ruggedly nautical in greying lockdown beard, looked absolutely delighted to be anchoring the show. His chief pundit Raphael Honigstein\u2019s usual air of ironic distances was only enhanced by the vast expanse of desk between them.</p> \n<p>On commentary Paul Dempsey worked hard, and successfully, to bridge the oddity on the pitch, although it was touch and go at first. The ball was passed in silence. There was a foul and nobody howled or screamed.

Perhaps not.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cfc40fdd-4b6b-4c33-99b3-8a801b1cd400\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-oqc89PYZkc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Steadily the day began to move, the old muscle memory kicking in.

Perhaps just a kind of monotone noise-cancelling drone that blocks out all sense of sound from your brain. Is Mark Lawrenson even available?</p> \n<p>Haaland scored with 29 minutes gone, the absence of a crowd offering the bonus of a lovely \u201cching\u201d noise as the ball hit the pole in the side of the net. And Dortmund ran the rest of the game. The final minutes were a kind of zombie game, played out by some tired athletes on both sides.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/16/bundesliga-makes-strangely-clinical-return-in-eerie-stadiums\">Empty seats and elbow bumps as Bundesliga makes clinical return</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>No matter, though.

And no doubt the Premier League, fearful of losing market share, will now look to accelerate its own return.</p> \n<p>Before then it must be said that Germany has earned this, has earned the right to be first, to stand alone, crowd-less, staging football. The Bundesliga isn\u2019t declaring this health crisis to be over. It is instead declaring its own government\u2019s relative competence in the early months of this crisis, the mass testing that means football\u2019s own demands \u2013 testing through the whole process for all players and officials \u2013 makes it part of the wider culture rather than a special case.</p> \n<p>In Britain the approach has been woollier, to the extent the Premier League would be a most unwelcome guest in the middle of this loss of control.

You open your email, and your utilities bill is still there.</p> <p><strong>Do you worry that a collection of historical short stories will seem irrelevant in the middle of a pandemic?<br></strong>A book is a long build. You hope you\u2019re writing something which has meaning, and which is a commentary on what it\u2019s like to be a human in the world. But now, yes, there are these very specific challenges to being human in the world. It\u2019s hard not to look at the book through the lens of the virus. What\u2019s surprising is that while there\u2019s no virus in it, certain stories in the collection do jump out at me as being what you could call Covid stories.</p> <p><strong>Which ones?<br></strong>The Line Agent Pascal, which is about a telegraph operator in the Amazon; the way he builds human relationships and maintains them without being in the physical presence of other people. And the one that tells the story of a woman who\u2019s caring for her son in Regency-era London, a boy who has asthma because of the terrible pollution. It\u2019s about trying to take care of someone when outside the door there\u2019s something unseen but quite threatening \u2013 which feels pretty close to what people are dealing with now.</p> <p><strong>Like Chekhov, you\u2019re a writer-physician. What\u2019s the relationship between these two careers, for you?<br></strong>There have been periods of time when I didn\u2019t write; when I was training I really couldn\u2019t much. But I wanted it in my life, and I wanted medicine in my life. Why? As a psychiatrist, I\u2019m highly suspicious of any answer I might give to this question. On some fundamental level, I need the community of other people. Being by myself in a room isn\u2019t easy. There\u2019s so much about writing that\u2019s not easy. In a hospital, it\u2019s quite clear what you have to do. With writing, speaking as someone who spent 14 years on a novel, there are long stretches where nothing seems to be happening.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One colleague tells me that a number of her patients feel almost relieved during this time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Do they inform each other?<br></strong>Yes. It\u2019s interesting: I feel like the writing flows back more towards the medicine, rather than the other way round. Thinking about the motivations of my characters has changed and deepened my encounters with patients; I see 10 patients in a day at the hospital, and in a way, those meetings are like a collection of stories. Each one is at a point of crisis, and thinking about their back story and what brought them to this point is much more interesting and helpful than running through a list of criteria for diagnosis, important though that is.</p> <p><strong>What do you make of the many recent books by psychiatrists and psychoanalysts in which they make use of encounters with patients?<br></strong>There are ethical complexities. That\u2019s not to say that it doesn\u2019t need to be done; it probably does. The classic case study is in decline, and that\u2019s too bad because without it medical literature just becomes one statistical study after another. But we need to ask if a patient can ever truly consent to being written about. I really don\u2019t want to write about my patients, and I don\u2019t want them to feel like they might be written about.</p> <p><strong>Is the pandemic having a deleterious effect on mental health?<br></strong>We don\u2019t know yet. There\u2019s no data. There are only experts talking. Being apart from other people, and in a state of uncertainty, especially economic uncertainty, can have huge effects. But people have different responses. One colleague tells me that a number of her patients feel almost relieved during this time; they had seen the world as troubled and now other people recognise it as being so, too. I was teaching a class last term, and we were talking about the line in <em>King Lear</em>: \u201cBut where the greater malady is fixed/ the lesser is scarce felt.\u201d This may also be the case for some [the global crisis almost cancelling out the personal one]. But one reason I\u2019m wary is that there is a huge cultural component to mental health. Someone oscillating between calm and anxiety may feel that the narrative only allows them to suffer.</p> <p><strong>Is reading good for mental health?<br></strong>I know that reading does wonders for my mental health, and there is some body of research suggesting that it does so for others too. I remember feeling giddy when reading <em>War and Peace</em> for the first time last year and rereading <em>Moby-Dick</em>. I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with the subject matter \u2013 I remember rereading both <em>Anna Karenina</em> and <em>Madame Bovary</em> in the last year or so and thinking to myself how utterly grateful I was to have been born after Tolstoy and Flaubert, that these books were here to accompany me on my passage through this life. Both are hardly \u201chappy\u201d or \u201crelaxing\u201d stories, but the language and the richness of the characters literally made me feel more alive.</p> <p><strong>What are you reading at the moment?<br></strong>Lately I\u2019ve been returning to travel narratives \u2013 Darwin\u2019s <em>Voyage of the Beagle</em><em> </em>and Alfred Russel Wallace\u2019s <em>Malay Archipelago </em>in particular. I don\u2019t think that it is a surprising choice for someone in isolation. I love the litanies of plants and animals they encounter, which have a way of populating the imagination, like some kind of forest of the mind.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Registry of My Passage Upon the Earth</em> by Daniel Mason is published by Pan Macmillan (\u00a314.99).

But there is growing optimism the two sets of Test tourists are willing to make the journey and put their players in such extreme lockdown conditions.</p> \n<p>Further talks with Cricket West Indies are due to take place on Monday, while an initial conference call with the Pakistan board on Friday, which included the head coaches Misbah-ul-Haq and Chris Silverwood, has reportedly resulted in Pakistan committing to three Tests and three Twenty20 matches.</p> \n<p>Drafted by the ECB\u2019s science and medicine team, an introductory outline was circulated to the counties last week explaining the process for the return of professional cricket that, from Wednesday, will see the first of 30 England players behin individual training under phase one.

Some zones may be required to have more than one functional area working in it at the same time, such as players and ground staff on the outfield before the start of a match, but they cannot interact.</p>\n    <p><b>Contact clusters</b><br><br>Individuals within a functional area can form their own exclusive social pod that, provided everyone involved commits to remaining socially distant from outsiders, allows them to relax in each other\u2019s company.</p>\n    <p>All three concepts are designed to minimise the number of interactions an individual makes and reduces the risk of transmission in the event of an outbreak.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After phase two, where training is permitted to take place in small groups, players and support staff from both sides would enter an \u201cisland site\u201d \u2013 a cricket ground with a hotel \u2013 for phase three and, following initial testing for coronavirus, they will then live and train on site but only within strictly designated zones. <br><br>Ashley Giles, England\u2019s cricket director, has confirmed they are looking at ways England\u2019s players can leave and re-enter the so-called \u201cbubble\u201d given a block of nine weeks away from friends and family that covers preparation time, practice games and the six proposed Tests, starting at Hampshire\u2019s Ageas Bowl on 8 July.</p> \n<p>However when the squad is together in the ground and part of a regular testing and screening programme it forms a \u201cfunctional area\u201d, one of a number of separate personnel groups that also include venue staff, the ECB events team, groundstaff, broadcasters/media and match officials within an overall headcount of around 300.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7cd25d1bd8975ce55465a37a40e8c19a54d6f12\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7cd25d1bd8975ce55465a37a40e8c19a54d6f12/0_164_5509_3307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The hotel at the Ageas Bowl is set to form part of the bio-secure environment that players will enter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hotel at the Ageas Bowl is set to form part of the <br>bio-secure environment that players will enter.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>These FAs must each stick to their designated zones within the hotel and stadium and though two such groups may find themselves down to operate in the same zone at times \u2013 for example players and ground staff on the outfield before the start of a match \u2013 contact between them must be kept to an absolute minimum.</p> \n<p>The system is designed to create clearly defined distance between FAs and, in theory, prevent the spread of Covid-19 should it penetrate the ground. Perhaps the most intriguing element of the plan is the concept of \u201ccontact clusters\u201d, where individuals within an FA group can create their own exclusive sub-group.</p> \n<p>The principle here is that individuals within a \u201ccontact cluster\u201d avoid anything but essential contact with those outside of it and so can be more comfortable within what is called \u201ca circle of trust\u201d. How this applies to the social dynamics of two playing squads that will both be up to 30 cricketers-strong remains to be seen.</p> \n<p>Schematics for the grounds detail the various zones and there will be signposted one-way systems to navigate on foot. Personnel will also be urged to sanitise hands at entry points to communal areas and use alternative methods of communication, such as telephone calls or video conferencing, where possible.</p> \n<p>While the introductory document states an intention to create isolation areas for individuals who become ill, as well as exit strategies and contact tracing, a full medical protocol for how a possible outbreak may be tackled has not yet been shared and will be crucial to receiving sign-off from the government.<br><br>England\u2019s players have had a number of the details above explained to them already \u2013 one told the Observer it was \u201cmind-blowing\u201d \u2013 but much will hinge on convincing West Indies, the first set of tourists, they will be safe to leave the relatively untouched Caribbean to fly to one of the pandemic\u2019s hotspots.<br><br>Giles has already admitted the plans have a number of \u201cpinch points\u201d that need fully ironing out before they can be put back to the government, while the International Cricket Council is yet to rule on whether players who have passed testing can still apply saliva to the ball and, if not, permit some form of legalised ball tampering.</p> \n<p>The bill for creating these bio-secure venues and flying two touring teams into the country on charter flights will run well into seven figures and the proposed tours will ultimately hinge on how the national picture looks in the coming weeks as lockdown measures in the UK begin to be relaxed.</p> \n<p>With the ECB facing losses of \u00a3380m in the event of no cricket being staged this summer \u2013 and six Tests worth an estimated \u00a3120m in broadcast revenues \u2013 the governing body is throwing every possible resource at getting international cricket back on television.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/14/england-face-soaring-costs-to-get-west-indies-series-started\">England face soaring costs to get West Indies series started</a> </p> \n</aside>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Italy records lowest daily death toll in 10 weeks</h2> <p>Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll has risen to 31,763, as a further 153 deaths were reported, its lowest 24-hour increase in deaths since 9 March. The country\u2019s total official death toll now stands at 31,763, the third highest in the world after those of the United States and Britain.</p> <h2>Spanish government aims to extend state of emergency</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s government will seek to extend the country\u2019s coronavirus state of emergency for the last time until late June, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez,<strong> </strong>said on Saturday as the country\u2019s daily death toll reached a near eight-week low.</p> <h2>Thousands of Germans protest over government restrictions</h2> <p>Anti-lockdown demonstrators have taken to the streets of German cities for the second weekend in a row to protest against restrictions imposed by the government to contain the coronavirus, despite some lockdown measures having been relaxed.</p> <h2>Britain\u2019s death toll rises by 468</h2> <p>The UK\u2019s death toll from confirmed coronavirus cases has risen by 468 and now stands at 34,466. The country has recorded a total of 240,161 confirmed cases, as teaching unions have said they will work with the government to begin reopening schools in England as long as it can be done safely.</p> <h2>Zimbabwe\u2019s lockdown to stay in place</h2> <p>The southern African nation will keep its coronavirus lockdown for the time being, though businesses will be allowed to open for longer and the restrictions will be reviewed every two weeks, the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has confirmed.</p> <h2>Canada increases child benefit to help struggling families</h2> <p>The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced an increase to child benefit, which was introduced four years ago, as a lifeline for families during the pandemic. Canada\u2019s death toll increased to 5,595, up from 5,499.</p> <h2>Hungary\u2019s lockdown to be gradually lifted</h2> <p>The government will start easing lockdown restrictions in Budapest from Monday, two weeks after it ended the restrictions in the rest of the country, the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, said on his official Facebook page on Saturday.</p> <h2>Domestic flights resume in Pakistan</h2> <p>Flights between major cities in Pakistan took off again for the first time in nearly two months on Saturday, with passengers required to wear face masks and vacant seats left between passengers. International flights will remain suspended until 31 May.</p>",

At least five children have died from the condition, which has hallmarks of a rare disease known as Kawasaki syndrome.</p> \n<p>The most recently announced death from this inflammatory syndrome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/16/french-boy-dies-from-coronavirus-linked-kawasaki-diseae\">was that of a nine-year-old boy in </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/16/french-boy-dies-from-coronavirus-linked-kawasaki-diseae\">France</a></strong>. Doctors said he had developed a form of coronavirus but had no symptoms, and medics initially thought he had scarlet fever. He died on 8 May, six days after being admitted to intensive care.</p> \n<p>Despite the high toll of the coronavirus, and as new discoveries continue to emerge about its nature and impact, there are protests over the weekend in several countries, including the UK and Germany, by small groups who oppose the lockdown measures.</p> \n<p>In the <strong>US</strong>, the worst affected country in terms of both infections and deaths, the toll is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June, the CDC director, Robert Redfield, has said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/coronavirus-us-new/map\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>President Donald Trump has announced details of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">\u201cwarp-speed\u201d effort to create a coronavirus vaccine</a> by the end of the year, even as experts warn that such a breakthrough could take longer than 18 months.

But Republicans who control the Senate have vowed to block the bill, though some support its provisions aimed at helping state and local governments.</p> \n<p>Trump also suggested on Saturday his administration might resume some payments to the World Health Organization, which he has frozen after accusing the body of promoting Chinese \u201cdisinformation\u201d. WHO officials denied the claims and China has insisted it was transparent and open.</p> \n<p>One draft would see the US return to paying only 10% of its former contributions, matching China\u2019s assessed contribution.</p> \n<p>In other developments:</p> \n<p>In <strong>Australia</strong>, as coronavirus restrictions begin to ease, people have started venturing back to weekend activities such as dining out, going to beauty salons and attending birthday parties, while observing social distancing rules.</p> \n<p><strong>China </strong>has increased pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s WHO inclusion, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China. The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday; Taiwan\u2019s attendance and a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west.</p> \n<p>As <strong>Mexico</strong> moves toward a gradual reactivation of its economy from Monday, the number of new coronavirus infections grows higher every day, raising fears of a new wave of infections that other countries have seen after loosening restrictions. There were 2,437 new coronavirus test confirmations on Friday, the highest daily total yet and the second straight day with more than 2,000 new cases.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure>",
  "<p> Rihanna was a tiny child when she first walked in on her father smoking crack. The family struggled with poverty during her childhood in Barbados; her home life was marred by violent arguments and her father\u2019s crippling drug and alcohol addictions.

By the time she was 10, Rihanna had become a carer to her two younger brothers while her mother worked to support them. Her parents later divorced.</p> <p>If humble, troubled beginnings go some way to explain the drive of the most successful stars, then Rihanna makes a bold claim to be among the biggest. At 32, she enters the <em>Sunday Times</em> Rich list as Britain\u2019s wealthiest female musician.</p> <p>Born Robyn Rihanna Fenty, the pop megastar-turned-businesswoman has a fortune estimated at \u00a3468m. Eligible for inclusion in the newspaper\u2019s annual list since she moved to London over a year ago, Rihanna, who enters the musicians\u2019 category at No 3 after Andrew Lloyd Webber and Paul McCartney, is now richer than Mick Jagger and Elton John, Ed Sheeran and Adele. And, to the<a href=\"https://ew.com/music/rihanna-tells-fans-to-stop-asking-about-new-album/\"> </a><a href=\"https://ew.com/music/rihanna-tells-fans-to-stop-asking-about-new-album/\"> consternation of her fans</a>, she hasn\u2019t even released an album since 2016. She last did a concert tour the same year. </p> <p>Her rise to the top of Britain\u2019s elite list appears to have even shocked Robert Watts, who compiles it. \u201cShe somewhat caught us by surprise,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cVery few people knew she was living in the UK until last summer; now she\u2019s well placed to be the first musician to reach billionaire status in the UK.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7534bc64acb12d6b75384a5a7c927e55caa08891\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7534bc64acb12d6b75384a5a7c927e55caa08891/0_0_594_459/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jay-Z and Rihanna, right, in New York in 2005, the year she signed her first record deal with him at Def Jam.\" width=\"500\" height=\"386\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jay-Z and Rihanna, right, in New York in 2005, the year she signed her first record deal with him at Def Jam.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brad Barket/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rihanna was just 17 when her first single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEauWw9ZGrA\">Pon De Replay</a>, became an unexpected global smash hit. (Her UK label was paying such little attention to its Caribbean signing at the time, it didn\u2019t even bother spelling her name right on their first ever run of \u201cRhianna\u201d CDs).</p> <p>At 22, she became the only female artist in the history of the US Billboard chart to score four No 1 singles in a calendar year. By 24, she had won the record as the biggest-selling digital artist of all time, and at 31, Rihanna became the first black woman to run a luxury fashion house. Backed by luxury brand Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), her fashion brand has been the key to building her staggering wealth.

Her Guyanese mother was an immigrant and her father came from mixed-race heritage, black and white. \u201cThe Guyanese are like the Mexicans of Barbados,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/rihanna-new-album-vogue-interview\">told </a><em><a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/rihanna-new-album-vogue-interview\">British Vogue</a></em><a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/rihanna-new-album-vogue-interview\"> last month</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s why I really relate and empathise with Latino people who are discriminated against in America.\u201d</p> <p>Rihanna spent her early teenage years training as an army cadet. When she was 14, she formed the girl group Contrast with her friends. That summer, in 2003, the group auditioned for US music producer Evan Richards, who immediately dumped the other girls and set about making Rihanna a solo star. A meeting was arranged with Jay-Z at Def Jam records \u2013 he signed her on the spot.</p> <p>In 2007, at 19 and with three albums already under her belt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/26/popandrock\">Rihanna told the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/26/popandrock\">Observer</a></em>: \u201cThey locked me into the office \u2013 til 3am. Then Jay-Z said: \u2018There\u2019s only two ways out: out the door after you sign this deal or through this window.\u2019\u201d Naively, perhaps, she was thrilled by the story. \u201cWe were on the 29th floor,\u201d she said. \u201c[It was] very flattering.\u201d Later, she said she felt stifled by the contract she signed so young, which saw her churn out seven hit albums in seven years.</p> <p>But the release of 2007\u2019s <em>Good Girl Gone Bad</em> marked a creative turning point and saw Rihanna drop her label-mandated image which she deemed \u201cgirlie and boring\u201d to experiment with \u201cdifferent, unexpected and edgy\u201d looks. She moved on from reggae-flavoured dancehall and delivered <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvBfHwUxHIk\">Umbrella</a>, a track that earned her the first of nine Grammys and spent 71 weeks in the UK charts, staying at No 1 for 10 of them.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s now got enough incredible singles to fill five greatest hits albums, and it\u2019s amazing she\u2019s never released one,\u201d says Michael Cragg, music journalist and editor of <em>BEAT</em> magazine. \u201cShe\u2019s got one great album \u2013 <em>Anti </em>\u2013 but like Madonna, she\u2019s made so many good singles it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Her ninth album is allegedly imminent, but then it has been for the last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"685db8f9f387b382366402e2dcccbdaa72c90975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/685db8f9f387b382366402e2dcccbdaa72c90975/0_185_2200_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rihanna and her then boyfriend Chris Brown on stage in 2008, the year they made their relationship public.

A year after going public about her relationship with RnB singer Chris Brown, photos of her battered face \u2013 swollen and bruised \u2013 were leaked to the press. Brown had beaten her after an argument in the car home from an awards ceremony. The couple broke up, but reconciled several times over the next four years.</p> <p>In a 2009 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KNFzBOtESk\">US television interview with Diane Sawyer</a>, Rihanna said that Brown was her \u201cfirst big love\u201d. She had been warned that her reconciliation with him would set a bad example for young girls. \u201cI realise that my selfish decision for love could result in some getting killed,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if Chris never hit me again, who\u2019s to say that [their abusers] won\u2019t kill these girls?\u201d In 2013, back again with Brown, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rihanna-crazy-in-love-178347/\">she told </a><em><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/rihanna-crazy-in-love-178347/\">Rolling Stone</a></em>, she didn\u2019t care what people thought : \u201cI decided it was important for me to be happy \u2026 I wasn\u2019t going to let anyone\u2019s opinion get in the way of that.\u201d Months later they broke up again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"81edac08a1cfa3c6fbe7f08db41bb4d1f20ca63f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81edac08a1cfa3c6fbe7f08db41bb4d1f20ca63f/0_0_2952_4260/693.jpg\" alt=\"Rihanna sits on the shoulders of a man at California\u2019s Coachella music festival in 2012.\" width=\"693\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rihanna in the audience at California\u2019s Coachella music festival in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Polk/Getty Images for Coachella</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While music has been the backbone to her creative success, her commercial skill goes far beyond singing songs. Designers including Tom Ford and Alexander Wang have been quick to heap praise on her, marking out her daring and constant reinvention. \u201cShe\u2019s an amplified version of what a lot of girls want to look like, but she\u2019s always one step ahead of the game,\u201d designer Peter Dundas told <em>British Vogue</em>.</p> <p>Critics largely agree it\u2019s a talent that applies to her songs, too. The <em>New Yorker</em>, noting that her limited vocal range has never been the draw, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/rihannas-anti-album\">declared in 2016</a> that her \u201creal art\u201d was \u201cher accessible brand of casual, forward-thinking cool\u201d. Put plainly, Rihanna excels at producing influential pop anthems that reverberate from school discos to underground clubs.</p> <p>Rihanna is notorious for playing against pop machine\u2019s rules and has cultivated a brand \u2013 the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/badgalriri/?hl=en\">Bad Gal Riri</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/badgalriri/?hl=en\">\u201d of her Instagram handle</a> \u2013 that is unapologetically sexual.

She genuinely has to have really great taste to still be so relevant at this point in her career.\u201d</p> <p>By all accounts, Rihanna is supremely slick at what she does \u2013 with little sign that she\u2019s letting up.</p> <p>\u201cI was always trying to figure out \u2018how can I change the world? What could I do?\u2019\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em> in 2007. \u201cI think the American way is a fantasy \u2026 Their priorities are fancy cars and bling.

  "<p>Here we go again. Facebook, a tech company that suffers from the delusion that it\u2019s a nation state, has had another go at pretending that it is one. Originally, you will recall, it was going to create a global currency called <a href=\"https://libra.org/en-US/\">Libra</a> and in effect become shadow banker to the world. Strangely, a world that normally seems hypnotised by Facebook turned out to be distinctly unimpressed by that idea; after all, who would trust Facebook with money? So the project is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/18/how-the-wheels-came-off-facebook-libra-project\">effectively evaporating</a> into something that looks a bit like PayPal, which is not quite what Facebook\u2019s supreme leader, Mark Zuckerberg, had in mind.</p> <p>Nothing daunted, though, Zuck has had another hubristic idea. On the grounds that Facebook is the world\u2019s largest information-exchange autocracy (population 2.6 billion) he thinks that it should have its own supreme court. (Yes, that\u2019s the expression he originally used: later, wiser councils \u2013 possibly a guy called Nick Clegg \u2013 persuaded him that that might be just a tad presumptuous.) So it\u2019s now just an \u201coversight board for content decisions\u201d, complete with its own <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/draft-charter-oversight-board-for-content-decisions-2.pdf\">charter</a> and a 40-strong board of big shots who will, it seems, have the power \u201cto reverse Facebook\u2019s decisions about whether to allow or remove certain posts on the platform\u201d. Sounds impressive, doesn\u2019t it? But it looks rather less so when you realise what it will actually be doing. It\u2019s actually a board for locking the stable door after the horses have bolted. Let us call the Facebook oversight board by its initials: FOB.</p> <p>The names of 20 of the 40 aforementioned big shots have just been announced. The big puzzle at the moment is why some apparently sane people with reputations to lose would have chained themselves to this particular catherine wheel. Apart from anything else, they have committed themselves to endorsing Zuckerberg\u2019s overweening vanity about the central importance of Facebook to the world.</p> <p>One big surprise (for me, anyway) was that Alan Rusbridger, the former editor of the <em>Guardian</em>, should have lent his name and reputation to this circus. In an <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/why-im-joining-facebook-s-oversight-committee-f5b0c30f2d14\">essay on Medium</a> he\u2019s offered a less than convincing justification. \u201cIn the eyes of some,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe oversight board is one of the most significant projects of the digital age, \u2018a pivotal moment\u2019 in the words of Evelyn Douek, a young scholar at Harvard, \u2018when new constitutional forms can emerge that will shape the future of online discourse.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOthers are unconvinced,\u201d continues Rusbridger. \u201cSome, inevitably, will see it as a fig leaf.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Facebook is not a public body: it's a powerful and rich global corporation with no democratic legitimacy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m in the fig leaf camp, but even those like the aforementioned Douek \u2013 who evidently takes the FOB seriously \u2013 seem to have serious doubts about its viability. The most important question, she writes, is about the FOB\u2019s jurisdiction, which of Facebook\u2019s decisions the board will be able to review. \u201cThe board\u2019s \u2018bylaws\u2019 contemplate a potentially vast jurisdiction, including the power to hear disputes about groups, pages, events, ads and fact-checking,\u201d says Douek. \u201cBut the bylaws only promise this jurisdiction at some unspecified time \u2018in the future\u2019 and initially the board\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to referrals from Facebook and \u2018content that has been removed for violations of content policies\u2019 from Facebook or Instagram.\u201d Which neatly dodges the problem that many of the issues with Facebook\u2019s content moderation decisions stem not from stuff that is taken down, but the crap that the company allows to remain on its platform.</p> <p>The most puzzling aspect of this whole shebang, though, is its sheer, pretentious effrontery. Facebook is not a public body: it\u2019s a powerful and rich global corporation with no democratic legitimacy. Not only that, but its toxic business model has done a great deal in the last decade to undermine democratic institutions and practices, not to mention enabling a spot or two of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/07/facebook-myanmar-genocide-violence-hate-speech\">ethnic cleansing and genocide</a> It\u2019s as if Exxon had decided to set up a \u201csupreme court\u201d to adjudicate on its decisions to open or close oil refineries and the level of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions it would allow in the current year. </p> <p>This is part of a wider and disturbing trend \u2013 the ceding of authority by territorial sovereigns such as courts and legislatures to \u201c<a href=\"https://lpeblog.org/2017/12/06/from-territorial-to-functional-sovereignty-the-case-of-amazon/\">functional sovereigns</a>\u201d such as Amazon, Google and Facebook. Institutions like the FOB play the same role in this transition as the supposed Potemkin villages of old \u2013 impressive facades designed to hide an undesirable fact or condition \u2013 in this case the inexorable rise to power of tech corporations. </p> <h2>What I\u2019ve been reading</h2> <p><strong>1</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/sure-the-velociraptors-are-still-on-the-loose-but-thats-no-reason-not-to-reopen-jurassic-park\">Sure, the velociraptors are still on the loose, but that\u2019s no reason not to reopen Jurassic Park</a>.

  "<p>Anger is growing over the government\u2019s failure to abolish the surcharge many migrant healthcare workers must pay to access the NHS, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/government-reviewing-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-medics\">Priti Patel suggested it was under review three weeks ago</a>.</p> <p>It has emerged that the Home Office did not specifically review the charges beyond exempting on a one-year extraordinary basis both those whose visas were due to expire before October from that fee and the \u00a3400 surcharge, which will rise to \u00a3625 a year each later this year.</p> <p>The department faces renewed condemnation for not permanently scrapping the charge after the deaths of several migrant NHS workers during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe have repeatedly called for the immigration health surcharge to be waived for nursing staff,\u201d a spokesperson from the Royal College of Nursing said. \u201cThey are already contributing through taxes and national insurance \u2013 to ask them to pay twice is simply wrong.</p> <p>\u201cThis charge must be stopped. Following her announcement that the charge was being reviewed, we wrote to the home secretary urging action. We await a response and commitment to act on this.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) council, told the Independent: \u201cIn the last two months, we\u2019ve seen a huge outpouring of support for our frontline staff, including those talented colleagues who have come to work here from overseas.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they would be dismayed to find that the government is continuing to penalise them with this absurd fee during the crisis.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The shadow health minister, Justin Madders, said the NHS would collapse without overseas staff and that it was \u201csimply unconscionable\u201d for them to be subject to extra charges.</p> <p>\u201cMinisters frequently tell us how proud they are of the incredible effort being made by NHS staff yet when they have the opportunity to do something tangible to demonstrate their appreciation they pull the rug up,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Home Office tweeted on Saturday afternoon: \u201cIt is wrong to suggest the home secretary said there would be a formal review into this policy. All government policies are continuously kept under review.\u201d</p> <p>After Patel\u2019s apparent announcement,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/03/calls-grow-scrap-nhs-surcharge-migrant-healthcare-workers-coronavirus\"> there were mounting calls</a> for the surcharge to be permanently ditched. It was introduced in 2015 as part of hostile environment laws designed to discourage illegal immigration and combat health tourism. The surcharge must be paid alongside taxes and national insurance contributions.</p> <p>Dr Chandra Kanneganti, the national chair of the British International Doctors Association, said: \u201cWe know BAME doctors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/nhs-bosses-say-bame-staff-should-be-risk-assessed-to-cut-covid-19\">are disproportionately getting ill</a>. To have to pay for the same service that they are putting their lives at risk for doesn\u2019t seem fair. This charge needs to be scrapped completely for NHS overseas workers.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said the surcharge raised about \u00a3900m for the NHS between 2015 and 2018-19. During this time the cost has repeatedly risen and healthcare workers have said they struggled to pay the fees. For other doctors and nurses, the charges are probably a deterrent when they consider coming to the UK.</p> <p>At the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing last month, Patel said in response to a detailed question from ITV regarding the surcharge: \u201cWe have a range of measures that are, like most things in government, under review, and we are looking at everything including visas, surcharge \u2026 We are looking at everything we can do to continue to support everyone on the frontline in the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAs the home secretary said, in light of the exceptional circumstances that coronavirus presents, it is right that policies are kept under review.</p> <p>\u201cThis includes how the immigration health surcharge applies. For example, the Home Office has already announced free automatic visa extensions for overseas frontline NHS workers who are working to beat the virus, including an exemption from the immigration health surcharge.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Roman author Pliny the Younger advised \u201ckissing the hairy muzzle of a mouse\u201d as a cure for the common cold. His fellow countrymen linked mice to the god Apollo, who could bring deadly plague upon them with his arrows.</p> <p>So they might not have seen the funny side of a lifelike mouse made out of a strip of leather which has been newly discovered at the Roman fort of Vindolanda, south of Hadrian\u2019s Wall, near Hexham, Northumberland.</p> <p>About the size of a real rodent and lying unnoticed until now among thousands of leather offcuts held by the Vindolanda Museum since 1993, it looks as if it had been squashed flat after being run over \u2013 perhaps by a Roman cart. </p> <p>Whether it was a practical joke or a child\u2019s toy will never be known, but the find has excited archaeologists, who are unaware of anything comparable from the Roman world.</p> <p>Barbara Birley, curator of the <a href=\"https://www.vindolanda.com/roman-vindolanda-fort-museum\">Vindolanda Museum</a>, told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cIt\u2019s a fabulous little piece. We weren\u2019t expecting to find something like that.\u201d</p> <p>If it was a practical joke, it was convincing, she said. \u201cIf you were working in a dark Roman room, because they didn\u2019t have a huge amount of indoor lighting, you could definitely see it as a little mouse,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially because it\u2019s not [like] Mickey Mouse with big ears. It looks very realistic.\u201d</p> <p>Vindolanda was built by the Roman army before Hadrian began constructing his 73-mile defensive barrier to guard the north-western frontier from invaders in AD122. It was an important garrison base, demolished and rebuilt repeatedly. It was there that archaeologists unearthed a cavalry barracks dating from AD105, finding extraordinary military and personal possessions left behind by soldiers.</p> <p>Birley\u2019s husband Andrew is director of excavations and chief executive of the <a href=\"https://www.vindolanda.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrIiJ_Y-46QIVy-vtCh37xAUoEAAYASAAEgIDtPD_BwE\">Vindolanda Trust</a>. He said that mice would have been a constant pest in ancient Vindolanda. \u201cWhen the granary buildings at Vindolanda were excavated in 2008, the bones from thousands of dead mice were uncovered below the floors of the buildings where they had been living and feasting on the ears of grain that had dropped between the flagstones into the basements of the buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is perhaps therefore rather wonderful that someone 2,000 years ago made a toy mouse from leather, crafting something to play with from their immediate environment.\u201d</p> <p>Vindolanda\u2019s spectacular finds include <a href=\"https://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/features/roman-writing-tablets-found-at-vindolanda.htm\">famous writing tablets</a> offering insights into the everyday lives of people living and working there 2,000 years ago, rare cavalry swords and the largest collection of boots and shoes to have survived from Roman Britain, among more than 7,000 leather objects and offcuts.</p> <p>Studying every piece has been painstakingly slow. It is thanks to the coronavirus lockdown that curatorial staff have had the time to focus on the task.</p> <p>The mouse had gone unnoticed when it was placed in a bag of scrap leather in 1993. It was among offcuts gathered by archaeologists who were then excavating the commanding officers residence dating to about AD105-130. The mouse had come from one of its rooms.</p> <p>Birley said: \u201cIt just shows that the collection can continue to reveal things that we weren\u2019t expecting to find.\u201d</p> <p>They hope to display the mouse when the museum reopens. </p>",

Microplastics can take hundreds of years to decompose completely.</p> <p>\u201cThis plastic has very attractive sustainability credentials because it uses no fossil fuels, and can be recycled \u2013 but would also degrade in nature much faster than normal plastics do,\u201d says Van Aken.</p> <p>Avantium\u2019s plant plastic is designed to be resilient enough to contain carbonate drinks. Trials have shown that the plant plastic would decompose in one year using a composter, and a few years longer if left in normal outdoor conditions. But ideally, it should be recycled, said Van Aken.</p> <p>The bio-refinery plans to break down sustainable plant sugars into simple chemical structures that can then be rearranged to form a new plant-based plastic \u2013 which could appear on supermarket shelves by 2023.</p> <p>The path-finder project will initially make a modest 5,000 tonnes of plastic every year using sugars from corn, wheat or beets. However, Avantium expects its production to grow as demand for renewable plastics climbs.</p> <p>In time, Avantium plans to use plant sugars from sustainable sourced biowaste so that the rise of plant plastic does not affect the global food supply chain.</p>",

The teenager\u2019s environmental activism has led to comparisons with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\">Greta Thunberg</a>.</p> <p>McAnulty is autistic, and it would be easy to file his book alongside Packham\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/02/chris-packham-malta-good-causes\">Fingers in the Sparkle Jar</a> </em>which gave a vivid insight into the naturalist\u2019s Asperger\u2019s but Dara has his own style. Simple, gorgeous sentences unfurl, one after another. Of a hot summer\u2019s day, he writes: \u201cDragonflies are whizzing, grasshoppers are trembling in the grass, and swallows are everywhere.\u201d Or: \u201cThe valley sings, heaves and rests.\u201d There are original, imaginative descriptions too \u2013 caterpillars move \u201clike slow-motion accordions\u201d and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/12/flight-goshawk\">goshawk</a> chick looks \u201clike an autumn forest rolled in the first snows of winter\u201d.</p> <p>He lives with his dad, Paul, mum and younger siblings, Lorcan and Bl\u00e1thnaid, in a small rented three-bedroom house in Castlewellan, Northern Ireland. As a young child, Dara loved to bang on about black holes to anyone who would listen, and was diagnosed as autistic when he was five. In fact, R\u00f3is\u00edn, Lorcan and Bl\u00e1thnaid are also autistic; only Paul, a conservation scientist, is not. The teenager describes his family as \u201cas close as otters\u201d. They are also punk lovers, chaotic and \u201cpretty formidable, apparently\u201d.</p> <p>McAnulty exudes energy and laughs a lot. His voice, however, belongs to an older man, and his writing is often unexpectedly wise too. When I ask about literary inspiration, he answers immediately: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/seamusheaney\">Seamus Heaney</a>. \u201cYou can reread his poems again and again\u201d; there are \u201call these different compartments like bubbles. You pop them one at a time and there\u2019s no centre to it. There\u2019s this saying about a brain: if a brain was simple enough to understand, we\u2019d be too stupid to understand that brain.

The bullying (he didn\u2019t know how to make small talk about Minecraft) intensified as he became a teenager. The noise and clutter of classrooms made them the worst environment for him.</p> <p>McAnulty learned that being in nature helped. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for all autistic people, but I feel things more intensely. In a shopping centre there\u2019s all of those different noises coming from different angles \u2013 my brain can\u2019t process them quickly enough, and everything goes completely crazy. Being out in nature, the sounds are quite level and I find it easier with muted colours. Everything just works. It\u2019s not oppressive.\u201d</p> <p>He wrote from a young age, on scraps of paper. \u201cOne of my ways of processing the world is writing things down,\u201d he says. Then social media helped him find a path. Aged 12, he began a blog about nature and joined Twitter. \u201cFour years ago I wouldn\u2019t have been able to talk to you right now,\u201d he says. \u201cTwitter opened my world to like-minded people. You\u2019ll always find someone who is willing to talk to you about mycelial networks. It\u2019s given me so many opportunities to connect with people and not feel so isolated.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"118b444ed8233ac899f4448b0aedafa3b3e13ca5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/118b444ed8233ac899f4448b0aedafa3b3e13ca5/0_1008_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"McAnulty with his brother, Lorcan, and sister, Bl\u00e1thnaid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">McAnulty with his brother, Lorcan, and sister, Bl\u00e1thnaid</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As McAnulty wrote, and also took his first steps in environmental activism \u2013 campaigning to end the persecution of birds of prey \u2013 his blog gained readers and admirers. Three years ago, he appeared on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/springwatch\">Springwatch</a></em> and was befriended by Packham. Adrian Cooper and Gracie Burnett, the husband-and-wife team behind tiny independent publisher Little Toller spotted his writing and began talking to his family about a book.</p> <p><em>Diary of a Young Naturalist</em> tells the story of McAnulty\u2019s year from spring equinox to spring equinox, from his 14th to 15th birthday. It was a difficult time. His family moved from one side of Northern Ireland to the other and he had to cope with changing schools and losing his cherished wild heartlands, a forest called <a href=\"https://discovernorthernireland.com/Big-Dog-Forest-Big-Dog-Walk-P23397/\">Big Dog</a>. \u201cWhen I was younger, I remember moving from a school I absolutely hated. Even though I wanted to get out of that place with every single fibre of my body, still, in the back of my mind, I was going: \u2018I don\u2019t want change.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The move from Big Dog precipitated a breakdown, where McAnulty ended up screaming in panic in his garden. His struggles that summer were not helped by the rise of social media trolling (the downside of forging those positive connections). \u201cRemoving\u201d himself from Big Dog \u201cwas devastating, as if it killed a part of me. Then I went up into the Mournes\u201d \u2013 the mountain range close to his new home \u2013 \u201cand everything became fine again.\u201d Was his recovery as simple as that? \u201cNo, but it definitely helped discovering a new place and building up a new connection with the land. I slowly crawled my way back into some semblance of a calm state of mind. Exploring was a really big part of that, trying to find new places to root myself.\u201d</p> <p>Writing was followed by a seven-month edit with Cooper and his parents. \u201cAll my family got together, trying to coax this book into something that was manageable,\u201d says McAnulty. But R\u00f3is\u00edn says she wouldn\u2019t want people to think his writing was overly shaped by others. \u201cAlthough it has been edited sensitively and beautifully, the first draft was actually incredible.\u201d </p> <p>Rewriting was a mixed blessing for McAnulty, forcing him to \u201cre-experience\u201d memories both traumatic and joyful. \u201cI uncovered things about myself along the way. It\u2019s like reading a book for the second time. I had to drag myself back through that thornbush. But I understood myself all the better because of it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We see a problem and we need to fix it. So when politicians seem to be making excuses we get angrier and angrier</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After his breakdown, he started at a new school. Despite huge anxiety, in the book he finds kindred souls and a nurturing environment. \u201cIt has been the best school I\u2019ve had,\u201d he says. He still has to flee lessons at times but \u201cI have, dare I say it, friends now, for the first time ever. I\u2019ve had the best luck in the world \u2026 I managed to land myself in a year group that was basically made up of nerds.\u201d</p> <p>McAnulty plans to take biology \u2013 his first love \u2013 alongside maths, chemistry and politics at A-level. He is currently writing a picture book for younger children and anticipates a career in conservation science. Activism takes up an increasing portion of his time. He runs a project to satellite-tag birds of prey, an eco group at school, and is prominent in his generation\u2019s call for action over the climate and biodiversity crises. Although the British government last year became the first major economy to make a legal commitment to \u201cnet zero\u201d carbon emissions by 2050, these are still only words, he believes, and his generation is becoming impatient. \u201cWe see a problem and we need to fix it. So when [politicians] don\u2019t fix it and seem to be making excuses we get angrier and angrier.\u201d </p> <p>In the meantime, McAnulty keeps his family, and the simple glories of the natural world, close. His favourite time is dusk, when \u201cthe night sky seems to chase the sun out of the sky and you can\u2019t really see the sun\u2019s light but you know it\u2019s just underneath the horizon,\u201d he says. \u201cAt that time, the energy in the air is so charged. That\u2019s when the bats begin to come out, and you feel such a rush.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022<em> Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Toller (RRP \u00a316).

Slowing down and observing \u2013 these are radical things to do in our accelerated age. It is only by being in lockdown that I have seen new treasures that I\u2019d previously have overlooked: the bright pink cones of the larch tree, blankets of blue speedwell, neon red velvet mites. The more we pay attention, the more we see.</p> <p>The senses can help us notice more. I have heard a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/what-could-be-better-for-the-soul-than-logging-the-first-cuckoo-rob-penn\">cuckoo</a> twice this last week for the first time since childhood, in two different spots.

It has been found to activate <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/01/call-to-wild/\">brain waves associated with calmness</a> and relaxation.</p> <p>Sometimes I choose one element to focus on. It might be different shades of green, leaf shapes, the colours of stalks, lichen, tiny things, an abundance of things, things becoming other things. Every day there is a new \u201cfellow\u201d to look for, as my three-year-old puts it. In Hampshire, where I am, it might be swifts, mayflies, damselflies, speckled wood butterflies, slow worms, beetles, caterpillars. People are heterogeneous. You might love fungi; I might love spiders. Find what you like.</p> <p>If you\u2019re sheltering inside, houseplants, bird feeders outside a window, or a view of sunlight filtering through the leaves of a tree (the Japanese word for this is <a href=\"https://www.awatrees.com/2017/02/16/komorebi-sunshine-through-trees/\">komorebi</a>) can be therapeutic \u2013 and suggests that in resilient and fair societies everyone should be able to see nature from their windows, especially those without gardens.</p> <p>We have lost our connection with the rest of the living world that we are part of.

In recent years, psychologists are revealing the importance of noticing \u201cnearby nature\u201d and connecting with the living world for our wellbeing rather than simply spending time outdoors. Noticing nature is linked to pro-environmental behaviour. If we feel a kinship, we are more likely to seek a reciprocal relationship with other beings.</p> <p>The evidence that contact with nature \u2013 even a view out of a window \u2013 can enhance healing continues to grow. Nature might even be a balm for those dealing with loss and loneliness. At an ecotherapy group I attended while researching my book, a man shared how methodically noticing the plants on a daily walk helped him grieve. Many of us are frightened, bored, or missing loved ones, and watching spring unfurl can be a healthy kind of escapism. When the news feels overwhelming, the rhythms and patterns outside can be a steadying arm: the swifts returning, the tightly orchestrated symphony of wildflowers, the trees filling out.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been noticing nature for a while, and I\u2019ve only scratched the surface. Each season I\u2019m surprised by new sights, which become familiar moments the following year, joined by other new happenings, layering upon each other. I think moving into a new kind of consciousness \u2013 a \u201cplant consciousness\u201d, as <a href=\"https://www.humansandnature.org/animism-tree-consciousness-and-the-religion-of-life-reflections-on-richard-powers-the-overstory\">Richard Powers</a> puts it \u2013 could be a lifelong journey, and a good one.</p> <p>You can find the wild near your home.

  "<p>A nine-year-old boy from Marseille is reported to have died of Kawasaki disease, the mysterious inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The boy is believed to be the first victim of the disease in France and only the second in Europe after a teenager died of the syndrome in London last week.</p> \n<p>Doctors treating the French boy said he had developed a form of coronavirus but had no symptoms. He was admitted to hospital on 2 May with what medics initially thought was scarlet fever. After being treated for that he was allowed to return home as doctors said his symptoms were mild. </p> \n<p>The boy was rushed to La Timone hospital later the same day and admitted to intensive care where he was diagnosed with \u201csigns of Kawasaki disease\u201d. He died six days later on 8 May after having a heart attack that caused brain damage.</p> \n<p>French officials said the child\u2019s death had not been formally linked to Kawasaki disease but that it was considered the most likely cause.</p> \n<p>Fabrice Michel, the head of the children\u2019s emergency ward at the hospital in Marseille where the child was first admitted, told Agence France-Presse that blood tests showed the boy had been in contact with coronavirus but had no symptoms.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen admitted he had the clinical signs comparable to scarlet fever. He was seen by an experienced senior paediatrician, and a treatment corresponding to the clinical signs was prescribed,\u201d Michel said. The child was then sent home because he showed \u201cno sign of being seriously ill\u201d.</p> \n<p>When the child was taken by ambulance to La Timone hospital doctors realised \u201creasonably quickly\u201d that it was not scarlet fever.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe child was showing symptoms that could be signs of Kawasaki disease,\u201d Michel said.</p> \n<p>There are believed to be 144 diagnosed cases of Kawasaki disease in France, most of them in the Paris area, more than half of whom have tested positive for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The French public health authority, <em>Sant\u00e9 Publique France</em>, said research suggested the syndrome appeared on average around four weeks after the children were infected by Covid-19, and was possibly a reaction to the virus. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A study <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31103-X/fulltext\">published in the Lancet</a> earlier this week traced the disease in Bergamo, Italy, which has been seriously affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The study observed a 30-fold increase in Kawasaki-like disease since the outbreak, and concluded: \u201cA similar outbreak of Kawasaki-like disease is expected in countries involved in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kawasaki disease is said to mainly affect children under five, but those diagnosed in France are aged from one to 14. Around 230 suspected cases have been reported in Europe, including in the UK where a 14-year-old boy died last week at the Evelina London children\u2019s hospital.</p> \n<p>Cases have also been observed in the US.

  "<p>Some people say it doesn\u2019t even exist \u2013 that it\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/16/business/worldbusiness/neoliberalism-it-doesnt-exist.html\">meaningless</a>\u201d, or even \u201ca term of abuse\u201d. But from the 2008 financial crisis to the vote for Brexit in 2016, from the rise of the alt-right to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is no way of properly grasping our world without thinking about how neoliberalism informs our politics and economy.</p> <p>But what is it? Broadly speaking, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/18/neoliberalism-the-idea-that-changed-the-world\">neoliberalism</a> can be defined as the raft of policies and overarching political ethos that enabled governments in the late-1970s to turn away from state-directed economic planning, towards an economic model that extended competitive markets into every sphere of human activity and initiated the reign of finance capital (the kind dreamed up in the City of London and Wall Street) by removing constraints on capital mobility.</p> <p>Importantly, neoliberalism is not merely a policy agenda but also a moral framework that teaches individuals to conceive of themselves not as, say, wage earners but rather as risk-taking entrepreneurs who should expect to shoulder the financial risks of their participation in higher education, the credit system and deregulated labour markets.</p> <p>First implemented as an economic programme in the UK and the United States by the Thatcher government and the Reagan administration, its principles continued to underwrite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\">third </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\">way</a> politics of New Labour and Clintonite Democrats. Although centre-left politicians reject the applicability of the term to their politics, a wealth of scholarship produced by economists, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246256989_From_Thatcherism_to_New_Labour_NeoLiberalism_Workfarism_and_Labour_Market_Regulation1\">sociologists</a> and historians demonstrates how third-way politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/18/blair-thatcher-legacy-labour-zarah-sultana\">advanced the neoliberal project</a>.</p> <p>So, where does the ideology stand today? Some are <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/transformation/coronavirus-spells-the-end-of-the-neoliberal-era-whats-next/\">calling time</a> on the neoliberal age. In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://paulmason.substack.com/p/day-one-of-uks-suppression-strategy?fbclid=IwAR2IZCzgpr9-gw23yDNugVaJd6tN2E2xJ_B06S_ossyCrlHCwe4SZFSBRrU\">Paul Mason declared</a> that the exigencies of the crisis would mean that, in short order, the UK\u2019s political class would soon consist entirely of either \u201centhusiastic\u201d or \u201creluctant socialists\u201d \u2013 progressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/governments-crisis-coronavirus-business\">state intervention</a> was inevitably back on the agenda. However, claims of this sort should be treated with caution, not least because similar predictions were made following the financial crisis, and after the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump as US president. And those predictions turned out to be seriously awry.</p> <p>For instance, at the height of the financial crisis, the Nobel prize-winning economist <a href=\"http://16beavergroup.org/articles/2008/10/24/infoshop-the-philosophies-of-deregulation-and-neoliberalism-are-dead-in-the-west/\">Joseph Stiglitz announced</a>, \u201cNeoliberalism \u2026 is dead.\u201d Yet it soon became abundantly clear that this was premature. It is true that the crisis seemed to pose a serious threat to the veneration of markets, as governments were forced to bail out the financial sector. But, as scholars such as <a href=\"https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/02/neoliberalism-movement-dare-not-speak-name/\">Philip Mirowski</a> have shown, neoliberals have long understood that their project requires state intervention to create and maintain markets. Rather than thinking of the crisis-fighting of governments in 2008 as a repudiation of market-friendly policy, it\u2019s more useful to think of it as an extreme instance of pro-business government intervention that aimed to maintain the long-term primacy of the market.</p> <p>On the face of it, the vote for Brexit and the election of Trump appeared to more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/17/american-neoliberalism-cornel-west-2016-election\">plausibly represent a break</a> with neoliberalism. But that diagnosis arose from a failure to understand how neoliberalism can adaptively recombine with elements of other ideologies.</p> <p>While the Brexiteers may loathe the European Union (an institution that neoliberal intellectuals have <a href=\"https://braveneweurope.com/quinn-slobodian-and-dieter-plehwe-the-neoliberals-who-opposed-europe\">long disagreed about</a>) they remain committed to the core of neoliberal ideology. For example, the Australian points-based immigration system \u2013 so beloved by the Brexiteers \u2013 is perfectly congruent with the neoliberals\u2019 view of human beings as bundles of assets (of greater or lesser value). The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/19/the-post-brexit-immigration-plans-at-a-glance\">post-Brexit immigrant</a>\u2019s educational background, work experience and connections are redefined as forms of capital that may or may not be worth investing in (by letting them in) in order to secure a future return on that investment for the national economy. Points-based immigration systems, in other words, do not represent a straightforward shift away from neoliberal, free-market orthodoxy towards rightwing protectionism.</p> <p>If neither the crises of 2008 nor 2016 signalled the end of neoliberalism, what about Covid-19? Today, as in 2008, politicians such as Rishi Sunak have been forced to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e77d3267-21f5-4369-bf08-0cf0f31ae3ff\">implement policies</a> that seem to contradict their adherence to market supremacy, but the intention is again to do so in order to swiftly return to \u201cnormal\u201d and wean the public off their \u201caddiction\u201d to state support. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunak-to-cut-coronavirus-furlough-scheme-cq2bfxl5p\">frustrated desire</a> to curtail the furlough scheme, and the clear opposition to implementing a universal basic income, indicate a commitment to maintaining the core of neoliberal welfare policy. This means opposing generous, non-means-tested payments, which neoliberals view as detrimental to fostering entrepreneurial activity and disciplining the workforce.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/uk-freeze-private-rents-homelessness-coronavirus-labour\">The UK must freeze private rents now \u2013 or thousands will be made homeless | Joe Beswick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More disturbingly, in the context of pandemic and the climate crisis, the persistence of the neoliberal view of individuals as human capital raises the possibility of governments treating populations of \u201clow value\u201d as <a href=\"https://lpeblog.org/2020/04/27/nationalism-and-neoliberal-governance/#more-3508\">disposable</a>. Increased state intervention to protect incomes is welcome, but could be used by governments to implement a kind of economic triage, with populations deemed not worth \u201cbailing out\u201d excluded from state support. As <a href=\"http://www.fordhampress.com/9780823285723/mutant-neoliberalism/\">Michel Feher</a> has shown, there are milder precedents for this in welfare reforms carried out by mainstream political parties in Ireland and Portugal, which reduced benefits for younger cohorts in order to encourage emigration and, in the case of Portugal, to swap young, relatively poor Portuguese for wealthier retirees from abroad. In a context of ballooning national debt, where migrant populations are being treated as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/02/malaysia-cites-covid-19-for-rounding-up-hundreds-of-migrants\">vectors of disease</a>, it\u2019s not difficult to see how an exclusionary neoliberal politics that supports investment in certain populations and disinvestment in others could gain traction.</p> <p>All of this is not to deny that the Covid-19 crisis poses a real threat to neoliberal orthodoxy. Physical distancing and enforced quarantine have <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2020/04/27/dont-fight-the-last-war-why-the-left-needs-to-look-beyond-austerity/\">disrupted the labour market</a>, potentially shifting the balance of power between labour and capital in favour of workers. The increase in <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-covid-19-has-workers-striking-where-are-the-unions?fbclid=IwAR03VFO75BoVjgHGweV0x156uf4vkGlz6H1RZ8qJRDciVSzayus8pgiNoBs\">wildcat strikes</a> and the emergence of mutual aid groups are certainly encouraging. And the furlough scheme has temporarily revealed the artificiality of government spending constraints. But given the persistence and adaptability of neoliberal ideology over the past 10 years, any sober assessment of the current situation needs to be attuned to the possibility of its survival (or successful mutation), as well as its possible demise.</p> <p>\u2022 Alex Doherty is the host of the Politics Theory Other podcast</p>",

(Of course, many people, particularly people of color, have understood the country\u2019s brokenness for a long, long time). Much discussion in the pandemic has turned clearly and devastatingly on the wreckage of America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/broken-capitalism\">broken capitalism</a>, which makes it perhaps ironically fitting that the country\u2019s pre-eminent streaming behemoth can offer you, in shutdown, a virtual syllabus on another of America\u2019s long-broken machines: the criminal justice system.</p> <p>I watch a lot of documentaries for my job, and while I\u2019m by no means an expert, I\u2019ve accumulated a sticky, patchy understanding of fractures, lies and unexpectedly fragile tethers in America\u2019s legal system through hanging in the Netflix true crime section. I\u2019m not talking about Netflix shock-umentaries, which are by now a genre unto themselves, in two categories: not-quite-distant retrospectives of a sensational stories (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jan/14/fyre-netflix-documentary-festival-disaster-review\">Fyre</a>, which was directed by Tiger King executive producer Chris Smith; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/15/aaron-hernandez-netflix-documentary\">Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez</a>) or outrageous, underplayed slice of America ripe for spilling out in conversation online (Tiger King; the cult of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/wild-wild-country-review-netflixs-take-on-the-cult-that-threatened-american-life\">Wild, Wild Country</a>; be-your-own-detective <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/16/making-a-murderer-is-our-obsession-with-true-crime-turning-nasty-serial\">Making A Murderer</a>). Those documentaries were designed to grab attention and, given Netflix\u2019s unparalleled global reach, generate word-of-mouth popularity on social media. But a second wave of programs sees Netflix\u2019s massive audience as an opportunity to redirect attention, with varying quality and impact, on larger, more entrenched outrages, which makes for an informal curriculum on America\u2019s uneven, unwieldy criminal justice system.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdvy14fdjj8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cdvy14fdjj8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Take some docuseries that have come out just during the shutdown. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/15/the-innocence-files-shocking-netflix-series-wrongful-convictions\">The Innocence Files</a>, released last month in partnership with the Innocence Project, offers perhaps the best and most galling portrait of broken justice: six episodes about wrongful conviction in the United States, demonstrating all the ways cornerstones of conviction can go disastrously wrong.

The series, in keeping with Netflix conventions, packages a sprawling story into slick episodes designed to heighten tension by chapter, sewing together interviews, old footage and dry evidence with glossy filler footage and ride-alongs with participants. It is, in other words, a solid documentary in terms of storytelling that still, by its end, offers a lesson in an under-seen yet critical element of convictions \u2013 the expert who confirms the weight and composition of seized substances \u2013 and a system oriented toward optics over justice.</p> <p>Cyntoia Brown: Murder to Mercy is <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-murder-to-mercy-netflixs-deeply-irresponsible-cyntoia-brown-documentary/\">a problematic documentary</a> made without Brown\u2019s permission, but nonetheless traces the Tennessee courts\u2019 shocking evolution from seeing Brown as a cold-blooded murderer to scared victim of sexual assault. It conveys how unforgiving and cruel criminal trials can be; in one scene of shocking court footage, a lawyer working in Brown\u2019s defense describes her fetal alcohol syndrome so forcefully \u2013 arguing a case of damaged goods so that the court might take mercy in front of her \u2013 that she breaks down in tears.</p> <p>The newer entries build on a foundation of older, most established films or series, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/29/the-13th-review-ava-duvernay-new-york-film-festival-prisons-plantations-race-law-us\">Ava DuVernay\u2019s 13th</a> from 2016, which offered a searing indictment of America\u2019s prison-industrial complex for black people and people of color. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/04/alex-gibney-dirty-money-interview-donald-trump\">Dirty Money</a>, a series created by Alex Gibney, is less on the criminal justice system specifically but certainly indicts a country in which the 1% (including and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/is-jared-kushner-the-worlds-worst-real-estate-investor\">especially Jared Kushner</a>) get away with essentially whatever they want. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/01/kalief-browder-spike-tv-series-criminal-justice-bronx\">Time: the Kalief Browder story</a>, a 2017 series which originally aired on Spike but is distributed by Netflix, presents a horrifying example of a shattered justice system: the story of a Bronx teen imprisoned without trial at Rikers Island for 1,000 days, often in solitary confinement, for allegedly stealing a backpack.</p> <p>Of course, Netflix is not the only provider of shows taking sharper aim at systemic issues than stereotypical true crime shock-docs; HBO recently released <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/31/the-scheme-hbo-documentary-basketball-christian-dawkins\">The Scheme</a>, nominally about money in college basketball but also about grandstanding in FBI investigations, as well as the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/19/ernie-joe-hbo-crisis-cops-police-mental-illness-health-documentary\">Ernie and Joe: Crisis Cops</a>, on training law enforcement to respond differently to mental health crises. Showtime\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/05/16-shots-laquan-mcdonald-shooting-chicago\">16 Shots</a>, on the shooting of Laquan McDonald in Chicago, came out last year. Nor do these Netflix series give a complete portrait of injustice in America \u2013 if anything, they\u2019re illustrative of how many planes of the justice system (state level, federal level, the labs testing your drugs) can fail. And I\u2019m not arguing that this does the work of investigative journalism, which undergirds many of these productions, or that the tying of entertainment with people\u2019s most crushing devastations isn\u2019t on some level always going to be ethically fraught. But you could do worse than use your streaming time to crawl through bits of a system which for many Americans \u2013 or at least many white Americans, especially white Americans on their couch in suburbia or relatively spacious apartments \u2013 can seem opaque and faraway, vaguely but not viscerally problematic.</p> <p>Remarkably, for all the scenes of brokenness, most of these shows find reasons for hope \u2013 in redemption, in persistence, in faith that even if it takes years, the truth wins out. The best ones, such as the Innocence Files, offer clear proposals for change and portraits of people fighting for them. These aren\u2019t the most meme-able or explosive lessons, but for a massive, stir-crazy streaming audience, especially these days, they\u2019re good ones to hold on to.</p>",
  "<p>This week marks my 20th anniversary in journalism, and given that there is absolutely no other news right now, I shall write about that. I am from a generation of journalists that could luck into jobs with minimal training, and by minimal I mean none. We came after the era when vocational training was a requisite, but before the 2008 crash, when media jobs were rarer than hens\u2019 teeth and salaries reduced to chicken feed. Believe me, I know how lucky I am.</p> <p>So I learned on the job, and while my innate elegance doubtless gives the impression that I picked this up as effortlessly as Audrey Hepburn learning to model in Funny Face, I was more Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator 2, trying to fit into this new world and yet blowing stuff up. But I have learned from my mistakes, and given that these include once slagging off a powerful magazine editor when said editor was standing right behind me, you can consider these lessons a masterclass from la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me.</p> <p><strong>Lesson one: always do your prep</strong><br>I like Tom Hanks. You like Tom Hanks. We all like Tom Hanks, the nicest guy in the movie business\u2122. Who could be so awful that Tom Hanks would have to reprimand them? Hi!</p> <p>Normally, before an interview, I read up on all relevant material. But with Hanks, I got cocky: sure, sure, Forrest Gump, Big, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sleepless-in-seattle\" title=\"\">Sleepless </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sleepless-in-seattle\" title=\"\">In Seattle</a> \u2013 I know my Hanks! And so, with the blithe confidence of a fool, I asked him why he had never played a villain. Suddenly, all the Hanksian \u201caw shucks\u201d-ness fell away and he told me that he <em>had</em> played a villain, in the film Cloud Atlas. \u201cYou really should do your prep before an interview,\u201d he scolded me, returning to that point several times and telling me to \u201ccheck that film out\u201d. I\u2019m sorry, Tom Hanks. I never did watch Cloud Atlas and I\u2019m sorry about that, too (kinda).</p> <p><strong>Lesson two: record everything</strong><br>Early on, I was dispatched to interview Elizabeth Hurley about her swimsuit range. As this was just going to be a little thing, and about swimsuits, I thought I could get away with taking notes in my half-arsed shorthand. No chance. Hurley took a pointed glance at my notebook and placed not one but two dictaphones between us. \u201cTo be on the safe side,\u201d she said, with a dagger of a smile. Chastened, I took out my dictaphone. I never went to journalism school, but I consider myself a graduate of the Hurley and Hanks School of Journalism.</p> <p><strong>Lesson three: your boss is not your friend</strong><br>I blame the Guardian for this misapprehension, because my first boss at the paper, fashion legend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jesscartnermorley\" title=\"\">Jess Cartner-Morley</a>, is very much my friend. She tolerated more from me in my decade on the fashion desk than most therapists would accept from their patients, including finding me multiple times under my desk <em>sobbing</em> over a boy. Other bosses have been less tolerant. There was the magazine editor I wrote for so often I thought I could share my personal problems with her. A firm \u201cThis is not appropriate, Hadley\u201d corrected that. Your boss is your boss. They are not your friend. Tattoo this on the inside of your eyelids.</p> <p><strong>Lesson four: check your facts</strong><br>Back in the very early days, I interviewed an author a decade or two older than me. I unthinkingly described her hair as \u201csilver\u201d. She complained, saying her hair was brown. We went back and forth and, with the callowness of youth, I thought the whole thing a bit absurd. Fast-forward a decade or so and I spotted this author at a book festival and she was right: her hair was brown. Also, no longer being so youthful myself, I have a lot more sympathy with such details.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/11/small-talk-and-ready-made-sandwiches-things-i-dont-miss-about-normal-life\">Small talk and ready-made sandwiches: things I don't miss about normal life | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Lesson five: don\u2019t bomb your office</strong><br>OK, it\u2019s finally time to tell this story. A while back, the tabloids had a running schtick in which they planted fake bombs near members of the royal family to show how badly guarded they were. A colleague came up with the wheeze that we should fake-bomb a tabloid paper, and so I made a bomb, a block of Blu-Tack stuck to a Chairman Mao alarm clock (long story). Lacking the necessary wiles, I failed to get past the security guard at the Sun; so I returned to the Guardian, put my fake bomb on my desk and went to the bathroom. When I came out, the entire office was empty. Baffled, I looked out the window \u2013 and there were all of my colleagues, outside. Someone on obituaries had heard the ticking of the Chairman Mao alarm clock and called the bomb squad. I had succeeded in fake-bombing a newspaper office: it just happened to be my own.</p> <p>Other papers were soon calling the Guardian to find out who the idiot was and, to his eternal credit, my then editor, Ian Katz, took the flak. Well, I can live on the run no more, and so I am outing myself as the actual Guardian Bomber. And this is the number one thing I have learned about journalism: you will meet the greatest people, who will always have your back, no matter how stupid you are.</p> <p>Here\u2019s to another 20 years in the job, if my poor bosses can bear it.</p>",

The platform is made for quick-cut videos, usually 15- to 60-seconds long, often accompanied by short clips of frenetic music and visual effects. The format is simple: users post videos of themselves dancing and singing and trying to be funny and exercising and just talking to the world. It\u2019s charming and cringeworthy and has a directness that is unlike the flattened experience of social media we\u2019ve become used to. When TikTok was first becoming popular in 2018, writers proclaimed a return to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/technology/tiktok-a-chinese-video-app-brings-fun-back-to-social-media.html\">good-fun internet of yore</a>. Then reporting revealed some uncomfortable claims about political censorship and the <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination/\">intentional suppression</a> of posts by people deemed ugly, poor or disabled. TikTok says it has updated its procedures but still, we had to admit: this doesn\u2019t sound like the good-fun internet. But it continues to grow and grow: at the start of this year it was the <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/news/tiktok-was-most-downloaded-non-gaming-app-at-the-start-of-2020/\">most downloaded non-gaming app</a>, surpassing WhatsApp and Facebook. In 2019, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-cfius-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-opens-national-security-investigation-into-tiktok-sources-idUSKBN1XB4IL\">company</a> said that 60% of active users in the US are between the ages of 16 and 24.</p> <p>TikTok is the medium of global lockdowns. It is perfect for a splintered attention span that is suddenly plunged into a boredom so extreme that nothing in particular will satiate it. I can\u2019t even watch TV any more, people are saying. But 15 seconds of a koala sleeping followed by 15 seconds of a teenager dancing with his grandmother feels doable. Throughout lockdown, headlines have been describing TikTok as a perfect distraction from lockdown conditions, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite right. It doesn\u2019t distract so much as reflect the conditions back to us. TikToks are often compelling precisely because they capture the experience of isolation \u2013 the creative ingenuity that can come of it; the drive to entertain ourselves and others; the desire for a tenuous connection to a generalised world.</p> <p>A lot of the videos, especially those made by young people, are inflected with what I can only think of as a powerful yearning, for an audience, of course, but also for a way to pass the time. They play dress-up, invent dances, imitate movie characters, and dye half their hair blond or purple (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTDv3W4N1mw\">#lockdownlewks</a>). Watching TikToks while I was bored one day, I had the thought that many of them are fundamentally artefacts of boredom, tedium-made material. You might wonder who has the time to make them, as you while away hours watching teens who haven\u2019t seen their friends in months playing multiple parts in skits about their lives.</p> <p>TikTok doesn\u2019t feel like a rabbit hole. Instagram is one endless boring scroll through advertisements and ex-friends\u2019 anniversary posts, and Twitter is a vortex you could tumble down for hours, into jokes and arguments and jokes about the arguments. TikTok, where the dominant feed is not your friends but a \u201cFor You\u201d feed curated algorithmically, is more like a deluge. Everything is disconnected, everything is divorced from context, everything is fragmented and vaguely miraculous, everything is so fast that it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s stealing your time. Everything is even more ephemeral than usual: the archive is so difficult to search that it can be hard to locate TikToks you might have seen just yesterday. There isn\u2019t even the artificially generated nostalgia of resurfaced content on Facebook. It is a kind of eternal present.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"TikTok video of teenage boy dancing\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@kindakyle/video/6787206535945784581&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6787206535945784581&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@kindakyle&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@kindakyle&quot;&gt;@kindakyle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;anyone else feel this too ? love this app but it\u2019s destroyed my attention span \ud83e\udd75 &lt;a title=&quot;fyp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp&quot;&gt;##fyp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;chooseone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/chooseone&quot;&gt;##chooseone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c original sound - whatthed0ugh&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6780547899525810949&quot;&gt;\u266c original sound - whatthed0ugh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There is a lot of silliness on TikTok.

  "<p>For about five weeks, the mayhem of coronavirus rendered the political mayhem of the previous four years irrelevant and dated. The divisive, petty, mendacious battles that had been waged in the name of Brexit suddenly appeared for what they were all along: conflicts conjured out of thin air by newspaper editors and their friends in the Conservative party. The era of digital \u201cfake news\u201d and memes was replaced by the sobriety of daily press conferences. Ministers broke their childish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">veto of the BBC\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">Today</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\"> programme</a>. Boris Johnson ran for cover behind civil servants and academics. All eyes turned towards the cold objectivity of statistics.</p> \n<p>We can date the opening of this window with some precision. Johnson\u2019s general election honeymoon (which included holidays to Mustique and Chevening) came to a halt when he attended his first Cobra meeting on coronavirus on 2 March. We can only imagine the shock and disappointment Johnson must have felt, as it dawned on him that his premiership would not be remembered for Brexit at all. There followed weeks of earnest policy analysis, and when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish\">lockdown finally arrived</a>, it was accepted as the authoritative decision of experts.</p> \n<p>We can date the closing of this window with equal precision. On 6 April it was announced that the prime minister had been taken into St Thomas\u2019s hospital with Covid-19, and the next day he was moved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">into intensive care</a>. By the time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\">Johnson had re-emerged</a> on 12 April with a video thanking the NHS staff who had saved his life, the mood had changed. Led by certain newspapers, the sense of measured proportionality that had governed public debate over the course of March was now lost, and an impassioned Covid nationalism was born.</p> \n<p>For the press, with whom Johnson has always been so intimate, the prime minister\u2019s illness was an opportunity to abandon the concern with aggregate mortality rates which had dominated the news for the previous month. The body of the leader now provided a symbol to focus on. \u201cMay Boris and Britain get through this battle,\u201d intoned Charles Moore sombrely in the Telegraph. \u201cYour health is the health of the nation,\u201d Allison Pearson pleaded to Johnson. Britain has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">lost more lives to Covid-19</a> than any nation in Europe, but its hero has survived. With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/boris-johnson-and-carrie-symonds-announce-birth-of-baby-boy\">arrival of a new Johnson baby</a>, followed by the 75 anniversary of VE Day, the Johnson administration spotted a path to reprieval. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6bb54d3cda7aa83ac545191f5b94b2aed6378654\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bb54d3cda7aa83ac545191f5b94b2aed6378654/995_907_2499_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Red Arrows over London on the 75th Anniversary of VE Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Red Arrows over London on the 75th Anniversary of VE Day.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uk Ministry of Defence/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The fact that Johnson and his adviser Dominic Cummings are in Downing Street at all is down to their intuitive grasp of symbolism and messaging, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">floored their opponents in June 2016</a> and again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/bombastic-boris-johnson-wins-huge-majority-on-promise-to-get-brexit-done\">in December 2019</a>. During the hiatus of March 2020, as the government scrambled desperately for a position on coronavirus, this skill seemed to desert them. Messages were all over the place, to the point where scientists were liberated to throw around jargon about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/the-guardian-view-on-herd-immunity-yes-it-was-part-of-the-plan\">\u201cherd immunity\u201d</a>. But when a line was found, it stuck: \u201cStay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>The status of the NHS here is interesting, and not a little troubling. As soon as horror stories started to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-may-have-been-in-italy-for-weeks-before-it-was-detected\">emanate from Lombardy in February</a>, it was clear that the worst possible nightmare on Britain\u2019s horizon was of the NHS being faced with far more Covid patients than it could treat. The phrase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/flatten-the-curve-why-predicting-coronavirus-infections-and-deaths-is-so-tricky\">\u201cflatten the curve\u201d</a> means specifically reducing the peak to within hospital capacity. But over time, the ambition to \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d has taken on such momentum, it has come to overshadow the third part of the slogan, \u201csave lives\u201d.</p> \n<p>The video that Johnson released on exiting hospital made the extraordinary gambit of elevating the defence of the NHS above the defence of the public:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>We are making progress in this national battle because the British public formed a human shield around this country\u2019s greatest national asset \u2013 our National Health Service. We understood and we decided that if together we could keep our NHS safe, if we could stop our NHS from being overwhelmed, then we could not be beaten, and this country would rise together and overcome this challenge, as we have overcome so many challenges in the past.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This was an ingenious piece of political rhetoric, sidelining the methodical and morbid question of body counts, and replacing it with a national story of collective identity and sacrifice. Where a standard utilitarian logic might presuppose that health policy should be judged in terms of outcomes for human welfare, now Johnson was suggesting that human welfare was a price worth paying to preserve a cherished symbol of health policy. Such rhetorical acrobatics were all the more impressive from a man who had been at death\u2019s door only five days earlier.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The symbol of the NHS has become entangled with other national icons that hark back to the second world war</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The draping of the union jack across the NHS has produced some sickly results. The gratitude that is felt towards health and care professionals has been profoundly moving to experience and witness, and the weekly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2020/may/07/doctor-calls-for-ppe-from-roof-as-uk-claps-for-carers-video\">\u201cclap for carers\u201d</a> is one of its many valuable expressions. But over the weeks, this spirit of spontaneous solidarity has thickened into something more forceful and censorious, potentially something angrier. Johnson\u2019s supporters in Westminster have turned on journalists for probing the government\u2019s performance too critically, as if any criticism was a sign of disloyalty to the national effort. Challenged in parliament by the Labour MP and A&amp;E doctor Rosena Allin-Khan about the shortage of available PPE, health secretary Matt Hancock suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/05/matt-hancocks-career-continues-to-win-the-battle-with-his-conscience\">she change her \u201ctone\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>As the weeks have passed, the symbol of the NHS has become entangled with a host of other national British icons, many of which hark back to the second world war. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/capt-tom-moore-thanks-people-for-support-on-his-100th-birthday\">100th birthday of Captain Tom Moore</a>, who raised an astonishing \u00a330m for NHS charities by walking around his garden, was celebrated with a flyover by two fighter planes from the era, a video message from the PM and a promotion to the rank of colonel by the Queen. Moore revealed that he\u2019d received a letter of congratulations from 103-year-old Dame Vera Lynn, whose song \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d had topped the charts, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/08/we-will-meet-again-when-a-monarch-brings-comfort-with-a-song\">Queen referenced the famous wartime number</a> in her televised lockdown address to the nation.</p> \n<p>As much as the left might wish otherwise, the NHS has always been available as a potential nationalist icon. As David Edgerton details in <em>The Rise and Fall of the British Nation</em>, the invention of \u201cBritain\u201d as a post-imperial nation state, defined as a national economy with a single people, was initially a project of the Labour party more than the Conservatives. Edgerton points out that the manifesto on which Clement Atlee won the 1945 election, and that set out plans for an NHS, contained the words \u201csocialist\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d three times, but the words \u201cnation\u201d and \u201cnational\u201d nearly 50 times. Years before wartime mythology and nostalgia took off in the 1970s and 80s, it was Labour \u2013 and not the Tories \u2013 who did most to create a sense of \u201cBritain\u201d as a single imagined community.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The litany of care workers who have died could scarcely be more ethnically and nationally diverse \u2013 a testimony to how little nation matters</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A more extreme version of health nationalism has been bubbling away on the far right for some years. The alleged problem of \u201chealth tourism\u201d, of foreigners exploiting the generosity of the NHS, has been repeatedly referenced by Nigel Farage, and is a common trope among English nationalists such as Tommy Robinson. Governments have occasionally indulged this sentiment, with Hancock accusing Labour of giving a \u201cfree rein to health tourism\u201d during the election campaign. Theresa May\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d migration policy (the cause of the agonising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/the-week-that-took-windrush-from-low-profile-investigation-to-national-scandal\">broke in 2018</a>) also sought to deploy the NHS as an instrument for deterring immigrants from settling in the UK. A <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026120914177\" title=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026120914177\">new sociological paper</a> by Des Fitzgerald, Amy Hinterberger, John Narayan and Ros Williams examines how Vote Leave seized on the NHS as a symbol of shared British \u201cheredity\u201d, the means through which the nation reproduces itself culturally and biologically. The vision of free healthcare, for the people and by the people, is a seductive part of Britain\u2019s national mythology.</p> \n<p>As the Covid crisis has confirmed in the starkest possible terms, the everyday reality of health and care services in the UK flies in the face of this jingoism. The litany of those who have died in the course of their professional care work could scarcely be more ethnically and nationally diverse \u2013 a testimony to how little nation matters, where expertise and basic humanity are concerned. This could, of course, be a basis on which to reset the story of \u201cBritain\u201d, in ways that take stock of its globally connected, porous nature. But at the moment, that story is losing the battle for column inches with false memories of the second world war.</p> \n<p>With the government lashing itself to the NHS, and then lashing the NHS to Dame Vera Lynn, a new facet of populism looms into view, in which critics and statisticians become tarred as useless naysayers. The possible political benefits to Johnson (who is born to this style of fact-free leadership) are obvious, but the potential consequences for policy are quite terrifying. It emerged during April that the UK\u2019s true death-toll was at least twice as high as the government was insisting, once care homes were taken into account. According to an investigation by Reuters, a decision was made in mid-March to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-elderly-sp/special-report-in-shielding-its-hospitals-from-covid-19-britain-left-many-of-the-weakest-exposed-idUSKBN22H2CR\">transfer 15,000 patients out of hospitals</a>, back into the community, including many who had tested positive for Covid and would return to care homes. So desperate was the effort to \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d and free up capacity, it seems that infections were being released into the care sector. Still the government\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d tally of deaths only counts those which have occurred in hospitals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"80190013-6673-49ce-b5f1-7bdbd26e9fb8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gNuL1wgTVYU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson has never been as popular as he was during his hospitalisation. Like most national leaders, his approval ratings have risen as a result of this crisis, and the Conservatives have been consistently polling at around 50%. Having the worst death toll in Europe clearly counts for less in the eyes of the public than the rallying around of our resolutely <em>National</em> Health Service. The style of politics that Johnson mastered over the previous four years has returned, and it is delivering for him, just so long as the accumulation of deaths can be slotted into a narrative of sacrifice and community.</p> \n<p>But as with previous nationalisms, the communities doing the narrating are not the same as those doing the grieving. It\u2019s here that the cultural politics of Brexit potentially resurfaces. Study a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/coronavirus-uk-latest-deaths-confirmed-cases-and-which-regions-are-hardest-hit\">map of where Covid-related deaths</a> have been concentrated, and the eye is immediately drawn to major cities: London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow. A lower concentration of mortality sweeps up the middle of the country, from the south-east, through the West Midlands, up to the north-west and on towards Scotland. But the east and west of the country are far less affected. It\u2019s not a perfect fit by any means, but the map loosely resembles a more familiar one: the 2016 referendum result. The virus presents the greatest risks to those inner city urban areas, such as Hackney and Stockport, which voted remain. </p> \n<p>This overlap is scarcely surprising. The remain vote was clustered in centres of international connectivity and intense commercial activity, both rich and poor. The choice to remain was a choice very often connected to the larger international world of global capitalism, travel and urban life. It is these same things that allow a virus to spread. Conversely, the disconnection experienced by rural leave voters also reduces their risk of infection. The interests of rural, car-driving England are not necessarily those of the inner cities, though the stakes are now of course far higher than just culture. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f14ae8e3fc9c3d317a530a5750bb529effd09dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f14ae8e3fc9c3d317a530a5750bb529effd09dd/154_308_3564_2138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Vote Leave bus parked outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Vote Leave bus parked outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The continuity between coronavirus Britain and Brexit Britain is greater than we might have imagined, and certainly greater than it appeared during those five weeks before Johnson\u2019s hospitalisation. It shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that Johnson \u2013 like Donald Trump \u2013 was elected to office on the back of an anti-metropolitan, anti-liberal cultural platform. Johnson\u2019s core vote is predominantly outside of those Covid danger zones of the inner cities and clusters of prosperity. Johnson, like Donald Trump, represents people who believe in the value of hard work, but don\u2019t do very much of the really unpleasant hard work themselves, either for reasons of wealth or age. They believe in \u201cunleashing\u201d the economy, less in a macroeconomic sense, and more in the sense of ditching all the red tape and political correctness that comes from government administrators and universities.</p> \n<p>This is how opposition to the European Union can shift seamlessly into opposition to the current lockdown. Some have pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of rightwingers who gave not a hoot for GDP when it came to Brexit, suddenly expressing their concern for Britain\u2019s economy when it comes to coronavirus. But there is more consistency here than initially appears. Theirs is a worldview that cares little for statistical aggregates, whether that be GDP or Covid-related deaths. It pays scant attention to economists or epidemiologists, claiming to know what\u2019s in the public interest, indeed it sets little store by the very idea of a \u201cpublic interest\u201d in the first place.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/national-emergencies-britain-government-health-covid-19-1940s-and-50s\">When it comes to national emergencies, Britain has a tradition of cold calculation | David Edgerton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Instead, the purpose of the economy, from this conservative perspective, is to inculcate independence, both at an individual and a national level. The national economy should be self-reliant, manufacture its own goods, and employ its own people. It\u2019s this national economy that globalisation, Brussels and lockdown all inhibit, and therefore need overturning. For the inner-city cleaner or hospitality worker, whose life would now be put at risk by a newly \u201cunleashed\u201d economy, the injunction would be to take more care, change jobs or take out life insurance. But it\u2019s not the government\u2019s problem, and it\u2019s certainly not the problem of the typical Tory donor whose investment portfolio is currently under the cosh.</p> \n<p>Johnson may not hold this worldview personally, but it is the one that propelled him to power, thanks to the victories of 2016 and 2019, masterminded by Cummings. Voices in favour of this libertarian economic nationalism have grown steadily louder since the lockdown began, and their vision of Britain is crystallising: fewer Chinese imports, fewer universities, lower immigration, more indigenous manufacturing and put the young and unemployed to work in the fields. No pain, no gain. It\u2019s not an ideology commonly held by people who work in the genuinely wealth-producing centres of British capitalism, nor by the generations who will pay the greatest financial cost for this crisis over the coming decades. And the lockdown retains remarkably widespread public support. But it is an ideology to which Johnson will keep on nodding, and which is being drip-fed to the public by rightwing newspapers, Tory backbenchers and opaquely funded thinktanks. His confusing televised statement on Sunday night, which urged people back to work without any clarity around how this should occur, was clearly crafted partly to please conservative hardliners who are appalled by the current scale of state interventions.</p> \n<p>Even with the most metropolitan and internationalist party in power, the coronavirus would force some reassertion of the nation state, as a legally binded entity with a common historical trajectory. There is no use trying to imagine Britain out of the story that we are living through. The question is whether a version of Britain can be imagined and described that avoids the worst nationalist excesses that are now stirring, as the death toll climbs, the NHS becomes a political shield and the wartime nostalgia tightens its grip.</p>",
  "<p>There was a moment, as Paul Sweeney filled out his online application for universal credit, when the reality of the box-ticking hit home. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking, Christ, when I was an MP I used to spend my days advocating for people who were caught up in all these benefits problems, and now here I am. It was bizarre.\u201d</p> <p>At the start of the year, it is fair to say that the former Scottish Labour member for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/09/glasgow-north-east-constituency-drives-its-own-regeneration\">Glasgow North East</a> had no expectation of becoming one of the 2 million people who have applied for universal credit benefits since lockdown measures were implemented.</p> <p>Early January was consumed with the joyless slog of winding up his office and constituency commitments, having lost his seat to the SNP in December\u2019s general election. After serving as an MP for only two years, 31-year-old Sweeney received two months\u2019 salary as a redundancy payment.</p> <p>Throughout the spring, he was working on Angela Rayner\u2019s campaign for UK Labour deputy, with the assumption that after that contract ended \u201cthings would come up\u201d. Instead, the special conference to announce the leadership results was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Sweeney found himself at home, rediscovering Call of Duty and Rollercoaster Tycoon, the computer games he\u2019d played as a teenager, but with a growing sense of panic as the job market froze.</p> <p>\u201cI was sitting looking at my finances and thinking, after last month I\u2019ve not got any income at all. It was that moment of realisation that I don\u2019t know when this lockdown\u2019s going to end.\u201d With the mortgage on his flat in north Glasgow diminishing his remaining savings, he organised a three-month payment holiday. Suddenly, applying for universal credit became \u201clogical\u201d.</p> <p>He did so on Monday, and went on to tweet about the \u201cdisorienting experience\u201d of finding himself unemployed \u201cfor the first time since the age of 14\u201d and in the midst of a pandemic lockdown. \u201cI have completed my online application for universal credit, which was actually reasonably straightforward. Now to wait for the DWP to call me back.\u201d</p> <p>His revelation prompted a largely warm and supportive response, but with \u2013 he suggests \u2013 \u201can element of voyeurism, too\u201d. Sweeney was certainly considered a rising star at Westminster, reclaiming a cherished Glasgow seat from the nationalists and joining Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s cabinet as the shadow minister for Scotland a month after his election. He was known for his effective and energetic campaigns on behalf of constituents, alongside his boundless enthusiasm for the city\u2019s Victorian architecture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6dd6da129df723d74192457821857aee116abe1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6dd6da129df723d74192457821857aee116abe1/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Sweeney at Possilpoint community centre, where he volunteers at a food bank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Sweeney at Possilpoint community centre, where he volunteers at a food bank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI just thought I\u2019d put it out there,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI\u2019m one of these people that\u2019s been long advocating for a basic income, so why is there any shame in accessing public funds that are used to support people?</p> <p>\u201cA few people have said, \u2018Oh I\u2019d never apply because I\u2019m too proud\u2019, that slightly Calvinist idea about welfare, that it\u2019s somehow morally questionable. I just felt I\u2019m going to make a point here because you\u2019re never too far from being in that situation.\u201d</p> <p>There was an assumption, Sweeney contends, that because he arrived in the Commons well-spoken and better-presented, his background must be one of privilege. \u201cI always found it irritating, having represented the constituency I was born and brought up in, that there was this inference I wasn\u2019t a legitimate representative of it.\u201d</p> <p>Sweeney grew up in the heart of a constituency where there are nearly double the Scottish average of children living in poverty. His father worked in the Clyde shipyards, but was made redundant in the 90s and now drives a taxi. His mother has worked as a bank teller all her life. His first job was an Evening Times paper round while he was still at school and \u2013 the only person in his family to go to university \u2013 he worked part-time throughout his studies, before he joined BAE Systems\u2019 graduate development programme, becoming a production engineer at its Govan shipyard.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is, the majority of Scots are working class \u2013 if they stopped earning a salary, within two months they\u2019d be in financial difficulties. However prestigious or seemingly privileged you are in terms of your work or identity, you\u2019re never far away from that. If more of us realised how close we are to that peril, maybe the social security system wouldn\u2019t be so punitive.\u201d</p> <p>While he waits for his claim to be assessed, he is clear that \u201c\u00a3340 a month a ridiculously small amount of money\u201d, but adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a comforting feeling to have something coming in as you find a way through this. It\u2019s not something you can sit back and relax on, but it takes the edge off.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Sweeney has been helping out with deliveries for a local food bank: \u201cIt\u2019s good psychologically to stay moving rather than dwelling on things.\u201d But he also admits that \u201cin a strange way I\u2019ve been enjoying time to relax\u201d.</p> <p>He says: \u201cBeing elected in 2017 unexpectedly, with a 200 majority and a parliament that could have collapsed at any moment, it was like having a ticking bomb in your hand. It was a pressure cooker from the start.\u201d</p> <p>The double blow of losing his seat \u2013 an experience he describes as brutal \u2013 and finding himself unemployed in lockdown is plain, and his impatience to get back to politics fizzes through his conversation. \u201cIt is frustrating to be sitting here knowing that my future is elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Sweeney is not a maudlin sort, but he will allow that his mum, who has only recently recovered from coronavirus herself, is \u201ca bit upset by it all\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably hit her harder emotionally than me. It is what it is; it\u2019s shit, but I\u2019m not dead, you know?\u201d He laughs, evidently still confounded at his present circumstances, personal and global. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to get on with it.\u201d</p>",

Gerhana arrived at eight months, close to death from starvation, but already knowing how to drink from a bottle. Kartini, just over a year old, was completely wild, refusing to eat any food that had not been harvested from the forest. \u201cWe had to tame her in order to save her life,\u201d says Preuschoft. \u201cSometimes it is so absurd \u2013 you have to teach them things you hope they never have to learn.\u201d</p> <p>Under supervision in a 100-hectare (247-acre) area of government-protected forest, the orangutans are taught how to forage for food, build nests, navigate the forest canopy, and other survival skills.</p> <p>Jejak Pulang\u2019s strategy is to \u201corangutise the humans, not humanise the orangutans\u201d, which means training for the staff in tree climbing (from professional arborists), how to weave nests from twigs and knowledge of forest fruits.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes years before the caretakers accumulate the essential knowledge,\u201d says Preuschoft. This balance \u2013 the orangutans must learn from humans, but only the right lessons \u2013 can be challenging to strike.</p> <p>Kartini has recently developed an aversion to eating protein-rich larvae that suggests to Preuschoft a caretaker once betrayed their own disgust: \u201cIf your mother is phobic of spiders, you will also not like spiders.\u201d</p> <p>The four \u201cbabies\u201d have also learned to give food simply from being given it themselves, popping morsels (\u201cnormally the ones they like less\u201d, Preuschoft observes) straight into their caretakers\u2019 mouths.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The similarities that intrigue us, and intrigue the orangutans in the same way \u2013 that is the very thing that can endanger their lives</p> <footer> <cite>Signe Preuschoft</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They would never learn to do this from an ape mother, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really a friendly gesture, part of the human language that they have adopted.\u201d</p> <p>But identifying with humans over other apes could prove fatal in the wild. After Kartini was was first tamed to learn, she then had to be made wild again.</p> <p>As the babies grow, input from their caretakers is minimised to encourage their independence and their progress towards release is measured against benchmarks set by wild apes. Only Robin \u2013 the eldest of those founding three, who has spent most of his life in captivity \u2013 has been judged unfit for release.</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that he can\u2019t learn to be an orangutan, it means that he can never unlearn the things we call \u2018humanised\u2019,\u201d says Preuschoft. The risk is too great that he would gravitate back to civilisation. Years ago, Preuschoft was called three times to rescue an orangutan from a logging camp where he had gone to socialise with humans, be fed, and even have coffee. The third time she picked him up, he had a broken jaw.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous affinity,\u201d she says. \u201cThe similarities that intrigue us, and I\u2019m sure intrigue the orangutans in the same way \u2013 that is the very thing that can endanger their lives.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6dc5780b7bc8c2c89f4eeb98597caae8cb21f4cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dc5780b7bc8c2c89f4eeb98597caae8cb21f4cf/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damai, a former pet, who arrived at the Forest School this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damai, a former pet, who arrived at the forest school this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jejak Pulang/Four Paws</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The threats to their survival can seem overwhelming at times, Preuschoft admits, from the big picture of consumerism and loss of connection to nature to the more immediate dangers, like land clearing for mines and roads, plantations and poaching.</p> <p>More challenges keep emerging.

A week after his arrival, Damai is already forming a bond with a veterinarian at the quarantine station.</p> <p>The older apes, Amalia and Eska, are already mostly independent, opting to sleep several nights a week in the forest school and finding their own food. Before the pandemic, Preuschoft had hoped that they would \u201cgraduate\u201d early this year to \u201cForest Academy\u201d, living with some oversight in the protected area where they will eventually be released.</p> <p>That monitoring would extend until Preuschoft is satisfied that the apes are entirely self-sufficient. \u201cWe would like to be sure that by the time they disappear they know what they are doing.\u201d</p> <p>Preuschoft argues that \u201csoft release\u201d is supported by scientific literature that shows that orangutans develop gradually. \u201cFor me, the release is a process, not an event.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a90c83844c0ae7fe3f5c7ae186b76ed7fd2fbc25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a90c83844c0ae7fe3f5c7ae186b76ed7fd2fbc25/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eska\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eska, who was rescued from a private zoo when she was four years old.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Signe Preuschoft/Jejak Pulang/Four Paws</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of the approximately 2,000 apes reintroduced to the wild in Borneo since the mid-1960s, the ultimate fates of most are not known, as tracking them beyond two years of release is difficult and costly.</p> <p>Some, Preuschoft believes, were still drawn to humans when they were returned to the wild.

The argument most often made in support of it is that extinction is a process that leaves animals orphaned, stranded, or otherwise in need of immediate help; and many see the alternatives \u2013 leaving them to die, euthanasia, or lifelong captivity \u2013 as unacceptable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902MYi6RCC8lCNw/\" data-alt=\"Map of Indonesia showing location of Samboja\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902MYi6RCC8lCNw/\">Map of Indonesia showing location of Samboja</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou must remember, extinction means suffering,\u201d says Preuschoft. \u201cIt means maiming, disease, living in fear, dying, seeing your children die.\u201d</p> <p>But even if there were not the question of what to do with incoming orphans, Preuschoft believes it is too late for to rely on saving the orangutans\u2019 habitat alone.</p> <p>In 2007 the United Nations Environment Programme\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.grida.no/publications/229\">The Last Stand of the Orangutan</a> report warned that the species had an \u201cextremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future\u201d.</p> <p>Nothing has changed, says Preuschoft. \u201cWhat that tells us is that preventive measures alone cannot save the species. That is not just a justification \u2013 but a job.\u201d</p> <p>Her sense of commitment to the apes that pass through her care may extend decades, she agrees \u2013 even their entire lives. Already Preuschoft foresees the possibility of having to intervene should the capricious Amalia make her a grandmother (\u201cshe hasn\u2019t shown a lot of maternal behaviour\u201d).</p> <p>For now, the challenge is securing a release site. Preuschoft has identified a 25-hectare area about 200km from the forest school, near the border with Central Kalimantan, which she is hoping to get protected. \u201cIn the current climate, any hectare that we protect is a benefit,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It is a \u201cterrible job\u201d, she adds, to \u201ccollect individuals and help them on\u201d as the species continues to be driven to extinction. \u201cI\u2019m not deluded. I\u2019m not thinking that I am going to single-handedly stem the flood.\u201d But in delivering competent animals to the wild, she says, \u201cwe hand the torch to the conservationists who work to preserve habitat \u2013 \u2018now it\u2019s your task\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe important thing is, we have hope.

One participant, Ellie, a 21-year-old trainee teacher living in north London, moved back to rural Devon to be with family before the lockdown, and had some technical problems while joining the virtual meetings.</p> <p>\u201cThat made discussion quite challenging,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd people have families coming in and out, and pets \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s a little bit chaotic, but quite endearing and lovely to see where everyone is from.\u201d</p> <p>The assembly is made up of 110 people selected by computer to be representative of society from a pool of 1,500, who asked to be considered after invitations were sent out to 30,000 households chosen at random.</p> <p>Over the past few weeks, experts have talked to them about a wide range of topics, including energy production, transport, agriculture and consumerism, with participants voting on a series of propositions related to each with a view to determining how the UK could best achieve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/21/long-road-to-zero-emissions-uk\">net-zero carbon emissions</a> by 2050.</p> <p>On this final weekend the assembly will be discussing how the coronavirus pandemic affects the climate crisis, and members will be given an opportunity to raise any issues they do not feel have been addressed throughout \u2013 for instance, whether the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/06/johnson-urged-to-set-out-firm-plans-for-uks-net-zero-carbon-target\">UK deadline</a> of 2050 for meeting net zero should be brought forward.</p> <p>Ellie said she was aware of the urgency of the issue before joining the assembly, and her views have remained pretty consistent throughout the process. \u201cMy feelings as it\u2019s coming to an end reflect how I felt when I initially found out I was going to be taking part,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really thrilled that we got to make a contribution and I was able to be a part of it.\u201d</p> <p>But 52-year-old Adrian from Belfast, who works in the legal sector, said he had become much more aware of the effects of his individual actions. \u201cI think having children makes you more aware of how you behave and the shadow that you cast across,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the things that I can do, and the things I can change \u2013 in your routine, the way you live, how you travel \u2013 that\u2019s the great takeaway for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f812a325520cc07795650042e6e59bdd0a9a204\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f812a325520cc07795650042e6e59bdd0a9a204/0_364_5456_3274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Global climate strike protest in Edinburgh, September 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global climate strike protest in Edinburgh, September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The assembly does not aim to provide a definitive consensus on issues, but to provide a snapshot of public opinion: if the participants are divided on an issue, the final report will reflect that. It is due to be published before the parliamentary summer recess starts in July, an exciting but also nerve-racking prospect for the participants.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m cautious about the impact it will have politically,\u201d said Ellie. \u201cI definitely hope this will have a tangible impact and it will gain some kind of recognition. I\u2019m sure it will gain some criticism as well.\u201d</p> <p>It is not yet known whether the report will be debated in parliament, although it will be used by the six select committees that commissioned it \u2013 and perhaps in other organisations as well. \u201cI think it will be really interesting to see how it\u2019s used by other people beyond parliament once it\u2019s published,\u201d said Allan.</p> <p>Assembly members said they were aware the coronavirus pandemic had completely transformed society, and perhaps shifted public focus away from the climate crisis. But Covid-19 had also created a unique opportunity for a national and global reset.</p> <p>\u201cWe would hope that [when] restarting the economy, some of the decisions made will be influenced by some of the suggestions we make here,\u201d said Adrian, noting the rise in cycling and walking since the lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes after these events [such as the coronavirus crisis] people have a greater community consciousness, and perhaps now is the time to use the recommendations to ignite that.\u201d</p> <p>The participants are hopeful that, now or in the future, their recommendations do help shape the country in a way that benefits the environment in the long term.</p> <p>\u201cI think the change will happen. It\u2019s the speed at which it happens which is the key,\u201d said Adrian. \u201cBut as I see those changes being made, I\u2019ll be able to smile and look at them and say, \u2018Well, I did that\u2019.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s the spring of 1960, and 18-year-old Erica has come to the tiny Greek island of Hydra with her boyfriend Jimmy, a would-be painter-poet, to join its foreign colony of writers, artists and musicians. Erica is running away from her controlling father in Bayswater and the risk of becoming nothing more than his housekeeper, like her late mother. \u201cIt was unbearable really,\u201d thinks Erica, what her mother \u201cput into a life that wouldn\u2019t contain her\u201d. Hydra\u2019s \u201cfantastically blue water and cheap rent\u201d, \u201csalt-white houses\u201d and wacky creatives promise freedom from all bourgeois restrictions.</p> <p>Erica immediately falls under the spell of Charmian Clift, a charismatic Australian with a ramshackle villa, writer husband and clutch of semi-feral children. Though Clift\u2019s name sounds as if it might have been invented by Samson to capture the seductive spirit of the counterculture, she, like almost everyone on the island apart from Erica and Jimmy, is based on a real person. There\u2019s Clift\u2019s husband, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/21/george-johnstons-majesties-of-nature-and-monstrosities-of-man-is-my-sydney\">George Johnston</a>; the New York playwright Kenneth Foch; the Beat poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jan/20/guardianobituaries.books1\">Gregory Corso</a>; and the emerging Scandinavian novelist Axel Jensen, whose long-suffering wife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/07/so-long-marianne-leonard-cohen-writes-to-muse-just-before-her-death\">Marianne </a>turns a blind eye to his affairs while she looks after their baby. Clift<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/30/bohemian-tragedy-leonard-cohen-and-the-curse-of-hydra\"> is a writer herself</a>, author <em>of Peel Me a Lotus</em>, a memoir of her family\u2019s Aegean escape from \u201cthe rat race\u201d, though her days are now taken up with shopping and cooking thrifty meals when she\u2019s not coaxing George to work.</p> <p>Most seductively of all, there\u2019s 25-year-old Leonard, the soulful Canadian who arrives on Hydra with his guitar and moves in with Marianne after Axel abandons her for another woman. As a character Leonard is elusive. He\u2019s romantic, chivalrous and slippery, offering a lot but not delivering much, and given to aphoristic word salads. \u201cWhen it comes down to it, all subjects are just an allegory, a metaphor for human experience\u201d and \u201cIf we assume the role of melancholy too enthusiastically, we lose a great deal of life\u201d are typically airy Leonardisms. He spends his time bedding Marianne, popping amphetamines and bashing out the book that will eventually appear as <em>The Favourite Game</em>. He\u2019s already published a volume of poetry and is about to burst on to the world stage as a singer and songwriter. He is, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/leonard-cohen\">Leonard Cohen</a>, and Marianne is Marianne Ihlen, the Norwegian beauty who became, for the decade of their on-off relationship, his muse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d3d1ac5b9d6332a421aeaabb17578044d43de5c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d1ac5b9d6332a421aeaabb17578044d43de5c8/219_791_3172_4330/733.jpg\" alt=\"Disenchanted isle (from left) George Johnston, Charmian Clift, Jason Johnston, Marianne Ihlen and Leonard Cohen, Hydra, 1960.\" width=\"733\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disenchanted isle (from left) George Johnston, Charmian Clift, Jason Johnston, Marianne Ihlen and Leonard Cohen, Hydra, 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Burke/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marianne, \u201cbeautifully trained by Axel in the arts that facilitate good writing\u201d, is soon keeping house for Cohen as she once did for Axel, ensuring he always has \u201ca gardenia and a little sandwich\u201d on his writing table. She\u2019s a younger and still hopeful incarnation of the worn-out Charmian, just as Erica, in thrall to her Jimmy, is an apprentice version of the domestic goddess that is Marianne. Erica is too busy going to market and whipping up moussaka to pursue her own creative work: \u201cJimmy\u2019s been so inspired,\u201d she explains, \u201cand it\u2019s so often my turn to sort out a meal.\u201d As Charmian says wryly, \u201cWhere would these male writers be without their ministering angels?\u201d</p> <p>The Jimmys and Georges and Leonards are far better than Erica\u2019s father at concealing how ruthlessly they exploit their women, but the latter end up just as confined and broken as Erica\u2019s mother. Hydra itself is an illusion, its heady mix of male freeloaders, free-flowing retsina and freer love concealing a reality of unfulfilled female ambition, sexual betrayal, poverty and alcoholism. Samson captures both the dream and the disappointment in a frictionless prose that slips down easily. Sometimes she herself seems to fall for the myth she\u2019s setting out to expose: there are strumming bouzouki players and grumpy donkeys and scented jasmine around every sun-baked corner; two nubile girls look up \u201clike startled does\u201d, while Charmian has eyes of \u201cburning absinthe\u201d. And it\u2019s hard not to do an anatomical double-take when we\u2019re told that after a season on Hydra Jimmy\u2019s shoulders \u201care almost amphibian from swimming\u201d. Are they <em>green</em>? Warty? Or is Samson hinting that, like most of the princes in this theatre of dreamers, he\u2019ll turn out to be a frog?</p> <p>Even Leonard (no spoilers here) emerges as a bit of a bastard, doomed to be discontented with Marianne no matter how many sandwiches she makes. We\u2019re never entirely sure what his motivations are for dumping her, but then, no doubt the real-life Ihlen wasn\u2019t sure either. All in all, Samson is magnificently in control of her subject. If this beguiling, clever book has a moral it\u2019s that being a muse isn\u2019t all that amusing, and that, as Charmian puts it, \u201cyou should be very cautious of pinning all your dreams to a bloke, however talented and marvellous he may be\u201d. </p> <p>\u2022 <em>A Theatre for Dreamers is published by Bloomsbury Circus (RRP \u00a314.99).</em></p>",

  "<p>When the 1975 released the song Frail State of Mind last October, the opening line, \u201cGo outside? Seems unlikely,\u201d felt like a typical Matty Healy lyric: heavy emotions, light touch. Now, he says, it\u2019s one of many moments on the band\u2019s fourth album, Notes on a Conditional Form, that have acquired an uncanny resonance. \u201cThis album asks the same question as the last record,\u201d he says. \u201cCan the centre hold? Is this weird? It\u2019s slightly fearful. It\u2019s going to come out at a time when that feels quite justified.\u201d</p> <p>Well, yes. In a kinder timeline, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-1975\">the 1975</a> would be headlining US arenas and enjoying the full pre-release hoopla as you read this. So much for that. When lockdown loomed, Healy asked himself where he most wanted to be. Whenever he\u2019s not making music, he has \u201can inherent lack of purpose\u201d, so he headed straight for the band\u2019s residential studio in Northamptonshire with drummer and co-producer George Daniel. After finishing some production work, the pair started playing around with new 1975 material.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYYQpTbBSBM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wYYQpTbBSBM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The current situation has seeped into the lyrics \u2013 for a songwriter as attuned to society\u2019s background noise as Healy, how could it not? \u2013 but he is treading carefully. \u201cYannis from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/foals\">Foals</a> said the other day there\u2019s no prize for the first person to make the definitive corona album,\u201d Healy says, laughing, when we meet over FaceTime. He is in bunker mode: shaggy hair, baggy shirt, a dusting of stubble, a pack of cigarettes on the go. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in reactive statements. I\u2019m interested in living in an environment and then reflecting what that\u2019s like. I want to see what the conversations are and what people turn into.\u201d</p> <p>It is a wonder that the 1975 have anything left in the tank after Notes on a Conditional Form. Announced two years ago as a companion piece to the chart-topping, Brit-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/29/the-1975-a-brief-inquiry-into-online-relationships-review-sex-social-media-and-the-state-of-the-nation\">A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships</a>, its 22 songs have taken 19 months in 15 studios in four countries. Longer than Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Tusk and just a few minutes shy of the Beatles\u2019 White Album, it features, among other things, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/25/why-greta-thunberg-joined-the-1975\">Greta Thunberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/28/fka-twigs-in-shadow-of-man-robert-pattinson-surgery-new-album-miranda-sawyer\">FKA twigs</a>, a duet with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/25/better-oblivion-community-center-review-dead-oceans-indie-power-combo\">Phoebe Bridgers</a> about repressed homosexuality in middle America, a country-rock tour diary, a shoegazer\u2019s love song, a house banger fronted by Cutty Ranks, and a song written by Healy\u2019s dad 30 years ago. The governing themes, says Healy, are \u201canxiety, violence and unattainable beauty\u201d.</p> <p>He thinks it is the best 1975 album; it\u2019s certainly the <em>most</em> 1975 album. Far from your typical radio-friendly unit-shifter, it doubles down on the band\u2019s reputation for sounding like anything and withholding nothing: an inevitable consequence of their frontman\u2019s whirling brain. Thoughts fly off him like sparks from a wheel. If this compulsion to say whatever is on his mind makes him a divisive figure \u2013 to some the mood board for a generation, to others a pretentious motormouth \u2013 then so be it. \u201cI\u2019m not an avocado,\u201d he says, accurately. \u201cNot everyone thinks I\u2019m amazing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69a40ff09c77d42b9ed156e103208d121d9a368e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69a40ff09c77d42b9ed156e103208d121d9a368e/577_0_2432_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Was it something I said?

We make records and we live together. So it\u2019s not striving to be bold; it\u2019s avoiding being bored.\u201d</p> <p>The final track, Guys, is a sweet love song dedicated to the band he formed at Wilmslow high school in Cheshire: \u201cThe best thing that ever happened.\u201d This is the first album where he has allowed himself to look back. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talking about life in your 30s on this record,\u201d says Healy, who turned 31 in April. \u201cLike All My Friends by LCD Soundsystem: looking at my scene looking back on itself.\u201d That means reflecting on his life and the choices he has made. \u201cMy 20s was fucking chaos and I didn\u2019t live a domestic life so there are lots of things I\u2019ve just not learned. I\u2019m not emotionally very mature. There have been times when it does damage my relationships [he split up with the model Gabriella Brooks last summer] and I ask myself: \u2018Why do I value my career so much?\u2019 I\u2019m trying to relinquish that idea. I want to have a period in my life when I\u2019m not conflicted about it.\u201d</p> <p>Healy says he is trying to avoid any activity that doesn\u2019t actively serve the 1975\u2019s music. In March, he tweeted a spiky joke about social media (\u201cStop telling people to support you we don\u2019t want your EP and zine bundle right now Laura we\u2019re going to die\u201d) that prompted accusations of obnoxious privilege and made him want to keep quiet. \u201cMaybe that was my last venture on to Twitter,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019ve been burned by it \u2013 I don\u2019t give a fuck, I get cancelled every week \u2013 it\u2019s that I\u2019m more interested in my longform statement. I\u2019m comfortable putting out a record but not comfortable promoting myself. The idea of superficial self-promotion really stings people\u2019s eyes at the moment because it feels frivolous.\u201d </p> <p>The current crisis of purpose among celebrities fascinates him. As the son of two tabloid-haunted actors, Tim Healy and Denise Welch, he says he never found fame exotic. If anything, it seemed a drag. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to be present in the culture unless I have a song out. A lot of artists have found that this enormous void has been created and think: \u2018What can I do to take up the space I normally did? I\u2019ll do a cover of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/elton-john\">Elton John</a> on Instagram.\u2019 It\u2019s created this new culture of content. I\u2019m lucky that I have an album coming out and it is an album about this time and these kinds of ideas.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"df03d7869ea9a2d07c20e6f2fb0ed9775b4be927\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df03d7869ea9a2d07c20e6f2fb0ed9775b4be927/55_65_636_795/400.jpg\" alt=\"Matty Healy and FKA twigs.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matty Healy and FKA twigs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recently, Healy has attracted more intense scrutiny by becoming more politically outspoken. Since the 1975 released the first two tracks from the new album last summer \u2013 the protest-punk bottle-rocket People and a Greta Thunberg monologue set to music \u2013 he is expected to take a position on everything. When you are celebrated for spraying opinions like a firehose, your omissions raise suspicions. He thinks the funniest line on the album comes from Roadkill: \u201cI took shit for being quiet during the election and maybe that\u2019s fair, but I\u2019m a busy guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest with you I was so disillusioned,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, I don\u2019t like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a>, I didn\u2019t trust either of them. My point is: yeah, I know, but I\u2019m doing my bit. Start on someone else.\u201d Pick your battles, he advises other artists, but do pick something. \u201cIf you want to get involved in creating stuff, be prepared to say something because people are feeling a real sense of pointlessness. I think after this there\u2019s going to be a postwar feeling. I can\u2019t imagine something superficial changing the world.\u201d</p> <p>This is the kind of grand pronouncement that aggravates the sceptics, but Healy is often his own sharpest critic. He uses dialogue in his songs \u2013 half-real, half-invented \u2013 to interrogate himself. Integral to his commitment to honesty and self-awareness (\u201cIf you\u2019re making art, the bits you want to leave out are probably the bits you should put in\u201d) is the knowledge that honesty and self-awareness can turn into just another shtick if you are not careful. \u201cPeople who overshare because they think it\u2019s endearing can be quite exhausting. Self-deprecation is fine if it\u2019s real but anything performative is annoying. If people feel like you\u2019re curating their perspective of you they think: fuck off, just tell me the truth.\u201d</p> <p>These days, much of that personality curation takes place online. Healy is one of few songwriters who can examine internet culture without rendering you paralysed by embarrassment, because his music sounds the way the modern world feels: overstimulated, lurching between excitement and anxiety. \u201cThe overarching theme on my records is communication and conversation,\u201d he says. \u201cGod, heaven, hell, reincarnation \u2026 they\u2019re all amazing ideas but the only thing that\u2019s actually going to happen is this: me and you, talking and thinking about it. How we do that and why we do that is all I\u2019m really interested in.\u201d</p> <p>Now, we are being forced to live online like never before \u2013 a development that Healy finds surprisingly benign. \u201cIt\u2019s almost approaching the utopian, original idea of the internet, which is the extension of pre-existing relationships. The internet is a massive social experiment that\u2019s given us the freedom to do anything, and it seems like what we want is an environment for our anger and anxiety, but that\u2019s not what it was invented for.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1jw6Jw1Fqk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m1jw6Jw1Fqk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Healy has also been thinking about how music will change. Before the crisis, many artists were talking about reimagining live music in a more environmentally sustainable way. Healy, who has junked the current 1975 stage show, thinks that the industry\u2019s hard reboot will force their hands. \u201cThe gig\u2019s up. It\u2019s done,\u201d he says, waving his cigarette. \u201cWe need to fucking change the world. In live music, the doors aren\u2019t going to be kicked from the outside. They\u2019re going to be kicked from the inside by people like me and Alex Turner and Dua Lipa. It\u2019s about sacrificing the way things used to work because they don\u2019t work any more.\u201d</p> <p>They certainly don\u2019t work right now. For the 1975, the hard sell that attends a major release has come to a halt. No more gigs, TV appearances, billboard campaigns. Notes on a Conditional Form will simply appear online and stand or fall on its own merits. Healy has made his peace with that.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to me that this record feels like it came out at a different time. What people are excited about now is fundamental shit, like going for a walk, like being able to see their mum. So it\u2019s eclipsed all the superficial dances you usually do around a record.\u201d In a way this feels apt. \u201cI have been obsessed with the idea of the end of an era and going into a new decade. This fucking feels like it. We\u2019re in a new world.\u201d</p> <p><em>Notes on a Conditional Form is out on Friday 22 May</em></p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global number of confirmed cases passes 4.5m</h2> <p>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University at least 4,542,752 people are known to have been infected and 307,696 people have died worldwide since the pandemic began. The figures are likely to represent a significant underestimate of the true scale of the pandemic.</p> <h2>Democrats push $3tn response bill forwards</h2> <p>The US House of Representatives has narrowly approved a $3tn bill crafted by Democrats to provide more aid for battling the coronavirus and stimulating a faltering economy. But Republican leaders, who control the Senate, and Donald Trump have vowed to block it, despite some Republican support for provisions aimed at helping state and local governments.</p> <h2>Trump unveils \u2018warp-speed\u2019 drive for vaccine by year\u2019s end</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has announced details <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">of a \u201cwarp-speed\u201d effort to create a coronavirus vaccine</a> by the end of the year, even as experts warn that such a breakthrough could take longer than 18 months. During remarks in the White House Rose Garden on Friday that had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/truck-protest-donald-trump-coronavirus\">to compete with honking from protesting truck drivers</a>, the US president also urged schools to reopen in the autumn and insisted: \u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back.\u201d</p> <h2>Mexico sees highest daily confirmed infections</h2> <p>As Mexico moves toward a gradual reactivation of its economy from Monday, the number of new coronavirus infections grows higher every day, raising fears of a new wave of infections that other countries have seen after loosening restrictions, AP reports. There were 2,437 new coronavirus test confirmations Friday, the highest daily total yet and the second straight day with over 2,000 new cases.</p> <h2>Trump to restore partial funding to WHO - report</h2> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s administration is set to restore partial funding to the World Health Organization, <a href=\"https://fxn.ws/3bFNpuG\">Fox News reported late on Friday</a>, citing a draft letter. The Trump administration will \u201cagree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions\u201d to the WHO, Fox News reported, quoting from the letter. Trump suspended US contributions to the WHO on 14 April, accusing it of promoting China\u2019s \u201cdisinformation\u201d about the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <h2>Italy to allow travel to and from abroad from 3 June</h2> <p>Italy\u2019s government has approved a decree allowing travel to and from abroad from 3 June, moving to unwind one of the world\u2019s most rigid coronavirus lockdowns. The government will allow free travel across the country from that same day. Some regions had pushed for a swifter rollback but the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has insisted on a gradual return to normal to prevent a second wave of infections.</p>",

The state officially entered phase one of its \u201c<a href=\"https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Roadmap-to-Recovery-Phase-One-Initial-Guidance.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">roadmap to recovery</a>\u201d last weekend, but the casinos at the heart of the state\u2019s economy remain closed. Casino executives have made it clear that they are ready and prepared to reopen, but without a clear go-ahead from the governor, the industry remains in limbo.</p> <h2><br><strong>\u2018What the new normal is, we don\u2019t know\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Over the weekend, phase one eased restrictions on \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses located off the Las Vegas Strip, including restaurants, salons and retail stores. Some Las Vegans, such as Pam Cartwright, a hair stylist, returned to work. Although her salon can only operate at half-capacity, on reopening weekend, her chair was fully booked.</p> <p>When asked how her workplace is coping with the restrictions, Cartwright described clients leaving the salon with wet hair (the state is discouraging blow-outs to prevent the spread of pathogens).

She said her employer had not communicated any details about a reopening plan and she worried it could take months.</p> <p>For public-facing service industry workers like Cartwright, the anxieties extend far beyond the idiosyncrasies of operating a virus-free workplace. For many hospitality workers, there is a lingering fear that temporary furloughs could become permanent layoffs.</p> <p>\u201cReturning the economy to a sense of normal is going to take time,\u201d said John Restrepo, a principal consultant at the Vegas-based RCG Economics. \u201cWhat that new normal is, we don\u2019t know yet, but it\u2019s not going to be where casinos are operating on the weekends at 90% occupancy.\u201d</p> <p>Bigger casino companies such as MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment have made it clear that they will reopen in<a href=\"https://news3lv.com/news/coronavirus/caesars-plans-to-reopen-properties-in-phases\"> phases</a>. MGM Resorts <a href=\"https://www.ktnv.com/news/coronavirus/mgm-resorts-vegas-will-be-different-at-start-of-reopening\">plans</a> to open two properties at a time with 25% occupancy. In a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9QSUoJo8Hw\"> video</a> shared with team members and posted to YouTube, the Caesars Entertainment CEO, Tony Rodio, told furloughed employees the most difficult part of their reopening plan was that \u201cwe will not be able to bring back everyone immediately\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/las-vegas-strip-closed-coronavirus\">After the end of the world: the eerie silence of the Las Vegas Strip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For those union workers under a collective bargaining agreement, most <a href=\"https://www.culinaryunion226.org/members/contract/recall-from-layoff\">contracts</a> include language that requires companies to recall laid-off workers by seniority.

They plan to implement significant changes across hotel procedures, from check-in to dining to table games. But with cards being dealt face up and dealers disinfecting dice between shooters, necessary sanitation protocols could disrupt the prime gambling experience that people travel specifically to Las Vegas to get.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s smart to be cleaning chips and dice, but one thing that gamblers like is action,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cIf the pace slows down considerably, that\u2019s going to be tough to sell.\u201d</p> <p>In the coming weeks, Las Vegas can only offer best guesses on how to keep that pace up during \u201cvirus time\u201d. Until casinos are allowed to turn the lights back on, the city will have to wait to see how its chips will fall.</p>",
  "<p>\u201c<em>Anial chwith</em> \u201d \u2013 forlorn wilderness \u2013 is how the Welsh essayist D Tecwyn Lloyd termed the Berwyn mountains. Paddy Monkhouse, former northern editor of the Manchester Guardian and the best of the hillwalking writers from the 1930s, characterised these hills tersely as \u201cbastard, slithering things \u2026 rough and sloppy underfoot\u201d. Neither description is entirely fair. This great bulwark curves west from Chirk to Hirnant, seldom dropping below the 600m contour.

But because students would have to return them when school resumed, a shortage remained.</p> <p>\u201cJack\u2019s gift allows us to put a device in the hand of every single kid in Oakland. And because it came in now, we can order the computers, clean them up, and by the time kids come back to school in the fall, they\u2019re ready,\u201d Silver said.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the first contribution Dorsey has made toward fighting the impact of coronavirus. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/twitter-chief-to-donate-quarter-of-his-fortune-to-coronavirus-fight\">he announced</a> that he would donate $1bn of Square shares to a charitable fund, called Start Small, to \u201cfund global Covid-19 relief\u201d\u2013 by far the biggest single donation to the global fight to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>This week, Schaaf launched a program called Oakland Undivided, which aimed to raise $12.5m to permanently close the digital divide in the city. With Dorsey\u2019s $10m donation, coupled with funds already raised, the program is now only about $700,000 shy of its goal.</p> <p>Silver, however, said the fundraising would continue. Devices break; some are lost. Closing the gap for good meant raising $4m a year, every year, starting next summer, he said.</p> <p>With only two weeks left in the school year, nearly 1,400 Oakland students still need a device and about 3,400 don\u2019t have internet access, <a href=\"https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/05/15/with-summer-school-looming-ousd-sets-new-goal-to-overcome-digital-divide\">reported Berkeleyside</a>. Students who remain offline are kept from accessing educational content and connecting with teachers.</p> <p>The need persists even in the shadow of Silicon Valley. As schools shut down, and educators hustled to equip students with devices, a need for hotspots and access to the internet often went unmet. Back orders mounted, compounding wait times for students left unconnected.</p> <p>Lack of access to the internet is only one way existing inequities have manifested themselves during the pandemic. The same families without internet often face food scarcity or unstable living conditions \u2013 both of which have been exacerbated with businesses closed and parents out of work.</p> <p>Nearly three-quarters of Oakland\u2019s students qualify for free and reduced lunch, a rough proxy for poverty. About a third of all students are still learning English, according to state data.</p> <p>Education officials worry the digital divide will only widen existing performance gaps between families in poverty and those who are better off. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/business/school-education-online-money.html\">One economist</a> penned an op-ed in the New York Times predicting the education gap would one day show up in the labor force.</p> <p>Dorsey\u2019s donation won\u2019t be enough to permanently close the digital divide in Oakland. But will certainly help. Schaaf called Dorsey\u2019s announcement a \u201cgame changer\u201d.</p>",

They are: Rokodausiga Josua Talemaisolomoni, 44, who served in the Corrections Service for 21 years and was the officer in charge of Suva prison, the largest prison in Fiji; his second-in-command Hendrik De Wachter, 27; Robert Delana, 43, who served in a variety of roles during his 10 years in the Corrections Service and Isikeli Ravula, 31, who worked on the K9 unit which conducted searches for contraband.</p> <p>Talemaisolomoni and De Wachter allege they had been politically persecuted by Kean for allowing an opposition MP to visit an inmate. All four claim that due to Kean\u2019s political connections they could face serious penalties, including imprisonment, if they were to return to Fiji.</p> <p>They also claim that they were themselves subject to harsh punishments from the commissioner, including regularly being forced to jump into a pond of sewage, having their wages docked for weeks at a time and being ordered to walk 20km before and after work each day.</p> <p>In 2007, Kean pleaded guilty to manslaughter after he beat a man at the wedding of his niece,<strong> </strong>the daughter of the prime minister Frank Bainimarama, Kean\u2019s brother-in-law. The man died of a brain hemorrhage. Kean was convicted for manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months in prison, though he was released after just a few months. He was appointed to the position of commissioner in 2016.</p> <h2>\u2018I had no other option\u2019</h2> <p>The officers all claimed that corporal punishment was commonplace in the prisons and that Kean would routinely indicate to them that they were to assault inmates.</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t say it directly,\u201d said De Wachter. \u201cHe will say this Fijian word: <em>\u2018cakava ga na ka e dodonu me caka\u2019 </em>(Just do what is supposed to be done to them).
