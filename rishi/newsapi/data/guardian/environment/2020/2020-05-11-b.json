The warning comes after Germany reported an acceleration in new infections after easing its lockdown, and South Korea, another country that succeeded in limiting infections, saw a new outbreak in nightclubs.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, denied reports his senior scientific and medical advisers were not consulted on the much-maligned new messaging attached to <strong>his plan </strong></strong>to ease the country\u2019s lockdown as he set out the details in parliament. Amid muddled guidance from ministers on what the new rules actually allow, Johnson insists the public understands his government\u2019s message.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, announced an easing of the nationwide lockdown</strong>, even as the country reported a record number of new infections. Putin said people in some sectors would return to work, though restrictions on public gatherings would remain in place. </li> \n   <li><strong>Men\u2019s blood has higher levels of an enzyme used by the Sars-CoV-2 virus to infect cells</strong>, the results of a study published in the European Heart Journal show.

It is thought to play a role in how the infection progresses into the lungs.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Afghan capital, Kabul, recorded its worst day for infections, as 161 new cases were reported,</strong> and the health ministry warned transmission would continue to surge across the country.

the virus takes off again,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p> Governments around the world are struggling with the question of how to reopen their economies while still containing Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told the same briefing that lifting restrictions was \u201ccomplex and difficult\u201d and that the \u201cslow, steady lifting of lockdowns\u201d was

Twenty-two people have died and 378 have recovered from the virus. </p> \n  <p>On Saturday there were almost a thousand new cases announced by the government. The rate of infections has fuelled worries that the relaxed measures have caused the virus to spread further. In what is still technically an election year, criticism of the government has grown more intense.</p> \n  <p>The former president John Mahama, a candidate against Akufo-Addo\u2019s re-election, tweeted on Saturday: \u201cFrom 3,091 to 4,012 #COVID19 cases within 24 hours. Government is certainly failing the people of Ghana.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In the president\u2019s address the following day, he indirectly responded: \u201cI know some political actors would want you to believe that the new numbers represent a failure on our part, do not begrudge them.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The government insists that its fairly robust testing and tracing measures allow it to track the spread with precision and focus restrictions on specific locations rather than entire cities. So far 160,000 tests have been administered in Ghana, one of the highest totals in Africa. </p> \n  <p>Addo said a sharp rise in cases was partly due to a backlog of tests, which had now been cleared. Many recently confirmed cases were not new infections. Clusters of cases were being tightly traced, such as 533 infections at a fish processing factory which he said were all linked to one individual. </p> \n  <p>Health officials in Ghana feel the larger case numbers, among the highest in Africa, are largely a result of its more comprehensive and widespread testing campaign relative to other countries.

If we were to sustain this 8% reduction over the coming years, Shine calculated, we would avoid about 0.15\u00b0C of warming but sadly we would still massively overshoot our Paris agreement target of 1.5\u00b0C. \u201cThis emphasises the scale of the task we have ahead of us,\u201d said Shine.</p> <p>One way in which the reduced emissions might affect our weather is through associated improvements in air quality. <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/pope-francis.aspx\">Francis Pope</a> from the University of Birmingham <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/coronavirus-lockdown-air-pollution-warmer-weather-heatwave-nitrogen-dioxide-a9482996.html\">speculates </a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/coronavirus-lockdown-air-pollution-warmer-weather-heatwave-nitrogen-dioxide-a9482996.html\"> cleaner skies may allow more sunlight through</a>, producing a short-lived warming. Shine cautions though that some pollutants have the opposite effect and figuring out which effect dominates, and whether it has a measurable impact on weather, will be challenging.</p>",
  "<p>The Premier League is to attempt to persuade authorities to allow matches at home stadiums, the first of several hurdles the competition will try to clear after the government gave hope that football could return in June.</p> \n<p>As the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, talked of \u201cmomentum\u201d behind Project Restart and new medical protocols were submitted to the government, there was a sense the top flight might finally be coalescing around an approach for resumption. But after the fifth shareholders\u2019 meeting since play was suspended in March plans still remain incomplete and, for the first time, the possibility of curtailing the season was discussed openly by clubs.</p> \n<p>On Monday the government revealed its plans for easing the coronavirus lockdown. They included the possible resumption of \u201ccultural and sporting events\u201d which could \u201ctake place behind closed-doors for broadcast, while avoiding the risk of large-scale social contact\u201d. This would not be before 1 June and would be dependent on meeting the government\u2019s five tests for reducing the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>The Premier League learned of the plans just as their shareholders\u2019 meeting was coming to a close. The issue of playing matches at neutral venues and preventing crowds gathering at grounds was the greatest sticking point. Clubs in the bottom six were against neutral venues, claiming the absence of home advantage would distort the competition and other clubs, Newcastle being one, were against it too. At the meeting, it was decided the idea could be revisited.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think everybody would prefer to play home and away if at all possible,\u201d Masters said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s clear to see that some clubs feel more strongly about that than others. We\u2019ve been talking to the authorities about the conditions in which we could get the Premier League back up and running and taking all that advice on board. But it is an ongoing dialogue.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think some of our clubs would argue that, in relation to policing their own fans, they have a good relationship with them and they\u2019re in a better position to control that. But this has to be a decision that\u2019s come to mutually.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/11/horse-racing-hope-of-return-sent-back-drawing-board-government-sport-june\">Racing's hope of return in Britain sent back to the drawing board</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Clubs are expected to have local discussions about the possibility of putting on games at their own grounds. It is one of a number of pieces of continuing work; the most important remains agreeing medical protocols for, in the first instance, the safe return of training.</p> \n<p>The medical protocols have been worked on in conjunction with club doctors, some of whom have expressed concern about the contents, and on Monday they were presented to club officials. The League Managers Association and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association were also briefed and the protocols submitted to the government for their approval, with the expectation the further amendments may still be possible. For example, the league is yet to devise a protocol for practising safe contact training. A meeting with players is to follow on Thursday, getting their consent another huge component in keeping the plans for a restart on the road.<br><br>\u201cClubs are determined as part of the consultation process that [players\u2019] concerns and questions are heard. They will be later this week,\u201d Masters said. \u201cWe\u2019re really just talking about return to training protocols. In isolation it\u2019s a big decision.

We think we are going to be able to create that safe environment.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877ff1e7-010f-455c-bfcc-f6380cbd04b8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RxdZnvwKsh0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Masters admitted, however, that the possibility of the season not being completed had been discussed by clubs and that the path towards any matches remained difficult. <br><br>\u201cIt was discussed for the first time but the contents of that discussion have to remain confidential. What I can say is that all of the talk was about finishing the season. No conclusions were reached on any other models. Those are future conversations we may need to have.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prospective restart of matches has long been pegged to early June in discussions, but when asked if he thought these dates were still on course to be met, Masters demurred. \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t want to make a prediction now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many steps to be taken, many hurdles to get over before we get to that point. It\u2019s too early for us to talk about it. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe want to remain in step with government and the authorities, and we want to remain in step with the mood of football supporters. I think really the talk at the moment should be about the tentative steps we are taking now.\u201d</p>",

According to an analysis by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between mid-March and early May, about 24,000 more people died in the city than researchers would ordinarily expect, based on the season.</p> <p>That was about 5,300 more deaths that had been attributed to the coronavirus during that period. At his own press conference on Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that \u201cunless something miraculous happens\u201d, lockdown measures were \u201cgoing into June\u201d.</p> <p>The outbreak has been less severe in smaller cities and rural areas and Cuomo said three upstate regions had met all criteria for opening some business activity after 15 May: the Southern Tier, Mohawk Valley and the Finger Lakes.</p> <p>Other upstate regions could follow soon, Cuomo said, though the reopening regions still needed to work out logistics such as creating regional \u201ccontrol rooms\u201d to monitor the effects of reopening.</p> <p>Cuomo said the reopening would happen in four phases. The first businesses able to open would include construction, manufacturing and retail with curbside pickup.

Partly that might be a function of the new format (there is no \u201cmood of the house\u201d on Zoom, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/status/1258312562095128577\">as James Forsyth pointed out recently)</a>, but maybe they\u2019re just reserving judgment.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson rejected claims that people did not understand his new \u201cStay alert\u201d slogan. </strong>Yesterday <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, the SNP leader and Scottish first minister, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb80b458f0858b1a810765c#block-5eb80b458f0858b1a810765c\">she did not know what this meant.</a> But when the SNP\u2019s <strong>Chris Law </strong>asked Johnson to explain this, he insisted it was clear. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It will be perfectly obvious to the house what we\u2019re trying to do, and what we\u2019re saying by \u201cStay alert\u201d. What we\u2019re now saying is we\u2019re emphasising, or re-emphasising, the importance of those who cannot work from home going to work, provided their workplaces are Covid secure, provided that they observe the rules of social distancing on public transport, or however they go to work. That is what staying alert means.</p> \n   <p>Staying alert is going to be absolutely vital to our continued success in beating this virus. I think the British public understands exactly what we are trying to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In response to another claim that his new guidance was not clear, Johnson said he trusted the British public to apply \u201cgood, solid British common sense\u201d.

Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The intention is the Covid alert system in time will be sufficiently sensitive and flexible as to detect local flare-ups, so that for instance if Covid is detected in the water supply of a certain town, then steps can be taken, or in a school, in an area, then steps can be taken on the spot to deal with that flare-up. Measures can be taken to keep the R down locally as well as nationally.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the 18,000 new contract tracers being recruited by the government would be in place by 18 May. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said people should not use the new guidance on outdoor exercise as an excuse to visit second homes.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We don\u2019t want to see people, let me repeat, we don\u2019t want to see people travelling to another home for a holiday or to a second home, that is not what this is about.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said parents without childcare should not be expected to go to work.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I want to stress if you can\u2019t get the childcare you need to get to work then that is plainly an impediment on your ability to work and your employer should recognise that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said there would be \u201cvery substantial reductions in capacity\u201d on public transport as a result of social distancing.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He rejected a claim that Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser, failed to sign off the new \u201cStay alert\u201d slogan.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He rejected claims he had been reduced to acting as the prime minister of England, not of the UK</strong>.

One, I\u2019m sad to say, is the newspaper headlines on Thursday last week, which very much gave the impression that lockdown was over and set the tone for the weekend. Then we had the hot weather and VE day on Friday, a lot of street parties and people drinking in the street. Our number of incidents doubled on Friday. Then into the weekend we had a large number of people who decided lockdown no longer applied and that they were free to drive the length and breadth of the country and had spurious reasons for doing so.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He said his force was trying to work out what Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201csoundbite\u201d meant for policing, when the prime minister told the nation on Sunday: \u201cYou can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Slattery said it would be hard to enforce social distancing in the most popular destinations in the Lake District: \u201cIf people come en masse to the Lake District next weekend it will make social distancing very difficult if they congregate in the same car parks, go on the same busy footpaths in the honeypot areas,\u201d he said.<br><br>Latest figures show that Barrow in Furness in west Cumbria has by far the highest infection rate in England with 804 cases per 100,000 people.

  "<p>You can\u2019t defend Kyle Walker. A common sentiment, albeit one usually expressed with a comma in the middle. To break coronavirus protocol once, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/05/city-to-investigate-kyle-walker-over-sex-party-that-broke-quarantine-rules\" title=\"\">by hosting an adult-themed party at his house</a> in April, might be considered unfortunate. To do so twice, by visiting his family in south Yorkshire, unwise. To then compound matters by offering up a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/08/kyle-walker-hits-back-at-harrassment-after-breaching-covid-19-lockdown\" title=\"\">defiant statement complaining of \u201charassment\u201d</a> is probably the point at which someone close to the Manchester City and England right-back should probably have taken him to one side for a quiet, physically-distanced chat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/11/premier-league-and-other-sports-in-england-get-june-green-light-to-resume\">Premier League and other sports in England get June green light to resume</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI feel as though I have stayed silent long enough,\u201d Walker incorrectly surmised in the statement explaining his decision to drive 40 miles to visit his parents in Sheffield, having first dropped in on his sister for a chat and a hug. \u201cWhat am I meant to do, push her away?\u201d Walker asked, inadvertently answering his own question. Look, Kyle. Maybe read the room a little. Maybe a short period of lockdown for the mouth might not be the worst idea right now.</p> <p>If Walker didn\u2019t know at the time that he had screwed up, then the reaction to his statement on social media \u2013 shrill, censorious, bordering on the vindictive \u2013 will quickly have set him straight. His club are said to be deeply unimpressed, to say nothing of the England manager, Gareth Southgate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/england-squad-gareth-southgate-tyrone-mings-euro-2020-qualifiers\" title=\"\">who has not picked him for a squad</a> in almost a year. And yet as deeply, dangerously foolish as Walker has been, let\u2019s not pretend that this is a story motivated solely by a heartfelt concern for public health.</p> <p>Consider, for example, why it was deemed necessary for a newspaper to trace Walker\u2019s movements around northern England for nine hours. If it was a form of noble public interest journalism, then it appears to have been a curiously selective one: walk down virtually any street in the country right now and you will find numerous examples of distances not being kept, of non-essential trips being made, of rules being flouted. So why the big fuss about Walker in particular? The answer, of course, is not all coronavirus offenders are made equal. The flimsy \u201crole model\u201d defence is often applied in cases like this, an attempt to rationalise the very British impulse to tear down the famous.</p> <p>It is an impulse that finds its expression not just in newspapers but in a good deal of online discourse, where the urge to expose, to embarrass, to excoriate, has morphed into a sort of macabre spectator sport. The bigger the name, the bigger the cross on their back. It was ever thus.</p> <p>But there is a more specific context at play here, one that only really becomes apparent when you examine a text box accompanying the original newspaper story: an \u201cAll-Star Covidiots XI\u201d comprising footballers alleged to have breached lockdown. Walker is captain, naturally, but Tottenham\u2019s Serge Aurier, Ryan Sessegnon and Moussa Sissoko are all in there with him for not respecting physical distancing rules. Arsenal\u2019s Alexandre Lacazette too, after standing too close to a valet who had visited his house to wash his car.</p> <p>Who benefits from all this? Perhaps it seems overly cynical to point this out, but you may have noticed that a monumental battle is being waged within Premier League clubs right now, and it is a battle of optics and PR as much as testing capacity and sporting integrity. The Premier League has made it clear that come what may, the remainder of the 2019-20 season must be scheduled: behind closed doors if necessary, every two or three days if necessary, with players and staff sealed off from their families and swabbed to the eyeballs if necessary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/11/manchester-city-add-belgian-second-division-side-to-their-stable\">Manchester City parent company add Belgian team to their stable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A number of players have already voiced their concerns about taking the field in the jaws of a pandemic, when many of us will still be confined to our homes, when the virus is still killing hundreds of people daily. Sergio Ag\u00fcero says many are scared to play again. Aston Villa\u2019s Tyrone Mings and Norwich\u2019s Todd Cantwell have also voiced their concerns. Meanwhile, the news <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/10/brighton-restart-covid-19-premier-league\" title=\"\">that a third Brighton player tested positive</a> for coronavirus over the weekend was greeted in some quarters not with concern or empathy but the accusation that Brighton were deliberately infecting their players with a deadly virus in order to get the rest of the season cancelled. Well, they do say you have to dig deep in a relegation struggle.</p> <p>The point is this. At a time when the game\u2019s powerbrokers are desperately making the case to resume top-level football, it needs to win the debate on player welfare. It needs to convince fans, authorities and the public that the interests of the game outweigh the interests of its participants. That task becomes much easier if people are already predisposed to believing that footballers are pampered, entitled self-serving millionaires with no sense of civic duty and a predilection for sex parties. We saw elements of this in last month\u2019s absurd controversy over player wage deferrals.</p> <p>Or, to put it another way: when the resumption debate turns to player wellbeing, the Premier League would rather you weren\u2019t picturing Ag\u00fcero, or Cantwell, or the three Brighton players with coronavirus. They\u2019d rather you were picturing Kyle Walker, hurtling along the M62 in his sports car while the rest of us sit at home. For all the damage done to his own reputation, perhaps Walker\u2019s gravest indiscretion has been to drain public sympathy from his profession at a time when it is needed more than ever.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 May 2020 to remove references to a newspaper assigning a photographer to \u201cwait outside Walker\u2019s home\u201d and \u201ctrail him ... around northern England for nine hours\u201d. The Sun, which was the newspaper that reported on Kyle Walker breaching lockdown rules, has told the Guardian that while the player was photographed on its behalf in two locations that day, he was not followed.</p>",

If, as widely alleged, the resolution to abandon the season was not appropriate then the number of those who supported it is irrelevant. The league published a result with the vote still open.

Listeners had cause to laugh. The SPFL requires an 11-1 vote to make changes in its top league. The Old Firm to swap board positions in rotation.

The SPFL did not comment on these or any other allegations.</p> \n<p>Technically Fraser is not in the SPFL bubble so one can bet his thoughts will be readily disregarded.

  "<p>The death of Darby McCarthy last week saw the passing of one of the greats of Australian horse racing and a trailblazer of Aboriginal history.</p> <p>It is remarkable today that so few in the wider community and the Aboriginal community know of his life and achievements. He fully deserves to be recognised as a genuine legend. Across recent decades Aboriginal footballers such as Greg Inglis, Jonathan Thurston, Latrell Mitchell, Buddy Franklin, Adam Goodes and Michael O\u2019Loughlin have been justifiably recognised as genuine Australian stars. The term \u201clegend\u201d with Aboriginal sporting achievement is today far more freely given than in Darby\u2019s time and he earned it the hard way.</p> <p> McCarthy was born at Cunnamulla in western Queensland where he grew up in a family of 12 on the outskirts of town.</p> <p>\u201cWe lived between the cemetery and the sewerage outlet, mate. Blacks weren\u2019t allowed up in the town mind you.

That moment still inspires me today | Anita Heiss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He fell in love with horses at an early age, watching them run past him kicking up the dust at the Thargomindah races, where he got his first ride. McCarthy went from that dirt track to ride winners all over the world. His cool head under pressure and skill in the saddle gained him riding contracts in Europe for some of the richest owners in the sport: the Rothschilds, Daniel Wildenstein and Prince Aly Khan. He partied with Frank Sinatra, Mia Farrow, Rock Hudson and Lee Marvin. In France, in the employ of the Aga Khan, he lived in a two-story mansion with servants.</p> <p> McCarthy won the Brisbane Cup, the Doomben 10,000, three Stradbroke Handicaps, AJC Tancred Stakes and, in one unforgettable afternoon in 1969, he won both the AJC Epsom Handicap and the AJC Derby.</p> <p>At the time, many Aboriginal people were living in a shocking state of inequality and neglect. Aboriginal sportsmen and women in any field were rarely given the opportunity to participate at a top level. There were long-held colour bars of exclusion that denied Aboriginal people the chance for sporting success. There were no Aboriginal land councils, legal services, children\u2019s services, medical services or the thought that an Aboriginal person could attain a university degree.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a581015d601b8e8bbb57b8d879e431aba2ba5a68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a581015d601b8e8bbb57b8d879e431aba2ba5a68/140_79_1857_1622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darby McCarthy holds a copy of his autobiography Against All Odds at the launch in Brisbane in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"873\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darby McCarthy holds a copy of his autobiography Against All Odds at the launch in Brisbane in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin King/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the 60s proved to be a decade of major social and political change. There was an enormously divisive war in Vietnam and a highly visible civil rights movement in the United States. African Americans such as Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali gained widespread media coverage. Arrernte and Kalkadoon man Charles Perkins and Gumbaynggirr man Gary Williams were the first Aboriginal men enrolled at the University of Sydney in 1964. Witnessing the severe disadvantage and suffering of his people, Perkins emulated Martin Luther King and set off on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2020/feb/21/freedom-ride-1965-protesters-challenge-ban-on-aboriginal-people-at-moree-pool-in-pictures\">freedom ride </a>across western New South Wales. It was the ignition point for a generation of Aboriginal political activism.</p> <p>The decade also witnessed the arrival of three major Aboriginal global sports stars. Lionel Rose won the world bantamweight boxing title by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/27/50-years-on-from-fighting-harada-remembering-aboriginal-boxing-champion-lionel-rose\">beating Fighting Harada in Japan</a>, Evonne Goolagong Cawley won 14 tennis grand slam titles including two at Wimbledon. And then there was the genius jockey, Richard Lawrence \u201cDarby\u201d McCarthy.</p> <p>Darby McCarthy was intent on enlightening the wider community on the special place of Aboriginal culture in the country. He had a lightening-quick wit and once had to correct an interviewer who referred to him as \u201ccoloured\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m black,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cYou\u2019re coloured. I was born black, stay black and die black. You\u2019re born pink, go white, get brown in the sun and finally end up grey.\u201d</p> <p>On another occasion, a writer into a newspaper complained that reporters always referred to McCarthy as Aboriginal. McCarthy responded himself in the press:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIf any newspaper man wants to do me a favour, he can call me an Aborigine as often as he mentions my name \u2013 because that is what I am and if I am going to be a success, it is important that I be known as an Aboriginal success.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2b3d829b8c338330080be55ba4474b94571c0cf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b3d829b8c338330080be55ba4474b94571c0cf6/0_0_2575_3603/715.jpg\" alt=\"Jockey Darby McCarthy polishing his saddle October 2, 1969.\" width=\"715\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darby McCarthy polishes his saddle in 1969, the year he won the AJC Epsom Handicap and the AJC Derby in one afternoon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grant Peterson/Fairfax Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I grew up on the racecourse. My father Merv Maynard was a top Koori jockey and an inductee of the Aboriginal Sports Hall of Fame. Back in 1967 as a 12-year-old I had a picture of McCarthy hanging on my bedroom wall. That image appeared in a Sydney newspaper of the day and it covered the whole back page. It showed McCarthy alighting from a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce at the Epson race meeting in England, in a top hat and beige tails. That picture was a source of great inspiration to me. McCarthy\u2019s achievements showed we could climb to the very top. It was also the dignity and pride that he carried with being Aboriginal that was a beacon of inspiration during those years.</p> <p>More than 20 years ago, I was very privileged to sit down and record some interviews with McCarthy. I was writing a history of Aboriginal jockeys, which became the first edition of the book, <em>Aboriginal Stars of the Turf</em> in 2002. The book was so popular that it was revised and republished with a new title, <em>Aborigines and the Sport of Kings,</em> in 2013. McCarthy came down from his home in Toowoomba to assist in the original launch and promotion of the book at Randwick racecourse, and he did the same thing in 2013 with the launch at Flemington.</p> <p>He was always so giving with his time and support.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/27/johnny-mullagh-was-one-of-australias-first-cricketing-heroes-his-story-deserves-wider-recognition\">Johnny Mullagh was one of Australia's first cricketing heroes.

The demographic under the dome is not unlike the one in Brunswick East, in Melbourne\u2019s inner north, which is populated by well-meaning, educated people who want to save the planet, some of whom also want to stay up partying and doing drugs at a nearby pizza parlour. There are households growing their own vegetables, urban foragers, wild yeasts and biodynamic everything.</p> <p>The film opens with a voice bellowing about searching for hope in the face of environmental disasters, over footage of burning oil derricks and baby ducks covered in tar, so we\u2019ve known fossil fuels are bad since at least \u201996.

They star alongside Kylie Minogue playing an oceanographer which is confusing because the Bio-Dome doesn\u2019t have an ocean and the only \u201cscience\u201d we see Minogue\u2019s character do involves her licking a carrot. Why she\u2019s named after the lead character in German auteur Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s film The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant is also inexplicable.</p> <p>Coming in hot from starring alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme in the big-screen Street Fighter adaptation, Minogue says Bio-Dome was her worst career move and is the only thing she\u2019s done in her professional life that her father ridicules her for. (I was unable to find the original source of this bit of Minogue IMDB trivia, but if you\u2019ve seen Bio-Dome it\u2019s believable.) Despite the current hype, Street Fighter will always be cooler than Animal Crossing.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a Tenacious D cameo at an environmental rally that resembles the kind of moshpit-free, socially distanced concert you can see happening once lockdown lifts. It\u2019s perhaps a best-case scenario \u2013 the worst being free-for-all, virus-spreading parties like the one Bud and Doyle throw in the Bio-Dome.</p> <p>Relations are tense between Bud, Doyle and the scientists after the big bash trashes their experiment. It drives the film\u2019s baddie \u2013 doctor Noah Faulkner \u2013 insane, forcing him to sneak around his bountiful ark like a Tinder user ignoring lockdown restrictions.

  "<p>Anti-lockdown protests in Australia over the weekend mimicked some of the conspiracy theories and language of similar protests in the United States but they\u2019re unlikely to grow as big due to the limited size of the groups within Australia, according to one misinformation researcher.</p> <p>More than 100 people gathered outside parliament in Victoria and a smaller crowd gathered in Sydney to protest the lockdowns, \u201ctracking apps\u201d and vaccines.</p> <p>The weekend protests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/10/ten-arrested-and-police-officer-injured-at-protest-against-victorias-covid-19-lockdown-laws\">were promoted on various Facebook groups</a> linked to fringe conspiracy groups including QAnon and various anti-vaxxers, with many of the signs at the protests targeting Microsoft founder Bill Gates for his work on vaccines \u2013 a popular target of conspiracy theorists.</p> <p>It is understood Facebook has removed events encouraging people to breach the physical distancing rules, and on one of the pages promoting the protests several posts have been removed for breaching Facebook\u2019s guidelines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/tech-firms-criticised-for-lack-of-answers-on-covid-19-disinformation\">Tech firms criticised for 'lack of answers' on Covid-19 disinformation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rallies followed much larger demonstrations in the US in recent weeks, with Australian protesters copying slogans and promoting similar conspiracy theories. The theme of posts on some of the group pages behind the weekend protests imitate those seen on fringe far-right groups in the US.</p> <p>But the groups often diverge in what they believe in, with the only common denominator being a purported link to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Axel Bruns, a professor in digital media research at Queensland University of Technology, told Guardian Australia the pandemic was bringing wildly differing conspiracy theory groups together.</p> <p>\u201cAny group with pre-existing conspiracy theories has projected their conspiracy theories on to the corona crisis in some form as well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhether that\u2019s the anti-vaxxers or the anti-5G people \u2026 it\u2019s quite likely that all of these groups have some belief there is an underlying story they\u2019re not being told.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the problem, he said, was that information about coronavirus was slow to emerge as the pandemic took hold.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a very genuine information vacuum, even authorities didn\u2019t have all the answers and couldn\u2019t have all the answers at that point. That\u2019s always what happens at the start of a major crisis,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Unlike the anti-lockdown protests in the United States, Australia\u2019s so far have been relatively small. Bruns puts this down to a lack of a pre-existing network, and the Australian government\u2019s response to the economic impact.</p> <p>\u201cWe probably won\u2019t get to the [US] point because we don\u2019t have the undergrowth of existing conspiracy theorists or fringe groups, but it will be interesting to see how things develop as people get fed up with the ongoing restrictions or ongoing lockdowns.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough but it\u2019s certainly not as polarised and as dysfunctional as it is in the US \u2026 it\u2019s easy to get people who are already quite upset and annoyed and frustrated.

Care workers will expect that regret expressed in hard cash once the crisis ebbs. To save the NHS, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-elderly-sp/special-report-in-shielding-its-hospitals-from-covid-19-britain-left-many-of-the-weakest-exposed-idUKKBN22H2EI\">15,000 patients were tipped out of hospitals</a> on 17 March into \u201cthe community\u201d, mainly care homes, with no testing, or, in some cases, having already tested positive. Care homes and community care workers were left defenceless. As one NHS leader told me: \u201cIf they\u2019re lucky, homes will have one nurse who had a course in infection control 30 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>The government knew about, but chose not to be \u201calert\u201d to, deaths in Spanish care homes. In later inquests and inquiries, families\u2019 anger at lonely care home deaths will not evaporate, with a strong suspicion that many died gasping for breath without enough morphine or tranquilisers. Some complain about GPs staying well away \u2013 though others tell of GPs heroically taking on neglected care home patients. Within just the first month of lockdown, an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86d9807e-2a47-47b2-8dff-8ab50b16e036\">additional 11,000 </a><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86d9807e-2a47-47b2-8dff-8ab50b16e036\">care homes deaths</a> were reported, according to a Financial Times survey. </p> <p>Will the care home body bags \u2013 of staff as well as patients \u2013 finally prompt the political crash trolley to resuscitate social care? The promised green paper has been kicked into the Westminster long grass. Hope rose when the health secretary, Matt Hancock, appeared with a Care badge at one press conference, but it was never seen again.</p> <p>The call for \u201cparity of esteem\u201d between NHS and social care rings out louder than ever in this crisis, with NHS promises never again to call care workers \u201cunskilled\u201d. Having worked in a care home, I can testify to good care workers\u2019 remarkable qualities. Yet a fully trained nurse in a care home is paid massively less than an NHS nurse: no wonder they are hard to hire. A plan from Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/29/national-care-service-labour\">National Care Service</a> would blend the two careers together under the same NHS Agenda for Change training and pay. But equalising them into a single force with people moving seamlessly each way needs money \u2013 and a change in professional attitudes. </p> <p>Local integrated care systems can happen, where councils are treated as equal partners. It happens in places \u2013 such as Salford or Oldham \u2013 where both services are commissioned together, wards interchangeable with care beds. But the obstacle, as ever, is austerity forcing both sides to tussle over puny funding. Besides, for as long as most care homes and services are profit-making, bonding them with the NHS will always be a viper\u2019s nest of contradictions. Add to that the brutal truth that caring for those with dementia in their last years always lacks the status and glamour of heroic life-saving in university hospitals.</p> <p>Optimists look at the great leap forward in this crisis as the two sectors are thrown together as never before, breaking through professional iron curtains showing them to be utterly interdependent. But that was oiled by \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d cash. Those 15,000 put into the community and care homes arrived as NHS-paid patients. Ian Hudspeth, an Oxfordshire council leader and LGA lead on community wellbeing, points to the \u00a34,000 they cost in an acute bed, \u00a31,200 in a care bed or \u00a3400 cared for in their own homes: if they always arrived with an NHS endowment, those \u201cbed-blockers\u201d would be easily discharged. As it is, he says councils are \u00a310bn out of pocket in this crisis, only compensated with \u00a33.2bn by government.</p> <p>Here\u2019s yet another wicked care issue: families didn\u2019t protest when those thousands were transferred to care homes as they were still registered as NHS patients, not needing to not pay care home fees. But families might have kicked up a fuss if the usual means-testing had landed them with a steep bill.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/how-did-we-end-up-turning-our-care-homes-into-jails-of-enforced-loneliness\">How did we end up turning our care homes into jails of enforced loneliness?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All the wicked issues in care come back to money \u2013 and until that\u2019s resolved there\u2019s no easy path for this \u201cintegration\u201d. Unlike the NHS, care was never free: with so much wealth accumulated in old people\u2019s property, few think younger generations with less property should pay via their taxes. But whatever system of payment \u2013 Burnham suggested a lump sum paid on retirement \u2013 care absolutely must be free at the point of use by the time old people need help, or the two systems will never meld.</p> <p>Here\u2019s that other wickedness, the Tory privatisation of care: in 1979, <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/2019-05/social-care-free-at-the-point-of-need-may-19.pdf\">64% of care homes were NHS or council owned</a>, most others charitable, but by 2012, 94% were private or for-profit. Many are now teetering on the edge, costs rising as they are forced to isolate patients better \u2013 and each death means lost income. Ros Altmann, a former Tory pensions minister, castigates the big care firms \u201cbought up by hedge-funders at knockdown prices, loaded with debt, tripling their money\u201d. They know homes can\u2019t be allowed to collapse. \u201cBut,\u201d she rightly says, \u201cdon\u2019t bail them out, take them over.\u201d That would ease a host of problems.</p> <p>No wonder Hancock doesn\u2019t wear his Care badge. He wouldn\u2019t be able to account for this ramshackle array of 11,000 mostly private homes. Soon the NHS really will be overwhelmed by its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/26/more-than-two-million-operations-cancelled-as-nhs-fights-covid-19\">gargantuan waiting lists</a>.

He praised Russia\u2019s doctors and nurses and said \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d had prevented a worse outbreak.</p> <p>The opposition politician Alexei Navalny <a href=\"https://twitter.com/navalny/status/1259838230125522944\">wrote on Twitter</a>: \u201cThis should be remembered.

W for Wisdom.\u201d</p> <p>The official death toll in Russia is 2,009, with 94 new deaths reported in the last 24 hours. But there are widespread suspicions that the numbers are wrong. <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2020/05/11/85324-neuchtennye\">Novaya Gazeta</a> suggested the real figure could be three times higher, based on an analysis of monthly deaths compared with previous years.</p> <p>\u201cSo far we only see that the increase in mortality is large. It\u2019s many times more than the official number of deaths from coronavirus. By how much \u2013 two, three or more \u2013 we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Boris Ovchinnikov, Data Insight\u2019s research director, <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2020/05/11/85324-neuchtennye\">told the paper.</a></p> <p><strong>France</strong>, <strong>the Netherlands</strong> and <strong>Spain</strong> all took significant steps on Monday towards ending their lockdowns. Across France, shops \u2013 including hairdressers \u2013 reopened. Citizens were allowed to venture out without formal permission and to drive up to 100km (60 miles) from their homes.</p> <p>In Paris, the traffic was noticeably up as some people returned to their offices for the first time after an extended break.</p> <p>Dutch primary schools partially reopened, together with nurseries and libraries. Some hairdressing and beauty salons welcomed customers.</p> <p>About half of Spain took its first tentative steps towards what the government calls \u201cthe new normality\u201d as lockdown restrictions were loosened for many regions \u2013 but not for Madrid and Barcelona.</p> <p>With 51% of Spaniards living in areas that have passed into the second phase of the de-escalation, people were able to congregate in groups of up to 10 individuals, shop in small stores and order a drink or a meal on the terraces outside bars and restaurants.</p> <p>Areas that qualify include most of Andalusia \u2013 Spain\u2019s most populous southern region \u2013 as well as the Canary and Balearic Islands. Bars, restaurants, shops, museums, gyms and hotels were allowed to open. Most operated at reduced capacity.</p> <p>But the capital and Barcelona, two of the hardest-hit cities, remain in the first phase. They will not be able to follow suit until they have permission from the health ministry. </p> <p>The trend across Europe appears to be one of region-specific easing. Many urban areas are set to continue with restrictive measures amid fears of a second wave of infections.</p> <p>In <strong>Germany</strong>, Angela Merkel urged people to remain vigilant. Appearing in the sky lobby of her chancellery in Berlin, she said Germans should continue with physical distancing and wear masks. It was \u201cvery important\u201d that people stuck to the \u201cbasic precepts\u201d, she stressed.</p> <p>Her brief comments followed a rise in Germany\u2019s infection rate at the end of last week, in the wake of an easing of restrictions. Over the weekend thousands of demonstrators gathered in cities around the country protesting against what they saw as the infringement of their civil liberties.</p> <p>There were reports that many people were failing to abide by the distancing or face covering rules \u2013 paradoxically as a result of the fact that Germany has successfully contained much of the epidemic. Its infection rate on Monday afternoon was 172,658. A total of 7,681 Germans have died of the virus \u2013 far fewer than in other European countries of similar size.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>South Korea</strong> pushed back its reopening of schools by a week as health authorities found dozens of coronavirus infections linked to nightclubs.</p></li> <li><p>The <strong>Afghan</strong> capital, Kabul, recorded its worst day for infections after 161 new cases were reported, and the health ministry warned transmission would continue to surge across the wartorn country.

  "<p>Modern humans were present in Europe at least 46,000 years ago, according to new research on objects found in Bulgaria, meaning they overlapped with Neanderthals for far longer than previously thought.</p> <p>Researchers say remains and tools found at a cave called Bacho Kiro reveal that modern humans and Neanderthals were present at the same time in Europe for several thousand years, giving them ample time for biological and cultural interaction.</p> <p>\u201cOur work in Bacho Kiro shows there is a time overlap of maybe 8,000 years between the arrival of the first wave of modern humans in eastern Europe and the final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/nov/27/bad-luck-may-have-caused-neanderthals-extinction-study\">extinction of Neanderthals</a> in the far west of Europe,\u201d said Prof Jean-Jacques Hublin, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, a co-author of the research, adding that that was far longer than previously thought. Some scholars have suggested a period of not more than 3,000 years.</p> <p>Neanderthals were roaming Europe until about 40,000 years ago. \u201cIt gives a lot of time for these groups to interact biologically and also culturally and behaviourally,\u201d Hublin added. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/bulgaria_cave-zip/giv-3902lTDOK15HFfAI/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/bulgaria_cave-zip/giv-3902lTDOK15HFfAI/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>Writing in studies published in the journals <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2259-z\">Nature</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1136-3\">Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</a>, Hublin and colleagues report how they excavated Bacho Kiro, a site that has been studied several times over the past decades. Previous excavations revealed human remains and tools of a very specific type known as \u201cinitial upper palaeolithic\u201d. Hublin said such stone and bone tools showed features both of tools known to have been used by Neanderthals and toolkits used by later modern humans, with much debate over which hominin was making them.</p> <p>However, previous dating of the site ran into a number of difficulties, including from contamination. Now Hublin and colleagues have carried out new excavations and unearthed more tools and remains, including bone fragments and a tooth revealed by methods including ancient DNA analysis to be from early modern humans.</p> <p>The team report that radiocarbon dating of modern human remains found in the same layer as the tools suggested the remains dated to between 46,790 and 42,810 years ago, while a dating technique based on the rate of changes in DNA from mitochondria, the \u201cpowerhouses\u201d of cells, suggested a date of between 44,830 and 42,616 years ago.</p> <p>The team say the same sort of tools were found in the layer beneath, alongside animal remains dating to almost 47,000 years ago. \u201cWe are talking about the oldest modern humans in Europe,\u201d said Hublin, adding that their archaeological context was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d. In other words, this group was making initial upper palaeolithic tools .</p> <p>Among further discoveries, the researchers found jewellery fashioned from cave bear teeth that they say is strikingly similar to that produced by the very last Neanderthals. They say this adds weight to the idea the latter may have adopted innovations as a result of contact with early modern humans.</p> <p>\u201cSome people would say that is a coincidence; I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Hublin, noting there was already genetic evidence that the groups interbred. \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can have biological interaction between groups without any sign of behavioural influence of one on the other.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Chris Stringer, an expert in human origins from London\u2019s Natural History Museum, said while <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48913307\">his </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48913307\">team had previously discovered</a> what was possibly an incomplete modern human skull in Greece from more than 200,000 years ago, the new research was important.</p> <p>\u201cIn my view this is the oldest and strongest published evidence for a very early upper palaeolithic presence of <em>Homo sapiens</em> in Europe, several millennia before the Neanderthals disappeared,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He added that doubt remained about whether Neanderthals were influenced in their jewellery making by early modern humans.</p> <p> Stringer said the new study highlighted several mysteries, including why the appearance of such early modern humans in Europe 46,000 years ago did not lead to their earlier establishment and an earlier disappearance of Neanderthals.</p> <p> \u201cOne possibility is that the dispersals into Europe [of modern humans of the initial upper palaeolithic] were by pioneering, small bands, who could not sustain their occupations in the face of a larger Neanderthal presence, or the unstable climates of the time,\u201d he said.</p>",

  "<p>A long out-of-print novel about a deadly virus by Stanley Johnson, the father of UK prime minister Boris Johnson, is to be reissued this summer, two weeks after it emerged that he was trying to find it a new publisher during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Having been pitched to UK publishers as \u201can urgent, exhilarating novel\u201d by \u201ca tireless self-promoter\u201d, Johnson senior\u2019s 1982 novel The Virus has been snapped up by Black Spring, an imprint of Eyewear Press, an independent publisher founded by poet Todd Swift. Originally titled The Marburg Virus, the novel follows an epidemiologist who must race against time to develop a vaccine when an unknown virus breaks out in New York. Based on a real event in Germany in the late 1960s, it also stars a US president desperate to come out on top.</p> <p>In a new afterword, Johnson writes: \u201cWill the fight against Covid-19 be as successful as my fictional hero was in fighting the Marburg virus? ... Thinking back to my own book, and its eventual happy ending, I can\u2019t help feeling that governments around the world, our own included, need to be ruthlessly focused on the search for an antidote or a vaccine. Without in any way diminishing the importance of precautionary measures of containment or mitigation, mass immunisation would surely prove a crucial factor in stopping the spread of Covid-19 or in preventing further outbreaks, eg the \u2018second wave\u2019 we are hearing about.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, Swift would not confirm the size of the deal, but said that they \u201cwere able to agree a deal that works for both a smaller indie press and a household British name, to forge a dynamic, unexpected alliance of strengths\u201d.</p> <p>Jonathan Lloyd, Johnson\u2019s literary agent at Curtis Brown, said the novel was presented to four publishers but it \u201cdid not get a positive response\u201d until Black Spring responded.</p> <p>\u201cYou would think it was a no-brainer, that a publisher would jump up and down at a novel that is already edited and ready to go,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThey are entitled to their opinion, I just found it rather disappointing. They may well live to regret it, but that is the fun of publishing \u2026 you may not agree with Stanley and his politics, or his son, but it is a jolly good thriller and it is extraordinarily valid today. If anyone thought \u2018I\u2019m not going to buy it because I don\u2019t like Stanley Johnson\u2019, I think that is rather pathetic.\u201d</p> <p>When it emerged in early May that he was attempting to get a new publisher, the 79-year-old author denied he was being opportunistic. \u201cI\u2019m a professional writer,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/01/stanley-johnson-pushes-for-new-release-of-his-40-year-old-virus-novel\">he told the Guardian.</a> \u201cIs it opportunistic for journalists and newspapers to be writing about the coronavirus?\u201d</p> <p>Secondhand paperback editions of The Marburg Virus have recently been listed online for more than \u00a350. \u201cAll the more reason to produce a new version now,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI do hope it happens \u2026 I had such fun writing it.\u201d</p> <p>The Virus will be published in print and ebook formats alongside a reissue of Johnson\u2019s environmental thriller The Warming, which follows a journalist who uncovers a global conspiracy involving a miracle mineral that could stop the climate crisis.</p> <p>Reviews of the novel are mixed online. One Goodreads reviewer called it \u201cfast paced and entertaining\u201d but said the plot \u201cbordered on gross inaccuracy and strained credulity\u201d, while another wrote: \u201cMade it about a third of the way through this before I got too annoyed with its stupidity and quit.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Despite the government\u2019s temporary <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-support-available-for-landlords-and-renters-reflecting-the-current-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak\" rel=\"nofollow\">ban on eviction proceedings until at least June</a>, Shelter continues to see families who urgently need somewhere to stay during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some find themselves in this position because of unlawful eviction by landlords and others because they need to escape violence and abuse. Refuge recently reported a <a href=\"https://www.refuge.org.uk/25-increase-in-calls-to-national-domestic-abuse-helpline-since-lockdown-measures-began/\" rel=\"nofollow\">25% increase in calls to its National Domestic Abuse Helpline</a> during the second week of lockdown.</p> <p>Since lockdown, in line with government guidance, Shelter has, where possible, moved its face-to-face support to <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/coronavirus\" rel=\"nofollow\">online and local telephone advice</a>, so that those who need support can still access free and expert help. Shelter is receiving calls from desperately worried people, who cannot follow the public health advice because of the accommodation they are in. Despite this difficult situation, its frontline teams are working harder than ever to ensure those in need of support can access it.</p> <p>England\u2019s housing emergency means there were already a growing number of homeless families living in temporary accommodation, such as hostels, B&amp;Bs and converted office blocks, before the pandemic struck. Many are lone-mother households: more than two-thirds (69%) of homeless families with children living in temporary accommodation are headed by a lone parent, the vast majority (93%) of whom are mothers. Temporary accommodation can mean the whole family living in one room with shared facilities.</p> <p>London has the highest number of homeless families, with 71% of those in temporary accommodation placed there by London boroughs. Chantelle Louise Welsh from Borough and Bermondsey in south-east London is typical of the women who contact Shelter when they find themselves in dire circumstances as a result of the housing emergency.</p> <p>She was statutorily homeless for a year with her then 14-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son. She had previously rented social housing, but because of an acute lack of this type of housing, there were long waiting times for her to move away from the poor living conditions and antisocial behaviour where she lived. So, she decided to take a private rental which offered a better-quality home, and safer environment to raise her children. They found a flat, which became their home for five years, but when the tenancy ended they were left unable to find anywhere else they could afford.</p> <p>While staying with family, she applied for assistance from her local council. A string of unsuitable offers of temporary accommodation followed, some with broken facilities and disrepair, others many miles from her children\u2019s school and her work as a travel consultant. She was at her wits\u2019 end when she decided to reach out to Shelter.</p> <p>\u201cThey threw me a lifeline when I was in a dark place,\u201d she says. \u201cPrior to that I was feeling isolated, suicidal and totally hopeless trying to find somewhere suitable to live with my children.\u201d</p> <p>Along with online information and a helpline, Shelter offers local advice, support and legal services through its London hub; one of 12 across England. These hubs offer a range of services and long-term support to people with housing problems, including those who are homeless, or at risk of homelessness. Shelter also offers help via its specialist outreach projects in the boroughs hardest hit by the housing emergency, to families affected by it. </p> <p>\u201cLondon is huge and housing issues are widespread,\u201d says London hub manager Hannah Norgate. \u201cWe found a high proportion of homeless lone mothers and families struggling in accommodation that did not meet their basic needs, so it made sense to pilot a comprehensive service to better support them.\u201d</p> <p>One of its most recent successes is Newham Family Action, set up by Shelter through funding and run in conjunction with The Magpie Project, Project 17, London Black Women\u2019s Project, Kay Rowe children\u2019s centre, St Stephens children\u2019s centre and West Ham Lane health centre last year. Newham has the highest rate of people who are homeless across all local authorities in England, with <a href=\"https://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/1883817/This_is_England_A_picture_of_homelessness_in_2019.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">one in 24 people in the borough regarded as homeless</a>. Building on Shelter\u2019s work throughout the borough, it offers community advice outreach sessions to women and children in key locations such as children\u2019s centres and health centres. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, the service is providing support by telephone and it continues to take referrals from a range of community and statutory services.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58d4fa0f0db84cd0dead527744c55987988ddbb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58d4fa0f0db84cd0dead527744c55987988ddbb2/0_117_1750_1050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"INLINE EDIT 200217 Hannah Norgate Hub manager Shelter Shot 02 013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shelter hub manager Hannah Norgate: \u2018With Covid-19, we are being contacted by desperate people who have lost employment and are rapidly getting into arrears.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Yeo/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe work in partnership with other community organisations to address whatever needs our clients and their families might have,\u201d says Norgate. \u201cWhat makes a project like this so helpful to those in need is that it\u2019s a partnership model, linking people with other specialist agencies to support the families\u2019 wider needs.\u201d</p> <p>Since Newham Family Action was set up in April 2019 it has helped 238 adults and 441 children with issues including housing suitability, conditions and problems with landlords.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to expand the reach of the service to people who might not necessarily approach Shelter directly. We do that by working with other partners in the community. This is effective because they can exchange information based on individual needs, so families are being properly supported whatever their problem.\u201d</p> <p>After being offered only unsuitable accommodation by the local council, Chantelle turned to renting privately for a second time but as she was a self-employed single parent, she struggled to pay the high rent without adequate local housing allowance. After she hung on to their home for three years, she received an eviction notice from her landlord who wanted to sell the property and the family was once again without a home.</p> <p>This is not unusual \u2013 many families cannot afford high London rents without support, due to a four-year freeze to the local housing allowance. The allowance covered only a small percentage of local rents at the very bottom end of the market. Many struggled to find somewhere available when they needed it, and even if they did succeed, this is the part of the market where the worst landlords and conditions prevail.</p> <p>In response to the charity and others consistently highlighting problems with the local housing allowance, the chancellor <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-workers-support-package\" rel=\"nofollow\">recently announced</a> that rates would be restored to cover the bottom third (30th percentile) of local rents, as they did in 2011. While this will help struggling claimants, it still means that families who need to claim benefits while in homes on average local rents will be accruing arrears because they are unable to work or move during this unprecedented public health crisis. And many families will see no increase because they hit the benefit cap.<br><br>To prevent further homelessness as a result of the pandemic, Shelter is calling on the government to restore the rates to cover average rents and for the benefit cap to be lifted. This would protect the people who, as a result of the pandemic, can\u2019t work the required 16 hours a week to avoid the cap.</p> <p>Many households in London have a large shortfall because there is a gap (of up to \u00a31,200 a month for a two-bedroom home) between the local housing allowance and average rents, which they must make up from income meant for other essentials, such as food and energy bills, or go into debt to pay. Thousands also have their local housing allowance <a href=\"https://blog.shelter.org.uk/2019/05/benefit-cap-undoubtedly-harsh-yet-not-unlawfully-discriminatory/\" rel=\"nofollow\">benefit-capped</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s important that people pay an average local rent, so that those who can\u2019t work or who see a drop in earnings during the pandemic aren\u2019t falling into arrears. Otherwise, it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll face eviction when the ban on court possessions comes to an end. This will put an even greater strain on council homelessness services, and lead to more people sofa-surfing or sleeping rough, when they are still at risk from the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/shelter-supporting-those-who-are-struggling/2020/apr/06/until-they-got-involved-i-was-beginning-to-think-this-was-the-end-of-me-how-shelter-changes-the-lives-of-those-in-need\">'It\u2019s like all the pressure\u2019s been taken off me': how Shelter is tackling the housing emergency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Shelter\u2019s advice and representation from its solicitor Rose Arnall, Chantelle was offered suitable help from the council in August last year.

Yesterday, prime minister Johnson mapped out plans to loosen the UK\u2019s lockdown restrictions. Workers in construction and manufacturing could potentially recommence work in the near term, so that is likely to boost investment confidence in London-listed stocks.</p> <p>Equity markets in Asia gained ground overnight on the back of optimism in relation to countries loosening their lockdown restrictions, and in turn European indices are tipped to open higher. South Korea and Germany reported an increase in new infections in the wake of their restrictions being eased. This is something that traders should be mindful of as it might curtail the reopening of other economies for fear of a second wave of cases. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The agenda</strong></p> <p>9am BST: Italy - Industrial production (forecast: -20% month on month)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-11T06:58:59.370Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p>  </div>",

The virus can stay on surfaces for up to 72 hours, so there should be regular disinfecting where possible. Bosses are also being asked to consider allowing staggered start times. Workplaces should be well ventilated.</p> \n<p><strong>Schools<br></strong>It is too early to open schools in step one, although the government is asking local councils to encourage vulnerable pupils and the children of critical workers to go to school. The government is amending its guidance to clarify that paid childcare, for example by nannies and childminders, can take place as long as they adhere to the government\u2019s guidelines on staying safe inside the home, which includes regular handwashing, washing clothes, keeping a place well ventilated and considering more activities outside.</p> \n<p><strong>Travel<br></strong>Everybody should continue to avoid public transport wherever possible. The government says it will increase funding and give new statutory guidance to encourage local authorities to widen pavements, consider road closures in cities and create pop-up cycle lanes.</p> \n<p><strong>Exercise<br></strong>Unlimited outdoor exercise means you can go out as many times in a day as you like, but you will still not be able to use areas such as playgrounds or outdoor gyms, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. You can exercise with up to one person from outside your household, which means no team sports unless every participant is from the same household.</p> \n<p><strong>Social contact<br></strong>As long as you adhere to the two-metre physical distancing rules, you can meet up with one person from outside your household, like a friend or relative, in a public place.</p> \n<p><strong>Outdoors<br></strong>You can drive to an outdoor place no matter how far from your household, as long as you adhere to physical distancing. However, the rules are different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which means people from England should not travel to parts of the country that are not adhering to Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cstep one\u201d plan.</p> \n<p><strong>Face </strong><strong>coverings<br></strong>These are not mandatory, but if you can then you should wear one on public transport and in some shops. They should not be worn by children under two years old.</p> \n<p><strong>Shielding<br></strong>This should continue for extremely vulnerable groups, who should stay at home and avoid face-to-face contact. For example, those who have had an organ transplant or are receiving chemotherapy or renal dialysis.</p> \n<p>People aged over 70, those with specific, chronic, pre-existing conditions, and pregnant women, are \u201cclinically vulnerable\u201d and should minimise contact with others outside their households, but do not need to be shielded. The document said it is likely that the government will advise people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to shield beyond June \u2013 the end of the current 12-week period.</p> \n<h2><strong>Step two</strong></h2> \n<p>These measures are for England and are reliant on the risk level at the time of making a final decision. The first day of June is the goal for the following measures, but this is flexible. There would be 48 hours\u2019 notice of any changes.</p> \n<p><strong>Schools</strong><br>A phased return for early years settings and schools. Schools should prepare to open for more children from 1 June, with early years, reception, year 1 and year 6 to return in smaller classes. Secondary schools could begin some face-to-face contact for years 10 and 12 pupils, who have key exams next year. All children could return to school before the summer for a month, depending on scientific advice.</p> \n<p><strong>Shops</strong><br>Non-essential shops could reopen from 1 June on a phased basis. Pubs, cafes and restaurants, and beauty services would not be allowed to reopen at this point because the risk of transmission in these environments is higher.</p> \n<p><strong>Sport and culture<br></strong>Cultural and sporting events will be allowed to take place behind closed doors for broadcast.</p> \n<p><strong>Social and family contact</strong><br>The government says it wants to reduce the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions while continuing to limit the risk of chains of transmission. One measure could be allowing two households to share childcare to create a \u201csocial bubble\u201d. The government is considering looking at allowing small weddings.</p> \n<h2><strong>Step three</strong></h2> \n<p>These measures will be considered for introduction on 4 July. If all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/have-the-governments-five-tests-for-easing-lockdown-been-met\">five tests</a> are met and there is scientific advice that suggests further changes are acceptable, the government plans to reopen remaining businesses such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, beauty salons, places of worship and cinemas.</p> \n<p>These places must meet safety guidelines. Some venues which by their design make physical distancing difficult may not be able to reopen at this stage.</p>",
  "<p>Three of the UK\u2019s major supermarkets have cut petrol prices to below \u00a31 a litre following the collapse in the global oil market.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons\">Morrisons</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/asda\">Asda</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco\">Tesco</a> all announced that the cost of unleaded petrol would fall to less than \u00a31 a litre, the first time it has been available nationally at that price for four years. The moves were the latest in a string of price cuts that began in March.</p> <p>On Monday morning Morrisons announced that with immediate effect motorists using its filling stations would pay a maximum of 99.7p a litre for petrol and no more than 104.7p a litre for diesel.</p> <p>Asda quickly followed suit, cutting its prices to the same level, in a move it said would \u201csupport the nation during these unprecedented times\u201d and lower the cost for those returning to work or completing essential journeys.</p> <p>Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest petrol retailer, said that on Tuesday it would be cutting the cost of unleaded petrol to no more than 99.9p a litre and 105.9p on diesel at its 500 outlets.</p> <p>Global oil prices have plunged since the start of the year to 21-year lows as a result of a standoff over production levels between Saudi Arabia and Russia and a sharp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/25/oil-market-storage-crisis-coronavirus-plummeting-demand\">slump in demand for crude and transport fuels</a> due to coronavirus lockdowns. The price of a barrel of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, has crashed from nearly $70 at the turn of the year to less than $30. At one point it stood at $18. </p> <p>Simon Williams, a fuel spokesman for the RAC motoring group, said the initial move by Morrisons had brought petrol and diesel to \u201ca very fair price and one that is much more reflective of what the retailer is itself paying to buy the fuel in\u201d.</p> <p>However, he said the low price may not last long. \u201cIt remains to be seen how long prices this low will persist for, with some early indications that wholesale petrol prices have started to rise as a result of the world oil price creeping up.\u201d</p> <p>Oil traders are betting that market prices will rise in the second half of the year as the US and Chinese economies reopen in the months ahead.

The Paris metro is operating well below capacity, with about 60 stations closed and rush-hour passengers obliged to prove their journey is essential and unavoidable.

It is unclear how many more will join them, or when senior schools will open. Asked by the headteacher, only 25% of families at the rue Milton primary school said they would definitely be sending their children back to class.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, look around you \u2013 this is hardly normal, is it?\u201d asked Gabrielle Rousselot, starting work at 10.30am in the back office of a bank near Op\u00e9ra. Rousselot said she had returned from Burgundy, where she had spent the lockdown with her partner and three children, on Saturday. She was not finding the readjustment easy.</p> <p>\u201cThe office is fine, they\u2019ve spaced out the desks and put in all sorts of protective kit \u2013 I\u2019m not worried about that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the metro is frankly unnerving. It\u2019s almost impossible to stay a metre away from everyone. And it\u2019s just not a nice feeling, to be looking at everyone and wondering, you know, \u2018How risky do you look?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Above ground, Paris was still notably quiet, with more cars on the streets than during lockdown but not many. Authorities reported a total of just 17km of queues on the main roads into the capital on Monday morning, compared with the more than 300km of queues that would normally be seen at the start of a working week. </p> <p>Pushing his young son in a buggy, Gautier Kertudo, 34, a lawyer, said it was a relief to be out. \u201cIt\u2019s not been easy in a small flat with a two-year-old,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve coped, and we\u2019re going to have to keep coping: his creche hasn\u2019t reopened. We\u2019re looking for a nanny \u2026 But for the time being, we\u2019re working a half day each.\u201d</p> <p>For many Paris shops usually closed on a Monday, the day was devoted to getting ready for reopening on Tuesday. \u201cWe will be back on 12 May, and delighted to welcome you all again \u2013 as long as you\u2019re wearing a mask,\u201d said a sign in the window of the book shop at the top of rue des Martyrs.</p> <p>At the locksmiths, St\u00e9phane Peyronnet \u2013 sticking strips of orange tape on the floor to ensure returning customers stayed a metre apart \u2013 had worked steadily through the lockdown but only on call-outs. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s the big day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re an essential service. People will be back.\u201d</p> <p>Some were less reassured. Restaurants, cafes and bars, so much a part of the fabric of Paris, must wait until the end of the month to hear when they will be able to reopen \u2013 with presumably strict, but as yet unannounced, physical distancing rules.</p> <p>On the Rue de Navarin, La Belle Maison is one of four popular 9th arrondissement restaurants to have grouped together to offer a pre-ordered takeaway and delivery service, La Pantruchoise, that opened for the first time on Monday morning.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve taken lots of orders. We\u2019re actually pretty happy, and it\u2019s certainly great to be back,\u201d said the manager, Nicolas Chatellain, busy sealing take-out boxes. \u201cBut then we\u2019re very lucky: we\u2019re a local bistro, with loyal, local customers. For many, this lockdown has been a massive blow.\u201d</p> <p>As for the future, Chatellain said: \u201cWe have to wait. Could we be profitable with half the tables? I don\u2019t know. Perhaps if we start at 6pm and close at 1am. Will we be allowed, exceptionally, to open a terrace this summer? That would help. Right now, we just don\u2019t know. Nothing\u2019s normal any more.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A sudden rise in infections leads to the temporary closure of nightclubs in Seoul. Lebanon tightens the curfew it had earlier relaxed after cases rebound over the weekend. German leaders wonder if they are easing too fast, as the country\u2019s parks fill up and its infection rate appears to accelerate.</p> \n<p>Welcome to the next phase of the coronavirus pandemic. Curves are being flattened in many countries. The harsh lockdowns of the past few months, implemented to prevent healthcare systems from melting down, are gradually being rolled back. The economic and social toll of mass isolation is growing every day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e60c6aea-b500-4a5a-b6af-b1d99f7d0511\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread.

Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n    <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity.

It\u2019s one giant experiment, made up of lots of little experiments in every country, in every jurisdiction.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over time, the list of safer activities is likely to grow. Ideally, societies will get better at managing the risk of things that are unsafe but deemed necessary.</p> \n<p>The past weekend has already given some clues: nightclubs, for example, where people are in close proximity and their inhibitions are lowered by alcohol, seem like an obvious site for mass transmission of disease. Time may prove otherwise. Some societies may decide the risk is worth it.</p> \n<p>Countries that have managed to squash their curve, such as Australia and New Zealand, will potentially provide the most controlled environments and therefore the richest testing grounds, Mackay said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn Australia, for example, we are going to see if the people going to the shops this weekend will lead to a rise in cases, and that will inform the entire world.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some of the difficulties ahead are already coming into focus. In the UK, there is widespread confusion over what exactly has been allowed. Germany, which was spared the worst ravages of the virus, is struggling with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/fears-rise-in-germany-over-second-wave-of-coronavirus-infections\">how to convince</a> its citizens to adhere to the ongoing restrictions.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over,\u201d the president of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, reminded his country over the weekend, after announcing the new burst in cases.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In countries without a social safety net, the imperative to restart economic life will only grow more intense, and may pressure governments to eventually ditch the experiment altogether.</p> \n<p>The beginning of the climb out of this pandemic has started in many places, but is likely to be long. \u201cIt continues indefinitely until the rate of transfer is so small that the virus will naturally extinguish, or until it can be pushed down by a vaccine,\u201d Jones said.</p>",
  "<p>C\u00e9cile Rol-Tanguy, who has died aged 101, was one of the great figures of the French resistance. She came from a communist family and worked in tandem with her husband, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/12/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Henri Rol-Tanguy</a>, who led the irregular French forces in the Paris insurrection of August 1944. Long in his shadow, she came into her own as a veteran and voice of the resistance in the years after his death in 2002.</p> <p>Her father, Fran\u00e7ois Le Bihan, a Breton who had worked in Les Halles market in Paris, joined the navy, trained as a radio electrician and met his wife, Germaine Jaganet, while based at Royan in the south-west of France at the end of the first world war. Returning to Paris, he joined the French Communist party (PCF) as soon as it was founded in 1920.</p> <p>C\u00e9cile, who was born in Royan, was brought up in an environment dedicated to international communism. Her family\u2019s home sheltered political exiles from Italy, Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, and as a girl C\u00e9cile joined the Jeunes Filles de France, set up by the PCF. In 1936, aged 17, she found a job as a shorthand typist in the engineers union of the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail. There she met Henri Tanguy, a Breton like herself, who had been repeatedly sacked from car factories for fomenting strikes and now worked as a permanent official for the union.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d9df88ff6ab56ce48bf367619edb879272d335e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d9df88ff6ab56ce48bf367619edb879272d335e/1776_258_2320_1392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"C\u00e9cile Rol-Tanguy at the the ceremony marking the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Paris from Nazi occupation in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">C\u00e9cile Rol-Tanguy at the the ceremony marking the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Paris from Nazi occupation in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Horacio Villalobos/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>C\u00e9cile and Henri were soon plunged into the maelstrom of what they saw as a war between fascism and communism. When the Spanish civil war broke out in 1936, Henri went to fight in the International Brigades while C\u00e9cile worked with the Aid for Spain Committee and wrote him letters as his \u201cwar godmother\u201d. Henri claimed to be a revolutionary who would never marry, but they wed in 1939. When the second world war broke out Henri was sent to the front at Sarrebourg, then to a factory in the Pyrenees as a skilled worker.</p> <p>C\u00e9cile\u2019s father was arrested as a communist in 1940 and her first child, Fran\u00e7oise, died as a baby in the same year, just as the German army closed in on Paris. Instead of collapsing, she decided to resist. \u201cI had nothing left,\u201d she said in a 2012 interview. \u201cMy father had been arrested, I didn\u2019t know where my husband was, and I had lost my little girl. What could hold me back?\u201d</p> <p>Henri became an underground communist resister, first for the Organisation Sp\u00e9ciale, then the Franc-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP). C\u00e9cile typed flyers and acted as his liaison agent, keeping the resistance network together and replacing those who were arrested.</p> <p>Resistance was extremely dangerous. Those who fell into the hands of the Vichy or German authorities risked deportation or execution. C\u00e9cile\u2019s father escaped after his arrest but was recaptured in 1941 and deported the following year to Auschwitz, where he died.</p> <p>After two comrades were arrested in the autumn of 1942, Henri was sent away to the Poitiers area for six months. C\u00e9cile stayed in Paris with her mother, who, when necessary, cared for their two children, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Jean. Henri returned to Paris in the spring of 1943 and was appointed FTP chief in the Paris region, working with the Polish-Jewish resister Joseph Epstein. C\u00e9cile liaised between them and also with Boris Holban, the Romanian-Jewish leader of the Paris FTP-MOI, which mobilised communists of foreign origin. Epstein was arrested and executed on 11 April 1944.</p> <p>In June 1944 Henri became Paris head of the Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l\u2019Int\u00e9rieur (FFI), which brought together communist and non-communist irregulars. He adopted the nom de guerre of Rol after a comrade killed in Spain.</p> <p>On 14 August 1944, C\u00e9cile took Henri\u2019s machine gun from one part of Paris to another, avoiding German road blocks, while her mother took flyers in Jean\u2019s pram and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne danced along the pavement. At dawn on 19 August the insurrection order signed by Henri was posted across Paris.</p> <p>The liberation of Paris covered Henri in glory but General Charles de Gaulle was determined to reassert his own power and to prioritise the role of the Free French forces, which he had founded and which had fought outside France until they entered Paris under General Philippe Leclerc on 24 August 1944.</p> <p>On 27 August, the day after he walked down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es to rapturous crowds, De Gaulle invited 20 leaders of the internal resistance to the War Ministry. Each was tersely thanked before the general dismissed him with \u201cGood. Next!\u201d C\u00e9cile was the only woman present. \u201cPersonally, I did not find it very welcoming,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was a very small reception, without even a glass of wine to finish with.\u201d</p> <p>The internal resistance was humiliated because it had a large communist contingent and because it detracted from De Gaulle\u2019s personal glory. Henri continued in the army proper and fought his way to Germany, but he was then given a military desk job in Versailles.</p> <p>Commemorations always celebrated the role of the Free French and of Leclerc in particular. On one occasion C\u00e9cile told the mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac, that not giving her husband a seat in the front row of such commemorations was \u201can affront to history\u201d. </p> <p>In recent years C\u00e9cile enjoyed greater recognition. She became co-president of the Friends of the Spanish Republican Fighters, set up in 1996, of which her daughter Claire was general secretary. Frequently she gave talks in schools about the resistance, becoming the star turn after the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/16/guardianobituaries.france\" title=\"\">Lucie Aubrac</a> in 2007.

  "<p>After a week in which people in some parts of the world have been given cause for optimism that they may have passed the peak of the pandemic, we have seen how extraordinary actions of individuals can change the trajectory for a whole nation.</p> <p>Retired doctors putting themselves back on the frontline, nurses making their own face masks, parents voluntarily separated from their children so they can care for the sick.</p> <p>More often than not, these are women. Women perform <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/publications/books/WCMS_633135/lang--en/index.htm\">76% of the total hours of unpaid care work globally</a>. They have the majority of caregiving roles in homes and in communities. They will also carry more of the weight of caring for the sick and helping to stem the spread of the virus. Women do this essential work in spite of obstacles and inequalities.</p> <p>That\u2019s why our updated <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/world/updated-covid-19-global-humanitarian-response-plan\">Global Humanitarian Response Plan</a> to counteract coronavirus, published on 7 May, has women at its heart.

Local actions translate into global gains. If there is one thing we have learned about this pandemic, it\u2019s that the world is in this together and we can only overcome it if we act as one.</p> <p>We must equip women with what they need. Let\u2019s enable them to stay safe and supported. It\u2019s the right thing to do but also the smart thing to do so they can continue to save and improve lives.</p> <p>As health systems become stretched, many people with Covid-19 will need to be cared for at home. This will add to women\u2019s workload, and put them at greater risk of becoming infected.</p> <p>As the world fights the pandemic, we have another epidemic to overcome \u2013 the violence perpetrated against women, and the inequalities that leave them more likely to be living in poverty and without access to essential services.</p> <p>We know lockdowns and quarantines are essential to suppressing Covid-19. Yet they can trap women with abusive partners. Over recent weeks, there has been a dramatic jump in reported incidences of domestic violence in many countries. In some countries, the number of women calling support services has doubled.</p> <p>Humanitarian settings already stressed by years of war and poverty will not be any different, except that often there are few places to report the abuse or to seek shelter so that women and their children can stay safe.</p> <p>If we are serious about eradicating this virus, we must promote and protect the health and rights of women, for their own wellbeing and so that they can continue to promote and protect the health of others.</p> <p>That is why the UN\u2019s global humanitarian response plan to fight Covid-19 sets out specific actions to achieve this in the most vulnerable settings.</p> <p>This plan is already helping install handwashing facilities that are safe for women and girls to access; delivering medical equipment and supplies, including to address women\u2019s health; and getting aid workers and supplies to where they are needed most.</p> <p>The plan recognises the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women and girls. It also recognises their power to stop the virus. the United Nations Population Fund will use resources from the appeal to prioritise the needs of women and girls \u2013 including working with women\u2019s groups on the ground to create safe spaces.</p> <p>All this is possible because of the generosity of donors. Much more is needed. We count on donors to continue funding the Covid-19 humanitarian response plan while sustaining support for existing humanitarian and refugee response plans.</p> <p>And we urge all governments to make the prevention and redress of violence against women a key part of their national response plans for Covid-19.</p> <p>Every day, women are overcoming obstacles and inequalities to treat and care for those infected with the virus, working hard to contain the virus, and helping their families and communities protect themselves.</p> <p>We owe it to these women to give them the tools and services they need, and the justice and equality that is their right \u2013 in hospitals, in homes, and in their communities.</p> <p>We are determined to do everything we can to counter this deadly virus, and that means addressing the inequalities that will otherwise hold all of us back.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Lowcock is UN under secretary general for humanitarian affairs.

  "<p>\u201cBabe, listen to me, I can\u2019t,\u201d says a giggling Lisa Riley. \u201cI can\u2019t even play a note yet, I\u2019ll just sound like a ship coming in to dock.\u201d</p> <p>Sitting on a cushion in her Yorkshire home, the Emmerdale actor had been listing her new-found quarantine pastimes \u2013 a Joe Wicks workout every morning, a double dose of meditation and a self-set challenge to learn how to play the Emmerdale theme tune on her partner\u2019s flute \u2013 when I ask her to give me a quick recital.</p> <p>It\u2019s in the other room, she explains. Rather than popping next door to get it, she opts to improvise. \u201cIt would sound something like this,\u201d she says, before a noise emerges from her mouth that we agree is best compared to a kazoo. \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d</p> <p>Just like the rest of us, the 43-year-old soap star is adjusting to life in lockdown. But Riley is finding the respite from 12-hour days on the ITV set to be a welcome break. \u201cI normally come home, jump in the bath and go through the next day\u2019s lines.

It remains unclear what will happen next. While it\u2019s no great surprise that soaps \u2013 just like every other mainstay of British culture \u2013 now exist in a state of uncertainty, their encroaching disappearance from our screens will be tough for those who settle down on the sofa most nights of the week to catch up with what\u2019s happening in soapland.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re like a crutch for people,\u201d says Riley. \u201cTuning-in is like visiting your own family.\u201d And when so many of us are separated from our loved ones, saying goodbye to another batch of familiar faces will be an even more painful loss.</p> <p>For Dan Brocklebank \u2013 better known as Billy Mayhew, the Coronation Street vicar \u2013 that sense of isolation has long been present. Living alone with his two dogs in his Manchester mid-terrace, the actor is already counting the days. He talks for 11-and-a-half minutes uninterrupted after I ask a simple \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p> <p>When he turned 40 in December, Brocklebank set himself a challenge: to renovate his house into a \u201clivable\u201d state. With the downstairs already mostly completed, he has turned his attention to the small yard out the back. It means he has plenty to get on with: painting garden walls and laying down slabs. \u201cThere\u2019s shrubbery arriving today I need to plant despite the fact I don\u2019t know which way the garden faces,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019ll just stick it in and hope for the best ... which seems to be a good rule for life anyway.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Dan_Brocklebank/status/1257427787121647618\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In celebration of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sue_Cleaver?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Sue_Cleaver</a> playing Eileen for a glorious 20 years, the theme in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DansBar?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DansBar</a> tonight was Eileen. <a href=\"https://t.co/6xY4D8GCV4\">pic.twitter.com/6xY4D8GCV4</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Brocklebank (@Dan_Brocklebank) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dan_Brocklebank/status/1257427787121647618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 4, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>When he\u2019s not working on his home makeover, Brocklebank is filling his time baking cakes (from a packet), having conversations with his stomach in the shower and entertaining/irritating his neighbours by belting out piano tunes. And after posting a jokey tweet in late March about a night out in at a fictional <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DansBar?src=hashtag_click\">#DansBar</a> in his living room (\u201cThey\u2019re giving away a free glass of prosecco on entry \u2026 as you can see the place is packed\u201d), he and fellow cast and crew have been posting pictures to appreciative fans as they get drunk together on Zoom, dressing up as bunnies or in togas depending on the dress code imposed on the night.</p> <p>As episodes run thin, viewers may well turn to social media as a way of keeping in contact with soap stars and their characters, but Brocklebank hopes the show will find a way to carry on. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been off air for 60 years,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the moment, people want to cling on to things which feel familiar.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a testament to just how strange our current circumstances are that we\u2019re turning to soaps \u2013 exaggerated and necessarily overly dramatised versions of everyday life \u2013 to remind us of what used to be normal. But having been filmed months in advance, that\u2019s exactly what shows such as Corrie are able to do. Brocklebank sees no way that soaps won\u2019t have to adapt when filming starts again. \u201cWe will have to expect massive changes in the way the building is run if social-distancing rules still apply,\u201d he says. \u201cHow the hell are makeup artists going to do hair and makeup? How can I portray a loving relationship with someone on screen if I can\u2019t go within two metres of them?\u201d</p> <p>There will be more existential questions for the teams of producers, directors and writers. Soaps set out to mirror our here and now: Christmas shows on Christmas; newsworthy events of the day nodded to with clever editing and forward planning. Once lockdown is over, we will no longer be confined to our homes. How soaps acknowledge the long-term impact of coronavirus, without showing it in real time, presents a whole set of challenges. \u201cWe represent social issues reflective of wider society,\u201d says Brocklebank. \u201cWho knows what Weatherfield might look like post-Covid? None of us do. It will change, though, that\u2019s inevitable.\u201d</p> <p>While most soaps offer escapism during a global pandemic, Casualty is doing the opposite, offering a window into the workings of A&amp;E, now more than ever the last place you want to find yourself. But Amanda Mealing \u2013 who has played the consultant Connie Beauchamp in Holby City and Casualty since 2005 \u2013 reckons the world\u2019s attention turning to health and hospitals is bringing more viewers. \u201cThere\u2019s a curiosity from those who might not watch the programme regularly to see how emergency departments work,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are fascinated to see what life is like for doctors and nurses on the frontline.\u201d</p> <p>While for some it seems learning to value NHS workers has been a revelation, for Mealing it is nothing new. With a family full of medics, and plenty of time spent on research trips in hospitals, she hopes that, once this is over, her real-life counterparts will get the recognition and acknowledgment they have always deserved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e14c1de0ebcbdfe45788fb20153fa0024d7cf68a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e14c1de0ebcbdfe45788fb20153fa0024d7cf68a/0_43_4300_2579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amanda Mealing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amanda Mealing has been helping to bring vulnerable people their prescriptions. \u2018Quite a few have been taken aback that the doctor from Casualty is delivering their medicine,\u2019 she says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Rogers/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although not a medical professional, she is doing what she can at home to help the national effort: dusting off her sewing machine to make masks; volunteering to deliver food and prescriptions in her community. \u201cQuite a few have been taken aback that Connie Beauchamp, the doctor from Casualty, is delivering their medicine,\u201d she says with a laugh.</p> <p>Life often feels a little simpler over in Ambridge and, without the need to film, The Archers has found it easier than its televised counterparts to adapt. Airing five rather six episodes a week has bought the BBC Radio 4 show some time to draw up a new way of working, and after a small gap during the first three weeks in May \u2013 when, having run out of pre-lockdown recordings, archive episodes are being rerun \u2013 the Archers will return to the airwaves in a new form.</p> <p>Cast members \u2013 such as Charlotte Martin, who has played Susan Carter since the early 80s \u2013 have been busy recording monologues at home that will be woven together into new episodes.</p> <p>\u201cCharacters thinking out loud is the best way I can describe it,\u201d Martin says from her DIY home studio (a corner of the landing covered in duvets to cushion the sound) in Birmingham. \u201cIt will be reflections from characters, but without interaction.\u201d Not being able to reflect real rural life for a period has felt strange to Martin and her colleagues; it\u2019s something they take pride in. \u201cOne of the positives of this situation, though, has been seeing a greater sense of community in our own lives. Bringing that to The Archers is going to be a great comfort to our listeners, especially those feeling cut off or alone.\u201d</p> <p>Recording The Archers isn\u2019t a full-time job for Martin even in normal circumstances. She works as a research psychologist at Warwick University as well. And with more time stuck at home, she has discovered some new hobbies. She\u2019s doing what she can to get fit by the time quarantine is over; on Friday nights she and her neighbours dance to disco tunes (at a safe distance) out in the street.</p> <p>Through it all, casts \u2013 many of whom have worked together day in and day out for decades \u2013 are keeping in close contact. And that\u2019s as true for the residents of Albert Square as anywhere else. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a group WhatsApp where we chat,\u201d says Diane Parish, who plays Denise Fox in EastEnders, who has noticed she\u2019s speaking to her colleagues more than she otherwise might do on set.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a strong, if occasionally dysfunctional family. If someone is having a down day we cheer them up; we\u2019re seeing pictures of the kids we\u2019ve never met.\u201d If anything, she says, the cast are closer now than they were on the Square. \u201cIt\u2019s really beautiful how we\u2019ve all come together,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re all saying we should try to keep it up whenever we finally go back.\u201d</p>",

In England there is Baker Street and Sherlock Holmes. It\u2019s a very beautiful place. And my brother Ahmed is there. The first thing I want to see is Big Ben. I know I will be happy.\u201d</p> <p>It will be a different world to Samos, where his home \u2013 a camp 11 times overcapacity \u2013 was overrun with rats \u201cas big as cats\u201d and was \u201cdirty, dirty, dirty,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Mustafa is far more reticent. He says his mother encouraged him to leave Burco, the Somali city where he grew up, when he was 15. Getting to Greece took seven months, after he flew out of Somalia to Kenya and from there on to Turkey. For almost two years he has languished on Lesbos. Part of that time was spent in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/moria-refugee-camp-doctors-story-lesbos-greece\">appalling conditions of Moria</a>, Europe\u2019s biggest refugee camp, where lone children live in designated areas.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned to live alone. I\u2019ve learned to be alone, but all the time I think about my family,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to leave because I was afraid for my life. I haven\u2019t seen my family for two years.</p> <p>\u201cI want to speak with my mother and brothers and sisters. I don\u2019t know where they are but I hope my uncle can help. He lives in London. I don\u2019t know what he does but I am hoping. I need my family, I want to see them.\u201d</p> <p>The teenagers\u2019 resettlement comes in the wake of a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/historic-uk-greece-migration-action-plan-signed\">joint action plan</a> between Greece and the UK on migration. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very comprehensive agreement,\u201d says Giorgos Koumoutsakos, Athens\u2019 alternate minister for migration policy. \u201cIt touches upon all the dimensions of the migration phenomenon including unaccompanied children, the most vulnerable migrants in this country.\u201d</p> <p>Thousands of lone children reach Europe each year, and an estimated 5,600 are in Greece. Of those, about 300 are kept in police cells and detention centres in what authorities call \u201cprotective custody\u201d but which Human Rights Watch has slammed as an \u201cabusive practice\u201d that exposes minors to brutal treatment in unsanitary and degrading conditions.</p> <p>Between 30-40% of the minors have family members in EU states, according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR). Most are in their mid-teens when they arrive in Europe. Many became separated from their parents in the chaos of war.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed out on a lot of school,\u201d says Mustafa, who as a young boy dreamed of becoming a pilot. \u201cI like computers, too. Maybe like him [Walid] I will go into IT,\u201d adds the Somali, who speaks with his Syrian roommate in Arabic picked up watching films.</p> <p>With Greece hosting almost 100,000 migrants and refugees in facilities nationwide, and facing intense criticism over vastly congested camps, the centre-right government has been pushing for relocation of the minors to other European countries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25af401dd16475fd1aaf0dc9b6b5964ff278e8e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25af401dd16475fd1aaf0dc9b6b5964ff278e8e7/119_340_2857_1714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The UK ambassador to Greece, Kate Smith (C), and Greece\u2019s alternate minister of immigration policy, Giorgos Koumoutsakos, await the refugees at Athens international airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK ambassador to Greece, Kate Smith (C), and Greece\u2019s alternate minister of immigration policy, Giorgos Koumoutsakos, await the refugees at Athens international airport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initial pleas fell on deaf ears, says the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who has spoken of \u201cscars of the soul [that] are not easy to heal\u201d. From March, 10 EU countries have agreed to take 1,600 children and teenagers under a scheme to help relieve reception centres, with the first leaving for Luxembourg last month.</p> <p>\u201cOur [EU] partners were not ready to give their assistance or their solidarity on this matter, but we insisted and did a lot of back-channel work explaining why it was so necessary,\u201d Koumoutsakos said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sensitive issue, politically and socially.\u201d</p> <p>All agree that speed is of the essence. Hostels, shelters and foster family care are in short supply. The longer the children remain in the camps, the greater the risks, such as sexual abuse or falling into the hands of criminals.</p> <p>\u201cFamily reunification procedures are cumbersome, they take too much time and are often implemented in a restrictive way,\u201d says Philippe Leclerc, the UNHCR\u2019s representative in Greece.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important that these procedures are accelerated. On average it take nine months for a positive decision to be reached. Children who might not be traumatised when they arrive here can become very traumatised living in overcrowded camps, in such appalling conditions, for so long.\u201d</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has added a layer of complexity that nobody was prepared for. Plans to move up to 2,000 men, women and children from squalid facilities in the Aegean have been substantially delayed, with the migrants having to be checked for Covid-19 in addition to other tests.</p> <p>On Monday, Koumoutsakos will be at the airport with the British ambassador to Greece, Kate Smith, to see off the child migrants. And just as in April, when 12 boys and girls departed for Luxembourg, he will give each one a small bag of gifts, including a notebook with a handwritten message wishing them \u201chappiness and good fortune\u201d.</p>",

The gas enveloped residents as they slept, causing people to collapse in the streets as they fled their homes. About 1,000 people were exposed to the gas, which causes neurological symptoms including headaches and nausea, as well as burning eyes. Twelve residents, including two children, died.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/indias-chemical-plant-disaster-another-case-of-history-repeating-itself\">India's chemical plant disaster: another case of history repeating itself</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The documents show that in December 2017, LG Polymers applied to the central government for the mandatory environmental clearance, in regard to a proposed expansion. The factory had been operating since 2001, but it is unclear whether the company had ever applied for the legally required permit before this.</p> \n<p>In its affidavit filed May 2019, LG Polymers informed central and state government it had not fulfilled its legally binding environmental requirement. Prior to this, the factory had operated based only on consent given by the Andhra Pradesh pollution control board. The same pollution control board had also given approval on six separate occasions for LG Polymers to expand its operations.</p> \n<p>The company then inexplicably withdrew its application in November 2019, even though the clearance had not yet been granted. The Guardian could not confirm whether it had since received the necessary permits.</p> \n<p>Environment clearance involves carrying out scoping and pollution studies, consulting with affected communities and mapping out any potential contaminating impact of the plant, under the scrutiny of an expert panel.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"07e1c41b-5f81-4dfc-9612-0d2894cdcedb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/somjseHz_t8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cRunning without an environment clearance is a crime: consent from the pollution board is not a ground on which they can operate,\u201d a Delhi-based environmental lawyer, Ritwick Dutta, said. \u201cThey should have ceased production at least then. Culpability is with the pollution control board, state and central environment authorities. They knew, they should have taken action proactively.\u201d</p> \n<p>LG Polymers did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>EAS Sarma, a former government finance and power secretary, who lives in Visakhapatnam, has filed a legal petition against the ministry of environment, the Andhra Pradesh state government and LG Polymers, calling for them to be held accountable for failing to comply with environmental law and to pay damages for contaminating the area. The petition was heard on Friday by the National Green Tribunal, India\u2019s top environmental court. Its ruling is awaited.</p> \n<p>The erosion of environmental safeguards and legislation has been evident since the prime minister, Narendra Modi, came to power in 2014. Green laws have been eased in favour of reduced industrial scrutiny and factories are now allowed to apply for retrospective environmental clearance. In March, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change amended the law so that smaller industrial, mining and energy projects will no longer be required to undergo environmental impact assessment.</p> \n<p>Environmentalists said this lack of enforcement and accountability on environmental laws meant it was not uncommon for major industries, such as construction or coal mines, to operate without clearance. Federal and local pollution and industrial safety watchdogs are often thinly staffed and poorly trained and equipped.</p> \n<p>The cost of poor environmental regulation is high. On Thursday, as well as the LG Polymers leak, there were industrial accidents at two other factories, one in Chhattisgarh and another in Tamil Nadu, that hospitalised several workers. In April, six people, including two toddlers, died when the waste pond burst at a factory in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Singrauli region, which was allegedly operating in violation of environmental laws, releasing a flood of ash slurry.</p> \n<p>VS Krishna of the Andhra Pradesh Human Rights Forum said there was already an attempt by state government to remove LG Polymers from any potential criminal liability for the gas leak.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one is talking about criminal liability, there\u2019s not been any deterrent,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a spate of accidents in this city and it all ends at compensation. The attempt to whitewash the South Koreans and the government has already started.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Never one to seek the spotlight, Trevor Carlin even agonised long and hard before allowing the motor racing team he founded to bear his name. Duly christened Carlin Racing, the team and their owner may not be well known outside the sport but their influence looms large. The drivers who have been through his stable have more than made their mark, with Formula One world champions among them, including Sebastian Vettel.</p> <p>Carlin has assembled a remarkable roster over the past 23 years but credits racing instinct over any grand plan. \u201cI have a very good gut,\u201d he says. \u201cI get a fantastic gut feeling about people.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/06/f1-prize-money-payout-liberty-media\">Coronavirus-hit Formula One to pay teams 100% of prize money</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With his team in lockdown, Carlin \u2013 a man who ordinarily looks forward only to the next race, the next win \u2013 is happy to consider the past. Vettel raced for him in the Renault 3.5 Series in 2006 and 2007, before being promoted by Red Bull midway through the latter, into F1. The character and talent of the four-times world champion stood out even then.</p> <p>\u201cHe was the most natural, relaxed, funniest team member you could ever wish for,\u201d says Carlin. \u201cWe would sit in the truck and Sebastian would be there watching Little Britain, laughing and joking with the mechanics. Then he would get in the car and be laughing and joking on the radio but when the lights went out he was all business. Immediately afterwards he knew exactly what he wanted to make the car faster and then he was back watching Little Britain, having a laugh with the lads. It was incredible, it was so easy for him to be fast.\u201d</p> <p>The 57-year-old team owner formed Carlin Motorsport in 1996, with only \u00a350 in the bank. They have since competed in 22 series including currently in the F1 feeder series, F2 and F3, in IndyCar in the US and the British F3 and F4 championship. With more than 400 race wins, the team\u2019s skill and dedication has made Carlin\u2019s team a hothouse for talent. More than 200 drivers have been through the doors of the base in Farnham.</p> <p>Of the current F1 grid, alongside Vettel all of Daniel Ricciardo, Lando Norris, Carlos Sainz, Kevin Magnussen and Daniil Kvyat are team alumni. Former F1 drivers include Robert Kubica, Anthony Davidson, Jaime Alguersuari and Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne to name but a few and the former Indy 500 winner Takuma Sato occupied one of the team\u2019s first seats. Even the F1 medical car is driven by Alan van der Merwe, the South African who won the British F3 championship for Carlin in 2003.</p> <p>It has been a remarkable achievement for the man who has thrown his all into racing since he was a teenager. Carlin left school to work as a gopher for his uncles who ran a Formula Ford team and worked his way up the sport from junior mechanic to team management by the late 80s. There was no university or higher education, instead only racing. \u201cI wanted to be involved in the sport and the best way was to work in it. Just hard work, which was 18 hours a day, seven days a week. You learn a lot in a short time and I have loved every minute of it.\u201d</p> <p>This year, if and when the season begins, he has another strong lineup set for F2 with Jehan Daruvala and Yuki Tsunoda, backed by Red Bull and Honda. They enter a special environment, one Carlin is proud of and one he is convinced has helped his drivers to thrive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The team that was founded with six people is now a hundred strong but retains a powerful sense of being a family unit. Through it all Carlin has juggled the pressure with the sense of responsibility he feels toward his personnel, successfully creating an atmosphere attractive to drivers and their backers. The team ran Norris from his first test before he was old enough to race, to when he joined F1 in 2019.</p> <p>Carlin\u2019s instinct about Norris\u2019s potential proved correct, as it did with another of the stars of the new generation, albeit the one who got away. \u201cWe nearly got Max Verstappen. I desperately wanted him but had already filled all my seats. I knew he was by far the best prospect. So much so I went down the bookies and put a bet on him becoming an F1 driver within three years when he hadn\u2019t even done a single-seater race. I saw him at a test and thought: \u2018This kid is incredible.\u2019 I love the sport, I know who has got it and who can make it.\u201d</p> <p>The honours board at Farnham is proof enough of how successfully Carlin has followed those instincts and indeed why so many drivers owe a debt to one of motor racing\u2019s most productive stables. The name may not be well known but that it is still above the door is enough for its owner. \u201cI am as excited with a win now as I was with the first. I know what we go through to get us there.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Traffic jams, pretty squares used as car parks, bike lanes that vanish into congested roundabouts: Brussels\u2019s love affair with the car has been waning for several years. Now city authorities are using coronavirus to kickstart plans to reduce the dominance of the car, by creating cycle lanes and \u201cslow streets\u201d that give pedestrians priority.</p> <p>After traffic plunged as a result of home working, Brussels is creating 25 miles (40km) of bike lanes, including on some of the busiest arteries that connect the <a href=\"https://www.introducingbrussels.com/european-district\">European district</a> to the heart of the city.</p> <p>From Monday the entire historic city centre has been turned into slow streets, where cars are limited to 20km an hour and must give priority to pedestrians and cyclists.</p> <p>The idea is to give more space to city dwellers at a time when everyone is meant to keep a distance of 1.5 metres.

But the seeds were planted in a mobility plan drawn up after Green parties made big gains in last year\u2019s city-region elections. While details will change once the pandemic is under control, Van den Brandt, one of three Greens with a key role in the city government, wants the move to a more pedestrian and bike-friendly city to be permanent.</p> <p>\u201cIt is really important that we step into the 21st century. In the 20th century the car had absolute dominance,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want a city where it is safe to walk and cycle, where clean air is preferred over traffic, making sure that you are not vulnerable when you get by foot or by bike ... that is good for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>But not everybody is pleased. Last week Theo Francken, a prominent member of the conservative separatist New Flemish Alliance party and a former government minister, accused Brussels of \u201cbullying\u201d motorists who commute from neighbouring Flanders.</p> <p>Francken seized on the plans as a means to further his goal of breaking up the multilingual kingdom, tweeting that Greens and the left were \u201cdetermined to give Brussels back to the people of Brussels, [which is] their right. We should let that happen with teleworking and further decentralisation.

Since the 1950s, Belgian planners have been in love with the automobile, sprinkling car parks into the historic centre and slicing up once quiet neighbourhoods with multi-lane highways. The Parc du Cinquantenaire, a green space with a bombastic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/09/belgium-addresses-postwar-apartheid-in-colonial-congo\">colonial-era triumphal arch</a>, is split by a partially open four-lane tunnel built in the 1970s. Until 1991, it was<a href=\"https://plus.lesoir.be/82297/article/2017-02-16/il-y-40-ans-la-grand-place-etait-un-parking\"> possible to park in the gothic masterpiece of Brussels\u2019s main square</a>, the Grand Place, right in front of the intricately carved 15th-century H\u00f4tel de Ville, described by Victor Hugo in 1837 as \u201ca dazzling fantasy of a poet fallen into the head of an architect\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bb9cef2b275e6744e3a5e8dbbc27e33226ec9e10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb9cef2b275e6744e3a5e8dbbc27e33226ec9e10/0_220_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A new cycle lane being set during the lockdown in Brussels.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A new cycle lane being set during the lockdown in Brussels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even in 2020, before the virus struck other historic squares were usually packed with parked cars. Uptake of cycling is fairly low in Brussels, compared with cities of similar size, such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Helsinki and Munich.</p> <p>\u201cBrussels was built for commuters,\u201d said William Todts, the executive director of the Brussels-based Transport and Environment campaign group. \u201cThe way the highways and the ring road were conceived was to make it as easy as possible to work in Brussels and get out as fast as possible. We\u2019ve been fighting against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/aug/28/belgium-worst-traffic-europe-brussels-antwerp-congestion\">that legacy </a>for the last 30 years and slowly, slowly things are changing.\u201d</p> <p>With so many people working from home, he sees an opportunity \u201cto use that new traffic situation to accelerate and consolidate some of those gains\u201d.</p> <p>But permanent change will require action beyond the city government. Belgium has been described as a \u201ccompany car paradise\u201d, for the generous perks that encourage employees to prefer shiny autos over extra salary. Employees have strong tax incentives to accept company cars, a valuable benefit when personal income taxes are among the highest in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cWe created a monster and it\u2019s very difficult to get rid of,\u201d Todts said. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to get rid of the company car system, it\u2019s too attractive.\u201d But he thinks it can be changed by ensuring that future company cars are zero emissions \u2013 plans already discussed at national level.</p> <p>The Brussels region wants the federal government \u2013 responsible for the country\u2019s rail network \u2013 to improve train services into the city to give motorists better alternatives.</p> <p>Van den Brandt also thinks a change in attitude is needed, so when the crisis is over, working hours are less rigid and people are freed from the expectation of being at their desks at 9am sharp. In Brussels, total daily peak traffic adds up to 4.5 hours, compared with 6.5 in Paris, where the 9 to 5 schedule is less ubiquitous.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to change the mentality in Belgium,\u201d she said. \u201cSpreading out these peak hours will have a very positive effect, as well as more teleworking.\u201d</p>",

Cannes sorts the good from the mediocre, champions talent new and old, and sets much of the agenda for the rest of the year. It is one of the giant trees that supports the global ecosystem of cinema.</p> <p>Beyond its commercial functions (it remains one of the movie world\u2019s primary marketplaces), Cannes has also come to symbolise an idea of <em>cinema</em>, as opposed to mere movies: of a mature and legitimate art form, like opera or ballet, to be consumed at prestigious gatherings in formal attire \u2013 even if the movie is, say, Kung Fu Panda (which premiered there in 2008). Reiterating this commitment, festival director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux excluded titles by Netflix and Amazon from competition in 2018, since they would not be released on the big screen. Fr\u00e9maux has also ruled out the idea of hosting Cannes virtually this year. \u201cIts soul, its history, its efficiency, it\u2019s a model that wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/global/cannes-film-festival-wont-go-virtual-coronavirus-1234572974/\">he told Variety</a>. </p> <p>As much as his passion for cinema, Fr\u00e9maux\u2019s principled stance could also betray the fear that if a virtual Cannes was a success, people might ask if we still needed the real thing. If it\u2019s cinema that really matters, why the whole circus of red carpets and private yachts and parties to which you\u2019re not invited? In terms of sustainability, frugality and championing your new magnum opus on humanity\u2019s struggle, it\u2019s not really such a good look, even without the masks.</p> <p>Cannes might not have a choice, though. Later this month, in what could be interpreted as a circling of the wagons, it is participating in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/27/worlds-biggest-film-festivals-unite-for-10-day-streaming-event\">We Are One</a>: a new, free, streaming film festival with programming from major festivals including Berlin, Venice, Sundance and Toronto. Not only is Cannes banding together with its rivals, the event is being hosted by \u2013 <em>quelle horreur!</em> \u2013 YouTube. Of course, Cannes and other festivals are vital and must return, but maybe this is a chance to reassess their priorities. </p>",

  "<p>Workers in garment factories in Bangladesh, which have reopened despite a nationwide coronavirus lockdown, have said their lives are being put at risk as they are forced to return to work in cramped conditions where mask-wearing and physical distancing are not enforced.</p> <p>Directives by the Bangladesh government stated that garment factories, which supply some of the biggest brands in the world and produce 84% of the country\u2019s total exports, would be allowed to resume operations, but only if they maintain physical distancing and the ban on public transportation.</p> <p>However, speaking to the Guardian, workers at garment factories in the industrial areas of Gazipur and Ashulia, on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka, said the only new measure was hand-washing at the entrance, and that no physical distancing measures had been enforced inside the factories. Overcrowded buses were bringing them into work. Many said they had been worried about returning to the factories, but had no choice, fearing they would lose their jobs.</p> <p>One 19-year-old, who irons clothes in a garment factory in Ashulia, said workers had to go on strike to get the bare minimum protective measures of hand-washing stands and reusable masks.</p> <p>\u201cWe resumed working last Sunday and on the first day, there was no change in the factory,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw in the news that they promised protective gear like masks and social distancing, but our factory didn\u2019t give us anything. We paid for masks from our own pocket,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe just wash hands once while entering to the factory, that\u2019s it,\u201d he added, shaking his head in disbelief. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no social distancing or anything of that sort. Everything is exactly as before.\u201d</p> <p>A 20-year-old machine operator, Shefaul, said the garment factory owners were trying to \u201cdeceive\u201d workers.</p> <p>\u201cWe know things are getting worse,\u201d said Islam. \u201cPeople are falling sick even inside the factories during work hours. But the management tells us that everything is safe and completely under control, which is a blatant lie.\u201d The Guardian could not verify which clothing brands the factory was supplying.</p> <p>The decision to reopen the garment factories has been a divisive one. While there is still a relatively low number of coronavirus cases in Bangladesh \u2013 about 10,000, with only 187 deaths \u2013 the country has one of the lowest testing rates in the world.</p> <p>Meanwhile the garment industry is the country\u2019s single biggest revenue generator, worth about $34bn and employing more than 4 million people in 4,500 factories.

It\u2019s not one issue, it\u2019s just across the board.\u201d</p> <p>The administration is under a tight deadline to secure changes before the election.

Even Houston, an energy hub, has issued a <a href=\"http://www.greenhoustontx.gov/climateactionplan/index.html\">climate action plan</a>. Yet such contributions are not expected to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/climate-emergency-global-action-way-off-track-says-un-head-coronavirus\">enough</a> to fulfill America\u2019s role in stalling the global crisis.</p> <p>Environmental advocates have challenged many of the Trump changes in court \u2013 and won. The Natural Resources Defense Council has sued 110 times and says it has prevailed in about 90% of lawsuits resolved.</p> <p>Recently, judges tossed out a permit for the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline and decided the EPA cannot bar scientists who receive federal grants from serving as agency advisers.</p> <p>Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer with the firm Bracewell who represents regulated industries and was a deputy EPA administrator under George W Bush, argued that many of the changes characterized as \u201crollbacks\u201d are actually \u201csensible, reasonable regulatory reforms\u201d or fixes to problems.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to understand the Trump administration\u2019s EPA unless you go back and look at the Obama administration,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many groups there was a sense that there really had been a great deal of regulatory overreach. And even if you disagree with that, the regulatory programs created problems that they didn\u2019t come back and fix.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018This is about who we\u2019re protecting\u2019</h2> <p>Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda has addressed some issues industry would rather were left alone. The agency is changing the way it calculates the benefits of mercury controls for power plants. Companies had already complied with the rule and most didn\u2019t want it changed. But the revision is meant to set a precedent for the government to ignore some positive health outcomes of regulation.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s weakened standards often go against science too, critics say.</p> <p>Last month, for example, the EPA decided not to tighten rules for soot pollution, refuting rebutting guidance from experts that more stringent standards would save lives. The EPA has also repopulated advisory boards with representatives from industry and conservative states and is trying to change what science it can consider when developing health protections.</p> <p>If a Democrat takes the White House, it will take years to reverse some changes. Moving faster would require Democrats holding both chambers of Congress. Even then, industry would fight hard.</p> <p>Christopher Cook, the environment chief for Boston, said Trump\u2019s efforts had been \u201cincongruous with all the actions that major cities are taking\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I would ask most Americans to consider when they\u2019re supporting stronger regulation is that this isn\u2019t about what we\u2019re protecting against, this is about who we\u2019re protecting,\u201d Cook said, noting that places with more pollution are faring worse under the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cCovid has been a dry run for the climate crisis.

Covid-19 reveals the costs to workers crowded together under already dangerous working conditions in jobs that often lacked sick leave and healthcare benefits. These are all problems dating from the early 1980s when the shareholder value movement forced corporations to have profit as their sole goal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s woken up a lot of people about how consolidated this system is, and how it is not very resilient, it\u2019s really vulnerable,\u201d said Lilliston. \u201cPeople asking about food security in the US is kind of new. There is also a greater awareness of worker rights - the lack of power, working tightly packed together, the lack of government enforcement and inspection. I think there is going to be some fallout but whether action will be taken remains to be seen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is clear that centralisation of processes into fewer and fewer centres, coupled with just-in-time supply chains, leads to a lack of resilience,\u201d said Prof Tim Benton, research director for emerging risks at Chatham House, a London thinktank. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to draft in a slaughterman off the street than to pull in casual labour into supermarkets or even farming.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian contacted all the companies named above. Cargill, JBS, Tyson and BRF detailed the significant work they are doing to deal with these issues including, in the case of JBS, working with physicians specialising in infectious diseases to develop a protocol, and, in the case of BRF, working with a global consultancy that specialises in risk management. Tyson has put aside $120m to give its workers \u201cthank you bonuses\u201d. All four said that they are carrying out special measures in their plants to protect workers, including distancing, staggered breaks, keeping vulnerable workers home and distributing face masks.</p> <p>Cargill pointed out: \u201cWe are also sensitive that farmers and ranchers need a place to move their cattle. This is a difficult balancing act facing our entire industry \u2026 We recognise farmers and ranchers rely on the global food system to earn their livelihoods, so it is critical we keep the market moving \u2013 for the farm economy and for the people and animals who rely on us for their food and nourishment.\u201d</p> <p>Litera Meats told the Guardian it is focused on keeping workers safe, and that \u201cgood sense, caution, collaboration and understanding\u201d are the principles guiding the response.

  "<p>Thomas Stapley-Bunten was due to finish his contract aboard a huge cargo ship carrying liquid natural gas early last month. The ship docked at the LNG terminal in Fos Cavaou, southern France, as planned, but by then the world was in coronavirus lockdown. He couldn\u2019t disembark, and international flights were grounded, preventing him from getting home to Newcastle, UK.</p> <p>So the 27-year-old former Royal Navy warfare officer has been stuck onboard as the ship criss-crosses the ocean from Qatar to Turkey and France and back. The 34-man crew, from the Philippines, India, Russia and Ireland, have had their pay increased by 50%, but they just want to go home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"419f934e072007758481a6c53d3b76328fcfcf46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/419f934e072007758481a6c53d3b76328fcfcf46/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Stapley-Bunten\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Stapley-Bunten: \u2018People are essentially prisoners.

But in the back of our minds, we are starting to realise: we are trapped. People are essentially prisoners,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to get off the ship.\u201d</p> <p>Stapley-Bunten is one of 150,000 seafarers stranded at sea on their vessels, forced to work beyond their contracts indefinitely, often seven days a week. Many have families and don\u2019t know when they will see them again. They have been given no choice but to keep going, from port to port, unloading at docks that are open for cargo but closed to the seafarers who deliver it.</p> <p>Cargo ships are responsible for delivering as much as 90% per cent of the global trade in goods, and the world\u2019s 1.2 million seafarers are a resilient workforce, operating in often dangerous conditions, seven days a week. Britain, Spain and the Netherlands have designated them key workers during the health crisis. But they are being stretched to the limit: working beyond their contracts, exhausted, under stress, and invisible to the governments that rely on the goods they carry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/cruise-companies-accused-of-refusing-to-let-stranded-crew-disembark-due-to-cost-coronavirus\">Cruise companies accused of refusing to let stranded crew disembark due to cost</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ITF) has received multiple reports of crew members with life-threatening conditions who have been refused emergency treatment at ports, despite the illnesses being unrelated to Covid-19. Unions and shipping and maritime organisations warn of a health and safety crisis. They are lobbying governments to lift restrictions to allow crew members home, but so far with little success.</p> <p>Many governments are making huge efforts to ensure cargo continues to be delivered safely. But there is no similar effort to help seafarers. The European commission has issued guidelines to facilitate the safe movement of seafarers and shipping companies, suggesting key ports \u2013 including Singapore, Rotterdam, Gibraltar and Hong Kong \u2013 where crew changes could take place safely. But unions have said port states and governments <a href=\"https://www.swzmaritime.nl/news/2020/04/16/shipowners-provide-plan-for-crew-changes-worldwide/?gdpr=accept\">are not responding</a>.</p> <p>\u201cGovernments are managing to get their citizens home from abroad, passengers from cruise liners, yet there are 150,000 seafarers still out there, working to keep global supply chains open, who can\u2019t get home,\u201d Mark Dickinson, general secretary for Nautilus International, the maritime union, said.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU, the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, the International Labour Organization, are saying please get these seafarers home, but individual governments are not pulling their weight. It is becoming a health and safety crisis and it\u2019s getting worse by the day.\u201d</p> <p> Kees Wiersum, captain of a Dutch-flagged specialised cargo ship currently sailing off the coast of Madagascar, said he is concerned about \u201cfatigue and depression\u201d among his 21-man, mainly Filipino, crew.</p> <p>\u201cThey are in contact with their families, but if something happens, they can\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Wiersum. \u201cWe are trying to keep their spirits up, but they will tell you their families need them home. Some of them are expecting babies and they can\u2019t get home for the births.\u201d</p> <p>Even if they were repatriated to the Philippines, one of the largest suppliers of seafarers in the world, they would face the additional obstacle of overcrowded quarantine facilities in Manila.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ede5bf02333d78506e1ae05ff14b248ec5e42ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ede5bf02333d78506e1ae05ff14b248ec5e42ef/0_0_4944_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Filipino seafarers inside a dormitory in Manila\" width=\"1000\" height=\"738\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filipino seafarers stranded amid the coronavirus pandemic rest inside a dormitory in Manila.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francis R Malasig/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur minister of transport calls us heroes. He said we are vital for the economy,\u201d said Wiersum, 61, a Dutchman who has spent 43 years at sea. \u201cBut we are treated like pariahs, like criminals. We can\u2019t go ashore for a walk or a beer, or even for medical help. In Holland, they have repatriated holidaymakers all over the world. But they forgot about us.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most pressing problems is that seafarers are not being afforded the usual rights to get medical treatment at ports. Fabrizio Barcellona, from the seafarer section of the ITF, said he was receiving 10\u201315 reports of medical emergencies a day, and those are \u201cjust the ones we know about\u201d.</p> <p>The strain of being forced to work long beyond the end of your contract also increases the risk of accidents, seafarers say. Andrewi Kogankov, 47, from St Petersburg, Russia, has been captain aboard the Spetses Lady oil tanker since November. His contract ran out in March, but the planned crew change in Qatar was cancelled due to the lockdown, forcing him to continue sailing. His contract has now been extended for two months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/10/scottish-fishermen-turn-to-food-banks-as-covid-19-devastates-industry\">Scottish fishermen turn to food banks as Covid-19 devastates industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are feeling exhausted,\u201d Kogankov said. \u201cWe are working 24/7, we have a tough schedule, handling dangerous cargo. You have to be careful, you have to concentrate. When you are six, seven months on board, thinking about your family, you can lose your concentration.\u201d</p> <p>This week the International Maritime Organization warned its 174 member states that trade and global supply chains would \u201ccome to a halt\u201d unless crews on ships can be replaced. If the 150,000 seafarers estimated to be working beyond their contracts are not relieved of their duties in two weeks, they will be in breach of maritime regulations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f74d291d78ac9cb01b794da6de5225f4efc16ef2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f74d291d78ac9cb01b794da6de5225f4efc16ef2/0_0_3500_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crew on a Pacific International Lines ship\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crew wear face masks on a Pacific International Lines ship in Singapore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pacific International Lines/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several groups \u2013 including the ITF, International Chamber of Shipping and the International Air Transport Association \u2013 have proposed a 12-step protocol to allow seafarers to join or leave ships at a series of \u201crepatriation hubs\u201d, from where they could fly home.</p> <p>Stephen Cotton, general secretary of the ITF, said: \u201cOur message for governments is clear: you cannot continue with a mentality of out of sight, out of mind, and we strongly urge governments to act now before we suffer more serious human or environmental consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Guy Platten, general secretary of the International Chamber of Shipping, described the plight of seafarers as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe could start to see disruption to trade, and more importantly we risk accidents and mental health issues.

  "<p>A battle over the right to enjoy uninterrupted views of the Acropolis has resulted in a five-star hotel being ordered to demolish its top two floors, in a landmark ruling hailed by residents of Athens.</p> <p>Owned by Coco-Mat, the Greece-based mattress maker, the hotel \u2014 whose \u201cbreathtaking terrace\u201d had been its selling point \u2014 opened its doors barely a year ago. Citizens enraged about the ten-storey establishment blocking their own views of the citadel took the case to the highest court in the land. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a very brave decision,\u201d said Athens mayor Kostas Bakoyannis of the ruling by Greece\u2019s central archaeological council (KAS), the country\u2019s top advisory body on the preservation of ancient antiquities. \u201cThe Acropolis is our heart and our soul, an essential part of our cultural heritage. It\u2019s very important that everyone can enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners are on a roll. The decision follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/mar/08/not-everythings-for-sale-greeks-mobilise-as-new-hotels-obscure-acropolis-views-athens\">more than a year of protests</a> against \u201cmammoth\u201d high rises being erected in neighbourhoods at the sharp end of tourism beneath the<sup> </sup>fifth century BC site.</p> <p>In April residents in Makriyianni, the district due south of the Acropolis, stepped up the fight launching an online petition, with members of the Avaaz activist network demanding the centre-right Greek government safeguard the declared archaeological zone. Within days 23,000 people had signed the appeal.</p> <p>\u201cWe know of permits being considered for at least seven huge hotels,\u201d said Irini Frezadou, the Swiss-trained architect spearheading the grassroots drive. \u201cWe are overjoyed that under pressure the immovable Greek state has finally acted but it\u2019s urgent we have new building and planning laws if the urban and cultural environment of the Acropolis is to be protected.\u201d</p> <p>Spurred by the protests Greece\u2019s archaeological council unexpectedly convened. After six hours of debate conducted via teleconference, the expert committee came to the unanimous conclusion that the multimillion-euro edifice would have to be lowered, in the name of protecting the symbol of western democracy.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the Acropolis is harmed, in essence our civilisation is harmed too,\u201d said Lina Mendoni, the Greek culture minister. \u201cThe Acropolis is a symbol. It is not simply a monument.\u201d Compensation might, she suggested, be in the offing, but KAS had ruled, irrevocably, that the gargantuan building could be no more than 24 metres in height and would have to be partially torn down. At 31.5 metres, the hotel is by far the biggest construction in Makriyianni, outstripping the new Acropolis Museum in size.</p> <p>Last week Greece\u2019s highest court, the Council of State, also weighed in, adjudicating that in future, structures in the area must be 21 metres or less. The judgment came after the court revoked building permission for an even larger hotel due to go up in Makriyianni, with three underground parking lots and a pool garden on top.</p> <p>\u201cBoth decisions are a huge victory, testimony to the strength of civil society and what people can do when they unite,\u201d said Andreas Papapetropoulos, the lawyer representing the campaigners. \u201cWe are lucky that the tribunal convened under Katerina Sakellaropoulou,\u201d he added, referring to the environmentally sensitive high court justice who has since become Greece\u2019s first female head of state.</p> <p>Construction of multistorey hotels at the base of the site will, critics argue, create the effect of \u201ca wall of high rises\u201d encircling the Acropolis.</p> <p>\u201cMakriyianni is a residential neighbourhood. It was never meant for buildings of such dimensions,\u201d said Frezadou. \u201cThe mass tourism we have witnessed may have disappeared with coronavirus, but it will be back. And if it goes unchecked it will destroy the very monument visitors have come for, the Acropolis itself.\u201d</p> <p>But Greece\u2019s culture minister also acknowledged the ruling had been a \u201cvery difficult decision\u201d, saying the hotel\u2019s proprietors \u201cvery likely\u201d had justice on their side \u2013 even if KAS had not formally endorsed construction after the discovery of antiquities on the site.</p> <p>In 2012, in the midst of Greece\u2019s economic crisis, a new construction code was passed permitting bigger and taller buildings if they met \u201cgreen\u201d standards. Investors seized the opportunity, initiating a building spree in a capital that would subsequently attract record tourist arrivals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"438beb8999069cb8683fe5374de57f0b0f9671e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/438beb8999069cb8683fe5374de57f0b0f9671e9/0_358_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Plaka district at the foot of the Acropolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Plaka district at the foot of the Acropolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thanassis Stavrakis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA lot of questions will be asked,\u201d said Giannis Mihail, vice president of the <a href=\"https://www.alfhellas.gr/en/networks/elliniki-etairia-society-environment-and-cultural-heritage\">conservation group </a><a href=\"https://www.alfhellas.gr/en/networks/elliniki-etairia-society-environment-and-cultural-heritage\">Elliniki Etairia</a>. An urban planner, Mihail drafted the land use laws credited with protecting Plaka, the ancient district of narrow lanes and neoclassical houses north of the Acropolis. \u201cFrom the Acropolis hill Plaka looks much the same as it did in the time of Pericles. That cannot be said of Makriyianni, on the south side of the monument, because land use laws were never extended to the entire urban area surrounding the site.\u201d</p> <p>Bakoyannis, like the campaigners, believes no view should be the preserve of a privileged few. Athens, he says, stands out from other cities precisely because the Acropolis \u2013 undergoing a mini facelift ahead of reopening on 18 May \u2013 can be seen far and wide.</p> <p>\u201cIn London there\u2019s Big Ben but you can only see it from certain, richer areas. The same goes for Paris and the Eiffel Tower. But the Acropolis has a unifying character. You can see it from all around Athens, whether you live in a poor neighbourhood or a rich neighbourhood,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>But the mayor also cautioned against heaping blame on businessmen. Greece\u2019s fragile economy is set to contract by as much as 10% as a result of the pandemic, with investment crucial to any recovery. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say this bad hotel owner or that bad investor but we also need to be very clear about the rules we set, respect the decisions of our high court and create a predictable and safe business environment.\u201d</p> <p>How or when the owners of the hotel will be called to demolish the upper floors has yet to be revealed. So far they have not reacted publicly to the KAS decision, and when asked to comment, declined.</p> <p>Locals have scrambled to find the money to cover legal costs. Many grumble they are doing what the state should have done long ago. But Frezadou and her fellow activists see it as a duty to keep on going: international investors are lining up, fuelling fears of runaway greed transforming the area forever.</p> <p>\u201cOur battle is not yet over,\u201d she said. \u201cThis campaign is not against one, but every, ten-storey monster in the shadow of this glorious site.\u201d</p>",

But health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour warned the situation \u201cshould in no way be considered normal\u201d, as one region recorded a swift rise in its death rate and reimposed a lockdown.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Russia</strong> and <strong>Brazil</strong> both passed grim milestones at the weekend.</p> <p>Russia\u2019s cases surpassed 200,000 and its figure is expected to become the highest in Europe within days, even as the number of deaths remains relatively low at fewer than 2,000.</p> <p>While officials say the figures reveal the effectiveness of Russia\u2019s testing regime, an opposition-allied doctors union said the authorities were under-reporting deaths of medics.</p> <p>For Brazil, the signs are more ominous. Officials confirmed more than 10,000 had now died in the hardest-hit Latin American country. Scientists warned that the real figures could be many times higher, given a lack of widespread testing.</p> <p>In a sign that officials were not yet facing up to the crisis, President Jair Bolsonaro, who has likened the coronavirus to a \u201clittle flu\u201d and criticised regional lockdowns, was seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/bolsonaro-attends-floating-barbeque-as-brazils-covid-19-toll-tops-10000\">jet skiing to a floating barbecue</a>.</p> <p>The disease has also moved in the <strong>US</strong> into the White House inner circle, with a valet to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s spokeswoman testing positive.

  "<p>In a speech <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/society-must-not-snap-back-to-insecure-work-and-poverty-after-coronavirus-crisis-albanese-says\">on Monday</a>, Labor leader Anthony Albanese called for Australia to build up its domestic manufacturing capacity in the wake of the pandemic. Hallelujah \u2013 Australia could not be more ready for it.</p> <p>Shockwaves from coronavirus\u2019 comet-like impact on the world economy have shattered the neoliberal assumptions of 40 years of economic policy in many directions, but staring at the rubble remaining from what used to be a thriving local manufacturing sector is one of its most confronting exposures.</p> <p>For four decades, manufacturing in the English-speaking west has shrunk. A combination of policy wilfulness and carelessness allowed a four-decade erosion rooted in two orthodoxies. First, that localised misery of factory closures was an acceptable trade-off for the lower prices of cheaper imports. Second, that globalised trade made the world more safe. There isn\u2019t a business student in Australia who hasn\u2019t been taught the <a href=\"https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/docs/koenig-pamina/martinmayerthoenig.pdf\">conventional wisdom</a> of the post-second world war experience that globalised trade brings globalised peace.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/society-must-not-snap-back-to-insecure-work-and-poverty-after-coronavirus-crisis-albanese-says\">Society must not \u2018snap back\u2019 to insecure work and poverty after coronavirus crisis, Albanese says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem with smashing components of an economy to ensure one kind of safety is that you can leave yourself directly exposed to face a different kind of threat. Long international supply chains and trade dependence are vulnerabilities in a world where pandemics demand an instant supply of <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-27/inside-australias-only-medical-mask-factory/12093864\">masks</a> and ventilators, not to mention the practical realities of closed borders, immediate travel bans, \u201ccontact and trace\u201d policy and the struggle of sovereign governments to contain contagions.</p> <p>In this scenario, it becomes chilling to examine what items Australians may consider essential but which their country cannot make. That it\u2019s even difficult to find a centralised list of the industries that have closed here reveals the blithe policy approach to domestic manufacturing capacity. But do head to the website of the \u201cAustralian Made\u201d campaign and start searching for locally-made consumer goods; the results are startling. It\u2019s hard to believe, but this country once made not only mass-market fridges, washing machines and toasters, but our own computers, televisions and even mobile phones. Before Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott, we made cars. Australia used to make tractors. We mass-produced <a href=\"https://www.brittslist.com.au/article/sustainably-made-shoes/\">shoes</a>, and most of our own clothes.</p> <p>Now, we don\u2019t. Iconic Australian toastie-maker and appliance company Breville may be headquartered locally and do all their design and development here, but their branded products are manufactured in China. Remember Simpson washing machines? Simpson merged with Email, an Australian refrigerator company in the 1980s. By the 1990s, the company was bought and asset-stripped, the appliance brands bought by Swedish multinational Electrolux. Electrolux still make wall-ovens here, but the Simpson/Email factory in <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-11/last-australian-made-fridge-is-end-of-the-line-for-manufacturer/7316682?nw=0\">Orange, New South Wales was mothballed in 2016</a>; 300 people lost their jobs. The washing machines, along with their other white goods, dropped off the local assembly line years ago.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Closures and offshoring remain a painful, permanent scar in the living memory of the Australian working class</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And now that we\u2019ve returned to corona-created, increasingly desperate levels of unemployment, we\u2019re obliged to revisit the lost job opportunities that come with Hockey-Abbott style government \u201cindustry policy\u201d that allows local factories to shut. Cities and towns across the continent have sad stories of what used to be made in them, but few descriptions of closure resonate with the clarity of <a href=\"https://www.themonthly.com.au/blog/dennis-glover/2015/29/2015/1438134862/all-right-some#mtr\">Dennis Glover\u2019s essay</a> exploring the decline of Doveton, the industrial suburb of south-east Melbourne where he grew up. In 1970 there were three jobs in its factories for every local family, but by 2015 \u201cjust one job for every five families\u201d. Closures and offshoring remain a painful, permanent scar in the living memory of the Australian working class.</p> <p>Albanese\u2019s speech is recognition that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Despite aggressive anti-manufacturing policy from generations of conservative policymakers, close to 1 million people are still employed making things in Australia, because we are \u2013 to quote economist Richard Denniss \u2013 \u201creally good at it\u201d. Currently, <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2016/jun/pdf/bu-0616-4.pdf\">80%</a> of the manufacturing sector that remains in Australia processes food, beverages, tobacco, machinery and equipment, petroleum, coal and chemicals, and metal products. It\u2019s enough scale, shared insight and experience for Australia to reimagine its productive capacity for local sustainability and to meet the greater manufacturing demands of an unpredictable future. </p> <p>Active, intersectional industry policy that mobilises Australia\u2019s considerable education and training capacity could allow us to replicate the success of <a href=\"https://www.blackincbooks.com.au/books/solved\">Germany</a>, a western country that rejected the temptation of cheap offshoring and became an internationally competitive manufacturer by producing goods in which \u201cinnovation\u201d is a measurable component.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/11/green-steel-industry-could-secure-jobs-future-for-australias-coalmining-heartland\">Green steel industry could secure jobs future for Australia's coalmining heartland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>History shows us that government investment in rebuilding an adaptive and innovative manufacturing base doesn\u2019t just enable that sector to develop and improve. The experience of Germany and <a href=\"https://publishing.monash.edu/books/nl-9781921867927.html\">Scandinavia</a> have demonstrated that industrial innovation cross-pollinates with enhanced job opportunities and spending, improving the economic performance of sectors in an economy from information technology to education and the arts.</p> <p>But without proactive industry policy from government, Australia is in a weak position. We\u2019re left without a rapid capacity to respond to crises, such as meeting demands for medical equipment. We\u2019re left without industrial capacity to build our own defence equipment, we\u2019re reliant on the French for submarines. We threaten the supply of things we need to survive in our own homes.</p> <p>We\u2019re also left denying Australia a powerful opportunity to secure prosperity if we don\u2019t choose to reinvigorate the means for mass employment, continual upskilling and good wages that lifted up Australian living standards for the 50 years that followed the second world war. Manufacturing is the bedrock of a better Australian dream. When we wake up from coronavirus, will we realise it?</p> <p>\u2022 Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist</p>",

Bars, restaurants, theatres and cinemas remain closed. Primary schools will take small numbers of pupils, depending on space. Masks will be obligatory on public transport. Everyone will be able to move outside without having to present a form on demand but people will only be able to go 100 kilometres from their place of residence.</li> \n   <li><strong>Belgium:</strong> Most businesses will open Monday, with social distancing. Masks are recommended. Cafes, restaurants and bars remain closed. In central Brussels there will be speed limits on cars and priority will be given to cyclists and pedestrians.

Unlimited outdoor exercise will be allowed from Wednesday. From 1 June (at the earliest) nurseries and primary schools may reopen, and some non-essential shops. By July, at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places could be reopened.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Netherlands: </strong>Primary schools will partially reopen Monday. Driving schools, hair salons, physiotherapists and libraries also return, with social distancing measures.</li> \n   <li><strong>Switzerland: </strong>Primary and middle schools will reopen Monday, with classes often reduced in size. Restaurants, museums and bookshops will also open, with conditions. Meetings of more than five people remain banned.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain</strong>: Half of Spain\u2019s 47 million people will be able to meet with family or friends in gatherings of up to 10 as of Monday. Outdoor spaces at bars and restaurants can reopen with limited capacity. Hardest-hit Madrid and Barcelona are excluded from the easing, though football clubs FC Barcelona resumed training on Friday and Real Madrid will follow Monday. Only movements within provinces are authorised and cinemas and theatres remain closed. Schools will not start up again until September.</li> \n   <li><strong>Italy</strong>: While schools remain closed until September, factories, building sites and offices reopened on 4 May. Social distancing rules are in place in parks. Wearing masks is mandatory on public transport. All retail businesses will reopen on 18 May, as will museums, cultural sites, churches and libraries. Bars and restaurants will reopen from 1 June, along with hair and beauty salons.</li> \n   <li><strong>Germany</strong>: Eating in restaurants is now possible in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where the country\u2019s first cafes and restaurants reopened on Saturday. Under Germany\u2019s federal system, each of the 16 states makes its own decisions on how to emerge from lockdown and cafes and restaurants will reopen in a number of other states in the coming days and weeks. Most shops are already open and children are slowly returning to classrooms. Bundesliga football matches are also set to resume. Heeding signs of a second wave, German authorities have agreed to reimpose restrictions locally if an area has more than 50 new infections per 100,000 residents over a week.</li> \n   <li><strong>Austria</strong>: Hairdressers, tennis courts and golf courses reopened in the first weekend in May. Travel restrictions have been lifted and gatherings of up to 10 people are allowed, with social distancing. Masks are compulsory in public transport and shops.

Discrimination against us just because we are medical workers is discouraging and demoralizing.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The backlash against coronavirus patients may lead some who fall sick to avoid seeking medical care, raising the risks of infection spreading further, clinical psychologist Reo Morimitsu at the Suwa Red Cross Hospital said in an interview with NHK public television. Reports said Japanese police last month found about a dozen people dead at home alone or collapsed on the streets who later tested positive for the virus. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe virus not only infects our body but also our minds and behaviour, harming us and dividing our society,\u201d Morimitsu said.</p> \n  <p>Random acts of hatred against those with virus connections have been reported countrywide, prompting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other officials to speak out.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s shameful,\u201d Abe told a recent parliamentary session. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T04:24:37.488Z\">at 5.24am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb765258f08c0a2409bae0a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T02:29:58.317Z\">3.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sam Neill, Jurassic Park actor, shares his advice for combating anxiety</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sam Neill, the New Zealand actor famous for roles in<em> Jurassic Park</em> and<em> Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em> has kept busy during lockdown filming short videos designed to cheer his followers up.
