In an attempt to persuade the public to obey social distancing measures designed to slow the spread of the virus, Boris Johnson on Saturday night pleaded with the public not to visit their mothers on Sunday for Mother\u2019s Day. He warned anyone elderly or frail was \u201cmuch more likely to die\u201d from infection. He also had a grave message about the progress of the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot disguise or sugar-coat the threat,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers are very stark, and they are accelerating. We are only a matter of weeks \u2013 two or three \u2013 behind Italy. The Italians have a superb healthcare system. And yet their doctors and nurses have been completely overwhelmed by the demand. The Italian death toll is already in the thousands and climbing. Unless we act together \u2013 unless we make the heroic and collective national effort to slow the spread \u2013 then it is all too likely that our own NHS will be similarly overwhelmed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Saturday was the worst yet for the UK and the rest of the world. NHS England said 53 more people had died, with two in Wales and one in Scotland, bringing the UK death toll to 233 \u2013 a rise of nearly 30% in 24 hours. A total of 5,018 people have tested positive for Covid-19, up by 1,035.</p> \n<p>Global deaths stand at 11,184, according to the World Health Organization, which reported 32,000 new cases on Saturday \u2013 the largest daily increase so far. More than 266,000 people have caught the virus. Italy continues to suffer most, with 793 more deaths in the past day and 53,578 cases overall. Spain and the Netherlands also saw large jumps.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c081fc4a-b5a1-4d0d-a847-deb0227bfec0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AlGsrCiVA9Q?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Up to 1.5 million people in England currently live with health conditions or are receiving treatment, which health experts believe puts them at a much greater risk from the virus. Those who need it will be given help in securing provisions. Military planners are already working with local councils on their coronavirus response plans, and their numbers will be expanded to support the effort to help the most vulnerable.</p> \n<p>It has also emerged that the Queen will address the nation during the crisis in an attempt to rally the country as the outbreak develops.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, ministers were also battling to dispel concerns over food shortages, as panic buyers were told they should be ashamed of depriving NHS workers poised to confront the mounting national crisis.</p> \n<p>The government is under mounting pressure over elements of its response to the pandemic. Johnson is now facing increasing demands to urgently improve personal protection equipment for NHS staff, while pressure is mounting for a further aid package for millions of self-employed workers. The demands come just 24 hours after he announced unprecedented measures to close pubs, restaurants and clubs, and a scheme to pay the wages of workers threatened with the sack.</p> \n<p>The environment secretary, George Eustice, on Saturday called on shoppers to \u201cbe responsible\u201d. He said there was no shortage of food, with 50% more produce being made available in some areas. Restrictions on deliveries to stores and driver hours have been ditched to help supply, while supermarkets have been allowed to share staff and vehicles and coordinate opening times.</p> \n<p>At a Downing Street press conference, NHS England\u2019s national medical director, Stephen Powis, went further in denouncing those stockpiling, saying they should be \u201cashamed\u201d of the effect they were having on NHS staff trying to get what they need.</p> \n<p>Charities for more vulnerable groups have also told the <em>Observer </em>that they are becoming increasingly concerned that many people are facing real food shortages because they have no access to stores and online shopping slots are booked weeks in advance. Many of those who can get supplies are struggling to pay for the few things that are available, because the cheaper options are often the ones that disappear first from the shelves.</p> \n<p>If the current measures are not enough, \u201cthen the government needs to come forward very quickly with a firm and effective response, otherwise there\u2019s a growing risk that some older people will be left without the essentials they need,\u201d said Caroline Abrahams of the charity Age UK.</p> \n<p>John Lewis announced on Saturday that it would temporarily shut all 50 of its department stores from Monday, with its online site continuing to operate. The group\u2019s Waitrose shops will remain open. More than 2,000 John Lewis staff are already working in Waitrose shops to cope with the unprecedented demand for groceries and more will be redeployed \u201cwherever possible\u201d. Pret a Manger also took the decision on Saturday night to shut temporarily, saying its intention was that no jobs would be lost.</p> \n<p>With the number of coronavirus cases mounting, NHS workers on Saturday demanded a guarantee that they would be given proper protection provision and immediately have access to testing for the virus, as concerns grew that they were facing unreasonable exposure.</p> \n<p>A group of 40 leading scientists also wrote an open letter to the prime minister calling for an \u201curgent enforced lockdown\u201d in the areas highly affected by the virus, coordinated alongside more testing, case isolation and contact tracing of those who could be infected.</p> \n<p>Demands for more help for the self-employed also grew, following concerns that they would not be helped by the government\u2019s pledge to pay 80% of the wages of employees threatened with dismissal as a result of the crisis. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, is among those demanding further measures, alongside Tory MP David Davis, the TUC and the Resolution Foundation thinktank.</p> \n<p>A poll for the RSA, conducted by Populus before the government\u2019s latest economic aid package announced on Friday, found that 47% of the self-employed were concerned they would have to work even if they felt ill. More than half (51%) of those working in the gig economy said they felt the same. An Opinium poll for the <em>Observer,</em> also conducted before Friday\u2019s financial package was announced, found that just under half (47%) approved of the way the government had handled the crisis, while 31% disapproved. It gave the government a positive net score of +16%, up slightly from +14% at the end of last week.</p>",

Taiwan gambled successfully on the assumption that Covid-19 would spread widely and rapidly.\u201d</p> <p>Other countries that initially allowed the disease to spread \u2013 most notably South Korea, which at one point was the country with the most infections outside China \u2013 managed to partially tame the outbreak through rigorous testing and tracing contacts of those infected. Subsequently, new infections levelled off, even as they spiralled across Europe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ef9ff51175340f4b19fdb41aa74ba18a26c314f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ef9ff51175340f4b19fdb41aa74ba18a26c314f/0_120_4332_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wearing a face mask walks past a poster in Seoul, South Korea, showing preventative measures against infectious diseases.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman walks past a poster in Seoul, South Korea, showing preventative measures against infectious diseases.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI do think we can learn from past mistakes, and South Korea is a really strong example of that if you look at the amount of testing they have been doing, and how fast they were able to mobilise,\u201d said Ashley Arabasadi, chair emeritus of the Global Health Security Agenda Consortium.</p> <p>\u201cIt might be unfair to criticise governments that haven\u2019t had to deal with something like this in over 100 years, while South Korea have had more recent experience.\u201d</p> <p>South Korea\u2019s sense of urgency was driven in part by recent firsthand experience of how virulent coronaviruses can be due to an outbreak of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/13/south-korea-mers-outbreak-is-large-and-complex-says-who-as-14th-victim-dies\" title=\"\">Mers in 2015</a> and the 2002-03 Sars epidemic, which also affected Taiwan, Hong Kong and others in the region.</p> <p>Those diseases barely touched the west, being contained, like others including Ebola, near the site of their outbreak, potentially leaving the west\u2019s leaders too complacent.</p> <p>\u201cWe should have used that time [in January and February] more wisely, but, to be fair, everyone was dealing with an unknown,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\" title=\"\">Laura Spinney</a>, a science journalist whose latest book is <em>Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World</em>. Authorities didn\u2019t want to cause panic initially, she said, but then the balance shifted so \u201cthe biggest danger was not panic \u2013 it was complacency, and too many governments weren\u2019t moving\u201d.</p> <p>There is a chance some politicians in the US and Europe, lulled by decades of stability in their countries after the second world war \u2013 decades in which they have waged war overseas but never seen life totally upended at home \u2013 simply didn\u2019t want to recognise the threat.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are not terribly good at estimating risk. Wishful thinking, overestimation of resources, and other factors can cloud our judgment of risk. This may have happened during the current pandemic,\u201d Taylor said.</p> <p>It\u2019s important, however, that whenever the world does successfully develop a vaccine, or a cure for Covid-19, the tragic lessons of these early crises are not forgotten. Governments need to invest in healthcare systems, so that when the next pandemic arrives, we are better prepared.</p> <p>\u201cYou see a system of panic and response that we go into. Once that initial panic dies down, you get complacency, a lack of understanding that these novel viruses happen regularly and will happen with greater frequency as we become more interconnected,\u201d said Arabasadi. \u201cThat\u2019s why there needs to be a greater investment in health and health systems.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Covid-19 is the biggest health, social and economic emergency we have faced since the second world war. And while we\u2019re only at the beginning of the process of halting its spread, we will be living with the consequences for many years to come.</p> <p>Our first responsibility is to save lives. That means giving our fantastic NHS staff the time and resources they need. The biggest threat to life is if hospitals are overrun \u2013 with more patients requiring intensive care than there are beds available \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen in Italy with devastating consequences. We\u2019re already starting to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/london-hospitals-struggle-to-cope-with-coronavirus-surge\" title=\"\">some London hospitals really feeling the strain</a>.</p> <p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s so crucial that we follow the expert advice \u2013 because it buys our NHS more time. Avoid social contact. Work from home if you possibly can \u2013 my team and I will. Don\u2019t use public transport unless you absolutely have to. Do not attend any gatherings. Avoid places of worship. Pubs, clubs, gyms, cinemas and theatres should all now be closed. Restaurants and cafes must be takeaway or delivery only. Leave your home only if you really have to \u2013 to buy food and other essential items, to take a walk or exercise at a safe distance from others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Life has changed and we all have to learn to live very differently for a while. We all have to learn how to use technology to keep in touch with loved ones. We\u2019re going to become experts on the latest must-watch TV series!</p> <p>We have a huge responsibility to look out for the elderly and vulnerable. That means Mother\u2019s Day this year will be like no other. If you know someone who needs help, reach out. Set up a regular call. Ask if you can pick up their shopping and leave it on their doorstep. Please don\u2019t buy any more food than you need. There is no shortage and there will always be enough to go around \u2013 if we only take our share.</p> <p>We don\u2019t know how long this will last. It will probably be many months. But we are not just doing this for our own health. We are doing it for our vulnerable loved ones who could die if we don\u2019t \u2013 and for our heroic NHS and social care staff who need our help.</p> <p>We also have to mitigate the economic impact of coronavirus. Without further decisive and immediate government action, thousands of businesses will go bankrupt and millions of people will be left unemployed, in poverty or homeless. We have a once-in-a-generation responsibility not to let that happen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This virus is not the 'Chinese virus'. It does not respect national borders and will affect every country on Earth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The biggest barriers to following the expert advice are economic ones. People cannot be forced to choose between their health and being able to pay the rent and put food on the table. The government must ensure that businesses don\u2019t go under and that not a single person is left permanently unemployed or pushed into poverty, loses their home, or is evicted or left homeless as a result of coronavirus.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">unprecedented measures outlined by the chancellor</a> last week demonstrate he has grasped the severity of the situation \u2013 with a job guarantee scheme that should keep millions of people employed, hundreds of billions of pounds available in loans and grants to businesses, and the easing of restrictions on welfare access.</p> <p>But let me be clear \u2013 these announcements alone will not be enough. The government must get the financial support already announced into bank accounts immediately so it can get into people\u2019s purses and pockets. And the scale and scope of the economic response will need to increase if the pandemic lasts longer than the government hopes.</p> <p>I am particularly worried about the millions of self-employed, freelances and those that work in the gig economy. Their income has not been secured. This must be rectified on Monday. And we must not forget those in our society who have the least: rough sleepers. I am working with the government on urgent measures to help them.</p> <p>We also need further urgent reform of the welfare system. If someone says they need financial support in order to survive then they must get it without delay. That includes removing the \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d condition and increasing emergency funding for local authorities and community organisations to help those in immediate need.</p> <p>And we need a coordinated global economic response to the coronavirus. This virus is not the \u201cChinese virus\u201d. It does not respect national borders and will affect every country on Earth. With Donald Trump rejecting the traditional leadership role of the US, responsibility for bringing world leaders together falls to us and other European leaders. It\u2019s time for the British prime minister to show leadership.</p> <p>We all have a role to play to ensure we halt the spread of coronavirus, protect our NHS, save lives and ensure that nobody is left unemployed, in poverty or homeless. Our nation has not seen a challenge of this scale for more than 70 years. We must rise to it.</p> <p><em>Sadiq Khan is mayor of London</em></p>",

  "<p>The Home Office has released almost 300 people from detention centres in the last few days because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The speed and scale of the release is unprecedented in recent years. Detainees and charities estimate that more than a quarter of those currently locked up have been set free.</p> <p>The release comes in the wake of a legal action launched last week which argued that the Home Office had failed to protect immigration detainees from the coronavirus outbreak and failed to identify which detainees were at particular risk of serious harm or death if they do contract the virus due to their age or underlying health conditions.</p> <p>It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-call-to-release-uk-immigration-centre-detainees\">called for the release</a> of all those who are particularly vulnerable and for all detainees to be tested, along with the suspension of all new detentions. The action warns even a short delay could have \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d.</p> <p>It is believed that more than 900 people are currently in immigration detention.</p> <p>The Home Office provided a response to the legal action to the high court out of hours on Friday. After receiving the Home Office submissions, Mr Justice Swift made an order on Friday night that a half-day hearing should be held next Wednesday to determine whether or not to grant the emergency measures requested in the legal challenge by the charity <a href=\"https://detentionaction.org.uk/\">Detention Action</a> and a vulnerable detainee who suffers from hypertension, which experts say doubles the risk of death if Covid-19 is contracted.</p> <p>As part of the legal action, the public health expert Prof Richard Coker of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has provided an expert report warning that prisons and detention centres provide ideal incubation conditions for the rapid spread of the coronavirus, and that about 60% of those in detention could be rapidly infected if the virus gets into detention centres.</p> <p>Coker\u2019s report was commissioned by Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who have embarked on what is thought to be the first legal action against the government relating to the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>The UK government issued <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance/covid-19-prisons-and-other-prescribed-places-of-detention-guidance\">guidance</a> stating that if there was a significant outbreak of Covid-19, \u201ccohorting\u201d should be used to put all those infected together behind locked doors in prisons, detention centres, young offender institutions and secure units.</p> <p>Many of those in detention have arrived from high-risk countries such as Iran, China and Italy. Some are forced to share rooms, and a \u201clock-in\u201d regime prevents many from leaving their cells during the night.</p> <p>Emma Ginn, director of the detention charity Medical Justice, said that those still in detention were scared of contracting the virus.</p> <p>\u201cWe are getting harrowing calls from seriously ill clients describing their fear of the virus spreading in the centres and feeling powerless in response. The distress in their voices is palpable and there is little we can do to console them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Bella Sankey, director of Detention Action, said:\u201dOur landmark legal challenge has already forced a response from the home secretary. We are delighted the high court has now ordered a hearing for next week and we\u2019ll be pressing for a robust review of all detentions. In the midst of a global pandemic, administrative detention puts those interned in grave danger.

Consider the source</h2> <p>New information is coming at us in charts, graphs, modelling results, social media posts, news articles, podcasts, TV bulletins and from friends and people we meet.</p> <p>Few of us are epidemiologists, statisticians or healthcare experts, and fewer still are likely to have a good enough grasp on all the information that\u2019s out there.</p> <p>One unifying theme is that we should all be considering the advice of experts. But what is an expert?</p> <p>Lyndal Byford, of the Australian Science Media Centre, says: \u201cThe main thing to consider is who is making the claim. Ask yourself what is the source of the information. Is the post from a reputable organisation such as the World Health Organization or is it based on a post by an individual who heard something that someone else told them.</p> <p>\u201cMisinformation can often read like a rumour. It is also worth thinking about who funds that organisation. Do they stand to make a profit from the information they are sharing?\u201d</p> <p>Grant says everyone should \u201cslow down\u201d before they decide to share information.</p> <p>\u201cBut more importantly, listen to key sources of authority \u2013 for example, chief medical officers \u2013 before changing any behaviour based on something you read online. If the chief medical officer says something is dangerous but something you read online says it\u2019s fine, go with the chief medical officer.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Newell, professor of cognitive psychology at the University of New South Wales, says we should always check the sources of information, \u201cand check the intention of the person that puts it there\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe should stop and wonder why we have been sent something, and the impact of sending that information on to others.\u201d</p> <p>Newell said Australians rightly had a \u201chealthy scepticism\u201d for people in authority, and events like the sports rorts scandal were likely to have eroded trust.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to now recalibrate and say to themselves, this is now a situation where I should listen to the people who are in positions of authority,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we should, and for good reason.\u201d</p> <p>Public health authorities, the World Health Organization and national science academies are reliable sources of information. Advice from your hairdresser probably isn\u2019t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mckinnon_a/status/1240475633219538947\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">my partner&#39;s hairdresser sent out an email blast with some &quot;tips&quot; on how to avoid COVID-19. they are ... not good <a href=\"https://t.co/TeSsqN4HPs\">pic.twitter.com/TeSsqN4HPs</a></p>&mdash; Alex McKinnon (@mckinnon_a) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mckinnon_a/status/1240475633219538947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>2. Be wary of preliminary scientific findings</h2> <p>Under normal circumstances, new findings in science come at us through a long process of research, peer review and academic publishing that can take years to develop.</p> <p>The Sars-CoV-2 virus was only defined in January and, while some assumptions can be made about how its close relatives have behaved, what\u2019s known about the virus and the illness is still a work in progress.</p> <p>Byford says scientists are sharing information with each other as quickly as they can.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/20/pharmacists-abused-by-customers-who-have-turned-into-animals-over-medicine-limits\">Pharmacists abused by customers who have 'turned into animals' over medicine limits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is vital to ensure there are no delays in moving towards treatments or vaccines. But it also means that lots of the information reaching the public hasn\u2019t been through the usual science \u2018quality check\u2019 that is peer review.\u201d</p> <p>Findings from research that\u2019s made public without being checked by other experts could \u201cchange dramatically\u201d after peer review has been carried out, Byford says, and she would \u201cdiscourage the public from sharing this sort of information\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf you do want to share it, perhaps include a note that it is preliminary work and has not been reviewed and scrutinised by independent experts.\u201d</p> <p>All of this also means that what may have been good information a few days or weeks ago may become out of date.</p> <h2>3. Remember that stress affects decision making </h2> <p>We\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic \u2013 a situation few of us have experienced \u2013 and our screens are filled with frightening content.</p> <p>Newell says when we have \u201cadditional cognitive load\u201d, this creates inconsistency in our decision making. \u201cThat means we should push that pause button and then ask ourselves about the basis for the decision we are about to make.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Mike Kyrios, director of \u00d3rama Institute of Mental Health, Wellbeing and Neuroscience at Flinders University, says it\u2019s very important for people to \u201cswitch off\u201d from the \u201coverwhelming emotional content\u201d of the crisis each day.</p> <p>Giving ourselves a break will reduce the tendency to panic and make rash decisions, he says. The development of apps or websites that centralise key information and advice will also help.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing a lot of positive thinking, but having a positive attitude if you\u2019re quarantined is important \u2013 we do need a more positive attitude instead of putting our internal resources into our fears. Fear is natural but we have to accept that fear is there and then move through it.\u201d</p> <p>Look for people who are responding positively, he says, and what\u2019s needed is \u201cactually physical distancing, not social distancing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe should use social media sites to connect with friends.\u201d</p> <h2>4. Think about the consequences before taking action</h2> <p>Grant says he would \u201cnever argue against critical thinking\u201d but says our own simple actions \u2013 \u201cwash your hands, increase social distance, isolate and test if you\u2019re sick\u201d \u2013 what\u2019s important.</p> <p>Newell says we should generally be thinking about the knock-on effects of our actions \u2013 whether that is simply coughing in a public place or deciding to clear out a supermarket when other community members may be in greater need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/so-you-think-you-have-coronavirus-what-australians-should-do-if-they-are-unwell\">So you think you have coronavirus: what Australians should do if they are unwell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Byford says there are lots of factchecking sites that are debunking particular claims regularly: \u201cA simple google of the claim and the word factcheck can do a lot of the work for you. Snopes is usually a good place to start, but <a href=\"https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer\">Google also as has a factcheck explorer</a>.\u201d</p> <p>She says people should also be aware that some conclusions may be based on a correlation, which may turn out to be irrelevant after scientists have examined it further.</p> <p> \u201cThere are lots of situations where two things seem to change at the same time but it turns out that there is not real link \u2013 for example you can find a correlation between the number of <a href=\"https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations\">films starring Nicolas Cage and the number of swimming pool drownings</a>.\u201d</p> <h2>5. Remember that information and assumptions can change</h2> <p>All modelling comes with uncertainties and is loaded with assumptions that may change, be wrong or be incomplete.</p> <p>Often models are designed not to accurately predict the future but rather to show what might happen if different decisions are made.</p> <p>\u201cUncertainty is the mind-killer,\u201d Grant says. \u201cIt\u2019s the real big issue here, and it\u2019s why our sociological behaviours have become part of the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re far more reasonable in the face of crises we\u2019ve seen recently before \u2013 cyclones and bushfires \u2013 because we\u2019ve seen lots of them before. Sure, they\u2019re changing now, but they\u2019re changing within bounds we can extrapolate to based on recent history.</p> <p>\u201cNone of us have experienced a threat like this personally before, and we don\u2019t know how long this will last. Any panic-buying behaviours are rational in this sense.\u201d</p> <p>Kyrios\u2019s institute at Flinders University has <a href=\"https://news.flinders.edu.au/blog/2020/03/16/mental-health-advice-amid-covid-19-concerns/\">developed a set of strategies</a> to help people manage their mental health if they\u2019re forced to stay home.</p> <p>\u201cUnderstand that uncertainty and novelty will lead to heightened tension and stress \u2013 Question yourself if you\u2019re angry,\u201d the advice says.</p> <p>\u201cAre your fears likely to eventuate? What does science tell us about the most likely outcomes? Is your response reasonable?\u201d</p>",

How do we track these daily convulsions and make sense of how society is shattering and how or when it will recover. Reporting the coronavirus pandemic is a defining challenge and responsibility for the news media. It demands deep consideration.</p> <p>Above all else \u2013 as our global editor in chief, Katharine Viner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-the-guardians-promise-to-our-readers\">promised readers this week</a> \u2013 we must provide reliable, factual, trustworthy information that holds firm against the conspiracy theories and misinformation swirling through social media. Being part of a global news organisation dedicated to deep factual reporting of this global crisis gives us strength and depth. We will track the best information on the disease and its treatment, question how authorities are handling the crisis, consider how decisions affect everyone, including the vulnerable, and try to understand the social and economic impacts as they strike.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Given the stakes are quite literally life and death, we must also be able to question those decisions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But those commitments raise so many more questions.</p> <p>How, for example, should we balance legitimate questioning of government decisions with the danger of further undermining public faith in expert advice and institutions? Of course we condemn shock jock Alan Jones for asserting that concerns about Covid-19 amount to \u201chysteria and alarmism \u2026 the health version of global warming\u201d, especially irresponsible considering the age demographic of his audience. But what about much more informed criticism of the Australian government, and its advice from the chief medical officer, from respected ABC presenter Norman Swan or health adviser Bill Bowtell, or the analysis of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/the-case-for-shutting-down-almost-everything-and-restarting-when-coronavirus-is-gone\">the various \u201cendgame options\u201d</a> from the Grattan Institute that Guardian Australia published this weekend.</p> <p>The official advice did seem chaotic in the early days, it did swing wildly in the course of a day and decisions were insufficiently explained. The government is making huge and difficult decisions in a rapidly changing environment. We have to take that into account. Given the stakes are quite literally life and death, we must also be able to question those decisions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many people seem to be thinking more deeply about their own priorities and those we have as a society</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But we have to consider the implications of those questions at a time when faith in public institutions is already shaky. A deeply polarised country needs to trust and stick with a plan. Yes, politicians may have done much to breed that lack of trust, but there are consequences for everyone if contempt for government undermines the need for a unified and urgent response to public health measures. When does legitimate scrutiny cross the line to become counterproductive? These difficult judgments must be made on a daily basis.</p> <p>This story is, by definition, terrifying and bewildering, but can the facts be presented in a way that makes them less so?

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>UK coronavirus death toll rises to 233</h2> <p>The death toll in the UK rose to 233 on Saturday after NHS England said a further 53 Covid-19 patients had died. The people who died were aged 41 to 94 and all had underlying health conditions. Two further deaths were announced in Wales and the third in Scotland on Saturday.</p> <h2>John Lewis and Pret a Manger close all UK stores</h2> <p>High street coffee chain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/pret-a-manger\">Pret a Manger</a> announced it will be closing 400 UK stores from Saturday evening, while John Lewis will be closing all 50 of its shops temporarily from Monday, the first time in the 155-year history of the business that it will not open its shop doors for customers. The online site will continue to operate as normal, alongside Waitrose\u2019s physical and online shops.</p> <h2>Italy sees biggest daily increase in coronavirus deaths</h2> <p>The death toll in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a> rose by 793 to 4,825 on Saturday, officials said. It is the largest daily rise in absolute terms since the contagion emerged a month ago. On Thursday, Italy overtook China as the country to register most deaths from Covid-19. The total number of cases in Italy rose to 53,578 from a previous 47,021, an increase of 13.9%, the Civil Protection Agency said.</p> <h2>US vice-president to be tested for coronavirus</h2> <p>At a White House press briefing, vice-president Mike Pence confirmed that an aide in his office had tested positive for coronavirus. \u201cBoth I and my wife will be tested later this afternoon,\u201d he says, despite the fact they are asymptomatic. \u201cNeither the president or I had direct contact\u201d with the staffer, he added.</p> <h2>Albania enlists help of army to enforce curfew</h2> <p>Albania has resorted to deploying the army to enforce a curfew that began at 1pm local time on Saturday in the country\u2019s latest bid to stem the spread of coronavirus. The measure, set to last 40 hours, was implemented after citizens continued to openly flout orders to stay at home. To date, 76 people in the country have contracted the virus. Two deaths have been recorded.</p> <h2>Jair Bolsonaro comes under fire for coronavirus response</h2> <p>Brazil\u2019s far-right president is facing fierce criticism for what is widely seen as his chaotic and cavalier response to the crisis. Despite this, governors of some of Brazil\u2019s key states are taking drastic action amid warnings that the country\u2019s health service could collapse in the coming weeks. The governor of S\u00e3o Paulo state, Jo\u00e3o Doria, has just announced that it will begin a 15-day quarantine from this Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>On 27 June 2019, the energy and clean growth minister Chris Skidmore signed papers that committed the UK to reduce carbon emissions to effectively <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-becomes-first-major-economy-to-pass-net-zero-emissions-law\">nothing by 2050</a>. If we are to stand any chance of meeting this target, known as \u201cnet zero\u201d, there is one enormous challenge that we will have to tackle: home heating.</p> <p>Warming our homes is responsible for between a quarter and a third of the UK\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. That\u2019s more than 10 times the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> created by the aviation industry. Around 85% of homes now use gas-fired central heating, and a large proportion of gas cooking still takes place. Greening this system is a huge challenge by any measure. But if recent reports are to be believed, there could be a simple and efficient way to do it: change from using natural gas to hydrogen gas.</p> <p>Hydrogen is abundant in the natural world and according to its advocates could power the next generation of gas appliances cleanly and efficiently.</p> <p>\u201cThe attraction of hydrogen is that for a lot of consumers, they wouldn\u2019t notice any difference. Customers would continue to use a boiler to heat their homes in a similar manner to natural gas,\u201d says Robert Sansom of the Institution of Engineering and Technology\u2019s energy policy panel. He is the lead author on a study conducted by the institute called <a href=\"https://www.theiet.org/impact-society/sectors/energy/energy-news/transitioning-to-hydrogen-assessing-the-engineering-risks-and-uncertainties/\">Transitioning to Hydrogen</a>.</p> <p>Together with colleagues, Sansom assessed the engineering risks and uncertainties associated with swapping our gas network to hydrogen. Their conclusion is that there is no reason why repurposing the gas network to hydrogen cannot be achieved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/hydrogen-uk-gas-grid-keele-university\">Zero-carbon hydrogen injected into gas grid for first time in groundbreaking UK trial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s not to say it would be easy, though. Technological and practical hurdles exist because there is no blueprint for such a conversion: there is nowhere in the world that supplies pure hydrogen to homes and businesses. The UK would have to pioneer everything.</p> <p>Interest in hydrogen as a way to heat homes began in 2016 with a report called H21. It was conducted by Northern Gas Networks, the gas distributor for the north of England, and looked at whether it was technically possible and economically viable to convert Leeds to 100% hydrogen instead of natural gas.</p> <p>\u201cThey went into a lot of detail, from the hydrogen production plants right the way down to people\u2019s homes,\u201d says Sansom.</p> <p>The report drew a parallel to the way the gas industry converted from town gas to natural gas in the 1960s and 70s. Town gas was a combination of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. It was mostly produced from the distillation of coal and oil and had been used for the first 150 years of the UK\u2019s gas industry. With the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea, which is predominantly methane, the UK undertook a nationwide programme to convert 40m appliances over a decade.</p> <p>Whole streets would be converted at a time. Engineers would inspect the gas appliances, and then convert them. Simultaneously, the town gas was disconnected and the pipelines were purged with an inert gas. Finally, the natural gas was pumped into the system and the engineers would make sure each appliance worked correctly before moving to the next street along.</p> <p>Some manufacturers are now so convinced that a similar thing can happen with hydrogen that they have already begun to develop new household appliances. In February, <a href=\"https://www.worcester-bosch.co.uk/img/documents/hydrogen/The_Future_of_Fuel.pdf\">Worcester Bosch</a> unveiled the prototype of its hydrogen-ready boiler. It would run first on natural gas and then, after a servicing visit, hydrogen.</p> <p>Also working in hydrogen\u2019s favour is that for the past 20 years, the gas industry has been systematically replacing the metal pipes in its \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/domestic/gasmain.pdf\">iron mains</a>\u201d network with yellow polyethylene ones. Around 90% of the pipes will have been replaced by 2030. This is good news for hydrogen because the gas reacts with the old metal pipes, making them brittle. But the polyethylene is safe.</p> <p>\u201cEffectively we started a programme of hydrogen-proofing our gas network without knowing we were doing it,\u201d says Sansom, who found himself becoming more and more impressed by the concept. \u201cFrom a personal point of view, I was very much on the fence when I kicked off with this work. But I found myself slipping down on the hydrogen side in terms of its viability as a low carbon alternative to natural gas,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83cf920fe00a530005a17cefdc3c86a97ba969b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83cf920fe00a530005a17cefdc3c86a97ba969b8/0_0_6000_3368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Worcester Bosch\u2019s hydrogen-fired boiler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Worcester Bosch\u2019s hydrogen-fired boiler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Worcester Bosch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But not everyone is convinced by this sudden interest in hydrogen. Richard Lowes of the University of Exeter Energy Policy Group says that until recently the received wisdom had been that heating would have to be electrified in some way to meet our climate-crisis commitments. \u201cThat has basically come out of years and years of technical and economic modelling to look at how you get to fully decarbonised heating in the UK,\u201d says Lowes.</p> <p>Switching heating from gas to electricity would mean relying on heat pumps. These use electricity to extract heat from either the air or the ground. In the case of an air source heat pump, it works like a fridge but instead of sucking heat out of a food compartment, it pulls it out of the air and channels it into the home, where it is used to heat water, which is piped to radiators for central heating, and stored in a tank for hot water.</p> <p>But because this technology works at a lower temperature than existing boilers, it requires many homes to be much better insulated, or to have larger radiators, capable of delivering more heating power. For those who have switched to heat-as-you-go combi boilers, it will necessitate the reinstallation of a hot water tank.</p> <p>It\u2019s extensive work but worth it, according to Lowes, who has removed his own gas boiler and is now using an air source heat pump to heat his home. \u201cIt was a lot of work but my home and heating system are now a lot more efficient. It\u2019s always warm, there\u2019s always hot water and it\u2019s basically the same cost to run as gas,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's a bit hypocritical for the gas industry to say we can\u2019t dig up the roads when they\u2019ve been doing it for 20 years</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Lowes</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The third approach is called district heating. It envisages water being heated at a central facility using waste heat from industry or green sources such as solar power. The hot water is then delivered to many homes simultaneously through a network of heavily insulated underground pipes. Both methods can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of home heating but the downside is that they require extensive work to roll them out on a national scale.</p> <p>District heating would require water pipes to be laid under homes, and the widespread use of heat pumps would necessitate the National Grid\u2019s electricity circuits being upgraded. It is this kind of disruption that hydrogen\u2019s advocates say could be avoided because much of the national infrastructure has already been upgraded. That argument cuts no ice with Lowes. \u201cIt seems a bit hypocritical for the gas industry to say we can\u2019t dig up the roads when they\u2019ve been doing it for the past 20 years,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He points out that although the consumer may not experience so much disruption, significant challenges for the gas industry remain. For example, the National Transmission System, which is the network of pipes that supplies gas from the coastal terminals to the gas distribution companies and other major users, is made of metal. This would need to be protected from embrittlement in some way before any switch to hydrogen could take place.</p> <p>\u201cHydrogen is certainly not a silver bullet,\u201d says Lowes. And if we get distracted by it, we could be getting ourselves into more trouble, missing the 2050 energy target altogether.</p> <p>But if there is so much uncertainty with hydrogen, why is the gas industry, which funds many of the studies, pushing it so hard? According to Chris Goodall, energy economist and author of <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50345546-what-we-need-to-do-now\">What We Need to Do Now for a Zero Carbon Future</a></em>, it is a matter of survival.</p> <p>\u201cThey do not wish for their industry to be eaten up by a switch to electricity for heating. So they are moving as fast as they can to persuade us about hydrogen,\u201d he says. And it all comes down to how the gas is produced.</p> <p>Hydrogen is not found on Earth in a pure state. Instead, it has to be extracted from other substances, and the best one to extract it from is methane \u2013 in other words natural gas. Hence, the gas companies could effectively keep their current operations running.</p> <p>But the extra steps involved in extracting the hydrogen would push the price up. Additionally, the extraction creates carbon dioxide as a byproduct, so large scale carbon capture technology would need to be developed to prevent it escaping into the atmosphere. Although this is a technology that the UK will have to develop anyway in order to reach net zero by 2050, it will add to the cost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94bea20a7ad39a7b8b1e81ae3254694474ab0782\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94bea20a7ad39a7b8b1e81ae3254694474ab0782/0_208_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Northern Ireland\u2019s first sustainable hydrogen fuel cell bus, the Wrightbus, unveiled in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Northern Ireland\u2019s first sustainable hydrogen fuel cell bus, the Wrightbus, unveiled in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But natural gas is not the only substance that contains hydrogen. Water does too, and the hydrogen can be freed by a process called electrolysis, which doesn\u2019t create any carbon dioxide. To make it totally green, which is the ultimate hope, electrolysis could be powered by wind farms. At the moment, however, the price of such electricity is expensive, and that would push the price of hydrogen up still further.</p> <p>Goodall hopes that the cost will decrease as technology improves, but warns: \u201cYou can be accused of mindless optimism just by saying this.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s future energy landscape is without doubt a difficult realm to navigate. Perhaps the best route will be revealed by not pitting the various solutions against one another. \u201cAll three have strengths and weaknesses and I expect that there\u2019ll be a major role for each as a replacement for natural gas,\u201d says Sansom. Even hydrogen\u2019s detractors acknowledge this. \u201cAs a niche technology it can have real value,\u201d says Lowes. He goes on to paraphrase the Heineken lager adverts of the 70s and 80s, saying that hydrogen could potentially reach the parts of the country that other energy solutions can\u2019t.</p> <p>Goodall also sees a role for hydrogen to \u201cstore\u201d energy generated from renewable resources such as wind and solar power. The idea is that in windy months, any extra electricity generated from renewables will be used to make hydrogen, which would then be stored. When there is extra demand on the National Grid, or a seasonal drop in the power produced from renewables, the hydrogen can be burned to produce electricity.</p> <p>The truth is that all options for us to decarbonise our heating systems will require significant disruption and cost. And while government continues to deliberate, the clock ticks towards 2050.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no need to wait. We can deploy stuff now that works fine,\u201d says Lowes, referring to his own experience of changing his gas boiler for a heat pump. \u201cThe urgency of climate change means there really isn\u2019t any reason to delay.\u201d</p> <p>Others believe that there is a role for hydrogen and think it is worth taking a little more time to consider. But there is one truth that everyone agrees upon. \u201cNone of this is easy. If anyone is saying to you this is easy, they are misleading you,\u201d says Lowes.</p> <h2>Hydrogen-powered cars</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f857b4c9eb391db5e6b71d3512f4d2566abf3cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f857b4c9eb391db5e6b71d3512f4d2566abf3cb/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hydrogen filling station in Seoul, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hydrogen filling station in Seoul, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hydrogen can also power vehicles, but in a different way than it would heat houses. Instead of being burned, the hydrogen reacts with oxygen inside a device called a fuel cell. Electricity and water are produced. The electricity runs the car, the water drips from the exhaust pipe.<br><br>An attempt to switch to hydrogen vehicles in the 1990s was thwarted byelectric cars, which store their energy in an onboard battery. But a new push for hydrogen vehicles is coming from Asia. China, Japan and South Korea have all set ambitious goals to have millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads by 2030.<br><br>Toyota and Hyundai are both offering hydrogen vehicles in the UK, but there are currently less than 20 hydrogen filling stations across the UK, mostly clustered around the M25.<br><br>\u201cIt will be really interesting to see what happens,\u201d says Lowes. But he himself is not convinced: \u201cHydrogen is much more expensive than electricity, and the car is more expensive than the electric vehicle.\u201d</p>",

In Albert Camus\u2019s 1947 novel, <em>La Peste</em> (The Plague), the initially unbelievable spread of a lethal disease in a small town serves as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy\" title=\"\">allegory for human suffering</a> in the fascist era. \u201cWe find it hard to believe in a pestilence when it descends upon us,\u201d he wrote. Camus continued: \u201cThere have been as many plagues in the world as there have been wars, yet plagues and wars always find people equally unprepared. When war breaks out, people say: \u2018It won\u2019t last long, it\u2019s too stupid.\u2019 And war is certainly too stupid, but that doesn\u2019t prevent it from lasting.

She filmed herself in her car, exhausted and crying, having just come out of a supermarket where she was unable to buy any fresh fruit or vegetables.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a critical care nurse and I\u2019ve just finished 48 hours of work and I just wanted to get some stuff in for the next 48 hours,\u201d she said. \u201cThose people who are just stripping the shelves of basic foods, you just need to stop it because it\u2019s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you are at your lowest and just stop it, please.\u201d</p> \n<p>Powis said: \u201cWe should all be ashamed that this [the video] had to happen. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about possible government intervention to restrict food purchases, Eustice said: \u201cThe reality is that most of the supermarkets are already, of their own accord, putting limits on certain items so I don\u2019t think it is necessary or appropriate for the government to dictate this.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said people needed to \u201ccalm down\u201d and \u201conly buy what they need\u201d, and that it was for retailers to agree what the appropriate limit was on goods such as toilet paper.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll of the major retailers are working together and exercising their own judgment on where it\u2019s appropriate to put limits \u2013 item limits \u2013 on certain issues,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cToilet roll is one, where, for reasons that are not really known, there was a spike early on, despite the fact that toilet roll is made in this country and they are able to expand production very quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>The press conference followed a meeting between Johnson and supermarket bosses about panic buying on Saturday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been growing calls from MPs, academics, charities and those who work with vulnerable people to ensure food and other essentials are reaching those most in need.</p> \n<p>This weekend, 150 cross-party MPs and peers wrote to the government asking it to \u201cshow the direction and leadership necessary\u201d to ensure food supplies were available for all NHS, emergency and essential workers.</p> \n<p>Charities working with more vulnerable groups told the Observer they were becoming increasingly concerned that many people were facing real food shortages because they had no access to stores, and online shopping slots were booked weeks in advance. Many of those who could access food were struggling to pay for the few things that were available because the cheaper options were often the ones that had disappeared from shelves.</p> \n<p>The Salvation Army\u2019s leader in the UK and Ireland, Commissioner Anthony Cotterill, said: \u201cWe urge the government to bring all the major retailers together to develop a coordinated approach. Measures are urgently needed, in both urban and rural areas, to help older people and key workers access the groceries they need to remain healthy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Age UK expressed similar concerns, saying it was \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d that the problem of stockpiling was not going away despite the measures supermarkets have taken to try to address the issues, such as introducing pensioner-only hours in stores.</p> \n<p>The stockpiling showed no sign of abating this weekend. Before 6am on Saturday, hundreds of shoppers were filmed queueing round the block at major stores, including all the way around the car park at a Tesco in New Malden, south London.</p> \n<p>Steve Livington, 58, who lives alone in Peacehaven, West Sussex, is a wheelchair user and said he always shopped online.</p> \n<p>\u201cLast week I went to order my Tesco delivery and there was nothing for three weeks, and then the same for Sainsbury\u2019s and similarly for Asda,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Asked what he thought of the government\u2019s call for greater responsibility, he said: \u201cWords like those I sadly feel will do little to calm the irrational fears driving most of those panic buyers. Akin to the old adage \u2018show don\u2019t tell\u2019, what\u2019s needed is action not words.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Alexander Trautrims, an expert in logistics and supply chains at Nottingham University Business School said: \u201cRelaxing the restrictions on retail logistics are well overdue. Making it easier for supermarkets and the food sector to share resources and knowledge by waiving competition rules temporarily is another logical step. It is hard to believe that such measures were not part of a response plan prepared a long time ago sitting, ready to be implemented, in a government drawer.\u201d</p>",

By the middle of last week, the other bellwether of US investor sentiment, the Dow Jones industrial average, was down 30% from its peak.</p> <p>Making matters worse, Trump refused to abandon a trade war with Beijing that has kept import tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods. With much of China and US manufacturing suffering a collapse in output, it seemed the perfect time for Washington to put aside a battle that had already slowed a global recovery in 2017 to a crawl in 2019.</p> <p>Across Wall Street predictions of a V-shaped recovery \u2013 one that means that by the end of the year a surge in economic activity through the autumn has eradicated most of the lost output in the spring and summer \u2013 were ditched in favour of an L-shaped recovery of low growth into the middle distance.</p> <p>\u201cIt is absolutely clear to every single investor,\u201d the Citigroup analysts went on, \u201cthat the 2019 growth consensus is not going to materialise.\u201d</p> <p>A survey of leading academic economic experts across Europe found that a majority believe a major recession is a likely consequence of the coronavirus pandemic, whatever the death toll.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"970693bed2f4b528b540e11333dc1517e10ccd5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/970693bed2f4b528b540e11333dc1517e10ccd5e/0_228_5149_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The front page of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper on 24 October 1929.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The front page of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper on 24 October 1929.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Icon Communications/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the main reasons for their gloomy outlook, and for many respondents to say they believed a long depression would follow the recession, was their eye-rolling assessment of Europe\u2019s finance ministries and how effective they can be in a crisis. Two-thirds told researchers at Chicago University that it is \u201chighly doubtful\u201d finance ministries would respond effectively to the potential damage from Covid-19.</p> <p>On Friday, Rishi Sunak set out extra measures to protect business from going bust and households from dramatic falls in income. It was the chancellor\u2019s third attempt to allay fears that the UK would enter a recession from which it could take years to exit.</p> <p>Widely seen as a way to match the income guarantee schemes implemented by the Scandinavian countries and Austria, Sunak\u2019s plan followed warnings from the TUC and business groups that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\" title=\"\">his first two efforts had fallen short</a>, leaving hundreds of businesses to lay off workers or go bust.</p> <p>There are still economic forecasters who predict a speedy return to health and a V-shaped recovery.</p> <p>In recent days, Oxford Economics has predicted a deeper recession for the UK than it estimated even a week ago, with a central forecast showing zero growth at the end of the year downgraded to a 1.4% decline.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the global economy gets a downgrade from 2.5% to zero growth for 2020, \u201cwhich would mark the second-weakest year for the global economy in almost 50 years of comparable data, with only 2009, in the depths of the global financial crisis, being worse\u201d, it said.</p> <p>But the consultancy still expects a strong bounce-back in GDP by the middle of next year.

We\u2019ve already had 10 years of low growth. It will be completely unacceptable to have another 10 years. We thought the spending taps would open in response to the climate emergency. Now it will need to happen to tackle the economic consequences of the virus and to save the planet\u201d he said.</p> <p>That means a repeat of the 1930s, when it took the US economy until 1939 to reach the level of GDP seen in the 1920s, may be prevented by a double-barrelled blast of funds from central banks and governments in the next couple of years.</p> <p>John Llewellyn, a former chief economist at the OECD, who now runs his own consulting firm, is sceptical that governments have the will to collaborate to boost growth while tackling climate change. He fears populist movements will force many national administrations to retreat further behind protectionist trade barriers, condemning the global economy to further years of low growth.</p> <p>Tommaso Valletti, head of the department of economics and public policy at Imperial College Business School, said: \u201cLooking at the past two centuries, we had many recessions but only one depression \u2013 in 1929 \u2013 which lasted almost a decade. So we really have a very limited sample size to draw from history.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the Great Depression happened with a perfect storm of bad events, including a tightening of monetary policy of the US central bank. We have learned how to lend support to the economy, and I observe that central banks are doing the right thing now, with expansionary monetary policies. I remain optimistic that we will avoid a repetition of the Great Depression: still, there will be massive economic and social costs and longer-term economic restructuring.\u201d</p> <p>Yet while central banks learned the lessons of the 1929 crash, it remains to be seen if governments have learnt the lesson of the last 10 years and put austerity behind them.</p> <h2>Then and now</h2> <p><strong>The Great Depression</strong><br>\u2022 By 1933, when the Great Depression reached its lowest point, some 15 million Americans (20% of the population) were unemployed and nearly half the country\u2019s banks had failed.</p> <p>\u2022 By 1931, industrial production had dropped by half, prompting President Herbert Hoover\u2019s administration to offer failing banks and other institutions government loans, allowing them to extend loans to businesses, which would hang on to staff. It was widely considered a flop.</p> <p>\u2022 President Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal prompted three years of 3% average growth from 1933.

But so far little attention has been given to products made by other industries.</p> <p>However, the trade campaign group Global Justice Now claims that US cosmetic products which use chemicals currently banned in the EU could soon find their way to the UK.</p> <p>More than 1,300 toxic ingredients have been banned from use in cosmetics in the UK, with restrictions on a further 500 ingredients. In comparison, only 11 are banned in the US, according to the group. It points out that animal testing of cosmetics is legal in the US, but banned in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cChemical regulation in the US is like the wild west \u2013 it\u2019s what happens when you allow big business to dictate the rules, rather than thinking about consumer protection or the need to protect the environment,\u201d said the group\u2019s director Nick Dearden.</p> <p>\u201cAnd with Trump in charge, it\u2019s getting worse by the week. Our big worry here is that, under a trade deal with the US, parts of this system will be imported into Britain, and that the concerns people have rightly voiced about chlorine chicken will be expanded to all manner of products that people use on their body.\u201d</p> <p>As with food, in the US the burden lies chiefly with the regulator to prove something is unsafe rather than with business to demonstrate that it is safe.

Other chemical substances freely available in US products but banned in the UK include formaldehyde, a carcinogen used in hair-straightening treatments, nail polish and eyelash glue; parabens, which are used in skin and hair products and have a tendency to mimic oestrogen in the body, disrupting the hormonal system; p-Phenylenediamine, an organic compound derived from coal tar and used in hair dyes which can trigger severe allergic reactions; triclosan, an antibacterial agent used in soaps and toothpastes which is believed to spread antibiotic resistance; and phthalates which are found in perfumes and shampoo and can lower semen quality.</p> <p>US negotiators stress that a key aim of any trade deal would be to \u201cpromote greater regulatory compatibility to reduce burdens associated with unnecessary differences in regulations and standards, including through regulatory cooperation where appropriate\u201d. But Dearden claims this would cede too much power to business: \u201cBoris Johnson has talked about the US\u2019s so-called \u2018science-based\u2019 system. But that\u2019s a shorthand for a system in which big corporations dictate the rules.\u201d </p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for International Trade said: \u201cThe government has been very clear that any future trade deal must work for UK consumers and businesses, upholding our high regulatory standards.

We have no intention of harming this reputation in pursuit of a trade deal.\u201d</p>",

The country\u2019s three professional franchises, along with Western Force, who were severed from the elite game in 2017, will feature in a domestic round-robin competition, playing behind closed doors, although it would take only one player, coach or member of the support staff to test positive for Covid-19 for the project to be abandoned. Still, it remains a model for the elite game in England.</p> <p>\u201cIf that is what it takes here, we want to start however we can,\u201d says Orange, \u201cand we are all of the same mind. I know I am going to have to put more money into Sale to help us overcome this and I will do so, but the shorter the delay in resuming playing, the better for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, all the Premiership clubs, plus relegated Newcastle, each received a \u00a312.5m windfall after the private equity company CVC took a 27% stake in the competition. It allowed many to pay off overdrafts and loans as well as investors and, for some, contribute to investment projects, but few have deep pockets and should the shutdown continue through the summer, they face being no better off than they were a year ago while CVC takes more than a quarter of the league\u2019s turnover every year, reducing their income.</p> <p>\u201cWe were not in debt so we have not touched the CVC money,\u201d says Orange. \u201cI am not in a position to say what other clubs have done with their share, but we will be all right.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/premiership-rugby-clubs-players-pay-cut-coronavirus\">Four top-flight clubs announce 25% pay cuts as rugby starts to feel pinch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Premiership was suspended until 24 April in the hope it would not spook BT subscribers into cancelling or freezing their deals. While playing behind closed doors would mean a loss of match-day income, it would provide live action at a time when nothing is going on and lead to a resumption in central funding from Premiership Rugby, which makes up for 30% of the turnover on average.</p> <p>Premiership clubs have responded quickly, collectively agreeing, with the exception of the leaders, Exeter, to cut players\u2019 wages by 25%. Central funding monies have dried up because it is paid on a monthly basis, based on expected income. With the lucrative Premiership final a potential victim of the shutdown and the knockout stages of the Champions Cup likely to be cancelled if the season resumes in a compressed form, revenues will be lower than calculated, adding to the financial pressure on the clubs whose outgoings average nearly \u00a31m a month. Broadcasters and sponsors alike are conscious they are now getting nothing for their investment.</p> <p>Some clubs needed to make the pay cuts immediately while others had more slack but they united in deciding they were all in it together and needed to make a collective decision. To do otherwise ran the risk that the players in clubs whose financial position was precarious would consider themselves free agents because their contract had been breached and look elsewhere.</p> <p>Only Exeter demurred, which did not surprise the other 11 as the Chiefs\u2019 chairman, Tony Rowe, has become increasingly detached from the others during the course of the season. Six clubs have confirmed the cuts: Bristol, Wasps, Gloucester, Worcester, Leicester and Saracens with Northampton, London Irish, Bath, Sale and Harlequins expected to follow early next week.</p> <p>\u201cIn line with the actions taken by other Premiership clubs, we are having to make difficult decisions that can help safeguard the stability of our club and the game in these testing times,\u201d said Bath on its website. \u201cWe are engaged in ongoing conversations with players and staff, and this will continue into the early part of next week.

From 1 April, players and staff will receive a deduction in salary during this unprecedented period without competitive rugby.\u201d</p> <p>These cuts have been in agreement with players, so contracts have not been breached. Reports of a threatened strike are premature, but there is concern about when full payment is resumed \u2013 will it be when they report back for training or matches resume? Also will the cuts be made up with players moving elsewhere when their contracts expire at the end of June?</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s four provinces have agreed to pay players and staff deferments of between 10-50%. The decision will be reviewed and the Irish RFU hopes \u201cto return to full pay, and repay any deferrals, as soon as possible\u201d, banking on something of the season being salvaged in the summer.

Thanks mainly to Donald Trump and his sidekick, Tehran could soon move a crucial step closer to going nuclear \u2013 the very outcome the Americans most fear.</p> <p>There is little reason to feel sympathy for Iran\u2019s political and religious bosses and their incompetent, corrupt and abusive regime. The country\u2019s present government has proved it is not fit to govern. But its long-suffering people are a different matter. They deserve better of both their leaders and the Trump administration.</p> <p>Pompeo said the new measures, targeting individuals and businesses allegedly engaged in circumventing the US oil embargo, showed Washington\u2019s determination to maintain its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, begun in 2018 after Trump torpedoed the nuclear deal.</p> <p>Yet the move could hardly have been more provocative, or more cruel. Iranians have endured many months of intensifying hardship as US sanctions have shrunk the economy, destroyed jobs and depressed living standards. They have been badly hit by the coronavirus, which the health ministry has said is killing one person every 10 minutes. </p> <p>Callous US disregard for Iran\u2019s Covid-19 emergency \u2013 it is effectively blocking bilateral medical aid and a request for a $5bn loan from the International Monetary Fund \u2013 suggests that Washington is not interested in confidence-building measures. \u201cThe Wuhan virus is a killer and the Iranian regime is an accomplice,\u201d Pompeo snarled.</p> <p>His animosity dashed hopes the health crisis could encourage a rapprochement of sorts. And clashes this month between US forces and pro-Iran militia in Iraq were a reminder of how the stand-off could easily go the other way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign of coercion and ostracism has failed disastrously</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Washington is at odds with European allies, who deplore its dangerous brinkmanship. Britain is quietly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/uk-presses-us-to-ease-iran-sanctions-to-help-fight-coronavirus\" title=\"\">urging an easing of sanctions</a>. It is also reluctant to pursue Iran for breaching the 2015 deal, believing that a reimposition of UN sanctions could tip Tehran over the nuclear precipice.</p> <p>The US, then, is in a hole and should stop digging. Trump\u2019s campaign of coercion and ostracism has failed disastrously. His three-pronged aim was to ensure Iran could never acquire a nuclear weapon, to curb its ballistic missile capabilities, and to halt its \u201cdestabilising regional behaviour\u201d. It has backfired on all fronts.</p> <p>The UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reports Iran now has more than 1,000kg of enriched uranium, enough to make a single nuclear weapon if it so chose. As experts predicted, it has expanded production in direct response to Trump\u2019s aggression.</p> <p>Its back against the wall, Iran has continued to develop missile, drone and satellite guidance programmes capable of hitting Israel and US bases in the Middle East. These capabilities were on show when it struck US forces in Iraq in retaliation for Trump\u2019s illegal assassination in January of a top general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/making-of-a-martyr-how-qassem-suleimani-was-hunted-down\" title=\"\">Qassem Suleimani</a>.</p> <p>Regrettably Iran has shown no sign of changing its regional strategy. Its proxies remain actively engaged in the Syrian war. Its influence in Lebanon and Iraq remains strong, despite popular resentment in both countries.</p> <p>Yet analysts say desperation in Tehran, coupled with deep anger over US policy and Europe\u2019s inability to mitigate it, is so pervasive that the regime may soon decide to raise the stakes by quitting the NPT to increase its leverage, even at the risk of US and Israeli military retaliation.</p> <p>\u201cThe mainstream view in Iran until recently was that withdrawing from the NPT would bring further diplomatic isolation, lead to increased sanctions, and court a US military strike \u2026 Therefore, it would be counterproductive to Tehran\u2019s larger aspirations of regional leadership and reintegration into the international community,\u201d <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/16/will-iran-follow-north-korea-path-ditch-npt-nuclear-bomb/\" title=\"\">wrote Mahsa Rouhi</a> of London\u2019s International Institute for Strategic Studies.</p> <p>\u201cBut recent events have caused Tehran to re-evaluate those ambitions, as they seem increasingly far-fetched. In the past year, the prospect of withdrawing from the NPT has transformed from a fringe idea among hardliners in Iran into a real policy option.\u201d</p> <p>Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, warned recently that if the UN security council reimposed sanctions, as urged by the US, Iran would renounce both the nuclear deal and the NPT. Faced by an economy that shrank by 9.5% last year, violent anti-regime protests, unrelenting international isolation and a lethal public health emergency, many in Tehran calculate Iran has little left to lose.</p> <p>That\u2019s not true, of course \u2013 and Iran would be wise to hold back. At present, the regime is not actively seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, and it claims it never has. But few will believe it if it defies the IAEA\u2019s inspectors, breaks loose of remaining nuclear constraints, and continues to stockpile enriched uranium.</p> <p>Trump, seeking re-election at any cost, and Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s beleaguered prime minister, may just be desperate or stupid enough to start bombing. Iranians may believe things cannot get any worse. But they could.</p>",
  "<p>Our ability to collect and record information in a digital form has exploded as has our adoption of AI systems, which use data to make decisions. But data isn\u2019t neutral, and sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination are showing up in our data products. Catherine D\u2019Ignazio, an assistant professor of urban science and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), argues we need to do better. Along with Lauren Klein, who directs the Digital Humanities Lab at Emory University, she is the co-author of the new book <em><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism\">Data Feminism</a></em>, which charts a course for a more equitable data science. D\u2019Ignazio also directs MIT\u2019s new Data and Feminism lab, which seeks to use data and computation to counter oppression<em>.</em></p> <p><strong>What is data feminism and why do we need it?<br></strong>It is data science with an intersectional feminist lens. It takes all inequality into account at every stage of the data processing pipeline, including gender discrimination but also other forms of intersecting discrimination like racism, classism and ableism. And the reason we need it is to stop producing harmful racist and sexist data products.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We shouldn\u2019t be surprised about the sexist results coming out of these algorithms with the flawed data we are feeding in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>When you look at data and AI this way, what kind of problems do you find?<br></strong>We find some people are winning and some people are losing. The benefits and harms are not being equally distributed. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/13/ai-programs-exhibit-racist-and-sexist-biases-research-reveals\">those who are losing</a> are disproportionately women, people of colour, and other marginalised groups. One way they are losing is that data most of us would think is important isn\u2019t being collected. We have detailed datasets on things like the length of guinea pig teeth and items lost on the New York City subway. But, in the US, missing data includes maternal mortality data, which has only started being collected recently, and sexual harassment data. And so much of our health and medical understanding is based on research that has been done exclusively on the male body.</p> <p><strong>How do people with less privilege show up in datasets?<br></strong>We\u2019ve had facial analysis software that is much less accurate for dark-skinned women and algorithms that disadvantage female applicants. We\u2019ve also had child abuse prediction software that over-targets poor families and predictive policing software like PredPol that disproportionately targets neighbourhoods of colour. The former pulls data from state health and welfare services, which poor people are more likely to access, while the latter is based on historical crime data; only US policing practices have always disproportionately surveilled and patrolled neighbourhoods of colour. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised about the racist and sexist results coming out of these algorithms with the deeply flawed data we are feeding in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/25/healthcare-algorithm-racial-biases-optum\">Healthcare algorithm used across America has dramatic racial biases</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>If our data and algorithms are all so flawed, how do we change things to make them better?<br></strong>First we need to be tuning in to the ways that oppressive forces might be insidiously inserting themselves into the data pipeline. More understanding is particularly needed among the technical folks who are making these systems. It is rarely the case that the discrimination in products is intentional; it\u2019s just that nobody has ever taught them that it is a problem or emphasised that it is important. University data-science courses should include more than just a single ethics class.</p> <p>Then we have to actually use data and computation to challenge inequality. We have to collect counter-data. Take for example the comprehensive dataset on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/mexico-femicide-amlo-protests-strategy\">Mexico\u2019s femicides</a> \u2013 gender-related killings of women and girls \u2013 that has been compiled for the past five years from media reports by <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/how-one-woman-is-mapping-femicides-in-mexico/\">Mar\u00eda Salguero</a>, a citizen activist in that country. She is filling a vacuum because the Mexican government is not collecting the data. Now of course data alone is never enough. But if the data is used in concert with organising, lobbying and building political will, it can be very effective. In the US, we do have organisations working to call out injustice and produce their own counter-data, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/data4blacklives?lang=en\">Data for Black Lives</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ajlunited.org/\">Algorithmic Justice League</a> and <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/\">The Markup</a>. We need to fund more of this kind of work.</p> <p><strong>Is there </strong><strong>such thing as neutral data?<br></strong>There is a naive assumption that if you see numbers in a spreadsheet, they are real somehow. But data is never this raw, truthful input, and it is never neutral. It is information that has been collected in certain ways by certain actors and institutions for certain reasons. For example, there is a comprehensive database at the US federal level of sexual assaults on college campuses \u2013 colleges are required to report it. But whether students come forward to make those reports will depend on whether the college has a climate that will support survivors. Most colleges are not doing enough, and so we have vast underreporting of those crimes. It is not that data is evil or never useful, but the numbers should never be allowed to \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d because they don\u2019t tell the whole story when there are power imbalances in the collection environment.</p> <p><strong>Would data science\u2019s bias problems be solved if there were simply more data scientists, coders and computer programmers who were women or from minority backgrounds?<br></strong>More diversity is an important part of the solution. As a group, data scientists are more likely to be male, white and highly educated. They have never experienced sexism, racism or classism so it is hard for them to see it. We call this \u201cthe privilege hazard\u201d in the book and diversity can mitigate it.</p> <p>But only including more women or people of colour is not going to solve everything. We need to put communities who will be impacted by the information systems into the process of making them. Because inevitably designers and programmers are going to be building systems for life experiences that they haven\u2019t had. If everyone that builds a welfare application needs to have lived on welfare, that would be a high bar. Because I am a woman doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to understand how to build an application for domestic workers. But there are participation strategies from other fields like urban planning and how we incorporate those in data science is an area ripe for exploration.</p> <p><strong>In the book you talk about \u201cBig Dick Data\u201d. What is it and should we just reject it outright?<br></strong>We coined it to denote big data projects that are characterised by masculine fantasies of world domination. Big Dick Data projects fetishise large size and prioritise it, along with speed, over quality, ignore context and inflate their technical capabilities. They also tend to have little consideration for inequalities or inclusion in the process. Mark Zuckerberg aiming to supersede human senses with AI might be considered one such project, along with software company Palantir\u2019s claims about massive-scale datasets. Big Dick Data projects aren\u2019t necessarily wholly invalid, but they suck up resources that could be given smaller, more inclusive projects.</p> <p><strong>What would you most like people to think about or ask themselves when they encounter data or a graph in the media?<br></strong>A good general strategy and feminist practice is to ask what we call \u201cwho\u201d questions. Who made this? Who collected the data? Whose lives are embodied in the data? Who is it serving? Who is harmed potentially? Asking these questions allows us to start to see how privilege is baked in.</p> <p><strong>How is privilege being baked into the coronavirus data we are collecting?<br></strong>The US government\u2019s response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> has been a case of missing data. There has been community spread, but the numbers are completely unreliable because kits are in short supply and people are having a hard time getting tests. And then poor people, which include many from immigrant backgrounds, will be less likely to seek tests because of lack of insurance, lack of ability to afford insurance co-pays and lack of paid sick time if they test positive.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Data Feminism </em>by Catherine D\u2019Ignazio and Lauren F Klein is published by <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism\">MIT</a> (\u00a325)</p>",

However, for people experiencing domestic violence, social distancing means being trapped inside with an abuser. As more cities go under lockdown, activists are worried that attempts to curb the coronavirus will inadvertently lead to an increase in domestic violence.</p> <p>Domestic violence is already a deadly epidemic. One in three women around the world experience physical or sexual violence, mostly from an intimate partner, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/violence-against-women\">according to the World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/violence-against-women\">zation</a> (WHO). As the WHO notes: \u201cThis makes it the most widespread, but among the least reported human rights abuses.\u201d Gender-based violence tends to increase during humanitarian emergencies and conflicts; \u201cwomen\u2019s bodies too often become battlefields\u201d.</p> <p>Reports from China suggest the coronavirus has already caused a significant spike in domestic violence. Local police stations saw a threefold increase in cases reported in February compared with the previous year, according to Wan Fei, the founder of an anti-domestic violence not-forprofit. \u201cAccording to our statistics, 90% of the causes of violence are related to the Covid-19 epidemic,\u201d Wan <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005253/domestic-violence-cases-surge-during-covid-19-epidemic\">told Sixth Tone</a>, an English-language magazine based in China.</p> <p>A similar story is playing out in America. A <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2020/03/calls-to-oregons-domestic-violence-crisis-lines-spike-amid-coronavirus-crisis.html\">domestic violence hotline in Portland, Oregon</a>, says calls doubled last week. And the national domestic violence hotline is hearing from a growing number of callers whose abusers are using Covid-19 to further control and isolate them. \u201cPerpetrators are threatening to throw their victims out on the street so they get sick,\u201d the hotline\u2019s CEO <a href=\"https://time.com/5803887/coronavirus-domestic-violence-victims/\">told Time</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard of some withholding financial resources or medical assistance.\u201d</p> <p>With all attention focused on curbing a public health crisis, the problem of private violence risks being overlooked or deprioritized by authorities. In the UK, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/key-worker-official-list-of-uk-personnel-who-can-still-send-children-to-school\">schools are now closed</a> to everyone except for the children of key workers performing essential services. Domestic violence professionals have been left off this list; apparently preventing abuse at home isn\u2019t an essential service. Dawn Butler, Labour\u2019s women and equalities spokeswoman, has asked the prime minister to \u201curgently reconsider\u201d this classification and consider implementing emergency funding to help people in danger escape domestic abuse during the crisis. \u201c[T]wo women are killed every week by a partner or former partner,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DawnButlerBrent/status/1240997135073652736?s=20\">Butler tweeted</a>. \u201cIf the Govt fails to prepare and plan more people will die.\u201d</p> <p>Now more than ever we need to look out for the most vulnerable in our society; activists are <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-fears-of-domestic-violence-child-abuse-rise/a-52847759\">calling on neighbors</a> to be extra aware and vigilant of possible cases of domestic violence. Retreating into our homes doesn\u2019t mean cutting ourselves off from our communities. We\u2019re all in this together.</p> <h2>Harvey Weinstein begins his 23-year sentence</h2> <p>The convicted rapist was transferred to a maximum-security prison in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/harvey-weinstein-new-york-state-prison-maximum-s\">New York on Wednesday</a>.

On the basis of golf being limited, picking an entire quota of Ryder Cup players would become the ultimate captaincy test. Youth or experience? Captaincy instinct or feel?

The choices would be endless, the public \u2013 doubtless grasping every piece of sporting theatre they can catch sight of \u2013 captivated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/masters-golf-tournament-becomes-the-latest-event-to-be-postponed-augusta-coronavirus\">Autumn Masters in Augusta\u2019s sights after coronavirus forces postponement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harrington has spoken about the necessary balance between Ryder Cup veterans and debutants. \u201cWe won\u2019t be going in with 12 rookies,\u201d said the three-times major winner. \u201cBut you want a nice mixture because the rookies have really made it for Europe over the years. Those are the guys that come out and they shine. I\u2019m hoping for a nice balance on the team.\u201d</p> <p>Automatic qualifying can, in fact, skew the balance Harrington desires. So can the enhanced points that are available through the European Tour\u2019s Rolex Series, where routinely the continent\u2019s best golfers do not appear.</p> <p>Through horrible reality rather than design, the Ryder Cup has the power to deliver something both fresh and fascinating. It would also take the Ryder Cup back to its roots.</p> <p>In the early days, starting at Gleneagles in 1921, teams were entirely selected, initially by committee. Performance-based qualification emerged later, with the merging of the two concepts actually in place only since 1989.</p> <p>The alternatives are rather dreary. The US and Europe could, say, choose the highest placed players in the world rankings, with or without wildcards. Yet that system was officially \u201cpaused until further notice with professional golf currently inactive\u201d on Friday. Even if the Masters, US PGA Championship and even some of the other competitions on the PGA and European Tours are rescheduled to the point where the rankings could materially affect the Ryder Cup, there is the obvious chance of distortion. Applying world rankings without any major being played would also undermine any such policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f542f4001743b9ea4b94f31d46ce1159ea8c872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f542f4001743b9ea4b94f31d46ce1159ea8c872/295_636_4390_2635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Bj\u00f8rn lifts the Ryder Cup after Europe\u2019s victory at Le Golf National on 30 September 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Bj\u00f8rn lifts the Ryder Cup after Europe\u2019s victory at Le Golf National on 30 September 2018.

If a qualification process is butchered less than halfway through, or restarted at the last minute, it loses all validity.</p> <p>One caveat relates specifically to the European Tour, which has rules in place to essentially hold players to their home continent by featuring in a designated number of tournaments, thereby earning Ryder Cup eligibility. Otherwise, given the riches on offer, it is not inconceivable the leading lights would spend their entire schedules on the PGA Tour.</p> <p>Protection of the European Tour is admirable and Harrington is wise enough to acknowledge that, but in this case we are edging towards a position where player appearances are going to be so limited that they are irrelevant in discussion of the Ryder Cup.</p> <p>\u201cSeptember is a long way off,\u201d said Harrington. That\u2019s true, but it will not douse speculation. Having to hand-pick 12 players to control his Ryder Cup destiny would fill the Irishman\u2019s time. It would add sparkle to further engage an eager golfing public. Give Stricker and Harrington a dozen blank cards \u2013 let us see the purest form of captaincy.</p>",
  "<p>This story of high drama and tortured creativity in the art world opens in a decidedly muted fashion. Eve Laing, once the muse to a celebrated portrait painter, is at the height of her career as an artist, and is watching life as she knows it unravel. <em>Nightshade</em> follows her on one nocturnal walk from her former marital home in a privileged corner of west London to her studio in a deprived area of east London. As she walks, she muses on a past whose more interesting elements are subsumed by fairly standard life events. So far, so understated.</p> <p>The \u201cshow reel of memories\u201d forms a large part of a novel tracing Eve\u2019s often predictable history, from student days in London to life as a young artist in New York. Her lover, the notorious Florian Ki\u0161, immortalises her in his portrait Girl with a Flower, and yet she is obliged to hide in the bathroom listening to his other sexual conquests. Eventually, Eve shakes him off to pursue her own vision; the work that makes her name is Underground Florilegium, a tube map featuring flowers in place of stations.</p> <p>One of her New York room-mates is a performance artist named Wanda Wilson, a sort of British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/12/marina-abramovic-ready-to-die-serpentine-gallery-512-hours\" title=\"\">Marina Abramovi\u0107</a>, whose \u201cmasochistic enactments\u201d involve her own wounds, secretions and suppurating ego. While Eve\u2019s work is often dismissed as mimesis or decoration \u2013 she is called \u201cthe Laura Ashley of the art world\u201d \u2013 Wanda becomes a global celebrity, and, to Eve\u2019s mind, a fraud. Eve\u2019s jealousy infects her entire career as critics insist, she says, on \u201cbelittling her while canonising the megalomaniac mediocrity Wanda\u201d. Marriage and motherhood follow; Eve resents domesticity\u2019s demands on her working life, and suffers in the shadow of her successful husband.</p> <p>As we follow Eve through London, McAfee\u2019s eye is so tuned to the minutiae of place, generation and milieu that little escapes her gaze. A former journalist and children\u2019s writer, she is fabulously, uncomfortably observant, and her exhaustively researched immersion in her subjects \u2013 journalism in her first adult novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/24/spoiler-annalena-mcafee-clark-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Spoiler</em></a>, Scottish history in its successor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/11/hame-annalena-mcafee-review\" title=\"\"><em>Hame</em></a> \u2013 lends her work a sense of true authority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"661ef47b1800fa89b29164680c722dcbed6637a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/661ef47b1800fa89b29164680c722dcbed6637a3/90_140_3415_2456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The narrator\u2019s grand project, the Poison Florilegium, comprises meadow flower portraits featuring deadly plants, with accompanying watercolours.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The narrator\u2019s grand project, the Poison Florilegium, comprises meadow flower portraits featuring deadly plants, with accompanying watercolours.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the age of 60, the married Eve meets a 30-year-old called Luka who becomes both her lover and her assistant on the big project that obsesses her: the Poison Florilegium, Swiss meadow flower portraits subverted to feature the world\u2019s deadliest plants, composed as a series of seven vast panels with accompanying watercolours and herbaria. There is unease as the work progresses. Is Luka a soulful tyro or \u201ca dumb pretty boy with his eye on the main chance\u201d?</p> <p>McAfee has a tendency to structure novels as restrospectives on her protagonists\u2019 careers, doing for Eve what she did for war correspondent Honor Tait in <em>The Spoiler</em>. <em>Nightshade</em> is somewhat top heavy, and would work as a far shorter, leaner novel: the backstories are summarised with little momentum. The novel\u2019s action is reserved for its second half, when it suddenly accelerates from the static to the dramatic, with explosive clashes in the studio, old rivalries flaring up, and the challenges of producing a major work.</p> <p>Ironically, after \u201ctold\u201d sections whose interiority make the pace drag, it\u2019s the scenes in which we really are watching paint dry that crackle with tension and movement. The drama of creation, of impending triumph or failure, and the expert rendering of the artistic process, all lift the novel to a new level, compounded by uncertainty about whether Luka is plotting to take over.</p> <p>McAfee\u2019s prose is lyrical yet sharp, and her descriptions of both the method and the intricately researched work itself are superbly convincing. Eve is far from a sympathetic character, viewing her only daughter as \u201ca gluten-intolerant, humbug-tolerant liberal\u201d and \u201csocial media virtue signaller\u201d, but thematically, the novel fascinates. What is the cost of pursuing one\u2019s vision, especially for a woman? How random is fame? And is a rounded life even possible for a true artist? The author achieves the hard task of portraying a different art form with conviction, and stays just the right side of satire in her rendition of art world excess.</p> <p>Eventually, Eve\u2019s infidelities hit the tabloids and Twittersphere with inevitable consequences. Luka, it turns out, is not her first beautiful boy, and as Eve\u2019s life spirals into freefall, only one certainty remains: her determination, against so many odds, to complete the work that will be her legacy. The ending is simultaneously overdramatic and yet vastly satisfying.

We were in the Bere peninsula, a part of south-west Devon that is bypassed by many but which in spring, with flowers in abundance, amazing river views and enticing bird life, is a walker\u2019s paradise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8d3ac422bb05acafdeb15c02c34b1e1c8e9a320e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d3ac422bb05acafdeb15c02c34b1e1c8e9a320e/1_5_868_595/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tamar valley map\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The last time I had been in these parts was in 2003, when I was making a TV series about the river with Dartmoor photographer Chris Chapman, and he was my companion again today. The sky was clear as we set off from the station, initially heading north-west towards Calstock to join a public footpath through woodland down to the river that forms the border with Cornwall, the Tamar.</p> <p>The morning sun was warm on our backs as we crossed a meadow and a stream then rejoined the woodland. Ramsons, or wild garlic, wood anemone and primrose were in abundance alongside daffodils and violets. The plethora of colour was a clue to the history of these slopes. At one time these now-wooded valleys were carpeted with soft fruits and commercial daffodils, and dotted with orchards. From the mid-19th century, trees had been cleared by enterprising people to make room for market gardens that sent early fruits and flowers to Britain\u2019s towns and cities, an industry for which the peninsula became famous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bb638313d0053466c582c997d75d2894c85a992\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bb638313d0053466c582c997d75d2894c85a992/0_0_5200_3121/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Calstock Viaduct.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Calstock Viaduct.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Hill/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two forces had helped them. The steep sides of the Tamar Valley were perfect for growing soft fruit and flowers, and thanks to the tidal nature of the river, the area was almost immune to frosts. River barges brought manure and other detritus from the dockyards of Plymouth and Devonport \u2013 the \u201cdock dung\u201d that Jeremy had mentioned. This, spread on the slopes, proved highly nutritious for the bulbs and fruits, but the public health authorities were not so impressed. By 1920 dock dung had been banned, though as Jeremy said, you can still find all sorts of bits and pieces \u2013 glass, ceramic, shells, even marbles, relics of the dock dung days \u2013 scattered in the ground. As we walked, we picked up a fragment of blue-patterned porcelain and a chunk of old glass.</p> <p>If the valley provided the perfect environment for the market gardens, railways provided the means for the perishable stuff to get to market. In 1890, the London and South Western Railway opened a line from Waterloo to Plymouth that went via Bere Alston. Growers could get their perishable but sought-after products into London overnight and for generations they prospered.</p> <p>Then, on 6 May 1968, another historic railway decision, the wielding of Dr Beeching\u2019s axe, closed the line and pretty much killed the industry (leaving Bere Alston to be served by the Tamar Valley branch line only). Today there are only a handful of growers left. Many of the former gardens have reverted to nature, leaving a huge variety of daffodils to compete with the woodland for spring light. Luckily for us, the blooms succeed rather well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f22e6d6f83aac3f18594b3186aaf304859fcd0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f22e6d6f83aac3f18594b3186aaf304859fcd0e/0_72_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Looking towards Kit Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looking towards Kit Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Treesme/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We followed the path through the flowers to the river, where we marvelled at the wonderful piece of Edwardian civil engineering that is Calstock viaduct. Built between 1904 and 1907, it rises majestically 37 metres above the Tamar, carrying the railway across the river. The morning sun was perfect; the arches stood out against a brilliant sky above the slate grey of the river, so still it glided past us like silk. Water reeds swayed in the gentle breeze \u2013 a perfect spring morning.</p> <p>A permissive footpath enabled us to stay alongside the river for a mile or so then, as the path climbed across the valley, our view of the river changed. Behind us we looked back to the Cornish side, the Tamar nestled in its steep-sided valley. Kit Hill, with its decorated chimney, stood out on the horizon, a reminder of another industry that once dominated the area \u2013 silver and copper mining. In front of us the river veered south-west and slipped out of sight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f14fd1cbb8892a45c531bee01ec252ce748595f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f14fd1cbb8892a45c531bee01ec252ce748595f/0_127_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dock dung\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dock dung consists of manure and debris from more than a century ago swept up with it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Parker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We climbed over a couple of stiles and walked along the edge of a not-so-pretty site. The fields in front of us had the remains of a crop of maize. It\u2019s used as animal feed but makes a mess of the landscape: \u201csubsidised soil destruction\u201d is what the Soil Association calls it. We dropped down into more woodland and crossed another reed-filled stream emptying into the Tamar. Bright, diamond-like flashes of light played on the water as the rays of the sun pierced the leaf cover. Walking in these wet areas was easier than we imagined: there are plenty of boards across the streams so your boots stay dry. Then came the only steep climb on the walk \u2013 a heart-pumping 20 minutes.</p> <p>We crossed a road and a field, over yet another stile and into more woodland. And what a picture it was. There were daffodils everywhere, swaying gently in the breeze. Lit by shafts of sunlight streaming through the trees, they resembled performers on a stage. As we gazed at the scene in this steep woodland valley, we could only admire the ingenuity of the community that once cultivated it. They\u2019d had to design special tools to prepare, sow and harvest flowers on such treacherous slopes. Some had employed dynamite as well as axes and picks to clear the trees. And yet the speed with which nature had recolonised these formerly manicured gardens was perhaps even more impressive.</p> <p>There were once more than 100 daffodil varieties in the Tamar Valley, so it\u2019s worth coming with a <a href=\"http://www.tamarvalley.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Daff-ID-text-with-photos.pdf\" title=\"\">visual guide</a>. The season lasts up to five months, so you could see the impressive yellow trumpet, the emperor, the smaller and softer lent lily (one of Wordsworth\u2019s \u201chost of golden daffodils\u201d), or one of the whites, maybe the ice folly. But the daffodil that made the area famous, the perfectly formed Tamar double white, doesn\u2019t come out until late May. Dispatched to London wrapped in soft, blue tissue-lined boxes, it sealed the reputation of the peninsula as a producer of fine-quality flowers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e2bd2ecca89e4c12cb721848862bf6069698b5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e2bd2ecca89e4c12cb721848862bf6069698b5c/88_263_3944_2367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn over the Tamar at South Hooe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dawn over the Tamar at South Hooe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Parker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leaving the wood, we met the road at Weir Quay and were struck by just how dramatically the river had changed from the one we had seen 30 minutes before. It had become a wide, sweeping tidal flow. Grey mudflats stretched out in front of us. Cornwall now seemed an awfully long way away. What had happened here was climate change. The whole area had been transformed thousands of years ago when, at the end of the last ice age, melting ice and rising sea levels had drowned river valleys across south-west England, creating wide, shallow tidal estuaries or rias (coastal inlets) like the Tamar.</p> <p>We walked along the road out of Weir Quay as the tide was going out. Small dinghies, these days used just at weekends, looked desolate, marooned in the mud. The river was quiet but the ruins of a lime kiln and a steam-pumping engine house reminded us how busy it used to be. At one time, myriad sailing barges, designed especially for this river, brought in tons of limestone. It was burned in kilns dotted along the quays to produce lime used to \u201csweeten\u201d the fields and improve crop yields. The same boats took away thousands of tons of locally mined copper and silver ore and loaded at the quays we had passed on the walk. Looking at this stunning but deserted landscape, it was hard to believe that in the 19th century the Tamar had been one of the busiest rivers in the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d34f56658b1f4acb2c25b4cfc95994678dfcba9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d34f56658b1f4acb2c25b4cfc95994678dfcba9/0_501_1504_902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daffodils in the Tamar Valley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Today this stretch is a good place to spot wading birds, so we rested a while on a bench, binoculars at the ready. We were not disappointed. We saw a couple of pairs of shelducks and a solitary little egret feeding in the shallows. We heard the distinctive call of the oystercatcher. A cormorant flew upstream while redshanks, with their bright orange legs and bills, busied themselves probing the mud for molluscs and small crustaceans. Then we spotted the black-and-white markings and curled beaks of a small colony of avocets, backlit by the afternoon sun. I now saw what Trish had meant when she said we\u2019d have to wait till lunchtime for the avocets. They feed on the mudflats as the tide empties the river. We\u2019d got there just in time.</p> <p>It was lunchtime for us, too, so we pressed on, following the road as it twisted and turned up the hill past what used to be Clamoak Farm, where the double white was first cultivated in the 1880s by a farmer called Septimus Jackson. (Surely there should be a plaque?) As we dropped into another creek, we followed the watercourse and a dammed pond, pretty much overgrown with alder and willow but with water lilies bursting through. There were more waders as the creek found its way through the reed beds to join the river. We made a sharp turn to the left, walked up the hill, looking back at slow-moving water for one final lingering moment, then through a couple of gates and into Bere Ferrers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66c7e195206a0a7f819398ffc8e7997fbe98d6ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66c7e195206a0a7f819398ffc8e7997fbe98d6ba/0_228_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tamar Valley Tamar River\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It was hard to believe that in the 19th century the River Tamar had been one of the busiest rivers in the country\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Parker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the way to the pub we passed the village hall and on the other side of the road called in on the village hairdresser Margaret Willmott, great-granddaughter of Septimus Jackson, who told us about her family\u2019s involvement in the market gardening.

His first game back in the stands was against Liverpool six months later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78cee9cc85c896601429bbd06deaf54b05180573\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78cee9cc85c896601429bbd06deaf54b05180573/0_120_1815_1131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Southampton\u2019s FA Cup final defeat by Arsenal in 2003\" width=\"1000\" height=\"623\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Southampton\u2019s FA Cup final defeat by Arsenal in 2003 is among the games attended by Steve and Dan Jarvis away from the Dell or St Mary\u2019s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was just pleased to be there,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what was going on but the fact I was back, back at the beloved Dell, the game didn\u2019t matter too much. It was the fact that I was back in the crowd, able to perform as a fan again. Matt Le Tissier started playing in \u201986 and, of course, I didn\u2019t see any of those goals he scored but just the description on the radio or the telly, the description of how he scored, it makes you think: \u2018Wow, he is something else.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cPeople said to me: \u2018You won\u2019t go to football again because you can\u2019t see it.\u2019 I said: \u2018No way, I\u2019ll be back there.\u2019 I said: \u2018I want to be there, supporting the team, in with the crowd making noise,\u2019 and, fortunately, that\u2019s what I do. With the audio description, I know what\u2019s going on in the game. It\u2019s almost like I can see the game. The audio description gives me that direct view of what\u2019s going on.</p> <p>\u201cI guess sometimes I think I can see the game better than someone who can see it, because I\u2019ll be stood up in my seat with my headphones on, whereas other people are trying to lean over saying: \u2018What\u2019s going on over there?\u2019 and so on, and I\u2019ve got it at the touch of a button,\u201d he says, smiling.</p> <p>For years Steve listened to local radio or Dan\u2019s dulcet tones, with his son channelling John Motson to provide his father with a running commentary, but audio description technology has helped enhance the match-day experience since the service was introduced at Southampton two years ago. That service has, for the most part, relieved Dan of his duties, though he is occasionally called into action. \u201cEarlier this season we went up to Macclesfield and they didn\u2019t have radios, so I did it from the first minute to the last. Other fans are thinking: \u2018What\u2019s this guy babbling on about?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Football has helped erase Steve\u2019s frustration \u2013 \u201cI couldn\u2019t really take part as a father and say: \u2018Come on, you\u2019re coming fishing or we\u2019re going out to play football\u2019\u201d \u2013 and his perseverance is striking. \u201cI do look up to him,\u201d Dan says, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve always thought when I have down days or get annoyed: \u2018Well, Dad has all the reason in the world to be despondent and give up but he doesn\u2019t, therefore I haven\u2019t really got an excuse.\u2019\u201d Steve looks immensely proud. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear that, because that makes me feel good and I think at least I\u2019m helping and giving you a perspective of life,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Dan has made it his mission to spread the word and has emailed every club in the country\u2019s top four divisions to raise awareness of their charity groundhopping challenge. The day before this interview Dan received a Nottingham Forest signed shirt to auction; Manchester City, Mansfield, Liverpool and Rochdale have followed suit, while West Brom have donated a signed ball. </p> <p>Steve spent six months in the army at Harrogate, and the money raised is being split between <a href=\"https://www.blindveterans.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7sD9t8qm6AIVRrDtCh24wgdUEAAYASAAEgJkK_D_BwE\">Blind Veterans</a>, whose centre in Brighton he has regularly visited, and <a href=\"https://www.bluecross.org.uk/donate?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2p6Ymsqm6AIVCbrtCh08IAoQEAAYASAAEgLxsPD_BwE\">The Blue Cross</a>, from where they got Skai, a French bulldog, last May.</p> <p>Since their first game together they have shared no end of special moments.

  "<p>Donald Trump has thrown an extraordinary temper tantrum on live television, lambasting a reporter who challenged him for raising hopes about a coronavirus treatment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/us-military-trump-coronavirus-pandemic-new-york\">States ask Trump to deploy military to help fight coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Peter Alexander, White House correspondent at NBC News, asked the US president: \u201cWhat do you say to Americans, who are watching you right now, who are scared?\u201d</p> \n<p>Erupting in anger, Trump unleashed a tirade: \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter. That\u2019s what I say. I think it\u2019s a very nasty question and I think it\u2019s a very bad signal that you\u2019re putting out to the American people.\u201d</p> \n<p>The outburst came at Friday\u2019s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, at which Trump announced a restriction on non-essential travel across the US-Mexico border as well as stricter controls on undocumented migrants.</p> \n<p>The president \u2013 who repeatedly downplayed the threat early in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/us-military-trump-coronavirus-pandemic-new-york\">the global outbreak</a> \u2013 has this week been hyping an anti-malarial drug, chloroquine, as a possible therapeutic treatment.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt may work, it may not work,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cI feel good about it. It\u2019s just a feeling. I\u2019m a smart guy \u2026 We have nothing to lose. You know the expression, \u2018What the hell do you have to lose?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>This was originally his campaign pitch to African Americans.</p> \n<p>Yet Trump\u2019s \u201cfeeling\u201d, on which he so often relies, was confronted by science when Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned that evidence of chloroquine\u2019s benefits against coronavirus is \u201canecdotal\u201d and it should not be viewed as a miracle cure.</p> \n<p>\u201cFundamentally, I think it probably is going to be safe, but I like to prove things first,\u201d Fauci said.</p> \n<p>Alexander asked the president: \u201cIs it possible that your impulse to put a positive spin on things may be giving Americans a false sense of hope?\u201d</p> \n<p>The president retorted: \u201cNo I don\u2019t think so \u2026 It may work, it may not work. I feel good about it. That\u2019s all it is, it\u2019s a feeling.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was then Alexander asked for Trump\u2019s message to people who are feeling scared and the president snapped: \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cYou\u2019re doing sensationalism \u2026 That\u2019s really bad reporting. You ought to get back to reporting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump claimed, \u201cI\u2019ve been right a lot,\u201d and barked at Alexander: \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other correspondents asked Trump why he was assailing a reporter during a national crisis.</p> \n<p>Trump replied: \u201cI think Peter is \u2013 you know, I\u2019ve dealt with Peter for a long time. And I think Peter is not a good journalist when it comes to fairness. This is the time to come together. But coming together is much harder when we have dishonest journalists.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, was asked what message such criticism sends to the rest of the world. He merely echoed his boss\u2019s dissatisfaction with the media. He also joined Trump in using the phrase \u201cChinese virus\u201d.</p> \n<p>Introducing Pompeo, Trump referred to \u201cthe deep state department\u201d, referring to a favourite conspiracy theory which holds that a network of bureaucrats and intelligence officials exists to frustrate the president\u2019s agenda, but which Steve Bannon, who has promoted the theory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/03/trump-steve-bannon-deep-state-conspiracy-theory\">has said is for \u201cnut cases\u201d</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Walldo/status/1241044023445524481\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Note Fauci\u2019s reaction when Trump makes a deep state joke at the podium <a href=\"https://t.co/cbNBxgqhRO\">pic.twitter.com/cbNBxgqhRO</a></p>\u2014 Brandon Wall (@Walldo) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Walldo/status/1241044023445524481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 20, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>On the podium, Dr Fauci glanced at the president, smiled ruefully, brushed his brow and rubbed his jaw in thought.</p> \n<p>Adding to the strange atmosphere, Sean Spicer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/sean-spicer\">the former White House press secretary</a>, was sitting in the briefing room in a seat normally occupied by the Guardian and asked a couple of questions. Trump\u2019s daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka, was also looking on after testing negative for the virus.</p> \n<p>Pompeo spoke about the new restrictions on the US-Mexico border, which follows a similar agreement with Canada. He said of Mexico: \u201cBoth our countries know the importance of working together to limit the spread of the virus and ensuring the commerce that supports our economy continues to keep flowing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The US, Mexico and Canada have agreed that anyone who tries to illegally cross a border will immediately be returned to their native country.</p> \n<p>Officials said asylum seekers would not be held in a US facility nor be given due process, because of the health risk to other migrants and border patrol agents. They would instead be returned to Canada, Mexico or their country of origin.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bcf737be-dc2b-4e07-8387-7f74421638ed\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LtYAp4OFRSY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump, who has long touted a border wall, said: \u201cEvery week our border agents encounter thousands of unscreened, unvetted and unauthorised entries from dozens of countries.

But now with the national emergencies and all of the other things that we\u2019ve declared, we can actually do something about it.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking a very strong hold of that. We have before but this is now at a level that nobody\u2019s ever approached. In normal times these massive flows place a vast burden on our healthcare system but, during a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants and the public at large.\u201d</p> \n<p>Amid some confusion, the president confirmed that he had put the Defense Production Act \u201cinto gear\u201d, to mandate the production of masks and ventilators.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have millions of masks which are coming and which will be distributed to the states,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 They will be here soon. We\u2019re having them shipped directly to states.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also announced a waive on all interest on federal-held student loans \u2013 which he said would \u201cmake a lot of students very happy\u201d \u2013 and noted that the US treasury had postponed the tax filing date to 15 July.</p>",

Because the ship had only travelled between Sydney and New Zealand, it was deemed a low risk of people carrying the virus.

But Banks really was one \u2013 and back in the 1990s, too, when the term had actual heft. Hell, she was even in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ2DVwSVIIo\" title=\"\">George Michael\u2019s Too Funky video</a>, alongside Linda Evangelista and Nadja Auermann, and you can\u2019t get more supermodel (or 1990s) than that. She had a long contract with Victoria\u2019s Secret and was, most famously, the first black woman to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated\u2019s Swimsuit Issue and GQ. But Banks never saw any of that as the end goal.</p> <p>\u201cPlan for the end at the beginning,\u201d she tells me, solemnly. (Banks often talks in platitudes on America\u2019s Next Top Model \u2013 \u201cNever dull your shine for someone else\u201d; \u201cYour flaws are awesome: that\u2019s why they\u2019re flawsome\u201d \u2013 and this is no mere onscreen shtick.) She learned this particular slogan from her mother, Carolyn London. London, who accompanied her then teenage daughter on most of her fashion jobs, would point to the other models and say, \u201cLook around. Where\u2019s so-and-so? She was hot everywhere last year, and now? No one cares about her. That\u2019s gonna be you one day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I would think, oh my God, that\u2019s so evil!\u201d says Banks. \u201cBut then I started to book less and less fashion shows and she\u2019d say, \u2018You see? But it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s your product, and now they\u2019re looking for a different product. So you can either figure out how to strategise and improve, or you can become a new product.\u2019\u201d (Perhaps the reason the rest of us don\u2019t have $90m in the bank, as Banks allegedly does, is because our mothers never taught us to strategise our product when we were young.)</p> <p>Banks strategised and lifted herself out of the cul-de-sac of modelling and on to the expansive global stage of celebrity, via the medium of TV. She hosted her own chatshow, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437758/\" title=\"\">The Tyra Banks Show</a> (five seasons, six Emmys, from 2005 to 2010), which sparked endless \u201cThe Next Oprah\u201d headlines. And, of course, she made America\u2019s Next Top Model (24 seasons and counting), the talent contest which she coined, produces and hosts, and which introduced the world to modelling tricks such as \u201csmize\u201d (smile with just your eyes) and \u201cbooty tooch\u201d (sticking your butt out). There was also an extremely brief pop career, which Banks describes, not entirely incorrectly, as \u201ca hot mess\u2026 I realised my gift was not my singing voice, but my talking voice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd0b5ec76466fa5793278a7f9638995e4ca4b357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd0b5ec76466fa5793278a7f9638995e4ca4b357/0_725_5778_5711/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks with young model Scout Kingston,  photographed in Los Angeles, CA, Feb 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"988\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyra Banks wears <a href=\"https://www.houseofcb.com/\">House of CB</a> top, Vex skirt, <a href=\"https://www.sararose.shop/\">Sara Rose</a> mask and (top) <a href=\"https://www.balenciaga.com/gb#/women\">Balenciaga</a> outfit.

But some have pointed out that it hasn\u2019t, actually, produced any top models. Banks dismisses this, insisting that many former contestants are now appearing in fashion shows and, anyway, her \u201cgirls\u201d have had to overcome the industry\u2019s initial snobbery against reality TV. \u201cSo thank God for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kendall-jenner\" title=\"\">Kendall Jenner</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gigi-hadid\" title=\"\">Gigi Hadid</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/bella-hadid\" title=\"\">Bella Hadid</a>, and all the other girls who came from reality television shows, because they\u2019ve now made it OK,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As with Heidi Klum \u2013 another model turned omnipresent TV star and judge of America\u2019s Got Talent \u2013 there is now a generation that has known Banks only as a TV celebrity, and that delights her: \u201cThank God they know me as more than just being a mannequin,\u201d she grins. But <a href=\"https://tyra.com/modelland/\" title=\"\">ModelLand</a>, her latest venture \u2013 currently on hold until the Covid-19 crisis has passed \u2013 is what she hopes will be her real legacy. \u201cI look at Walt Disney and what he\u2019s done with Disneyland and how it continues for ever and ever. And the next person like that is JK Rowling, what she\u2019s done in creating the Potter universe. I want that with ModelLand,\u201d Banks says solemnly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My objective is for people to come and their jaw to drop and say, \u2018Tyra has lost her goddamn mind. This bitch is crazy!'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She has been planning <a href=\"https://www.model-land.com/\" title=\"\">ModelLand</a>, which takes its name from the title of her decidedly weird 2011 young adult sci-fi-ish novel, for almost a decade. Reviewing the book for the feminist magazine <a href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/\" title=\"\">Bitch</a>, Ann-Derrick Gaillot wrote, \u201cThis book promotes self-esteem and confidence in girls, [but] it is less than empowering since it is all to a depressing consumerist end.\u201d Undaunted by the negative reviews, Banks has used the book as inspiration for what she is determined will be her greatest achievement, even if nobody else really understands what it is. Her explanations in previous interviews haven\u2019t helped: \u201cFrom the beginning, I wanted ModelLand to go beyond just a place to go to, but to be a place to feel emotion,\u201d she told Variety last year, prompting <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/tyra-banks-to-launch-modelland-whatever-the-hell-that-1832355423\" title=\"\">feminist website jezebel.com</a> to run a piece headlined \u201cTyra Banks to Launch ModelLand, Whatever the Hell That Means\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to give it away,\u201d she smiles now.</p> <p>Sure, but can she give some details?</p> <p>\u201cModelLand is kind of like Harry Potter meets America\u2019s Next Top Model meets Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory meets Disney \u2013 and you know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman\" title=\"\">Black Panther</a>?\u201d she begins, and continues to talk about ModelLand without pause for \u2013 no exaggeration \u2013 14 minutes. Reader, I desperately tried to follow it, but you try making sense of sentences like, \u201cSo it\u2019s an alternate universe called Ozonia, which is comprised of six different provinces, and each province is demarcated by different weather, and each of them makes the fashion and beauty of the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11b96df5d105dfb3bcb482ddf10396ff5917612b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b96df5d105dfb3bcb482ddf10396ff5917612b/764_217_979_858/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks with her Mother backstage before the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show 2002\" width=\"500\" height=\"438\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her mother in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Agostini/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Banks has long been an outspoken campaigner against the fashion industry\u2019s narrow idea of beauty, but at the point when she started to talk about \u201cthe uprise\u201d in ModelLand against fashion\u2019s tyranny, specifying that it was capitalised \u201cUpRiSe\u201d, I started to tune out. \u201cMy objective for ModelLand is for people to come in and their jaw to drop, and say, \u2018Tyra has lost her goddamn mind. This bitch is crazy!\u2019\u201d she concludes triumphantly.</p> <p>Beyond the bonkers storyline, ModelLand sounds like a giant mall (\u201can elevated integrated shopping experience,\u201d as Banks puts it) in Santa Monica, where people can live the modelling fantasy via personalised makeovers, fancy photoshoots and fashion shows. The intention, she says, is to teach people that the fashion industry wants \u201cto make us feel insecure and buy products, so it\u2019s really an economy type of thing\u201d. ModelLand, by contrast, celebrates all kinds of beauty: \u201cYou may be 50 years old, you may have cellulite, you may have a big forehead or you may have freckles all over your face. We will show that you can smize and you can slay that runway,\u201d she says. You won\u2019t, she says earnestly, be forced to buy any products the ModelLand team then recommends for your cellulite and freckles. \u201cBut if you do, it will heighten the experience.\u201d</p> <p>Well, I\u2019m sure ModelLand will shift some mascaras. But how about, instead of arguing that the industry should expand its beauty standards, which is never going to happen, Banks told girls that how they look isn\u2019t important? \u201cBut it is important, 100%,\u201d she interrupts before I finish. \u201cLike, right now, I\u2019m looking at things about you that my eyes are just naturally attracted to. I\u2019m looking at your hair, it\u2019s parted on the side, and it\u2019s beautiful because you have a high, square-shape forehead. There\u2019s a reason you chose that dress because you want to look in the mirror and say, \u2018You know what, this dress makes me feel nice.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Actually, I chose it because I can\u2019t be bothered to lose my postpartum weight and this is one of the few dresses that fit, I say. \u201cBut you still chose that dress over another one,\u201d she says. \u201cI teach personal branding at Stanford, and one of the things I do with my students is I redo their LinkedIn photo, because research shows that certain things in that photo get you that interview. We say these things don\u2019t matter, but a lot of research shows that it does.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fb35c0fec1746dfe419f7390559ea5c29d7bd205\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb35c0fec1746dfe419f7390559ea5c29d7bd205/0_116_1324_1801/735.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks on location for America\u2019s Next Top Model in 2003\" width=\"735\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">America\u2019s Next Top Model: on location\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CW Network/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3cf47fc62962dffa66f06a9b240042f02274c690\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cf47fc62962dffa66f06a9b240042f02274c690/173_186_1475_1611/916.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks with judge Nigel Barker on America\u2019s Next Top Model in 2003\" width=\"916\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">with judge Nigel Barker\u2026<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Yarish/Cw Network/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cb7d99d2487416b518a191c3f1ab2ecdf862e854\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb7d99d2487416b518a191c3f1ab2ecdf862e854/219_244_692_1469/471.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks with a contestant on America\u2019s Next Top Model in 2003\" width=\"471\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">and with a contestant, all 2003.

When she was a couture model she was told she was too curvy and needed to lose 20lbs; instead, she took the lucrative route of becoming a Victoria\u2019s Secret model. When a tabloid published unflattering photos of her in a swimsuit in 2007, she appeared on her chatshow in the suit and, to the delight of her audience, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mOQh3evqsI\" title=\"\">told her critics to \u201ckiss my fat ass\u201d</a>. Today she brings up, apropos of nothing, that she has put on 30lbs from the stress of working on ModelLand.</p> <p>\u201cI can hide it, because my neck is small, and my wrists and ankles are small. But I have some rolls on my back now \u2013 I\u2019m not used to that. And my ankles are hurting because I\u2019m carrying too much weight for my bones. Plus, I got grey hairs popping up under this wig. And look, I got my first wrinkle,\u201d she says, leaning across the table and scrunching up her face to produce one, barely visible, line at the top of her nose. Similarly, Banks talks about how \u201ccurvy\u201d she was as a model, when the truth is she was always incredibly thin: such chat might tick the \u201crelatable\u201d box, but it\u2019s a pretty relative field.</p> <p>How do these recent physical changes feel, given she has always made her livelihood from her looks? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me unhappy, but it makes me feel like I need to deal [with the weight] before I get unhealthy,\u201d she says.</p> <p>And is she reaching for the Botox to sort out her nonexistent wrinkle?</p> <p>\u201cNot yet! But you know, I haven\u2019t cracked a lot yet, so ask me again when it cracks.\u201d</p> <p>She has recently returned to modelling because she \u201cfelt like a hypocrite\u201d for having retired from Victoria\u2019s Secret in 2005. \u201cI wanted to leave before they kicked me out because of my age,\u201d she says (she was 32). \u201cBut now that I\u2019m older than ever, and thicker than ever, and I\u2019m saying beauty knows no age and size, I wanted to put my money where my mouth is.\u201d</p> <p>Banks talks proudly of her association with Victoria\u2019s Secret. \u201cThey never told me to lose weight,\u201d she says, describing it as a company that \u201chelps women feel more beautiful\u201d. And yet for years the brand was best known for its annual fashion show in which supermodels \u2013 including Banks \u2013 walked in their underwear down the runway to the delight of male celebrities in the audience, including the predictable likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Bieber and Adam Levine. Banks says she found it \u201cempowering\u201d: \u201cMy ass was thicker [than other models\u2019] and I was the only black model [in the show], so I knew what that meant to my community and the world as a whole. So I had a whole different thing going on,\u201d she says.</p> <p>These days, the brand is very much on a downward trajectory, not helped by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/business/victorias-secret-razek-harassment.html\" title=\"\">reports </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/business/victorias-secret-razek-harassment.html\" title=\"\">that models were being sexually harassed</a> by former executive Ed Razek. Razek denies the allegations, but had already drawn fire after a <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/victorias-secret-ed-razek-monica-mitro-interview\" title=\"\">Vogue 2018 interview</a>, in which he said he wouldn\u2019t include plus-size or transgender models in Victoria\u2019s Secret campaigns. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ddc3ae17406a9f21a93067154ee0c47cf93fae35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddc3ae17406a9f21a93067154ee0c47cf93fae35/0_668_5778_3467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks photographed in Los Angeles, CA, Feb 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Modelling can still be a stepping stone for everybody.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Rozzi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt makes me sad,\u201d Banks says now. \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret don\u2019t pay me any more, but I still feel an affinity to the company. The model I was back then could not work for them now, because [they would say] I was too thick [fat],\u201d she says, implying that Victoria\u2019s Secret has changed, when the truth is it hasn\u2019t, and the times have. Surely, I say, she must have seen the 2017 shows in which <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a13880726/victorias-secret-cultural-appropriation-native-american/\" title=\"\">the models wore</a><a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a13880726/victorias-secret-cultural-appropriation-native-american/\" title=\"\"> Native American headdresses</a>?</p> <p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t seen the shows lately,\u201d she interrupts firmly. \u201cBut I think [the company] will change because they have to, and that will help a lot of people feel more accepted.\u201d</p> <p>With the launch of America\u2019s Next Top Model in 2003, and again with ModelLand, Banks has been bringing the model experience to the masses, promising that anyone \u2013 even those of us with high, square-shaped foreheads \u2013 can be a model, if only in Banks\u2019s world. Although this has been very lucrative for her, it\u2019s never made much sense to me: Banks knows better than anyone that it\u2019s absurd for modelling to be seen as the supreme goal for women \u2013 after all, she used it as a stepping stone to something bigger (and better). \u201cIt can still be a stepping stone for everybody,\u201d she insists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"159ffb7b1c503cad94e286b6f3109c00f8d75bb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/159ffb7b1c503cad94e286b6f3109c00f8d75bb9/0_0_3857_4443/868.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks walks the runway at the Yves Saint Laurent Ready to Wear Fall/Winter 1992-1993 fashion show during the Paris Fashion Week in March, 1992 in Paris, France.\" width=\"868\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Modelling for Yves Saint Laurent in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Virgile/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But ModelLand and Top Model pitch the job as a form of ultimate validation, I say.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a realist, and I\u2019m not going to sit here and lie, and say that a young girl doesn\u2019t want to look in that mirror and feel good,\u201d she says, which is of course true, but it is also different from saying they should aspire to be a model. After all, empowering Victoria\u2019s Secret shows aside, Banks didn\u2019t have that great a time when she was a model.</p> <p>She started when she was 15, a skinny African American girl from a broken home, and was soon booked to walk for the highest of high fashion shows: Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Christian Dior. \u201cBack then I was very shy and all \u2018Thank you, OK.\u2019 I was a bit intimidated by the [fashion] world, where everything seemed very over-the-top and not based on truth. I thought, everyone\u2019s so fabulous, and I\u2019m just a girl from Inglewood, California,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Although she got jobs easily in Europe, US agencies and casting directors would look at her and say, \u201cWe already have a black girl.\u201d This attitude led to what is still one of the most notorious feuds in fashion. When Banks was starting out, she was often pitched as \u201cthe next Naomi Campbell\u201d, much to Campbell\u2019s displeasure: the British supermodel allegedly had Banks fired from shows and photo shoots. Banks eventually left the high fashion world, partly because of the weight issue, but also out of a desire to get away from this weird Mean Girls environment. In 2005, she somehow convinced Campbell to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=516JwxaFVy4\" title=\"\">appear on her talkshow</a> and the result was one of the most extraordinary onscreen encounters since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/19/feud-bette-and-joan-tv-drama-hollywood-sexism-in-spotlight\" title=\"\">Bette Davis squared up to Joan Crawford</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI was tired of having to deal with you.

It\u2019s funny, Naomi hasn\u2019t done anything bad to me, and that other stuff was decades and decades ago. But it was just such a painful time, it really did something to me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I tell her she seemed incredibly composed in the interview, given she was confronting someone who has since been convicted of assault four times.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, the most nervous shows I\u2019ve ever done have been interviewing all the presidential candidates, and interviewing her,\u201d Banks says.</p> <p>I ask if she ever watched The Face, the shortlived modelling show which Campbell hosted.

Instead of being an untouchable fashion queen like Campbell, she\u2019s the goofy, overemotional friend. Top Model\u2019s most iconic (and memed) moment came in 2005, when Banks <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Shpn5WCFs\" title=\"\">lost her temper with contestant Tiffany Richardson</a>, because she felt Richardson hadn\u2019t tried hard enough, and wasn\u2019t upset enough when she was dropped from the show. \u201cI was rooting for you, we were all rooting for you, how dare you?!\u201d Banks screamed at the bemused teenager.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fdaf147f45e5247f48499436f7bd0b3002fac52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fdaf147f45e5247f48499436f7bd0b3002fac52/0_113_2445_2441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks and Naomi Campbell at the 10th Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show, in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"998\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Naomi Campbell at the Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show in New York in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I tell Banks that my friend Joe thinks Top Model is more camp than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/rupaul-s-drag-race-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\">RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race</a>, which is itself a kind of drag version of Banks\u2019s show.</p> <p>\u201cOh yes, we\u2019re very campy, that\u2019s deliberate. So thank you, Joe! Look, fashion can feel intimidating, so if you were to play it straight it wouldn\u2019t drive millions of people to watch it.\u201d</p> <p>So when she shouted at Richardson, was that her camping it up? She recoils in shock at the idea. \u201cOh, <em>hell</em> no. Camp is me fake fainting or jumping up and down, or talking about my weaves. But moments like that, I tap into pain, and that pain is real.\u201d</p> <p>In her encounter with Richardson, it was clear that what infuriated Banks was the thought that a working-class black girl was throwing away an amazing opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I was thinking about Tiffany earlier today, and yeah, I felt a personal connection to her. But it was also hearing her say, \u2018I\u2019m just not smart enough,\u2019 and then she brought race into it [as a reason for why she was dropped from the show]. I had to tell her and every girl in the room, \u2018It\u2019s not because you\u2019re black.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The fear of wasting opportunities is still what drives Banks today. Instead of slogging her guts out over this mall \u2013 I mean \u201celevated shopping experience\u201d \u2013 she could have married a rich man<strong> </strong>and spent her days shopping in Beverly Hills. \u201cOh my God, that is hell,\u201d she says. \u201cI see some models and it\u2019s like they cashed in their career. That\u2019s like selling your soul, to be with somebody because they have money. You can\u2019t be happy,\u201d she says in a doomy whisper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"12245c61822e917709d5792583e6033b1f00477f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12245c61822e917709d5792583e6033b1f00477f/262_210_2119_1723/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tyra Banks and boyfriend Erik Asla out and about, Los Angeles, America - 07 Feb 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"813\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With partner Erik Asla in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Banks and her long-term partner, the Norwegian photographer Erik Asla, had their son, York, by surrogacy four years ago. There were media reports that she and Asla broke up soon afterwards, but on these subjects \u2013 her relationship and her child \u2013 Banks slams shut like a clam. \u201cI\u2019m very protective of my personal life. So if you look at my social media, you don\u2019t see my child. I know my followers would quadruple if I posted pictures of him, but I don\u2019t want to use my child for my career,\u201d she says. She won\u2019t even confirm where she lives, shaking her head with sealed shut lips. And in that moment, the wacky, over-the-top goofball suddenly looks like a very cautious and thoughtful operator.</p> <p>Banks is a likable and shrewd woman, and it would take a gambler with stronger nerves than me to bet against her. Given that she is planning to start shooting her 25th season of America\u2019s Next Top Model, maybe ModelLand really will be, as she solemnly says, \u201cmy Steamboat Willie\u201d, the early Mickey Mouse cartoon that launched Disney\u2019s kingdom.

  "<p>As the Trump administration and lawmakers in Washington debate cash payments to support Americans during the coronavirus crisis, the mayor of one California city that has experimented with universal basic income has advice.</p> <p>Early findings from Stockton, California, which launched a basic income experiment last year, may offer American policymakers some reassurance \u2013 and a few notes of caution.</p> <p>It\u2019s \u201cheartening\u201d to see a national focus on providing direct cash assistance, said Michael Tubbs, Stockon\u2019s 29-year-old mayor, who championed the city\u2019s basic income experiment. But some choices in the current Republican plan make little sense to him, Tubbs said. \u201cIf someone was struggling more than others before a crisis, why should they get less help during a crisis that is going to hit them harder? It defies logic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, proposed legislation to give middle-income Americans a single, $1,200 payout for each adult, plus $500 for each child in a family. The payments decrease for Americans who earn more than $75,000 a year, and individuals who make more than $99,000 will get nothing. The lowest-income Americans also get less: the plan includes a smaller, $600 payment to adults in some of America\u2019s poorest families. Democratic lawmakers are calling for Americans to receive larger, recurring cash payments, with at least one plan calling for <a href=\"https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-reps-ryan-khanna-propose-cash-infusion-between-1000-6000-help-working\">a monthly check</a> of between $1,000 and $6,000.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to make sure that the most marginalized, the most impacted, the folks who were struggling the most before this pandemic get help</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have to make sure that the most marginalized, the most impacted, the folks who were struggling the most before this global pandemic get help and relief,\u201d Tubbs said.</p> <p>Stockton launched its guaranteed income experiment, the first in modern US history, in 2019. Since that February, 125 local residents in the economically challenged city have received $500 a month to spend on whatever they choose.</p> <p>The idea of providing a universal basic income to citizens is not new, but it has found new supporters in recent years, as some tech industry leaders have embraced \u201cUBI\u201d as a possible response to rising inequality and a growing number of American jobs lost to automation. The Facebook co-founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/20/america-guaranteed-income-chris-hughes\">Chris Hughes</a> is among the proponents of the policy; the Economic Security Project, which he co-chairs, is helping fund basic income experiments in Stockton and elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/andrew-yang-coronavirus-universal-basic-income-interview\">'$1,000 per person should be the baseline': Andrew Yang on direct payments during coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early data from the Stockton experiment is promising, according to the two researchers who are running the evaluation of the program.</p> <p>\u201cIf you give people free cash, how do they spend it? They\u2019re very rational about it, and they make great decisions,\u201d said Stacia Martin-West, an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee College of Social Work and one of the lead researchers.</p> <p>Direct cash payments are more flexible than a one-size-fits-all government program, and they allow people to adapt to changing needs and new crises. \u201cEveryone we talked to, there was a different way they would use $500, and they all made sense,\u201d Tubbs, the Stockton mayor, said. \u201cThere was no way, as a government official, I would be smart enough to think of all that.\u201d</p> <p>One participant used the money to pay for dentures, Tubbs said. Another was able to take time off work to interview for a better job that paid more and had shorter hours. Participants have talked about finally having the money to buy their kid a sports uniform or a prom dress, or to move to <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/156584/can-500-month-change-life\">a safer neighborhood.</a></p> <p>But the single largest category of spending among Stockton participants so far: food. Nearly 40% of tracked spending monthly went to feeding the recipients and their families.</p> <p>That number highlights the degree of basic \u201cfood insecurity\u201d that Americans have been living with since even before the current crisis, said Amy Castro Baker, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the other lead researcher on the project.</p> <p>The Stockton researchers also found that participants were using their additional cash to invest in healthier food choices for themselves and their kids, additional evidence that the barrier for lower-income Americans to eat healthier is not education about what they should and should not be eating, but access to affordable, high-quality food.</p> <p>Scaling a direct cash payment program nationwide during a pandemic could end up having broader public health benefits, beyond just preventing the spread of the virus, Baker said. It could give more Americans the resources to eat healthier meals. If lawmakers provide continuous payments, reducing residents\u2019 fears about being able to make it through the crisis, their lower levels of anxiety could also lead to better overall health outcomes.</p> <h2>\u2018As long as the crisis lasts\u2019</h2> <p>As policymakers in Washington debate which Americans to exclude from direct cash payments, and whether they should send just one check, or two or three, Tubbs, the Stockton mayor, encouraged them to think bigger.</p> <p>Direct cash payments should last \u201cas long as the crisis lasts, and even a little bit after\u201d, Tubbs said.</p> <p>Receiving $500 or $1,000 monthly isn\u2019t much during a global pandemic that has destroyed the economy, Tubbs said: \u201cIf they were working two or three jobs, this is not replacing what they made, this is enough to let them get by.\u201d</p> <p>Martin-West and Baker, the researchers evaluating the Stockton experiment, agreed that an effective program of national cash payments needed to match the scale and scope of the problem. That means payments should go out immediately, within 10 to 14 days; they need to recur throughout the crisis; and they need to reach Americans with as few bureaucratic hurdles as possible.</p> <p>Since the 2008 recession, \u201cthe average household has not recovered,\u201d Baker said. Banks got bailed out, the stock market boomed, but the government did not do enough to help most Americans.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have now is an entire economy of people living paycheck to paycheck because they were left out,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe have been a house of cards for a really long time, and it wasn\u2019t going to take much to blow it over.\u201d</p> <p>A big, sustained program of direct cash payments was a chance for the American government to \u201ccourse-correct\u201d and make up for the failures of the 2009 bailout, she said.</p> <p>How big and how sustained? A good benchmark for the size of the checks the government should send to Americans now, Martin-West said, might be some common financial wisdom.</p> <p>\u201cThe advice that we\u2019ve all heard for how to be financially savvy is: you\u2019re supposed to have three months of income saved up. If we look at the median income for Americans, that would mean $7,500 in the bank,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That benchmark would mean supporting Americans with roughly $2,500 per month throughout the crisis. \u201cAt minimum, a year of those cash transfers would be ideal,\u201d Martin-West said.</p> <p>Lawmakers need to specify in the legislation that the coronavirus payments do not count as income that could later disqualify low-income families from receiving food stamps, or other continuing government assistance, the researchers said. If lawmakers fail to do that, families could lose their eligibility for other programs, hurting them more over the long run.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re in an unprecedented crisis, so we have to have big thinking. This is a New Deal type moment</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Tubbs</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While both Republican and Democratic plans call for reducing or even eliminating direct payments to higher-income Americans, Tubbs also said that he believes payments should be \u201ccloser to universal\u201d since \u201cthe crisis will impact everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the difference between [an income cutoff of] $99,000 and $100,000 is, especially at at time when we\u2019re laying people off and shutting down industries,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The two researchers suggested that the federal government should channel money to Americans through multiple programs, to make sure they reach everyone in need. Why not increase the amounts of existing welfare and disability payments, as well as using tax records to send taxpayers cash?</p> <p>But even large direct cash payments aren\u2019t a substitute for other kinds of government action, they cautioned. Other solutions are needed during the coronavirus crisis, including paid sick leave and better healthcare. In Stockton, the guaranteed income pilot has made clear that more money is not enough to help residents deal with systemic problems, like California\u2019s lack of affordable housing.</p> <p>Baker also questioned why the McConnell legislation was benchmarked against Americans\u2019 2018 tax returns, when so many Americans, including freelancers and gig economy workers, see their incomes change dramatically over time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/america-coronavirus-recession-universal-basic-income\">America is in crisis. We need universal basic income now | Karl Widerquist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the researchers worried about the part of McConnell\u2019s legislation that envisions a lower, $600 payout to Americans who do not reach certain income tax cutoffs. A single mom who spends most of her time caring for a child with a serious disability, for example, might not make the income cutoff for a full $1,200 check, even though she\u2019s \u201ccertainly going to be struggling in the middle of a public health crisis\u201d, Martin-West said.</p> <p>Not all lawmakers are onboard with even a single direct cash payment to Americans, and some key Senate Republicans expressed reservations about McConnell\u2019s plan on Thursday, including Lindsey Graham, an influential Trump ally.</p> <p>But merely focusing on increasing unemployment insurance, as Graham has suggested, Tubbs said, would leave out too many people who might not fit the criteria for unemployment, including women doing domestic and caregiving work, freelancers, barbers and hairdressers, and Lyft and Uber drivers.</p> <p>Americans needed both more unemployment insurance and direct payments, Tubbs said, not one or the other.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in an unprecedented crisis, so we have to have big thinking,\u201d Tubbs said \u201cThis is a New Deal type moment, in terms of the recession that\u2019s bound to come from this public health epidemic, which we haven\u2019t seen in at least a century.\u201d</p> <p>Tubbs said he was not surprised that direct cash payments were having a national political moment, and he said that work to make the idea mainstream has already been done, including by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/andrew-yang-coronavirus-universal-basic-income-interview\">Andrew Yang</a>, the entrepreneur and Democratic presidential primary candidate, who made UBI his central policy issue in his bid for the White House.</p> <p>\u201cI think folks like myself, and people like the Economic Security Project, people like Mr Yang, have taken the brunt of the criticism,\u201d Tubbs said. \u201cI think now it\u2019s really a safe space, particularly because we\u2019re in a crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of people who were living in an economic pandemic before the corona crisis,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 March 2020 to correct a mistake that said White Policy instead of White House.</p>",
  "<p>Last Saturday night, Amber Valentine got dressed up to play a set, as she has nearly every weekend since she began DJing full time eight years ago. She put on her headphones as a smoke machine and lights filled the room \u2013 but this time, instead of walking on stage to perform, she walked into her living room.</p> <p>Valentine is one of an increasing number of performers moving their work online as nationwide lockdowns meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus force bars and other nightlife spaces to a close. Drag shows, DJ sets, and dance parties have been taking to live streams and chat rooms to keep people connected and pay out-of-work performers as more and more cities in the US go on lockdown.</p> <p>Valentine came up with the idea to stream her set on Instagram live for a virtual dance party when New York City bars and clubs closed last week , and she\u2019s planning another one this weekend now the New York governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo-non-essential-workers-businesses\">has ordered</a> most people to stay home. </p> <p>\u201cThe response was like nothing I could have expected,\u201d she said. Thousands of people tuned in and hundreds of her Instagram followers sent her videos of themselves dancing to her music in their living rooms. Many used the comment section to chat with one another as they might do in a club, and although she didn\u2019t ask for money she made several hundred dollars via donations through her Venmo account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9z1ei6l8Me/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Traditionally Nowadays has outlawed phones on its dance floors in an attempt to keep people present and connected. Now it is turning to those devices to do just that.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a case where technology is serving an important purpose, when we can\u2019t be in the same rooms together,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThe whole reason we ever started throwing parties in the first place was to create an environment where people could connect.\u201d</p> <p>Other nightlife spaces that <a href=\"https://boilerroom.tv/\">previously hosted streaming</a> options are increasing their offerings \u2013 including the Boiler Room, an online music broadcasting platform based in London. Previously the collective streamed shows from various clubs around the world, <a href=\"https://boilerroom.tv/article/statement-covid-19\">but it is now launching</a> a Covid-19 series, which will stream from artists\u2019 homes and private spaces.</p> <p>The impulse to stream performances comes from a desire to continue to unite people through nightlife, but also to keep workers in the industry afloat as they go indefinitely without normal wages, said Rify Royalty, a New York City drag queen who is putting on drag shows via Instagram live. Rify has streamed one performance and has two more planned for next week.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone in the nightlife space \u2013 bartenders, barbacks, performers, are all getting hit very hard by this,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a community, we need to stick together.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Amy Tan is preparing to burst into song with two fellow musicians on a deserted street in Acton, west London.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do anything by Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald \u2013 the Rat Pack,\u201d she says. \u201cOr maybe they would like a song by Elton John or the Beatles?\u201d</p> <p>A watching couple wave from the balcony of their flat as Tan begins to sing. But she is not expecting to meet every audience, or even see their faces. What\u2019s important is that they are listening.</p> <p>The street has been selected by a local aid group as one where vulnerable people who are self-isolating during the coronavirus outbreak would benefit from the simple, life-affirming joy of hearing music.</p> <p>Tan has formed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-mutual-aid-how-to-help-the-vulnerable-near-you\">Covid-19 Mutual Aid</a> musicians\u2019 group to lift the spirits of those forced to cut themselves off.

They will go out in small groups to perform \u2013 and the project aims to help them, too.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many musicians out of pocket because of this epidemic. I wanted to help people find purpose again,\u201d says Tan. \u201cPeople are asking: \u2018Why am I a musician?\u2019 My answer is that, when the worst happens, you still have your music.\u201d</p> <p>As a response to the coronavirus outbreak and the mental health challenges of self-isolation, the wider <a href=\"https://covidmutualaid.org/\">Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK</a> network is more evidence not just of crisis as a catalyst for altruism, but of the mutual benefits of helping others. There are now 900 groups across the UK, fast recruiting volunteers from all walks of life to assist with tasks from shopping to dog walking to being at the end of the phone line.</p> <p>In London, where the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-51910748\">epidemic is spreading faster </a>than elsewhere, the membership of these solidarity groups has soared. Tom Bird, a teacher, says hundreds of volunteers have joined the Ealing group he administers. \u201cPeople can relax more when they know they can do something tangible. This is one of the things that I have felt. People like to think; \u2018Here is a task that I can do.\u2019 We can achieve something together.\u201d</p> <p>One beneficiary of the local aid network is Joanna Dudzinska, who is undergoing chemotherapy, and enjoyed the performance in Acton with her partner Anthony Smith. \u201cIt was such a wonderful distraction.

The next day, a young woman made a delivery at her door. \u201cWe kept a distance but still it was like hugging heart to heart.

  "<p>Long before the arrival of Covid-19, the speed and contents of the news had made me feel almost overwhelmed with fear. Faced with a flood of images that includes migrant children in cages, melting glaciers and forest fires, it has felt impossible to process information, let alone assess the best way to react.</p> <p>We\u2019ve entered an era characterised by the twin forces of speed and instability, in which a superabundance of potential threats \u2013 running from Islamic State to nuclear war, the rise of the far right, Brexit, environmental catastrophe and now a global pandemic \u2013 is matched by a dearth of time in which to process them. It\u2019s impossible to keep up, and far too alarming to look away. Thanks to the accelerating effects of social media, it\u2019s begun to seem as if the social landscape is shifting at such a rate that thinking, the act of making sense, is permanently balked. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to distinguish real danger from rumours, speculations, conspiracy theories and deliberate lies, a process the spread of coronavirus around the globe has only intensified. Logging into Twitter or following the rolling news has meant being trapped in a spin-cycle of hypervigilant anxiety.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If this virus shows us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During this febrile period, I\u2019ve found myself longing for a different kind of timeframe, in which it would be possible both to feel and to think, to process the intense impact of the news and perhaps even to imagine other ways of being. The stopped time of a painting, say, or the dilations of the novel, in which it is possible to see patterns and consequences that are otherwise invisible. Art has begun to feel not like a respite or an escape, but a formidable tool for gaining perspective on what are increasingly troubled times.</p> <p>Can art do anything, especially during periods of crisis? In 1967, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/george-steiner-obituary\" title=\"\">George Steiner</a> wrote a famous essay about the deficiencies of art in the wake of the Holocaust. He argued that if a concentration camp commander could read Goethe and Rilke in the evening and still go about their duties at Auschwitz each day, then art had failed in its highest function, which he defined as the ability to humanise. The problem with this argument is that it implies for art to be successful it must act as a magic bullet, effortlessly reorganising moral faculties; in effect obliterating free will.</p> <p>Art can\u2019t forcibly induce a change in behaviour. It\u2019s not a re-education pill. Empathy is not something that happens to us when we read <em>War and Peace</em>. It\u2019s work, for which art can, however, provide us with radiant materials. Art can\u2019t win an election or bring down a president. It can\u2019t stop the climate crisis, cure a virus or raise the dead. What it can do is serve as an antidote to times of chaos. It can be a route to clarity, and it can be a force of resistance and repair, providing new registers, new languages in which to think.</p> <p>One of the problems with the internet as a source of information is that there is no end, no definitive conclusion to be reached. You travel link by link, pursuing digressions and counter-claims, interrupted by continuous breaking updates. The novel, by contrast, is a technology of orderly revelation, slowing and speeding time so as to trace connections and consequences down into hours, minutes, seconds, or out into decades, even centuries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc6e5902fe3521b0e8efbec34020b4e94ab47dca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc6e5902fe3521b0e8efbec34020b4e94ab47dca/0_111_2050_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The TV adaptation of Bleak House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The TV adaptation of<em> </em>Bleak House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Mike Hogan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dickens is the master of this, and it strikes me that there can\u2019t be many better figurations for what information-gathering feels like on social media than Krook\u2019s Rag and Bottle shop in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/charles-dickens-bleak-house-book-that-changed-me\" title=\"\">Bleak House</a></em>. This \u201cgeneral emporium of much disregarded merchandise\u201d is overflowing with indeterminate objects, among them blacking bottles and pickling bottles, heaps of parchment scrolls, rags and hundreds of rusty keys. Buried somewhere in this maddening chaos is, or might be, a vital document, without which clarity and justice will never be achieved.</p> <p>There\u2019s a plague in <em>Bleak House</em> too, the hyper-contagious smallpox virus, which serves to underscore Dickens\u2019s larger argument about interconnection, his determined attempt to show that social classes are not inviolate or impermeable, and that no group of people, no matter how grand or rich, are truly separate from their neighbours, no matter how poor or abject. The fever doesn\u2019t respect titles or addresses, racing indiscriminately from the London slum of Tom-All-Alone to Bleak House itself. Esther catches it because she insists on helping the abject, homeless orphan Jo, shivering and stumbling from ditch to doorway, always being moved on. Realising she too is sick, she establishes herself in rigorous quarantine, knowing that by locking the door on her dear friend Ada, she is carrying out an act of love. \u201cAs she loved me and wished my mind to be at peace,\u201d she instructs, \u201ccome no nearer than the garden\u201d: the tender message of self-isolators everywhere.</p> <p>One of the pleasures of <em>Bleak House</em> is that it\u2019s a drama about the act of information-gathering itself, slowly and laboriously producing clarity and order out of lies, misinformation and occlusion. Back in the early 1990s, the critic and queer studies pioneer Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick wrote an illuminating essay about this vexed and essential process. Sedgwick was once described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review\" title=\"\">Maggie Nelson</a> as \u201cfat, freckled, prone to blushing, bedecked in textiles, generous, uncannily sweet, almost sadistically intelligent and, by the time I met her, terminally ill\u201d. She wrote \u201cParanoid Reading and Reparative Reading, or, You\u2019re So Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay Is About You\u201d at the centre of the Aids crisis, at a time when many of her closest friends and colleagues were dying difficult and painful deaths, and she herself was undergoing treatment for the breast cancer that later killed her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That\u2019s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading The Road does not</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Though it was written predominantly for an academic audience, \u201cParanoid Reading\u201d is about something that affects us all, which is how we approach knowledge and uncertainty, as we do constantly in the course of our daily lives, and particularly at times of disaster or rapid political change. Sedgwick begins by describing the paranoid approach, so common and widely practised that we sometimes forget there are alternatives to it.</p> <p>A paranoid reader is concerned with gathering information, tracing links and exposing secrets. They anticipate and are perennially defended against catastrophe and disappointment. They\u2019re always on the lookout for danger, about which they can never, ever know enough. Paranoia can be an appropriate mode in circumstances like those we\u2019re in now, when knowledge is crucial and swift reactions matter. As the poet Anne Boyer observes in a much-shared essay about coronavirus, \u201cfear educates our care for each other \u2013 we fear a sick person might be made sicker, or that a poor person\u2019s life might be made even more miserable, and we do whatever we can to protect them because we fear a version of human life in which everyone lives only for themselves. I am not the least bit afraid of this kind of fear, for fear is a vital and necessary part of love.\u201d</p> <p>The difficulty lies in gauging the level and amount of information it\u2019s useful to acquire. How much does the average citizen need to know about epidemiology or viral loads? Does the accumulated store of possible scenarios help a person to act safely or does it paralyse their capacity to act at all? Furthermore, how much of what is read is true, and how much is being used to convey a more sinister message, like Trump\u2019s constant harping on a \u201cforeign\u201d virus, his deployment of a disease to broadcast propaganda about closed borders? At their worst, Twitter, Facebook and the like can be a factory for manufacturing speculation and mistrust, in which material travels more rapidly the more frightening it is, providing comprehensive evidence for hopelessness and dread.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be5b0ebd9e8a69e57cb30b91ea04c659cfbdd02d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be5b0ebd9e8a69e57cb30b91ea04c659cfbdd02d/0_0_4254_4278/994.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Jarman\u2019s Modern Nature is an account of building his famous garden on the beach in his final years.\" width=\"994\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Jarman\u2019s Modern Nature is an account of building his famous garden, see below, on the beach in his final years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Krause, Johansen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sedgwick\u2019s essay arose out of a conversation in the mid-1980s with her friend Cindy Patton, an activist-historian of the Aids epidemic. At the time, there were rumours that Aids might have been deliberately engineered by the US military. Sedgwick was excited to hear what Patton thought and startled by her reply. \u201cSuppose \u2026 that the lives of Africans and African Americans are worthless in the eyes of the United States; that gay men and drug users are held cheap where they aren\u2019t actively hated; that the military deliberately researches ways to kill non-combatants whom it sees as enemies; that people in power look calmly on the likelihood of catastrophic environmental and population changes,\u201d she said. \u201cSupposing we were ever so sure of all those things \u2013 what would we know then that we don\u2019t already know?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"adef2942164cda507e8cfdcc6c3728ae35eac6c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adef2942164cda507e8cfdcc6c3728ae35eac6c3/0_251_5079_3047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jarman\u2019s cottage at Dungeness in Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jarman\u2019s cottage at Dungeness in Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Bird/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Sedgwick took away from this \u201ccongenial pessimism\u201d, which strikes a definite echo with the present day, is that it isn\u2019t always necessary to track down every piece of information about a crisis in order to respond effectively to it. Patton\u2019s statement made her realise that there are other valid concerns for the artist, the activist, the citizen faced by emergency or disaster. At the very end of her essay, she briefly, tantalisingly floats another possible approach, which is more concerned with creativity and repair than the so-called hermeneutics of suspicion.</p> <p>A useful analogy for what Sedgwick terms the \u201creparative\u201d is to be fundamentally more invested in finding nourishment than identifying poison, a drive she locates in artists as diverse as the realist painter Jack Smith, artist Joseph Cornell, film-maker John Waters and <em>Nightwood</em> author Djuna Barnes. This is not the same thing as being naive or heedless, unaware of crisis or undamaged by oppression. Instead, it\u2019s about being driven to find or invent something new and vital out of inimical environments. \u201cWhat we can best learn from such practices,\u201d Sedgwick explains, \u201care the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture \u2013 even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.\u201d</p> <p>Sedgwick\u2019s faith in art was hard-won, and derived in part from the crucial role it played during the plague years of the Aids crisis. In contrast to the rapid international public health response to coronavirus, the first cases of \u201cgay cancer\u201d in California and New York in 1981 were met with apathy and derision. In 1984, by which time 5,596 deaths had occurred in the US and it was estimated 300,000 people had been exposed to the virus, the Reagan press officer was still responding to questions about the epidemic by joking about the journalist\u2019s possible infection status. Reagan himself didn\u2019t say the word \u201cAids\u201d until 17 September 1985. By the end of that year, 12,529 people had died.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/29/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2020\">Fiction to look out for in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In such a situation, visibility mattered. In 1987, a six-person collective of artists in New York created the \u201cSilence = Death\u201d graphic, which became the international logo of Aids activism. This stark phrase was emblazoned in white letters on a black background beneath a pink triangle, taken from the insignia homosexuals were made to wear in concentration camps. It served to brand the call to arms, a crisp refutation of stigmatisation and homophobia.</p> <p>If silence equalled death, then part of the work of resistance was to make the fact of enforced silencing visible, as well as conveying something of the damage it caused. In 1989, the American artist and Act Up activist David Wojnarowicz posed for a famous photograph. He gazes furiously at the camera, his lips sutured with five loose stitches. Three thin trickles of blood run down his chin. In this distressing image, hurt and repair are fused. The needle works through flesh, self-inflicted wounds announcing larger harm.</p> <p>In our own era, the act of lip-sewing has been adopted by refugees. I\u2019ve seen photographs of refugees with stitched lips made on the border between Greece and Macedonia, in an Australian immigration centre in Papua New Guinea, in Athens; all places where borders are closed to certain bodies and free passage is impeded. In these cases, the image possesses an uncanny power. It can travel where the body can\u2019t. It migrates and strays, taking up permanent residence in the mind, revealing what \u2013 who \u2013 has been forcibly excluded from sight.</p> <p>The desire to unveil hidden cruelty is also at work in a series of performances about rape carried out in the early 1970s by the Cuban-American artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/22/ana-mendieta-artist-work-foretold-death\" title=\"\">Ana Mendieta</a>, while she was still a student at the University of Iowa. In 1973, a nursing student was brutally raped and murdered in campus housing. It took months before there was an arrest, and during that frightening period, Mendieta took it upon herself to create work about the attack, conveying her own horror, as well as drawing attention to the invisible epidemic of violence against women. In the first of these performances, she invited her fellow students to her apartment. When they arrived, the door was ajar. Inside, there was lavish evidence that a horrible crime had been committed. Mendieta was tied to the table, half-naked, her underwear around her ankles. Blood dripped on the floor. The students stayed an hour and for the entire time she didn\u2019t move a muscle.</p> <p>Mendieta was working right at the beginning of second-wave feminism, when it was still possible to believe in the power of revelation, the shock tactics of re-enacting violence as a vaccination, a homeopathic cure. But by the 1990s, Sedgwick was already beginning to wonder whether there wasn\u2019t something weirdly naive about placing faith in this kind of unveiling, \u201cas though to make something visible as a problem were, if not a mere hop, skip, and jump away from getting it solved, at least self-evidently a step in that direction\u201d. As if violence is not titillating to certain appetites; as if the expression of pain cannot be consumed with relish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8876ba6367c42864b4eea6991ca47579a5b2eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8876ba6367c42864b4eea6991ca47579a5b2eb1/0_69_1503_902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisabeth Moss in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisabeth Moss in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Kraychyk/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The faith in inoculation remains, of course. In 2017, the actor Elisabeth Moss announced her irritation with people who refused to watch the ultra-violent <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-handmaids-tale\" title=\"\">Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a></em>, a dystopic fantasy that felt closer by the day. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the balls to watch a TV show? This is happening in your real life. Wake up, people. Wake up.\u201d But in the age of the internet, it\u2019s very hard to think that anyone needs more evidence of violence. We\u2019re already drenched in it, and its capacity to snap us out of numbness is grossly overstated. If anything, it does the opposite, glutting the viewer with despair.</p> <p>The night before Trump\u2019s inauguration, I saw the trans poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/16/eileen-myles-learn-to-write-poems\" title=\"\">Eileen Myles</a> read their own version of a presidential address at the London Review Bookshop. The vision they unfolded was the utopian inverse \u2013 painful! thrilling! \u2013 of what Trump would say the following day. Under Myles, the White House would be a homeless shelter, there\u2019d be 24-hour libraries, free trains, free education, free food, archery for everyone; sure, why not? It felt reparative, listening to that. It felt like my imaginative ability to frame utopias and then to move purposefully towards them might have been restored, at least for a minute.</p> <p>I had the same experience when I first read <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/27/ursula-k-le-guins-electronica-album-music-and-poetry-of-the-kesh\" title=\"\">Always Coming Home</a></em>, Ursula Le Guin\u2019s 1985 collection of stories and anthropological fragments about a future civilisation, the Kesh, living in what is now California\u2019s Napa Valley in the wake of an apocalypse that is never quite described. It was a relief to encounter such a formidable thinker using her imaginative energy, her humour and her extensive knowledge to construct a better, fairer, more environmentally sane society \u2013 its architecture, sexual arrangements, metaphors, toys, songs, clothes, medical practices and stories \u2013 rather than simply magnifying all that is worst about our own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/17/best-books-new-beginnings-jenny-colgan\">The best books about new beginnings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading <em>The Road</em> or <em>The Death of Grass</em> does not. Le Guin was no less concerned about the oncoming ecological crisis than Cormac McCarthy, but her approach is calmer and more infused with hope. Hope has a bad press in our cynical age, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being disengaged, a Pollyanna blind to the state things are in or uninterested in how they got that way. Hope is the precursor to change. Without it, no better world is possible.</p> <p>The same year that Wojnarowicz was photographed with his needle and thread, the film-maker Derek Jarman began the diary that would become <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/olivia-laing-derek-jarman-modern-nature\" title=\"\">Modern Nature</a></em>, an account of building his famous garden on the beach in Dungeness, Kent. Jarman was diagnosed HIV-positive in the winter of 1986, years before the invention of combination therapy made long-term survival a probability. In the face of his own oncoming death, he didn\u2019t give way to despair. Instead he elected to spend his time making this stony desert bloom.</p> <p>He planted irises and roses directly into the shingle, encouraging a riot of wallflowers and valerian, \u201call the dark humours blown away by the wind\u201d. This wild, unfenced arcadia sustained him through the political battles of his final years, and has now outlived him by more than quarter of a century. Last time I visited, in December, it was still humming with power.</p> <p>I have the same feeling when I look at photographs by Wolfgang Tillmans or read a novel by Ali Smith. I had it when I went to see my friend Rich\u2019s degree show at Goldsmiths and he\u2019d made dozens of ceramic razor clams and anemones, downed planes and nubbly coral reefs. It\u2019s a feeling of being inducted back into hope, a restoration of faith. It\u2019s easy to give into despair. There\u2019s so much that\u2019s frightening, so much that\u2019s wrong. But if this virus shows us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat, even when we can\u2019t touch.

  "<p>It started out as a bit of an experiment in 2007, an attempt to take what sports journalists were doing with minute-by-minute coverage of cricket and football and see if it would work with fast-paced news events.</p> <p>It did. More than a dozen years later, the Guardian\u2019s live blog format (a rolling screed of real-time news updates written by journalists like me) is one of our most successful digital innovations ever, prodigiously utilised, much copied \u2013 and so well read that it can be daunting for those doing the writing.</p> <p>Take the coronavirus story. As the news about the pandemic becomes grimmer and the measures to combat it ever more drastic, the interest from readers has only grown. At the start of March the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-update-live-news-who-covid19-cases-outbreak-us-states-uk-school-closures-australia-europe-eu-africa-asia-latest-updates\">coronavirus live blog</a> was already attracting 3 million page views each day. By this week, daily figures for the blog were more than 7 million.</p> <p>As one of a pool of reporters called upon to liveblog coronavirus, these are intimidating figures. It isn\u2019t easy imagining all those eyeballs glaring at typos in your latest post, while you struggle to keep on top of a rapidly moving story that has hit all parts of the world.</p> <p>Indeed, there are moments when you might wonder about the impact of this kind of journalism, with its rapid-fire, alert-style updates and overwhelming tide of information. A very few readers have told us they find it all too much in an anxious world. We try to mitigate by bringing in breadth and context wherever possible. </p> <p>Fortunately, help is at hand from reporters all over the world, colleagues in the office and, crucially, readers. All of us who do the coronavirus live blog have been sent a stream of emails, tweets and texts from readers with helpful tips, insights, corrections, and encouragement. These are particularly useful from areas of the world where we don\u2019t have correspondents.</p> <p>A Guardian subscriber from Greenland got in touch this week to tell us about the island\u2019s first confirmed case. Anders Madsen, a nurse from the capital, Nuuk, became the live blog\u2019s Greenland coronavirus correspondent, with a post about concerns over delays in verifying cases because tests have to be confirmed in Denmark. This prompted another reader from the Falklands to report similar concerns about tests having to go to the UK for confirmation.</p> <p>Doctors have also been in touch to share their expertise and concerns. And generally readers have let us know how they and their relatives are coping. One shared a video of her mother singing about all the things she\u2019s been doing while locked down in her flat in Spain. Putting lighter content like this on the blog isn\u2019t always appropriate, and risks trivialising an incredibly serious crisis. But when it feels right to do so, it can help break up what would otherwise be a fairly unremitting string of updates.</p> <p>Though principally used to convey the latest on the breaking stories of the day, live blogs are not always bleak. We liveblogged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2015/mar/20/solar-eclipse-live-updates\">the solar eclipse in 2015</a>, numerous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/aug/06/curiosity-rover-mars-landing-live-blog\">other astro</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/aug/06/curiosity-rover-mars-landing-live-blog\">nomical events</a>, royal weddings, Nobel prizes, and any number of Oscars ceremonies.

It was an era before Twitter and we were using a blogging platform that would crash almost every time you tried to embed a video.</p> <p>Minute-by-minute reports, as they were known then, were initially frowned on by some senior figures in the Guardian. They were regarded as good for football but not for serious news stories \u2013 the first draft of the first draft of history, if you like. However, the popularity of the format soon changed minds. And when the website and print reporters integrated into one team, live blogs became central to the way the site covered major breaking stories. Greatly improved liveblogging software and increased involvement of correspondents from around the world made the Guardian live blogs more respected and even better read.</p> <p>The torrent of major developments on coronavirus makes the story virtually impossible to cover through conventional news stories. By the time such stories are written, edited and published, they are often already out of date. Only by following events in real time can you satisfy readers\u2019 desire for up-to-date news about Covid-19.</p> <p>But the virus is testing even this flexible format. On some days the website has carried up to five live blogs on the subject as it hits business, UK, US and Australian politics, and global affairs.</p> <p>There is so much to cover, it can be very tricky to convey the key developments. As a live blogger, you are frantically trying to keep several important plates spinning all at once \u2013 with the latest from China, Italy, Iran, and the UK, plus the effect on sport, the arts, and the economy, and all those briefings from the World Health Organization. Taking a step back to summarise what\u2019s been going on risks at least some of these plates crashing down. Colleagues often have to help out while you put together a summary.</p> <p>And it threatens to become even more difficult to cover as more of us are forced to work from home. Live blogging is much easier in a busy open-plan office, with several TVs broadcasting various news channels. Colleagues will shout out to make sure you\u2019re aware of the latest developments, such as an announcement from the NHS. And editors will even come to your desk to tell you, \u201cIdris Elba\u2019s got it!\u201d or point out Donald Trump\u2019s latest virus tweet.</p> <p>Liveblogging coronavirus from the kitchen table will be a different affair altogether.

Their failures conform to certain aspects of Lord Macpherson\u2019s definition of institutional racism, enshrined in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">Macpherson report</a> into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, published in 1999.</p> <p>Macpherson defined <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277111/4262.pdf\">institutional racism</a> as: \u201cThe collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.\u201d</p> <p>The Windrush Lessons Learned review pulls no punches in describing the failure of ministers and officials to understand the nature of racism in Britain. It shows how the government\u2019s hostile environment immigration policies had devastating impacts on the lives and families of black citizens within the UK.</p> <p>It is hard to forget the story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/special-needs-teacher-uk-50-years-loses-job-immigration-status\">Michael Braithwaite</a>, who came from Barbados to the UK as a nine year-old, more than 50 years ago. Thinking that he was British, Braithwaite never applied for a passport \u2013 but in 2017, after the implementation of the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Acts, he suddenly lost his job as a special needs teaching assistant in a school where he had worked for more than 15 years. Michael had been living in the UK legally his entire life, but he lost his much-loved job and livelihood because he could not prove his citizenship status.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17b11fb825dcd5b69651140fe3b2c09535bc1404\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17b11fb825dcd5b69651140fe3b2c09535bc1404/0_177_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest against  immigration policy outside the Home Office in London, April 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The government\u2019s hostile environment immigration policies had devastating impacts on the lives and families of black citizens within the UK.\u2019 <br>Demonstrators protest against immigration policy outside the Home Office in London, April 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact that black British people who had spent much of their lives in Britain, working and paying taxes, were accidental victims of the government\u2019s immigration policies, perfectly illustrates how the coalition and Conservative governments not only failed to adhere to existing race relations legislation, but also showed a complete lack of understanding about \u201cindirect discrimination\u201d \u2013 a concept accepted in legislation as far back as the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1976/74/enacted\">1976 Race Relations Act</a>.</p> <p>Neither that lesson of \u201cunintended discrimination\u201d, nor the definition of \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d from the Macpherson report, seem to have been learned by Britain\u2019s policymakers and politicians.

We are even seeing mothers with cubs, which is very unusual.\u201d</p> <p>There are believed to be fewer than 10,000 of these bears left across the northern Andes. Listed as <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22066/123792952\">vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature red list</a>, they face an increasingly uncertain future due to habitat destruction and hunting.</p> <p>Justicia set up the Maquipucuna Foundation with her husband, Rodrigo Ontaneda, 30 years ago. They were instrumental in persuading many local communities to stop ranching and timber farming and lobbied for protection of the wider Choc\u00f3<em><strong>-</strong></em>Andino Pichincha region, which was finally declared a <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/biosphere/lac/choco-andino-pichincha\">Unesco biosphere reserve</a> in 2018.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we started our project, it was very hard to see a bear,\u201d said Justicia. \u201cWe heard, anecdotally, there were bears here and that people hunted them.\u201d</p> <p>Andean or spectacled bears, which have earned global attention thanks to the fictional Paddington Bear, are hunted for parts used in the international wildlife trade \u2013 gall bladders, used in oriental medicine, can fetch as much as $150 (\u00a3116) and there is a large market in Ecuador for bear paws.</p> <p>Justicia spotted her first Andean bear in 2008. Since then, she says, she has recorded 40 different bears, based on photographs taken in the 6,500-hectare (16,061-acre) Maquipucuna reserve, identifying individuals from unique facial markings. Other experts have counted up to 19 bears in the forest in a single year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We still don\u2019t know how the bears decided to come to Maquipucuna.

The next year, it went crazy, we saw females with cubs. One February we realised how many bears came together and we began to record them.\u201d</p> <p>Each Andean bear needs around 1,000 hectares of territory, so the reserve itself would only support six individuals.</p> <p>Justicia compares the gatherings to those of Alaskan grizzlies that come together at salmon rivers. The bears arrive in the dry months, from September to December, but it is unpredictable, because the avocados do not ripen at the same time every year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Five years ago, people did not believe there were bears in this area, in the Quito corridor</p> <footer> <cite>Santiago Molina, bear expert</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe still don\u2019t know how the bears decided to come to Maquipucuna,\u201d said Justicia. \u201cBut we are learning more and more every year.\u201d</p> <p>Santiago Molina, a bear expert from San Francisco University of Quito, has carried out his own <a href=\"https://www.bearbiology.org/publications/ursus-archive/use-of-spatial-capture-recapture-to-estimate-density-of-andean-bears-in-northern-ecuador/\">study of bear numbers</a> in a 65,000-hectare region within the metropolitan district of Quito.

Given that spring and early summer are the peak season for weddings, there will be a lot of people wanting to claim if they took out a policy. Big providers include John Lewis and Debenhams, and specialist including Emerald Life.</p> <p><em>Will it pay out for coronavirus?</em></p> <p>Couples who wanted to get married are now being tied in knots by the wording in these insurance policies. For example, the John Lewis policy says explicitly it will pay out for cancellation caused by \u201cthe booked venue for the wedding or wedding reception being unable to hold your wedding due to an outbreak of infectious or contagious disease\u201d.</p> <p>A lot of couples will think, great, surely we will get a payout. But it\u2019s not that simple \u2013 and distraught couples are finding their claims are being rejected.</p> <p>Why? Because weddings have not been banned by the government. If the wedding venue itself does not cancel the event the John Lewis policy will not pay out.</p> <p>John Lewis says: \u201cThe current UK government position is that \u2026 weddings are still permitted to take place. So if your wedding venue is still prepared to hold your wedding and you chose to cancel, then this would not be covered.\u201d</p> <p>John Lewis also warns couples against cancelling without minimising losses \u2013 for example, asking suppliers such as venues, cake makers, photographers etc, to give refunds, or to rebook at a later date. \u201cWe may ask you to provide copies of your venue and supplier contracts as well as relevant correspondence with them, and may refuse cover in the event that we consider that you have not adequately minimised your costs.\u201d</p> <p>John Lewis will pay out if a person central to the wedding \u2013 bride, bridegroom, very close family etc \u2013 has contracted coronavirus. But if a key person is self-isolating without an actual diagnosis it won\u2019t pay out.</p> <p>The company has, inevitably, stopped selling wedding insurance, and its treatment of customers during this period will no doubt be noted by other couples arranging their nuptials in future.</p> <p>Emerald Life kept selling wedding insurance until 18 March, although only for weddings taking place in or after October, but it has also now closed its doors. It said: \u201cWhat we are doing is talking through whether customers can rearrange as a practical measure. Most venues and suppliers seem to want to help, and we will then just move their wedding date forward and extend the wedding coverage at no extra charge.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Income protection cover</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2256f29e00c8c9aaa5e72c40c89c94402398c557\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2256f29e00c8c9aaa5e72c40c89c94402398c557/0_92_4256_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fridge magnets with mortgage payment reminder note\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will your insurance pay out if you have to stay home with coronavirus, but can\u2019t get a diagnosis?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>What is it?</em></p> <p>The insurers promise that an income protection policy will give you a monthly income if you can\u2019t work because you are ill or injured, and in some cases if you are made unemployed. It pays a proportion of your lost earnings (usually around two-thirds of your former salary), with the payments continuing until you return to paid work or you retire.</p> <p>Policies are sold with \u201cwaiting periods\u201d. The more expensive ones let you claim the moment you can\u2019t work, while the cheaper (and more widely sold) don\u2019t pay out until after a month or so. The typical monthly cost is about \u00a360 to \u00a380.</p> <p><em>Will it pay out for coronavirus?</em></p> <p>When we contacted LV=, one of the UK\u2019s biggest providers, it said it had yet to receive a coronavirus-related claim. But it added that it would stand by the policies and pay claims as they arise.</p> <p>It said: \u201cWhile coronavirus is an unprecedented global pandemic, we recognise that it is already changing lives of everyday individuals and families. Income protection insurance has, and will have, a role to play, offering valuable reassurance and a much-needed financial safety net.\u201d</p> <p>For a confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus, LV= said: <strong>\u201c</strong>We\u2019ll assess and pay their claim in the usual way, reflecting their chosen waiting period and the policy terms and conditions.\u201d</p> <p>But what if you have not been given a diagnosis, but have to stop working and self-isolate?

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Other companies offering to lend expertise, staff and factory floor space include the automotive firms McLaren and Nissan, Dyson, Airbus, Vauxhall, Jaguar Land Rover, Renishaw and JCB.</p> \n<p>As well as ventilators, hand sanitiser and masks are in huge demand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/brewdog-begins-making-hand-sanitiser-shortages-uk\">prompting several companies to venture into new territory</a> to help increase supply.</p> \n<p>The British Honey Company, which makes honey, gin, rum and other spirits from its base in the Cotswolds, said it would use spare capacity in its distillery in Worminghall, Buckinghamshire, to produce hand sanitiser.

  "<p>The candlesticks and photo frames that usually adorn our mantelpiece have been usurped by four less conventional ornaments, and it doesn\u2019t take long for visitors to notice. \u201cAre they... ashes?\u201d Well, yes \u2013 but they\u2019re not so much a macabre display of what Americans call \u201ccremains\u201d as a small warehousing operation; we\u2019re working on the logistics to enable their respective onward journeys, but for now they are stuck here, above our fireplace. Visitors have other questions: why the Russian hats? Why is that one just a cardboard box? Let me explain.</p> <p>In December 2016, my 70-year-old Uncle Rod, my mum\u2019s younger brother, died. His will, of which I was executor, left his body to medical science. Skeletal and riddled with metastases as he was, the doctors politely declined the gift. His will\u2019s small print stipulated that anything left after his dissection should be cremated and scattered into the Avon from the Ashton Avenue Bridge, near his beloved Bristol City football ground.</p> <p>In life, Rod embraced the unorthodox, and he had mentioned to me years before that he didn\u2019t want a funeral, just a \u201cgathering\u201d of loved ones. I decided the best way of honouring his wishes was to organise a direct cremation \u2013 one with no ceremony or witnesses \u2013 and a knees-up in the garden room at Bristol Zoo, one of his favourite haunts.</p> <p>About five weeks after his death, I answered the door to a man cradling a sturdy cardboard box in a canvas tote bag: Rod\u2019s mortal remains. We chatted for a few minutes (mainly about how David Bowie had recently been directly cremated and therefore it had to be the coolest option), before he handed the box to me and left. I hadn\u2019t held ashes before; they were much heavier than expected. After a few stupefied seconds, I stood and cried for a solid minute, then placed the box on the sitting-room mantelpiece, under a Soviet-badged hat, next to my nan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6f9f48913ae281694514ad79044e286625f2e628\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f9f48913ae281694514ad79044e286625f2e628/41_45_392_571/343.jpg\" alt=\"Clare Brown\u2019s uncle Rod with his mother, Dolly.\" width=\"343\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clare\u2019s uncle Rod with his mother, Dolly.

Rod\u2019s flat had been decorated with remnants of his nomadic past; Bobby Kennedy merchandise from the US, aboriginal flags and a didgeridoo from Australia, military memorabilia from eastern Europe. While clearing it out \u2013 a hurried process, because the council wanted it back \u2013 Dan, my husband, lifted a Cossack hat from a shelf and discovered a large green plastic bottle beneath it. Reading the label that dangled from its neck, he announced: \u201cI\u2019ve found your nan!\u201d</p> <p>Dolly died, aged 90, in 2012 and left no instructions, so my mum popped her on the kitchen windowsill of the family home in Sheffield for a year or two, because \u201cshe always did love to see a line of washing\u201d. Rod volunteered to return their mother\u2019s urn to her birthplace, Newport in south Wales, and have her remains interred in her own mother\u2019s grave. We\u2019re not sure why Rod never made it, but we couldn\u2019t leave Dolly in Bristol for the council to find, so she came back to Nottingham with us. It seemed only right to keep her hat on; and when we found a second hat in the flat, obviously it had Rod\u2019s name on it.</p> <p>When our thoughts turned to scattering, we decided it might be nice to send Rod and Dolly down river together, although my mum had her reservations (\u201cBut she can\u2019t swim!\u201d). Then Rod\u2019s good friend Carol called us from Bristol to say that the Ashton Avenue Bridge<strong> </strong>was closed while extensive works took place, which is why, over two years later, Dolly and Rod are still sitting to the left of the mirror, under their furry hats.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They are family, and hiding them away in a cupboard would seem inhospitable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To the right of the mirror are the urns with the ashes of Dan\u2019s Aunty Mary and her husband, John. This summer, when his 89-year-old aunt died, it was my husband\u2019s turn to be an executor.</p> <p>Mary and John courted for 14 years before finally marrying in 2000, when she was 69 and John 65. But, after John\u2019s death in 2014, Mary\u2019s health began to deteriorate, especially her eyesight. She withdrew to her sofa, eating and even sleeping there. While clearing her house, Dan was a little more prepared for the shock of finding the green urn containing John, tucked beside the pillow at the end of the sofa that Mary slept on each night. So John came back with us until after Mary\u2019s funeral, at which point they were reunited on our mantelpiece. This time there were no hats; we didn\u2019t want it getting gimmicky.</p> <p>Mary did express her wishes before she died: her ashes are to be scattered, along with John\u2019s, on Woolley Edge, a Wakefield beauty spot. But John\u2019s son from his first marriage is keen to be there, and ill health has so far prevented him from leaving his home in Spain. We\u2019re waiting to coordinate timings for both scattering trips; in the meantime the strange quartet will remain on the mantelpiece. They are family, after all, and hiding them away in a cupboard would seem inhospitable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7910a1338e46a5def8c4b11e4e6aa08a37fcc4a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7910a1338e46a5def8c4b11e4e6aa08a37fcc4a7/202_254_2361_3331/709.jpg\" alt=\"Clare Brown's husband Dan\u2019s Aunty Mary and Uncle John on their wedding day in 2000\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan\u2019s Aunty Mary and Uncle John on their wedding day in 2000.

There must be thousands of urns awaiting a final resting place, but few seem to be on display. There are grieving relatives who keep ashes by choice, of course; but what about the remains that are, like ours, in transit? Are they all hidden in cupboards?</p> <p>According to Catherine Powell, customer experience director of <a href=\"https://www.purecremation.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pure Cremation</a>, there are almost 250,000 unclaimed urns in the UK. She says that even families who do have the ashes of a loved one can find it hard to agree what to do with them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://scattering-ashes.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Scattering Ashes</a> is a company that offers various dispersal and commemorative items, from decorative urns and garden memorials to water ceremony packages and ashes jewellery. The company carried out its own research into the length of time between receipt of remains and the decision to do something with them; 25% of the families they asked took more than three years to make their final move.</p> <p>While there is a growing acceptance of unconventional methods when it comes to dealing with ashes in the UK, Richard Martin, the company\u2019s director, has identified geographical differences. For instance, 75% of his jewellery customers live in the south-east. On the other hand, he adds: \u201cWhen we contacted UK football grounds a few years ago to ask how they\u2019d respond to ash-scattering requests on their pitches, we found that most northern clubs welcomed the idea, while most in the south were firmly against.\u201d</p> <p>We haven\u2019t been tempted to consider alternatives for our own collection of ashes \u2013 no fireworks, pendants or Viking longboats \u2013 because we have instructions from the deceased. But as about 60% of Britons don\u2019t have a will, many families have to make these decisions while grieving, which explains the often lengthy delay in dealing with the ashes. </p> <p>Will I miss our four urns when they\u2019re gone? The thing is, their very presence represents an absence, because they \u2013 Dolly, Rod, Mary and John \u2013 are already gone. They\u2019re already missed. And I\u2019m looking forward to getting those candlesticks back where they belong.</p> <h2>Final resting place: the dos and don\u2019ts of scattering ashes</h2> <p>There is very little legislation around ash scattering, but common sense applies in all settings: consider the effect on the surrounding area and those who use it, and avoid disposing of non-biodegradable tributes along with the ashes. You will also need to make sensible choices about wind direction.</p> <p><strong>On private land</strong> You need permission from the landowner.</p> <p><strong>On your own land</strong> No permission is required, and there\u2019s no need to keep a record.</p> <p><strong>At a cemetery, church</strong><strong>yard or natural burial site</strong> Easily arranged, by applying to the site manager \u2013 or ask your funeral director, if you have one, to act on your behalf. </p> <p><strong>At </strong><strong>a historic site or beauty spot</strong> National Trust England and Wales, English Heritage, Welsh Heritage, Historic Scotland and the National Parks will all consider requests made direct to the local property or landowner. No permanent site markers are allowed. Rather than scatter from or on popular mountain tops, placing ashes inside an out-of-the-way hollow or around a tree is preferred. (The Royal Parks in London and the Forestry Commission do not permit scattering.)</p> <p><strong>At a sports ground </strong>Some football and cricket grounds and racecourses will allow ashes to be scattered pitch- or track-side, or sometimes in an adjacent garden of remembrance. Permission must be secured.</p> <p><strong>On rivers or lakes</strong> <a href=\"https://www.scattering-ashes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/GEHO0306BKIK-e-e.pdf\" title=\"\">The Environment Agency has published a leaflet</a> about river scatterings, stating that ashes should not be put in water 1km from any drinking water supply, or from bridges over rivers used by boaters or canoeists, or anywhere close to a marina, anglers or bathers. If you can comply with these requirements no permission is necessary. If in doubt, contact your local Environment Agency office, which can also advise about tide times.</p> <p><strong>At sea</strong> Many companies offer scatterings by boat all round the UK coastline, but you could also organise your own beach ceremony \u2013 again, provided you have consideration for others, and ensure it\u2019s a sandy beach and the ashes are placed below the tide line.</p> <p>Further information is available at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cemeteries-and-burials-prevent-groundwater-pollution\" title=\"\">environment-agency.gov.uk</a>.</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;If you would like your&nbsp;comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

Her deputy prime minister Winston Peters, aged 74, was exempt as he was \u201cessential\u201d, Ardern said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/new-zealand-sees-biggest-daily-surge-in-coronavirus-cases-as-testing-increases\">New Zealand sees biggest daily surge in coronavirus cases as testing increases</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anyone who could work from home should now do so, Ardern said, and then reassured Kiwis that essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies would remain open throughout.</p> <p>If you cannot go out and maintain two metres of distance, then don\u2019t go out, Ardern said.</p> <p>\u201cOver the past few weeks, the world has changed. And it has changed very quickly.\u201d Ardern said, speaking from her parliamentary office in Wellington.</p> <p>\u201cWe are experiencing an unprecedented event \u2013 a global pandemic that in New Zealand, we have moved to fight by going hard, and going early.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI understand that all of this rapid change creates anxiety, and uncertainty. Especially when it means changing how we live.</p> <p>\u201cThe first really important thing to remember, is that the vast majority of people who will ever have Covid-19 will only experience mild to moderate symptoms. But there will be some who need more care.<br><br>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to focus on one simple goal \u2013 to slow down Covid-19,\u201d Ardern said.</p> <p>Slowing it down would mean having \u201csmaller waves\u201d of the virus circulating, to reduce the impact on health, jobs and and the economy.</p> <p>Ardern said \u201csome countries have successfully managed to do this\u201d and the goal now was slowing, not stopping, the virus.</p> <p>The prime minister also introduced a four-level alert system, with New Zealand currently at level two.</p> <p>\u201cAlert Level Two is where the disease is contained but the risks are growing because we have more cases,\u201d Ardern said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is when we move to reduce our contact with one another. We increase our border measures, and we cancel events. This is also the level where we ask people to work differently if they can, and cancel unnecessary travel.\u201d</p> <p>Level four, the highest level, would mean transmission through the community was \u201csustained\u201d. At this stage \u201cwe eliminate contact with each other altogether\u201d, Ardern said, as seen in Italy and France. The government would \u201ckeep essential services going, but ask everyone to stay at home until Covid-19 is back under control\u201d.</p> <p>Different areas of the country could move to different alert levels at different stages and times.</p> <p>Despite some health experts pressing for school closures and other level four measures, the prime minister said schools would open as normal on Monday, despite many parents already choosing to keep their children home.</p> <p>Many tertiary institutions are now moving to teach students online, while most workplaces are testing, phasing in or adopting work from home practices.</p> <p>Kiwis praised Ardern\u2019s national address, describing it as calm and reassuring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samuel_clack/status/1241142156619726848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After watching that update I\u2019m so grateful we have Jacinda leading the country through this.

Trudeau stressed the \u201cexceptional measure\u201d to deny asylum seekers was temporary. The federal government had previously weighed placing those seeking to enter Canada into mandatory self-isolation. Canada has received roughly nearly 55,000 asylum claims since February, 2017.<br></p> \n  <p>The prime minister also announced plans to support manufacturing companies across the country, including large automative companies, as they quickly retool much of their production lines to build much-needed medical equipment, including ventilators and masks. <br></p> \n  <p>Early indications suggest the virus is hitting the Canadian economy hard as businesses across the country close.
