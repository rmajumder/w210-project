The widespread losses came despite the ECB becoming the latest global central bank to unleash emergency stimulus measures, following efforts by the Fed and the Bank of England, which announced an emergency cut in interest rates on Wednesday alongside Rishi Sunak\u2019s expansionary budget.  The stimulus measures to try to prop up the fragile eurozone economy included loosening restrictions on lending by banks in the currency bloc, and buying more private sector bonds.  However, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, did not unveil the interest rate cut expected by investors and called instead for eurozone governments to step in with increased spending.  The normally sure-footed Lagarde came under fire after she refused to echo her predecessor, Mario Draghi, and say the bank would do whatever it takes to protect the eurozone from a recession.  Referring to calls for the ECB to help ease borrowing costs for highly indebted eurozone countries, Lagarde said: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/12/stock-markets-tumble-trump-europe-travel-ban-ecb-christine-lagarde-business-live?page=with:block-5e6a5a028f087df56e4c7609#block-5e6a5a028f087df56e4c7609\">\u201cWe are not here to close [bond] spreads, there are other tools and other actors to deal with these issues</a>.\u201d <br> The cost of borrowing for the Italian government soared, sparking fears of a repeat of the 2012 eurozone debt crisis when the then ECB boss, Draghi, declared he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro.  Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the ECB chief\u2019s intervention was a \u201cdisaster\u201d given the scale of the challenge facing the global economy.  \u201c[Her] performance will go down as a catastrophic failure by part of the ECB. It is one of the world\u2019s largest central banks, and today markets were crying out for a backstop; they got anything but,\u201d he said.  Banking bosses from lenders including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Natwest were summoned by Rishi Sunak and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, to discuss coordinated action to support small businesses.  The group of lenders, which also included Santander, Virgin Money and Danske Bank, confirmed they were making more than \u00a320bn available for companies that needed emergency financing over the coming months.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/marketsneil/status/1238214730264829953\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US Fed injects $1.5tn to markets as Dow and FTSE suffer worst day since 1987 <a href=\"https://t.co/4eycdRuq75\">https://t.co/4eycdRuq75</a></p>&mdash; Neil Wilson (@marketsneil) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marketsneil/status/1238214730264829953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Goodnight, and good luck. <strong>GW </strong>and <strong>JJ</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T22:02:30.276Z\">at 10.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6aadc28f085f0b8d9478a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T21:50:08.726Z\">9.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bitcoin is continuing to slump -- at a pace that dwarfs the stock market tumbles today:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/1238215558291771399\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wow! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bitcoin</a> is down 30%... <a href=\"https://t.co/lqbcdNkGaz\">pic.twitter.com/lqbcdNkGaz</a></p>&mdash; jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/1238215558291771399?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Although other assets have suffered similarly steep declines in recent weeks:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Convertbond/status/1238211971717181441\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Drawdowns from Recent Highs: <br><br>Oil: -53%<br>Bitcoin: -46%<br>Delta Airlines: -46%<br>Tesla: -42%<br>Goldman: -40%<br>JP Morgan: -38%<br>Transports: -36%<br>Russell 2000: -35%<br>FANGs: -28%<br>S&amp;P 500: -27%<br>Nasdaq 100: -25%<br>Amazon: -23%<br>Consumer Staples: -19%<br>Gold: -7%<br>Cash: 0%<br><br>via: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BearTrapsReport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BearTrapsReport</a></p>&mdash; Lawrence McDonald (@Convertbond) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Convertbond/status/1238211971717181441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T21:50:22.951Z\">at 9.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6aac1a8f08c2df6d2789d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T21:42:11.908Z\">9.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tho\u2019 markets in the US and Europe are closed, the futures markets are still open.</strong></p> <p>And they suggest markets are going to fall again tomorrow, with the German DAX currently 3% lower on IG\u2019s overnight futures trading. </p> <p>Not a good sign for Friday.

This is a world away from the bill purchases, which effectively just allowed banks to swap bills for reserves at the Fed. This action will offset the inevitable downward pressure on money supply growth as economic activity contracts. It should weaken the dollar and raise asset prices, other things equal. They won\u2019t be, but these actions should limit the damage. We expect the FOMC to announce indefinite purchases at next week\u2019s meeting, alongside a rate cut of at least 50bp.

It is one of the world\u2019s largest central banks, and today markets were crying out for a backstop; they got anything but. Ms. Lagarde spent significant energy on the press conference calling on fiscal policy coordination as the key tool to deal with the fallout from Covid-19. This is self-evident, but it is also extremely tone-deaf at the current juncture. We are not in the business of expressing what we think policymakers should do, but we\u2019ll make an exception on this occasion.

She even delivered the astonishing signal that the ECB is \u201cnot here to close spreads\u201d with the result that BTP yields are up over 50bp as I type, and this is an economy that has just imposed a lockdown of its economy to combat Covid-19. We are very certain that Ms. Lagarde will have to eat those particular words in due course.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a599e8f085f0b8d9474b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:48:22.172Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b24a3580767993de604c879d2813611e59013940\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b24a3580767993de604c879d2813611e59013940/0_0_821_448/500.jpg\" alt=\"The FTSE 100 over the last decade\" width=\"500\" height=\"273\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The FTSE 100 is plunging to its lowest point since May 2012 today</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:48:33.854Z\">at 3.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a58848f085f0b8d947495\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:44:34.730Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>My god, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is now down 10% - or 590 points, at 5287, as the sell-off accelerates in late trading.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a542b8f087df56e4c75a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:36:01.982Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>We\u2019re into the last hour of possibly the worst session on the London stock market in over 30 years.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE 100 is still showing huge losses, down 9.3% or 547 points at 5330.

The rush to buy dollars also pushed down the euro by 1.5%, back below $1.11.</p> <p>The widespread losses came despite the ECB becoming the latest global central bank to unleash emergency stimulus measures, following efforts by the Fed and the Bank of England, which announced an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-bank-of-england-makes-emergency-interest-rate-cut\">emergency cut in interest rates</a> on Wednesday alongside Rishi Sunak\u2019s expansionary budget.</p> <p>The stimulus measures to try to prop up the fragile eurozone economy included loosening restrictions on lending by banks in the currency bloc, and buying more private sector bonds.</p> <p>However, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, did not unveil the interest rate cut expected by investors and called instead for eurozone governments to step in with increased spending.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\">normally sure-footed Lagarde came under fire </a>after she refused to echo her predecessor, Mario Draghi, and say the bank would do whatever it takes to protect the eurozone from a recession.</p> <p>Referring to calls for the ECB to help ease borrowing costs for highly indebted eurozone countries, Lagarde said: \u201cWe are not here to close [bond] spreads, there are other tools and other actors to deal with these issues.\u201d</p> <p>The cost of borrowing for the Italian government soared, sparking fears of a repeat of the 2012 eurozone debt crisis when the then ECB boss, Draghi, declared he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro.</p> <p>Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the ECB chief\u2019s intervention was a \u201cdisaster\u201d given the scale of the challenge facing the global economy.</p> <p>\u201c[Her] performance will go down as a catastrophic failure by part of the ECB. It is one of the world\u2019s largest central banks, and today markets were crying out for a backstop; they got anything but,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Banking bosses from lenders including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Natwest were summoned by Rishi Sunak and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, to discuss coordinated action to support small businesses.</p> <p>The group of lenders, which also included Santander, Virgin Money and Danske Bank, confirmed they were making more than \u00a320bn available for companies that needed emergency financing over the coming months.</p>",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Fears that the US president had turned the possibility of a global recession into a certainty sent share prices into a tailspin and by the end of a day of turmoil, the FTSE 100 index was down 639 points \u2013 a drop of almost 11%.</p> \n<p>In other developments, the Electoral Commission urged the government to postpone local and mayoral elections in May, while next week\u2019s planned Brexit talks in London were called off. Universities across the country began to cancel in-person lectures in favour of online teaching.</p> \n<p>Thursday\u2019s press conference was told that Britain, where the death toll had risen to 10 and where there are 596 diagnosed cases, is believed to be four weeks behind Italy, which has seen 1,000 deaths and more than 15,000 infections. In the UK, the infection is expected to build to a peak in May or June.</p> \n<p>Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said that worst-case scenario planning projected that 80% of the country would contract the virus, with a 1% mortality rate. This equates to more than 500,000 deaths.</p> \n<p>Speaking at a sombre press conference in Downing Street, the prime minister said measures to tackle \u201cthe worst public health crisis for a generation\u201d could \u201ccause severe disruption\u201d to everyday life for months.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time,\u201d Johnson said, as two more fatalities from Covid-19 brought the death toll in Britain so far to 10.</p> \n<p>Dismissing the belief that the virus is comparable to seasonal flu, he added: \u201cAlas that is not right. Due to the lack of immunity, this disease is more dangerous,\u201d with the elderly at particular risk. Entire families could be told to self-isolate if one of them falls ill, and people should start looking after elderly relatives and neighbours, he added.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"738650bd-fbdd-4ec5-9767-0a8d37b2adda\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ministers and health chiefs are bracing themselves for an imminent sharp rise in infections and deaths. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said between 5,000 and 10,000 people in the UK are thought to have the virus now, as it spreads undiagnosed.</p> \n<p>From now on, anyone with symptoms of the coronavirus must stay at home, schools should not undertake trips abroad and those aged over 70 with underlying health problems should not go on cruises, he said.</p> \n<p>However, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt criticised the government for not doing more, saying that countries that had closed schools and \u201cacted earlier on social distancing\u201d had seen success in halting the spread of the virus. He said people would be concerned that the government had not adopted policies such as the banning of external visits to care homes. \u201cI think most people\u2019s priority is their elderly loved ones who are most vulnerable,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Experts also criticised the measures as too limited to have a major effect and inadequate, given the scale of the looming threat to health.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t see that any of these measures are going to have a big impact \u2026 none of that is really going to affect transmission in the UK,\u201d said Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the university of East Anglia.</p> \n<p>Prof John Ashton, former regional director of public health for northwest England, said: \u201cThis is a kind of ragbag with no particular logic to it \u2026 they are issuing some semi-directive things but they are not really doing what we need to do, which is to mobilise and encourage communities, neighbourhoods, families to form their own plans for the next period in which the local situation will influence what happens \u2013 whether it\u2019s not going out to eat, or stopping sporting events.\u201d</p> \n<p>Coming on the day that Ireland decided to close all schools and colleges until 29 March, Johnson\u2019s decision not to dramatically upgrade the government\u2019s response highlighted again the stark difference between the UK\u2019s approach and that of other European countries, which have instigated tougher action.</p> \n<p>The UK is among a dwindling number of European countries \u2013 others include Belgium and the Netherlands \u2013 not to have introduced at least a partial closure of its schools. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, announced measures including a ban on gatherings of more than 100 people yesterday, but said closing schools would do more harm than good at this stage.</p> \n<p>Flanked by Vallance and Whitty, Johnson defended their tactics.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe measures that I have discussed today \u2026 staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly \u2013 making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home \u2013 these are the three most powerful defensive lines,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But Hunter said older people had been \u201cleft out on a limb\u201d by ministers not setting our more detailed plans to protect their health.</p> \n<p>Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the UK\u2019s response \u201chas clearly not been sufficient\u201d. He and other experts called for much more extensive testing and tracing of the contacts of those diagnosed with Covid-19.</p> \n<p>However, there was broad support for schools staying open, given children\u2019s low risk from the virus and the economic and practical impact of parents left unable to work because they were looking after their offspring.</p> \n<p>Signs that financial markets were starting to freeze up in response to growing evidence of economic distress caused by the pandemic created echoes on Thursday of the near-collapse of the banking system in 2008 and prompted an emergency cash injection from America\u2019s central bank.</p> \n<p>But the action by the New York Fed was not enough to make good the damage caused by Donald Trump, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecbs-plan-to-support-eurozone-banks-is-underwhelming\">botched attempts by the European Central Bank to reassure</a> investors proved counter-productive.</p> \n<p>The prospect of a sharp fall in business and tourist travel prompted concern over the financial health of airlines and saw an 80% drop in the share price of Finablr, owner of the airport money business Travelex.</p> \n<p>But the pain suffered by sectors seen as especially sensitive to travel restrictions and weaker consumer demand was only part of a wider selloff that saw a fall in the share price of every FTSE 100 company.</p> \n<p>Since the markets started to take fright at the economic implications of Covid-19 in late February, the FTSE 100 has fallen by more than 2,000 points to 5,237 and seen its value plummet by \u00a3543bn.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2020. An earlier version implied in the standfirst that it was chief medical officer Chris Whitty who suggested that half a million people could die.

  "<p>Fireworks ignited outside the closed stadium marked the beginning of a last-16 tie that may not be completed next week due to coronavirus. The disease is causing more and more sport to be suspended so when Manchester United will hope to seal passage to the quarter-finals is unclear.</p> <p>Here, though, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side did what was needed, turning in a professional performance, cruising to victory before the smattering of Lask fans allowed entry. Their side did pose an occasional threat despite operating on a budget roughly similar to a League Two team.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/12/lask-v-manchester-united-europa-league-last-16-live\">Lask 0-5 Manchester United: Europa League last 16 \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor us it counts [even if competition is suspended], because to see the improvement of the team, the players \u2013 it\u2019s vital enough,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cIt [the empty stadium] makes it easier to get the instructions on the pitch but of course it\u2019s weird and a strange feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Victory also takes United to 11 matches unbeaten, equalling their best run under the Norwegian, the previous streak coming at the start of his incumbency. Solskj\u00e6r chose Odion Ighalo to replace the injured Anthony Martial and the Nigerian repaid the manager with a fine opener. This was his fourth goal in eight United appearances and the manager suggested his loan move may be made permanent.</p> <p>\u201cOdion has done really well \u2013 we need those qualities for next season so let\u2019s see,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r, who went on to suggest the unsettled Paul Pogba, absent here, could also remain at the club beyond the summer. \u201cPaul is our player and has got two years left on his contract \u2013 a year and the option of another year, so you can expect Paul to be here, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Bruno Fernandes again led the way, trotting forward with the ball during the early exchanges and teeing up Fred, though the Brazilian blazed over. Next he won a free-kick with a slick flick-and-pirouette around an opponent. It yielded nothing and when Lask moved forward the visitors were turned for the first time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae49a93bb729c6e5fa49aa374e8f987e842786bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae49a93bb729c6e5fa49aa374e8f987e842786bc/0_166_3751_2251/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Odion Ighalo opens the scoring in the first half.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Odion Ighalo opens the scoring in the first half.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uefa/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Klauss sprinted in behind Harry Maguire along the right and went down but Artur Dias, the referee, ignored the penalty shouts. Despite this, United were in control. A quick move that featured Brandon Williams to Ighalo down the right had the latter\u2019s cross mis-hit by Juan Mata. Fernandes collected and fed Luke Shaw and when he put the ball in this time Mata drew a corner. Fernandes took it but Scott McTominay could not score with his header.</p> <p>United were warming up. The faster passing play that Fernandes has ignited since his winter transfer was behind a Daniel James snapshot that the goalkeeper, Alexander Schlager, saved well to his left. When Ighalo was signed on loan in January there was derision in some quarters. These naysayers had already been silenced by his three goals but the fourth suggested his arrival may prove a minor masterstroke: the ball arrived on the edge of the area at pace but following a mesmerising juggle he hammered the ball in off the bar to leave Schlager with no chance.</p> <p>\u201cHe had three touches and the fourth was the finish,\u201d his manager said. \u201cAll those touches were high-quality, but he had to make them to give himself the space and the strike is on the half volley, great timing. No one would have saved that one.\u201d</p> <p>While two over-enthusiastic United fans were ejected after breaking into the stadium, the home support nearly had an equaliser to cheer when the ball broke to Dominik Frieser near Sergio Romero\u2019s goal. The forward\u2019s attempt looked to be heading in before Eric Bailly blocked.</p> <p>The half closed with United still in the ascendancy. Another pinpoint Fernandes corner deserved a better header from Maguire. But Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s half-time chat seemed simple: telling his side to sharpen up in front of goal to make the contest comfortable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/12/rangers-v-bayer-leverkusen-europa-league-last-16-live\">Rangers v Bayer Leverkusen: Europa League, last 16 \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First up was a Lask free-kick, though, after Shaw was booked for felling Dominik Reiter. Peter Michorl took it but United\u2019s wall did its job. Val\u00e9rien Isma\u00ebl\u2019s team pressed, but United were able to roll the ball around until Shaw was in position down the left. He hit Mata but the No 8\u2019s first-time effort sailed over.</p> <p>A dimension Ighalo offers is the outlet ball and how he killed a high pass and twisted before spraying possession wide to Williams was a fine illustration. Next he turned creator, helping James to break a six-month drought by finding the Welshman, the latter\u2019s long-range strike his fourth of the season. Moments later, Ighalo might have scored again but hit the right-hand post, Fernandes\u2019s vision again releasing the striker.</p> <p>In the closing stages United added three more. With eight minutes left Mata finished clinically after Fred played him in with a glorious through-ball. In added time Tahith Chong put in Mason Greenwood, who smashed in via both posts, and there was still time for a fifth as Andreas Pereira\u2019s speculative long-range effort was fluffed in by Schlager to complete a satisfying night in Austria\u2019s third city.</p> <p>What happens next for United in the Europa League is unclear. This may be their last action for a while.</p>",

Some people compare it to seasonal flu. Alas, that is not right. Due to the lack of immunity this disease is more dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cIt is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d</p> <h2>UK moves from \u2018contain\u2019 to \u2018delay\u2019 phase</h2> <p>Scotland\u2019s first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a556a8f08c2df6d278562#block-5e6a556a8f08c2df6d278562\">Nicola Sturgeon</a>, pre-empted Boris Johnson\u2019s press briefing, holding her own earlier in the day and announcing the move to the next phase.

The prime minister\u2019s office said Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau began showing mild flu-like symptoms \u2013 including a minor fever \u2013 after returning from London. She and her husband have been tested for the virus.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Prof </strong><strong>Deenan Pillay</strong><strong>, professor of virology, </strong><strong>University College London</strong></p> <p>The ways these measures are developed and issued will be balancing the urgency of trying to flatten the curve of the peak versus activities that are sustainable and realistic. The purpose of staying at home for seven days if you have a new continuous cough or a high temperature is to blunt the number of people contributing to ongoing transmission, and that is a very important step. It will help reduce deaths, but also reduce the number of people who are admitted to hospital and intensive care. From the situation in Italy, we can see that intensive care is one of the services that will soon become overwhelmed.</p> <p>It\u2019s very sensible to try to limit the chances of infection in those at high risk of needing intensive care. We can also see around the world that cruise ships are more likely to have older people, but also that the cruise ship environment is an ideal chance for infections to circulate widely.</p> <p>Banning overseas school trips is a difficult one, but remember that any trips involve groups of people going to airports, going on boats and coaches, and living together, and since this virus is ubiquitous now, anything like that is likely to increase acquisition. We know that children are less likely to get severe disease from coronavirus, but they nevertheless are likely, if they do get infection, to spread it to others. It\u2019s a sensible measure before closing the schools.</p> <p>Many organisations and businesses are already implementing working from home and reducing meetings. I\u2019m surprised there\u2019s not an emphasis on that, it would be good for government policy to reflect it.</p> <p>I\u2019m very pleased there isn\u2019t the sort of reaction we\u2019ve seen in the US to close borders. This infection is now circulating in the UK and it\u2019s important that, wherever those infections come from, there\u2019s an understanding that we\u2019re responsible for dealing with all of them and avoid the xenophobia that has emerged and that would be perpetuated by an insular approach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26c0a16f5c46c255fcc7bb42d19dd3aeeda08762\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26c0a16f5c46c255fcc7bb42d19dd3aeeda08762/0_0_3710_2226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A group of primary school children have a picnic in St James\u2019s Park, London.

Overseas school trips have been stopped due to coronavirus concerns, but schools remain open for the time being.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PjrTravel/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Dr </strong><strong>Jennifer Rohn</strong><strong>, cell biologist, </strong><strong>University College London</strong></p> <p>Empowering ill people to stay home is a good thing. Some might have felt that their employers would not allow this, and the government mandate gives them license to do the sensible thing and stay home just in case.</p> <p>Not closing schools seems understandable to me. Children will be the least likely to be affected, and therefore the least likely to be shedding virus, which is directly proportional to more serious symptoms. In contrast, if you close schools you\u2019re keeping a very large number of parents away from work \u2013 as long as it is deemed feasible to keep workplaces open, it\u2019s probably better not to harm the economy further in this way.</p> <p>I was surprised and disappointed to see nothing on testing. The people with suggestive symptoms should be tested during their self-isolation, so that we can maintain more reliable data about the actual real-time reach and spread of this epidemic, and so that crucially their immediate contacts can be traced. What is government doing on increasing our supply of testing kits and the workforce to go out and test people at their homes? I was disappointed to hear no update on that.</p> <p>People over 70 with pre-existing conditions could get into trouble in crowded settings far beyond cruise ships. I think the advice could have been more broadly reaching for this group of particularly vulnerable individuals. [Banning] international school trips feels very arbitrary to me. What about other forms of travel?</p> <p>Not banning major events now is the biggest disappointment and surprise for me. I think buy-in would be high anyway \u2013 many will already choose not to attend. The virus is clearly circulating in communities, and large gatherings in confined spaces could accelerate onward transmission.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df6d82731c454f25ba8b29cd33896f1448a65bb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df6d82731c454f25ba8b29cd33896f1448a65bb3/0_111_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"coronavirus testing procedure at the pathology labs, Leeds General Infirmary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What is government doing on increasing our supply of [coronavirus] testing kits and the workforce to go out and test people at their homes?\u2019 asks a cell biologist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Prof Paul Hunter</strong><strong>, professor in medicine,</strong><strong> Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia</strong></p> <p>I was expecting there to be something a bit more rigorous. I can\u2019t see that any of these measures are going to have a big impact on the current situation.</p> <p>The guidance about self-isolating if you have any respiratory symptoms for a week is absolutely spot on. I\u2019m not sure how many people will actually follow that advice \u2013 we shall see. But even if people ignore the advice themselves, you can imagine that if they turn up to work, colleagues and bosses will be on their case and there will be increased peer pressure.</p> <p>Just telling elderly people to not go on cruises isn\u2019t enough to protect them. I would\u2019ve hoped we\u2019d be seeing more targeted advice for elderly and vulnerable citizens on what sort of things they should be thinking about. I think they\u2019ve been left out on a limb.</p> <p>The issue for me with not going on cruises would be not so you can protect yourself \u2013 it\u2019s because you could get quarantined for god knows how long. It\u2019s the same for the new advice on school trips: you don\u2019t want them going off and then travel bans come in and they\u2019re quarantined in a hotel. </p> <p>However, none of that is really going to affect transmission in the UK. I think at this point we are being perceived as lagging behind a lot of countries. And presumably other countries are basing their decisions on scientific information too.</p> <p>I would like to see a bit more about why they\u2019re not closing schools and banning large events. We do know, in general, that school holidays lead to a marked reduction of transmission in infections and at the end of school holidays, infection rates take off. </p> <p>I\u2019m sure it\u2019s based on good quality science. But we don\u2019t know what that science is. The science isn\u2019t being shared with us in a way that makes it easy for us to understand the logical basis for all of this.</p> <p>I would hope that more of the information and science that the government is relying on to make these decisions would be made available so we could interrogate it and see if it\u2019s valid. Unless that happens, there\u2019s a risk of losing the trust of the scientific community and the public.</p> <p>One of the biggest reassurances from my perspective is having Chris Whitty as chief medical officer.

It will be determined by the data, which they should be sharing promptly and fully with everybody so that people can decide for their town, village, neighbourhood what they need to do.</p> <p>If everybody reduced the amount of mixing time that they\u2019ve got, that would help to slow things down. We should take this as an opportunity to develop home working.

  "<p>The coronavirus health crisis may lead to a slump in global carbon emissions this year but the outbreak poses a threat to long-term climate action by undermining investment in clean energy, according to the global energy watchdog.</p> <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects the economic fallout of Covid-19 to wipe out the world\u2019s oil demand growth for the year ahead, which should cap the fossil fuel emissions that contribute to the climate crisis.</p> <p>But Fatih Birol, IEA\u2019s executive director, has warned the outbreak could spell a slowdown in the world\u2019s clean energy transition unless governments use green investments to help support economic growth through the global slowdown.</p> <p>\u201cThere is nothing to celebrate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-could-cause-fall-in-global-co2-emissions\">in a likely decline in emissions driven by economic crisis</a> because in the absence of the right policies and structural measures this decline will not be sustainable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The virus has stoked fears of a global economic recession and helped to ignite one of the sharpest oil price collapses in the last 30 years, wiping billions of dollars from the world\u2019s largest energy companies.</p> <p>The economic contagion is likely to stall many infrastructure projects, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/11/clean-energy-investment-falls-back-to-2016-levels-amid-policy-uncertainty\">the multi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/11/clean-energy-investment-falls-back-to-2016-levels-amid-policy-uncertainty\">billion-dollar investments in clean energy needed</a> to avert a climate catastrophe by the end of the decade.</p> <p>The year ahead could mark the first time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/21/renewable-energy-to-expand-by-50-in-next-five-years-report\">the world\u2019s solar power growth falls</a> since the 1980s, according to a report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The analysts on Thursday slashed forecasts for new solar power projects by 8%. It expected sales of electric vehicles to stall too.</p> <p>\u201cWe should not allow today\u2019s crisis to compromise the clean energy transition,\u201d Birol said. He said global governments should use the economic stimulus packages which are being planned to help countries weather the downturn to invest in clean energy technologies.</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe have an important window of opportunity. Major economies around the world are preparing stimulus packages. A well designed stimulus package could offer economic benefits and facilitate a turnover of energy capital which have huge benefits for the clean energy transition.\u201d</p> <p>The IEA\u2019s analysis has shown 70% of the world\u2019s clean energy investments are government-driven, either through direct government finance or in response to policies such as subsidies or taxes. The watchdog has also found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/24/britain-hidden-fossil-fuel-subsidies\">government fossil fuel subsidies total $400bn (\u00a3300bn) </a>each year.</p> <p>Birol urged global governments to invest in energy efficiency measures, which might not offer good short-term returns while energy prices are low but would prove a lucrative investment in the longer-term.</p> <p>The IEA head also urged policymakers to use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/saudi-arabia-oil-price-war-production-increase-aramco\">the downturn in global oil prices</a> to phase out or scrap fossil fuels subsidies, which could be used to boost healthcare spending.</p> <p>\u201cThese challenging market conditions will be a clear test for government commitments,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the good news is that compared to economic stimulus packages of the past we have much cheaper renewable technologies, have made major progress in electric vehicles, and there is a supportive financial community for the clean energy transition.</p> <p>\u201cIf the right policies are put in place there are opportunities to make the best of this situation,\u201d he added.</p>",
  "<p>You\u2019d expect Larry Summers, former US Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton and adviser to President Barack Obama, to twist the knife, and he did so stylishly. By destroying \u201cabout $500bn in equity market value in course of an 11-minute speech\u201d, President Donald Trump had set \u201cwhat I believe is a new world record for presidential market value destruction\u201d.</p> <p>Fair point. Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/eu-condemns-donald-trump-coronavirus-travel-ban\">ban on flights from 26 European countries</a> lacked rhyme or reason. It runs counter to the World Health Organization\u2019s advice and virtually guarantees the economic hit to the US will be intensified. More to the point, the president said virtually nothing about how the US will construct its healthcare response to the pandemic.</p> <p>Trump also managed to lower already-low hopes that the world\u2019s big economies would summon a spirit of collectivism. The US president seems mostly concerned with finding someone to blame while ensuring trade tensions with the EU are set to maximum, the natural reading for why flights from the UK to the US will be permitted (for now).</p> <p>Cue another huge fall for stock markets as investors, having been offered no reason for macro optimism, engaged in a micro hunt for corporate losers. Within the FTSE 100 index\u2019s 10.87% fall, more than a dozen constituents saw their share prices fall 15% or more \u2013 and they weren\u2019t all obvious candidates such as airlines, hoteliers, tour operators or the cruise company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/princess-cruises-owner-suspends-all-trips-for-two-months\">Carnival</a>.</p> <p>Anglo American, BHP and Glencore \u2013 three of the world\u2019s large miners, and thus sensitive to every twitch in commodity prices \u2013 were among the biggest fallers. The moral there is that markets now expect global recession and fear deflation.</p> <p>Then there was Centrica, the British Gas owner that, once upon a time, would have been considered a haven stock. Not now: its earnings will be hit by lower energy prices while its North Sea assets, which are up for sale, will be falling in value by the day. Centrica, unfortunately, is one of the most widely held stocks by retail investors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then came the financial crew of Prudential, Legal &amp; General, Standard Life Aberdeen and Barclays. The whacks to insurers and fund managers can be explained: the former\u2019s capital is depleted when markets fall and the latter\u2019s assets under management decline for the same reason.</p> <p>However, the presence of Barclays, down 17% at 97.5p, its lowest level since 2009, was most revealing. It played to the new fear of financial contagion, meaning previously liquid markets suddenly drying up. The danger is mayhem as financial institutions are forced to get out of positions at almost any price in a desperate search for cash. It happened in 2008 \u2013 indeed, it was a defining feature of the chaos in the weeks after the fall of Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>The worries were clearly justified. Soon after the close of trading in London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/us-and-european-markets-plunge-further-after-trump-travel-ban\">the New York Fed injected $1.5tn into financial markets</a> to address what it called \u201chighly unusual disruptions\u201d in the US Treasury market, or the market for US government debt, which in normal times is the world\u2019s most liquid.</p> <p>Consider the intervention a case of the financial grownups trying to restore a sense of stability via a show of strength. It is frightening, however, that the US central bank was forced into action less than 24 hours after the US president tried to calm a crisis and failed at every turn. More wild days lie ahead, one suspects.</p> <h2>Cineworld\u2019s dividend decision could have unhappy ending</h2> <p>Its share price has fallen by 75% in a year, and has halved in the past 10 days, but Cineworld, the world\u2019s second-largest cinema chain, is trying to imagine a cheerful plot. The industry expects to provide \u201cfun, laughter, happiness and joy to millions of dedicated movie fans, just as it has for over a century\u201d, said its chairman, Anthony Bloom.</p> <p>In his shoes, you\u2019d probably say the same, especially as Cineworld says ticket sales have largely been immune to coronavirus so far. But the decision to lift the annual dividend by 3.3% looks very odd when you read the auditor\u2019s scary \u201cgoing concern\u201d statement.</p> <p>In short, Cineworld, which also runs the Picturehouse chain in the UK, could breach its banking covenants if it lost two or three months of revenue across its estate.</p> <p>Skipping the latest quarterly dividend would save $50m, which is popcorn in the context of group debt of $3.5bn, the legacy of acquisition-driven expansion. All the same, why pay any dividend when enforced closures of cinemas are a real possibility?</p>",

The official number of confirmed cases is 596.<br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson confirmed that the UK was now moving out of the \u201ccontain\u201d phase and into the \u201cdelay\u201d phase for dealing with the epidemic.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we\u2019ll have more time for medical research. We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that people with a fever or a new, persistent cough were now being asked to stay at home for seven days.</strong> He also said schools were being advised to cancel overseas trips, and the over-70s and the ill were being told to avoid cruises. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild -- either a new continuous cough or a high temperature -- then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease. We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that at some point in the future the government would go further, and ask all family members to stay at home if someone was ill.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At some point in the next few weeks we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms then we will be asking everyone in that household will stay at home.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said that at some point in the future the elderly would be asked to stay away from places or people to avoid infection. He did not give details.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said at the moment he was not planning to ban sporting events, but he said this was being kept under review.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we\u2019ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread but there\u2019s also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a mild dig at Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister who is planning to cancel events with crowds of more than 500 people from next week and whose decision to announce the results of the Cobra meeting before Johnson angered some in No 10, Johnson said that Scotland might have a particular issue with the resilience of its emergency services. He implied that that was why the Scots needed a different policy. Vallance said cancelling sporting events could be counterproductive. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On average, one person infects two or three others.</p> \n   <p>You therefore have a very low probability of infecting a large number of people in a stadium and a rather higher probability of infecting people very close to you.</p> \n   <p>And that means that most of the transmission actually tends to take place with friends and colleagues and those in close environments - and not in the big environments.</p> \n   <p>Though it is true that any cancellation of things can have some effect, if you then get a displacement activity where you end up with everyone congregating somewhere else, you may actually perversely have an increased risk, particularly in an indoor environment.</p> \n   <p>So it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t at some point make the decision from a resilience point but this is not a major way to tackle this epidemic.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson defended his decision not to introduce measures as draconian as those being introduced in some other other countries.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The measures that I have discussed today... staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly - making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home - these are the three most powerful defensive lines.</p> \n   <p>We think it\u2019s very important to maintain public trust and confidence in what we are doing, throughout this challenging time, always to be guided by the best possible scientific advice.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He and his advisers also argued that, if self-isolation measures were introduced too early, they would be ineffective - because people would ignore them at the point where they were most necessary.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said he thought the overall mortality rate from Covid-19 was around 1% or less.</strong> It was higher for older people, and people in the vulnerable group, and lower for others, he said. But he said he did not want to speculate on who many people might die from the illness because he said the scientists just did not know how many people are infected. He said, although an 80% infection rate was the government\u2019s top reasonable worst case scenario, nowhere in the world was currently coming close to an infection level like that.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said that the outbreak in the UK could be about four weeks behind the outbreak in Italy. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said the peak of the epidemic in the UK was \u201csomething like 10 to 14 weeks away\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a7aaf8f087df56e4c77e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T18:21:06.369Z\">6.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Nigel Farage critique of Boris Johnson (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a79788f08c2df6d278784#block-5e6a79788f08c2df6d278784\">6.08pm)</a> is still very much a minority view at Westminster.

But there\u2019s a catch, or rather two. First, if you look at day-to-day spending on public services per head, it is no higher than it was in 2009-10 (because the population has got bigger). And, second, if you take out health, which received a sizeable, long-term spending increase under Theresa May, real-terms spending on everything else is lower than at the end of the Labour government, both overall (7% lower) and per person (14% lower).</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be3d989cc63d9d4035285161238d9319379939ce\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be3d989cc63d9d4035285161238d9319379939ce/0_0_938_692/500.jpg\" alt=\"Real-terms public spending figures.\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real-terms public spending figures.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But the IFS also says these figures are potentially misleading, for two reasons. First, they include the \u00a311bn a year that the UK will save because it won\u2019t have to make annual payments to the EU - but they do not take into account the \u00a37-8bn a year that the EU used to spend in the UK. And, second, they include an extra \u00a35.5bn a year that the government is spending because of changes to the rules on employer pension contributions. The IFS argues that taking out these figures allows for a more reliable comparison with the past, and on that basis it has produced a chart with adjusted figures (see below).</p> \n  <p>On this measure, day-to-day public spending in real terms will still be higher in 2024-25 than in 2009-10, but only 5% higher, not 9% higher. But day-to-day spending per person ends up being 4% lower in 2024-25 in real terms than in 2009-10, overall spending excluding health is 12% lower, and spending per person excluding health is 19% lower.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b7e823ec34da069481ab0d7c1aeb734b08b2e24\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b7e823ec34da069481ab0d7c1aeb734b08b2e24/0_0_946_703/500.jpg\" alt=\"Real-terms public spending figures - adjusted\" width=\"500\" height=\"372\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real-terms public spending figures - adjusted</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a58268f087df56e4c75e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:42:49.500Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sturgeon is now taking questions.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What sort of gatherings do you want to cancel?</em></p> \n  <p>Ones that put pressure on emergency services, she says.

He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The OBR\u2019s economic forecasts are a little more positive than the Bank\u2019s, but they are still very weak even before factoring in possible longer term effects from the coronavirus. Projected growth rates averaging barely over one and a half per cent a year for the next five years are feeble and indicative of an economy that is not in a robust position for coping with shocks like the coronavirus. The OBR continues to assume an orderly move to a free trade agreement with the EU. Anything less orderly, or a failure to achieve such an agreement, would weaken an already weak economy even further.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that if coronavirus had a long-term impact on the economy, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would have to revise his strategy.</strong> Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Only time will tell whether any of the numbers in this budget will have meaning once the economic effects of coronavirus become fully evident ...</p> \n   <p>If the long-term path of the economy is affected then [Sunak] will also need to reassess much more of his fiscal strategy when he returns to the despatch box in the autumn.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the plans for current spending were \u201cnothing like as generous as they appear\u201d. </strong>He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Average annual increases of 2.8% sound substantial. Take account of the need to replace EU funding, and factor in planned increases for health, schools, defence and overseas aid, and there is relatively little here for other departments. If this spending envelope is stuck to there are plenty of public services which will not be enjoying much in the way of spending increases over the next few years.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said overall spending is due to rise by 9% in real terms between 2019-20 and 2023-24, \u201clargely paid for by extra borrowing\u201d.</strong> He said public spending would stabilise at around 41% of national income, \u201cabove its pre-crisis level and bigger than at any point between the mid 1980s and the start of the financial crisis\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>But he said current spending per head for most public services would remain well below 2010-11 levels in 2024-25. </strong>He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While austerity is clearly at an end in the sense that spending is rising, spending levels in many areas are set to remain well below 2010 levels for a long time to come.

Given that welfare support is targeted at lower-income households, and that the 2015 package of welfare cuts was so substantial (including the benefits freeze and two-child limit), the average losses for poorer households are very large. For example, the second decile will ultimately be \u00a32,900 a year worse off (on average) than if welfare policy had remained unchanged, with \u00a3900 of that still to come as a result of welfare policies still being rolled out. </p> \n   <p>Welfare cuts have been somewhat offset (in aggregate) by tax cuts. Successive cuts to income tax, through increases in the personal allowance and higher-rate threshold, have been followed in this budget by an increase in the starting point for national insurance, as well as repeated fuel duty freezes. But these changes have been of most benefit \u2013 in cash terms \u2013 to the top half of the income distribution, though this has been tempered at the very top by tax increases targeted at the richest tenth of the population.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dce2e891de391d34268cb33e03c1bb28ecdf1b08\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dce2e891de391d34268cb33e03c1bb28ecdf1b08/0_0_649_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"Distributional impact analysis of tax and benefit changes since 2015.\" width=\"500\" height=\"393\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Distributional impact analysis of tax and benefit changes since 2015.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Resolution Foundation</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:26:24.243Z\">at 1.26pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a33228f08c2df6d2783a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:05:35.612Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>President Trump did not contact Boris Johnson directly before his decision to ban citizens from 26 EU countries from entering the US for the next 30 days, No 10 has said.

He was speaking during business questions, and responding to a question from the SNP MP <strong>Tommy Sheppard</strong> who said that it might be safer for MPs during the coronavirus outbreak to abandon their normal method of voting (queuing up in a smallish lobby while waiting to have their names ticketed off by a clerk) and to instead use the deferred division procedure (voting using a ballot paper). Rees-Mogg replied that he had taken a Public Health England official into a division lobby and been told that the lobbies were \u201cnot a high risk\u201d.

She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mass gatherings, football matches for example, they need to be policed, they need to have emergency medical ambulance cover.</p> \n   <p>We are going into a period where our emergency services, our NHS in particular, will be under significant challenge and significant pressure, we may see all of our workforces affected by high absentee rates because of sickness, so there\u2019s a wider issue here about whether cancelling those kind of events is the right thing to do to reduce pressure on our front-line emergency workers.</p> \n   <p>From a wider resilience point of view, then I think there is a big question mark over whether large-scale events like that, whether it is sensible to allow them to proceed at the moment.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019re looking very carefully right now at whether large-scale events, whether it would be right and sensible given the situation we are facing right now to allow them to go ahead.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The UK government may announce a move towards new \u201csocial distancing measures\u201d after a Cobra emergency committee meeting on coronavirus being chaired by Boris Johnson this afternoon.

He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The US is still deciding the details of what exactly that means, but you are right. As I talked about yesterday, there will be an impact on the demand side of our economy as people are unable to spend in the way they normally would and travel, but it also affects the supply chains for businesses and that impacts the supply side of our economy.</p> \n   <p>As those supply chains are disrupted, the productive capacity of our economy will shrink for a period of time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He dismissed claims that his spending plans were irresponsible. </strong>He said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>I think that\u2019s the right thing to do for the economy. We need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.</p> \n   <p>In the medium term, as you will see from the figures, there is actually responsible economic management and it\u2019s because we\u2019ve had responsible economic management for several years that I\u2019m able to stand here in a strong position to say that we will do whatever it takes to get through this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that his measures were compatible with the fiscal rules set out in the Conservative manifesto.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He laughed off suggestions that he had delivered a Gordon Brown budget, or a Labour budget</strong>. When LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari put this to him, Sunak laughed, and said he would let others make that judgment.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s resignation as Labour leader was holding up the announcement of plans for reform of social care. </strong>When asked about the absence of social care from the budget, he said that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, wrote to MPs last week <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/health-and-care/news/110410/matt-hancock-kicks-cross-party-talks-social-care-crisis-letter\">proposing cross-party talks starting in May.</a> When it was put to him that the government was taking a long time, particularly since Boris Johnson claimed to have a plan for social care last summer, Sunak replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no permanent leader of the opposition at the moment. They\u2019re having a leadership contest, so we can\u2019 formally start that process until they have one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sunak defended his decision not to extend sick pay to cover the low-paid and the self-employed.</strong> In the budget he said that people in these categories would instead find it easier to claim benefits as a result of rules being relaxed during the coronavirus outbreak. This morning he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For those that don\u2019t [have access to statutory sick pay] we\u2019ve strengthened the working of our welfare system so that it works quicker, more responsibly and more generously for those people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also claimed that around half of workers who needed to take time off would get more than statutory sick pay because their employers offered more generous arrangements.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He sidestepped a question about whether he and his family would be able to live on \u00a390 a week.</strong> Statutory sick pay is worth \u00a394.25 per week. Asked whether that was enough to live on, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have strengthened our safety net to make sure we have access to benefits easier, quicker, more generously, and also provided an extra \u00a3500m to local authorities to distribute to vulnerable people and their local communities if they need extra support. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When pressed on whether he could live on this himself, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is a safety net. That is what it\u2019s there for, to provide people to fall back on. It\u2019s obviously not the same as your day-to-day life</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended his decision not to include nurseries in the list of companies that will qualify for a one-year exemption from business rates.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51843971\">The nursery sector has been horrified by the decision</a>. Asked why they were not included, Sunak said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Because what we\u2019ve done on business rates is target the sectors of the economy which are in the consumption side of the economy, which will see a very significant hit because of people\u2019s inability to spend. And what we wanted to do is make sure that they don\u2019t go out of business during that period of time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He accepted that his plans involved making an assumption about the cost of borrowing remaining low, but it was a judgment he defended.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You have to make a judgment about the persistence of low interest rates, that\u2019s a judgment I have to make as chancellor.</p> \n   <p>The reality is these interest rates have stayed lower for longer than anyone expected and keep falling, and it\u2019s right that I as someone in charge of managing our public finances has a view on that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0562573b5aa4ed8b8417232293950b28bd3faf1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0562573b5aa4ed8b8417232293950b28bd3faf1/0_147_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak visiting a building project at Leeds station this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak visiting a building project at Leeds station this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T10:56:06.488Z\">at 10.56am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a00d18f087df56e4c7207\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T09:29:35.590Z\">9.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Stock markets around the wall are down following President Trump\u2019s travel ban announcement.

We are all learning more about the seriousness of this situation and hopefully people can continue to educate themselves and realize that they need to behave responsibly both for their own health and for the well being of those around them. I appreciate the authorities in Oklahoma who were helpful with the testing process and everyone from the @utahjazz who have been so supportive.

I have gone through so many emotions since learning of my diagnosis\u2026mostly fear, anxiety, and embarrassment.  The first and most important thing is I would like to publicly apologize to the people that I may have endangered.  At the time, I had no idea I was even infected.  I was careless and make no excuse.  I hope my story serves as a warning and causes everyone to take this seriously.  I will do whatever I can to support using my experience as way to educate others and prevent the spread of this virus .  I am under great care and will fully recover.  Thank you again for all your support.  I encourage everyone to take all of the steps to stay safe and healthy.

  "<p>Tullow Oil will axe a third of its staff after plunging to a $1.7bn (\u00a31.3bn) pre-tax loss amid a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of oil market woes, which have fuelled doubts over the company\u2019s future.</p> <p>The Africa-focused oil exploration company lost almost a third of its market value on Thursday after issuing a grim warning that material uncertainties in the market <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/07/tullow-oil-climate-crisis-covid-19-conspire-crush-prospectors\">may cast significant doubt</a> over its ability to keep operating.</p> <p>The warning comes months after Tullow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/09/tullow-oil-shares-ghana-stock-market-value\">surprised investors by slashing its production forecast, scrapping its dividend</a> and announcing that its chief executive and exploration director had left.</p> <p>The embattled oil explorer, worth \u00a315bn in 2012, is expected to crash out of the FTSE 250 next week after the value of the company plunged to 16-year lows in 2019 and has tumbled another 80% already this year.</p> <p>Shares in Tullow closed down 31% on Thursday to trade just below 12.5p a share, valuing the company at about \u00a3175m, down from 200p a share last November.</p> <p>\u201cFate seems to have it in for Tullow,\u201d said Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cIf oil prices remain at this level for a sustained period Tullow could end up reliant on asset sales for its survival but the current environment is hardly ideal for securing the best price.\u201d</p> <p>The company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/10/tullow-oil-vows-to-cut-costs-1bn-pre-tax-loss\">emerged from the oil price crash of 2016</a> with plans to explore for oil off the coast of Africa and Guyana. It restarted investor payouts late last year despite disappointing results and the collapse of a deal to sell a stake in a major project in Uganda.</p> <p>Hyett said: \u201cThere\u2019s no getting away from the fact that the next few months will be tough for Tullow. In the current conditions we don\u2019t think there\u2019s much the company can do but batten down the hatches and try to weather the storm.\u201d</p> <p>If Tullow is successful its share price could recover but with its market value trading only slightly higher than the value of its assets the market is clearly pessimistic, he added.</p> <p>Dorothy Thompson, Tullow\u2019s executive chair, said after an intense period Tullow\u2019s oil assets remain robust due to the company\u2019s low costs, a strong hedging position and substantial oil reserves.</p>",
  "<p>Coronavirus is the first major crisis Donald Trump has faced that is not of his own making. People who know what it is like to be in charge when disaster strikes have warned us this moment would come eventually \u2013 and we can now see why they were so terrified.</p> \n<p>Trump in a time of coronavirus is a lethal combination. Everything about the president \u2013 his reliance on his gut instincts in place of expertise, his overwhelming selfishness, and his unfailing tendency to lash out at others when things go wrong \u2013 make him the worst person imaginable to hold the world\u2019s most powerful job in the face of pandemic.</p> \n<p>Confronting the threat requires global cooperation, perhaps more than at any time since the second world war. But Trump and his junior imitators around the world have taken a sledgehammer to the very notion of international solidarity.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/eu-condemns-donald-trump-coronavirus-travel-ban\">Coronavirus: EU condemns Trump travel ban as Ireland shuts schools</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>America\u2019s closest allies were given no notice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">his decision on Wednesday night to suspend flights from Europe</a>. The EU mission in Washington only found out about it when journalists started calling.</p> \n<p>The president has dealt with coronavirus the same way he approached every other challenge in his administration, first trying denial \u2013 and when that failed, blaming outsiders. The disease has slid from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/trump-calls-coronavirus-outbreak-a-hoax-and-links-it-to-immigration-at-rally\">a Democratic \u201choax\u201d</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/we-are-at-a-critical-time-trumps-coronavirus-speech-in-full\">\u201cforeign virus\u201d</a>. It came as little surprise that his speech had been written by Stephen Miller, the author of the administration\u2019s cruellest anti-immigration policies.</p> \n<p>The declaration of a European travel ban was only the second time Trump has addressed the nation from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. The first time was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/08/donald-trump-speech-tv-address-border-wall-oval-office\">to announce the building of a wall on the Mexican border</a>. The administration has made xenophobia its defining ethos.</p> \n<p>It can stir up passions and corral votes, but railing against foreigners is useless against a virus that is indifferent to ethnicity and nationality.</p> \n<p>Slamming the gates shut is also pointless in the face of a disease that already has taken hold within. Its incidence appears lower in the US than in much of Europe so far \u2013 but almost certainly because US has barely started testing.</p> \n<p>And the US is only shutting some of its gates. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/donald-trumps-eu-travel-ban-is-driven-by-politics-not-science-coronavirus&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1584120160309000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGp78I9QE6o0JbAe5fmUfH6-l1Mvg\">The exclusion of the UK and non-Schengen countries like Ireland</a> from the ban makes no sense if stopping the spread of disease is really the aim. Contrary to Trump\u2019s claim, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/health-expert-brands-uks-coronavirus-response-pathetic\">UK is not doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d in containing coronavirus</a> compared with most of its European neighbours.</p> \n<p>It may or may not be a coincidence that Trump has golf resorts in the UK and Ireland. Given Trump\u2019s preoccupation with his investments throughout his time in office, it is as plausible an explanation as any for an otherwise pointless decision.</p> \n<p>On the one strategy known to be effective in curbing the pandemic \u2013 screening for the virus and organised social distancing \u2013 the US is far behind most of the countries it has now cut off.</p> \n<p>The production and distribution of diagnostic tests has been a fiasco. The initial test distributed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was flawed and had to be recalled. Production of new tests has been held back by a global shortage of a key component, reagents used to extract RNA from samples. Largely because of complacency at the top, the US was last in line putting its order in.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/coronavirus-us-healthcare-preparedness-guidelines\">Coronavirus: health experts concerned US hospitals are not prepared</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The same complacency has allowed the institutions that the US now most needs to wither and die.

  "<p>Passengers at New York\u2019s JFK airport waiting for flights to Europe experienced almost none of the chaos reported at European international airports, where some passengers have been paying exorbitant sums to get to the US ahead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">tomorrow\u2019s travel ban</a>.</p> <p>With a single Alitalia flight, from Rome, on the arrivals board at JFK\u2019s terminal two, many passengers said they had decided to leave early and \u2013 without confirmations \u2013 hoped that they would be allowed to switch to a Europe-bound flight today, knowing that with inbound flights shutting down their chances of returning home beyond tomorrow are limited.</p> <p>\u201cI came to the airport a day early because I do not know how I will get home otherwise,\u201d said Pasquale Fimiani, waiting for the Alitalia desk to open.</p> <p>The Wednesday night sudden decision by Donald Trump to close down European flights, he said, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">seemed \u201cvery chaotic</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t think this is the best way to manage this situation,\u201d Fimiani added. \u201cThere are many people like me \u2013 Europeans in America and Americans in Europe \u2013 who want to come back home.\u201d</p> <p>Returning to Italy, where millions are under restricted travel and home quarantine, Pasquale added, was preferable, despite New York life \u2013 at least judging by full restaurants and operating subways \u2013 remaining mostly uninterrupted.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I get home to Rome I will be under great restrictions, but I think the government is handling it,\u201d Fimiani added.</p> <p>Only foreign travelers to countries who have been in the Schengen area of Europe 14 days prior are affected by the new restrictions. US nationals are not affected, though disruption to trans-Atlantic flights is likely to impact US-bound travelers of all nationalities as airlines cut schedules.</p> <p>Travel restrictions would not apply to those who had been in the UK, Trump clarified, and would begin on Friday 13 March at midnight and last for 30 days.</p> <p>Micaela from Austria said she decided last night after Trump\u2019s address to come directly to the airport to try and get home after being placed on a two-hour telephone hold by United. \u201cIt feels like it is just getting serious here now so decided to try to leave today. So I came here to see what flight I could take,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But on the way into the US, on 5 March, she encountered almost no screening checks. \u201cThey asked me if I\u2019d been to China or Iran, but they didn\u2019t ask me if I\u2019d had any fever. I said no, and that was it. I expected much more.\u201d</p> <p>Jose Andres, hoping to fly home to Valencia, Spain, via Madrid, said the choice between staying in America, where testing for coronavirus is still sporadic, and being under the European system of healthcare was a relatively easy choice to make.</p> <p>\u201cOur system is better than here because everyone who has the virus is getting free healthcare,\u201d Andres noted.</p> <p>But with almost empty terminals, a smattering of airline staff in face-masks and generalized sense of foreboding, JFK seemed to be a ghost town compared to pre-coronavirus activity.</p> <p>Curbside attendant Anthony Peart said his hours had already been cut down. \u201cThey says they will increase again when this coronavirus is over but who knows when that will be.\u201d</p> <p>An airport official, who declined to be identified, said Trump\u2019s abrupt directive is not necessarily the last word in the fast-moving crisis.</p> <p>\u201cSaying something and enforcing it are two different things. So who knows? What\u2019s he going to do? Force flights to stop? I think it\u2019s a waiting game.\u201d</p> <p>But others traveling said they believed the decision was a prudent one, despite inconveniencing millions of travelers and helping to cause global stocks to take another precipitous plunge.</p> <p>In Europe, thousands of travelers planning to travel to the US have been left <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmcintire/status/1238019976163995655\">scrambling</a> after Trump issued the overnight order hours after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic.</p> <p>US-bound traveler Mike McIntire <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmcintire/status/1238019976163995655\">posted</a> a photo on Twitter earlier today of the scene at Charles de Gaulle in Paris, France where thousands lined up to board US-bound flights.</p> <p>\u201cBedlam at US-bound airlines at CDG in Paris early this am, as Americans pay as much as $20,000 for last-minute flights,\u201d McIntire wrote.</p> <p>In his statement, Trump said: \u201cThe European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cWe made a lifesaving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe.\u201d</p> <p>But at JFK, as travelers milled around hoping for news from airplane representatives, some said it was a good time to leave the US.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get any masks, not even at the hardware or beauty-supply stores, and even bottles of hand-sanitizer is restricted to one per customer,\u201d said Anna Nobokova-Henry, returning to Moscow.</p> <p>The airport, she said, might be empty but remaining staff seemed on the verge of nonchalance. \u201cNothing is really happening here \u2013 I can\u2019t see TSA or airport staff making any protective measures. People probably are scared but they don\u2019t seem to be taking actions to protect themselves as seriously here.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>We\u2019re starting to get used to seeing games played in empty stadiums, and as the coronavirus continues to sweep across Europe it seems there\u2019s going to be a lot more of it \u2013 assuming games are played at all. For players who are used to selling out every ground they play in, and fans used to being there to see them, this is all very strange. But as a woman footballer I played in front of empty stadiums for half my career, and really it should not affect performance.</p> <p>I was surprised to read what Pep Guardiola had to say the other day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/10/pep-guardiola-it-is-inevitable-english-games-will-go-behind-closed-doors\" title=\"\">about playing football behind closed doors</a>. \u201cI would prefer not to play games without people watching,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to play professional football without the people, because they are the ones we do it for.\u201d From my perspective as a female footballer, if you play in front of 75,000 people or five, it doesn\u2019t make a difference: the game is still the game.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/real-madrid-players-in-quarantine-and-la-liga-suspended-due-to-coronavirus\">Manchester City v Real Madrid postponed as La Liga suspended</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is where women\u2019s football is perhaps purer in its culture than the top of the men\u2019s game, because historically we haven\u2019t had to worry too much about anthems and sponsors and corporate hospitality. We are just there for the sport. At the end of the day, governments and governing bodies across Europe are concerned that gatherings of large groups of people will accelerate the spread of a deadly virus, and that\u2019s what is most important. Some things are more important than money.</p> <p>Having said that, a full ground definitely makes a game feel more special. When I think back over the greatest moments of my career, a lot of them were, of course, the big occasions. When I won the FA Cup with Charlton in 2005 it was at Upton Park with about 20,000 people there \u2013 not full but pretty busy; when I won it with Chelsea in 2015 there were about 30,000 at Wembley; I played at the 2012 Olympics in front of 75,000 people. But then I remember winning the league at Staines Town in front of 1,200. It\u2019s still the same-sized pitch and the same players, so to a certain extent we need to just get on with it.</p> <p>Perhaps players will find the absence of people and noise distracting for a while. That special matchday atmosphere is not there, and the energy you get from the fans, the buzz that can give you a few extra per cent during a game, is missing. I\u2019m fully used to that because it\u2019s been the reality of women\u2019s football for a long time, but for the men it is a novelty. Ultimately, however, once the referee\u2019s whistle blows the intensity shouldn\u2019t change, the football shouldn\u2019t change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8539ba6e00bd27e58b9dbacc53e94dea76dbd4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8539ba6e00bd27e58b9dbacc53e94dea76dbd4e/0_201_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I won the league at Staines in front of 1,200 fans.

It\u2019s the same pitch and players.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Fa/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe in the women\u2019s game we experience the same thing in reverse, when players used to performing in front of small crowds are thrown out of their comfort zone when they find themselves in front of a large one. It could be difficult on those occasions: not distracting exactly, but you have to quickly learn to block out the crowd and not play the occasion. The job of the coach and the players, just as with the men at the moment, is to prepare properly so they don\u2019t let it affect them and just get on with the game. Your focus has to be on beating your opponent, whether it\u2019s being watched by one man and a dog or 50,000 people and a television audience of millions.</p> <p>I\u2019ve just come back from a scouting trip to Portugal, where the final of the Algarve Cup got cancelled. Portugal has had relatively few cases of the coronavirus and scouts as well as players had come from all over the world, but it was felt it wasn\u2019t safe to have a public game. Italy\u2019s squad was worried that with flights back to their homeland being cancelled they might be unable to get home if they stayed until the final. This is a global game that has global responsibilities. In theory a match between, say, Norwich and Southampton is a fairly small-scale affair but increasingly people travel from all over the world to watch Premier League matches. Northern Italy is the centre of the virus in Europe, and though that may seem distant there\u2019s no way of telling whether some people from Italy have travelled to England to watch a game. There are times when caution is the best policy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/leicester-city-players-in-self-isolation-due-to-coronavirus-symptoms\">Leicester City trio in self-isolation after showing coronavirus symptoms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, not everyone will listen to official advice. There were cases in Europe this week of fans who had been locked out of the ground congregating outside anyway to support their team. Ultimately individuals will decide whether they want to put themselves at risk and suffer the consequences, but clubs must follow the government line.</p> <p>One thing is for sure, though: you know when football matches are getting postponed something serious is going on. Usually football is quite stubborn about protecting the game, and avoids rescheduling except when there is no option. Racism has been a problem in the game for decades, on the pitch and in the stands, but it\u2019s not even come close to being taken seriously enough to close a stadium. Sport generally won\u2019t reschedule anything for anything, and this sudden willingness to do so speaks to how fragile we are, and how significant this situation is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve seen a lot of discussion about how much stadium closures will cost the clubs, and how badly some of them will suffer, and I am sure there are professional clubs that will struggle to cope. But ultimately there is enough money in football to get through this hopefully temporary period. Football clubs have always tried to make the finances of football work in their favour but this might be the time to put self-interest to one side and for everyone to support each other, for the good of the game.</p>",

  "<p>Was the coronavirus engineered by Netflix? This was one of the wilder conspiracy theories doing the rounds earlier this month, as observers noted how the streaming giant\u2019s new docuseries <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81026143\" title=\"\">Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak</a> dropped into subscribers\u2019 menus just as the world was experiencing exactly the type of once-in-a-century outbreak it was warning against. Coincidence? Good timing? Massively implausible homicidal marketing strategy? \u201cWe hoped to inform before, not after, another dangerous pathogen emerged,\u201d explained Pandemic\u2019s producers.</p> <p>But now that the Covid-19 virus is disrupting global business and behaviour, streamers like Netflix seem to be in a fortunate position. Public gatherings are being discouraged or avoided, including cinema-going. High-profile releases are being postponed, such as the latest James Bond instalment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/04/james-bond-no-time-to-die-november\" title=\"\">No Time to Die</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51822739\" title=\"\">Peter Rabbit 2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/12/quiet-place-part-ii-release-postponed-coronavirus-pandemic\">A Quiet Place Part II</a> and Fast &amp; Furious 9. People are being quarantined or self-isolating, which means they are trapped at home with hours to fill like never before. In other words, conditions are perfect for a marathon binge-watch.</p> <p>\u201cAmid fears over a global economic slowdown from the widening coronavirus outbreak, companies like Netflix that provide in-home services are best positioned to withstand the storm or even see upside from the crisis,\u201d reported Variety at the end of February, noting that while global stock markets plummeted, Netflix\u2019s share price had actually risen 0.8%. Similarly upbeat was Perry Sook, head of Nexstar, the largest owner of local TV stations in the US. \u201cIf it becomes more widespread in the US and there\u2019s more quarantining at home and all of that, it could potentially benefit our business because we\u2019d become the primary source of entertainment,\u201d he boasted on 4 March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d25264994c61a404ac03079956a527eb534f811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d25264994c61a404ac03079956a527eb534f811/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Craig in No Time to Die\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No Time to Die ... the new Bond film\u2019s cinema release has been postponed in response to the coronavirus. Photograph: Nicole Dove/DANJAQ, LLC AND MGM.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicole Dove/2019 DANJAQ, LLC AND MGM.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That was then. On 9 March the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 7.8% and media stocks were among the hardest hit. Nextstar lost nearly 14%. Other streaming giants that theoretically stood to gain from the pandemic also fell, due to liabilities elsewhere in their businesses.</p> <p>Disney, for example, is set to launch its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/01/disney-plus-coming-soon-to-uk-galaxy-netflix-challenge\" title=\"\">Disney+ streaming service</a> in the UK on 24 March \u2013 another case of suspiciously good timing. Disney+ offers a vast back catalogue of features from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, the Star Wars universe and National Geographic \u2013 just the thing to keep the young ones amused when the schools are shut, perhaps. The service went live in India this Wednesday, 18 days ahead of schedule. But any potential gains for Disney are offset by hits to its cinema business and especially its theme parks: both Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands have been closed since the end of January. There are fears its US parks could be next. On Monday, Disney shares fell 23% (they have recovered slightly since). Likewise Apple, whose iPhone manufacturing supply chains have been disrupted by the shutdown in China. As a \u201cpure play\u201d, solely concerned with the streaming business, Netflix has fared slightly better (its share price fell 6% on Monday), but the overall outlook is bleak: nobody is really \u201cbenefiting\u201d from a global economic downturn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1296164639d3e4fa281e09c0f21fed2eb21d23d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1296164639d3e4fa281e09c0f21fed2eb21d23d1/0_0_2270_1362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cinema release postponed ...

Nor does Martin see potential for attracting new subscribers: \u201cAwareness is already 100%.\u201d Added to which, people in the US and elsewhere might well have been suspended from work with no pay. \u201cIf you have to decide between food and your Netflix subscription, it seems to me like you disconnect your Netflix. You\u2019re probably not going to add another $13 a month if you don\u2019t know when your next pay check\u2019s going to come in.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not the streaming giants profit in the short term, the coronavirus could still have long-term consequences for the industry. That has certainly been the case in China, where the pandemic first struck. Most of China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/23/china-new-year-film-releases-scrapped-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">nearly 70,000 cinemas closed in late January</a> \u2013 just before the Chinese new year holiday, traditionally the most lucrative box-office period. Major movie releases were cancelled. In response, one of them, local comedy Lost in Russia, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/asia/coronavirus-china-lost-in-russia-online-release-1203478139/\">sold its rights to local streaming platform Bytedance</a> (which also owns the TikTok app), which streamed Lost in Russia for free. It was watched by 180 million viewers in its first three days. By comparison, China\u2019s all-time highest-grossing movie, Wolf Warrior 2, sold 159 million tickets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ee9cde4be3f28abbae19eef51c271a3dafee552\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ee9cde4be3f28abbae19eef51c271a3dafee552/18_0_937_562/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lost in Russia film poster\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lost in Russia ... the Chinese comedy had 180 million viewers in its first three days online after its cinema release was cancelled</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Western moviegoers are now accustomed to high-profile movies going straight to streaming, such as Netflix\u2019s releases of The Irishman and Marriage Story, but for China\u2019s booming industry, this was an unprecedented step. Another Chinese New Year movie, the Hong Kong-made Enter the Fat Dragon, made a similar streaming deal with iQiyi \u2013 China\u2019s answer to Netflix. (Netflix itself is unavailable in China except via illegal VPN).</p> <p>Now it\u2019s had a taste of streaming, China is unlikely to go back, says Elaine Yau, a Beijing-based journalist. Quarantined in their apartments, Chinese people have learned to love online viewing, whether that be new movies, cooking shows or livestreams of strangers doing banal indoor activities like sewing. \u201cPeople are getting bored,\u201d Yau says. \u201cMany people in China like going to the cinema, but they\u2019ve been getting into the habit of watching whatever they want, at their convenience, with no need to buy a ticket. So I think this coronavirus is definitely going to affect movie distribution models and earnings. The cinema chains are very on edge.\u201d</p> <p>Could it happen here? The longer the pandemic goes on, the more the industry will be disrupted: falling box office revenues, releases postponed or cancelled, delays and logjams in the release schedules, and ultimately, productions delayed or cancelled \u2013 which affects the streamers as much as cinema companies. As for cinema losing ground to streaming permanently, the jury is out. \u201cI think people have taken up the streaming habit in a pretty significant way already,\u201d says Matt Mueller, editor of Screen International. \u201cYou could see a rebound effect. If people are restricted to their homes because of a pandemic, then by the time it lifts, they will be desperate to get back out into the world, and I think you will probably see a surge in cinema-going.\u201d Mueller points out that despite streaming\u2019s incursions, cinema has been thriving in the UK. \u201cIn the past two or three years we have had the highest cinema admissions ever.

  "<p>Monsanto secretly funded academic studies indicating \u201cvery severe impacts\u201d on farming and the environment if its controversial glyphosate weedkiller were banned, an investigation has found.</p> <p>The research was used by the National Farmers\u2019 Union and others to successfully lobby against a European ban in 2017. As a result of the revelations, the NFU has now amended its glyphosate information to declare the source of the research.</p> <p>Monsanto was bought by the agri-chemical multinational Bayer in 2018 and Bayer said the studies\u2019 failure to disclose their funding broke its principles. However, the authors of the studies said the funding did not influence their work and the editor of the journal in which they were published said the papers would not be retracted or amended.</p> <p>Glyphosate is sold by Bayer as Roundup and is the world\u2019s most widely used weedkiller. The World Health Organization\u2019s cancer agency, the IARC, declared that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/21/roundup-cancer-who-glyphosate-\">glyphosate was \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d</a> in 2015 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/16/glyphosate-unlikely-to-pose-risk-to-humans-unwho-study-says\">several international agencies</a>, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), subsequently came to opposite conclusions.</p> <p>Last year courts in the US ordered Monsanto to pay damages of up to $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) to individuals with cancer and faces many more lawsuits. Bayer said it \u201cstands fully behind its glyphosate-based products\u201d.</p> <p>The new revelations centre on studies published in <a href=\"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/resinf/opm/2010/00000021/00000006/art00008\">2010</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/resinf/opm/2014/00000025/00000005/art00007;jsessionid=224saa9i9qtui.x-ic-live-01\">2014</a> by researchers at ADAS, an agricultural and environmental consultancy in the UK. The analyses concluded \u201cthe loss of glyphosate would cause very severe impacts on UK agriculture and the environment\u201d. They suggested a 20% fall in wheat and rapeseed production. However, other researchers at another consultancy, the Andersons Centre, <a href=\"https://cropprotection.org.uk/media/1139/oxford-economics-summary-report-final.pdf\">said</a>: \u201c[We] believe that this may be rather high.\u201d</p> <p>Glyphosate weedkiller allows planting without ploughing, which helps stop carbon being released to the atmosphere.

However, this was far shorter than the 15 years that had been sought.</p> <p>The secret funding of the ADAS studies was uncovered by a German transparency campaign group, LobbyControl. In December, <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/2019-12/glyphosat-monsanto-finanzierung-studien-usa-hersteller\">LobbyControl revealed two pro-glyphosate German studies</a> that were partly funded by Monsanto and published in 2011 and 2015 without the funding being declared.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an unacceptable form of opaque lobbying,\u201d said Ulrich M\u00fcller at <a href=\"https://www.lobbycontrol.de/initiative/\">LobbyControl</a>. \u201cCitizens, media and decision-makers should know who pays for studies on subjects of public interest. The studies also used very high figures for the benefits of glyphosate and for possible losses in case of a ban.

They are one of the most thoroughly studied products of their kind. We have no reason to doubt the methods, content or results of the studies conducted by ADAS.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah Wynn, at ADAS and one of the authors of the studies, said: \u201cAs with other companies in our field, it is entirely normal for external organisations to fund research studies. However, it has always been our core principle that our research is never influenced in any way by those that fund us.\u201d ADAS is now leading <a href=\"http://www.cpm-magazine.co.uk/2018/07/02/theory-field-stewarding-glyphosates-future/\">another project</a> on glyphosate that was partly funded by Monsanto.</p> <p>Leonard Copping, editor of the journal Outlooks on Pest Management, in which the studies were published, said: \u201cThe authors did not advise me of the source of the funding. For this reason it was not disclosed. Conflict of interests is important but not relevant in this case. The papers will not be amended or retracted.\u201d</p> <p>However, following an enquiry from the Guardian, the NFU has amended its glyphosate material. \u201cWe are happy to add a line to the online article stating that the research on this occasion was funded by Monsanto,\u201d said an NFU spokesman.</p> <p>Bayer said farmers around the globe rely on glyphosate to provide enough food for the world\u2019s growing population. But <a href=\"https://usrtk.org/pesticides/carey-gillams-presentation-to-european-parliament-hearing-on-the-monsanto-papers-glyphosate/\">campaigners </a>claim Monsanto has defended the product by ghostwriting research papers for regulators and using front groups to discredit critical scientists and journalists.

  "<p>A woman who alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Alex Salmond has told a court that he apologised to her at a private meeting arranged by officials a week after the incident took place.</p> <p>The woman claimed that she felt fear and panic that the then first minister \u201cwasn\u2019t going to stop\u201d after saying that he lay on top of her while drunk and forced his hands up under her dress, while repeatedly telling her: \u201cYou\u2019re irresistible.\u201d</p> <p>Witness F, a civil servant in the Scottish government who cannot be named for legal reasons, alleged that Salmond had drunk nearly a full bottle of spirits before he ordered her on to a bed at the first minister\u2019s official residence, Bute House, towards the end of a late-night meeting in December 2013.</p> <p>She said that it was arranged for her to meet Salmond at his office in Holyrood, without any chaperone, around a week after the alleged assault.</p> <p>F told the court: \u201cThe first minister told me he was sorry for what had happened and that it was inappropriate. He said that he had been drinking more than usual, not just that night but in general, due to stress. He said that he respected me and wanted to keep working together. I accepted the apology and confirmed we would keep working together.\u201d</p> <p>The woman was giving evidence from behind a screen on the fourth day of the former Scottish National party leader\u2019s trial on 14 sexual assault charges, relating to 10 women, including a charge of sexual assault with intent to rape against F. The 65-year-old denies all the allegations.</p> <p>F told the high court in Edinburgh that she ended up in a bedroom on the third floor of Bute House with Salmond after he suggested that they move from a private sitting room on the floor below because it was too cold.</p> <p>F alleged that the pair first sat at a small table in the bedroom to go through paperwork. She said that Salmond produced a bottle of the Chinese spirit Maotai, which she said that he continued to drink steadily, while she \u201cwetted her lips\u201d. \u201cI never particularly liked drinking with the first minister,\u201d she told the prosecutor, Alex Prentice QC.</p> <p>The witness told the court that she felt panicked when Salmond told her: \u201cGet on the bed,\u201d as she prepared to leave at around 11pm.</p> <p>\u201cThis was very much within a working environment and culture where you do whatever the first minister asks of you. I was sitting very primly on the edge of the bed with rising panic.\u201d</p> <p>She alleged that the assault progressed quickly. \u201cI was lying across the bed and the first minister was lying on top of me.\u201d She said that Salmond first pushed his hands under the skirt of her dress and ran them over her thighs and bottom, before touching her breasts over her clothing. She told the court that he was kissing her \u201csloppily and rather haphazardly\u201d, while repeatedly murmuring the phrase: \u201cYou\u2019re irresistible.\u201d</p> <p>Asked by Prentice what she was feeling at this point, F said: \u201cA mix of panic and disbelief that this could be happening. I knew that I had to stop this, to get away but how on earth do you actually achieve that?\u201d</p> <p>She went on: \u201cIt seemed very clear that he wasn\u2019t going to stop.\u201d She told the court that she believed that there would be \u201caggression\u201d, and that Salmond \u201cwas going to try to remove my tights and underwear and that he would be pushing the encounter physically\u201d.</p> <p>She alleged that as she continued to try to block Salmond\u2019s hands, his weight shifted and she was able to get up off the bed and leave the bedroom, after saying goodnight.</p> <p>After she left Bute House, F told the court that she felt a \u201clooming horror that this was something sufficiently serious that I would have to tell somebody but I couldn\u2019t imagine doing that, couldn\u2019t imagine saying the words\u201d.</p> <p>As she walked home, she said that she texted a senior civil service colleague with the message: \u201cThat\u2019s an evening that I\u2019ll need to forget.\u201d After he responded with concern the following morning, they met in person. \u201cI was finding it extremely difficult to talk about,\u201d said F. \u201cPart of his response was that it could be a crime.\u201d</p> <p>She said she then decided to take further action, speaking to another senior civil servant and conveying \u201cthat something more serious had happened than the lower-level behaviour we almost took as a baseline\u201d. At a further meeting with this senior civil servant and Geoff Aberdein, Salmond\u2019s then chief of staff, she said: \u201cI used the phrase \u2018get on the bed\u2019 but didn\u2019t go into details.\u201d The two men then arranged the meeting with Salmond, she alleged.</p> <p>During cross-examination, one of Salmond\u2019s lawyers, Gordon Jackson QC, suggested that the encounter amounted to \u201ca sleepy cuddle\u201d on the bed, and that F had drunk a similar amount of alcohol to Salmond.</p> <p>She replied: \u201cAbsolutely not. I refute any suggestion that I cuddled the first minister.\u201d</p> <p>Asked why she did not got to the police if she genuinely believed that Salmond had intended to rape her, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I was processing what was happening through the lexicon of criminal justice.\u201d She added: \u201cI very much felt that he wasn\u2019t going to stop.\u201d</p> <p>Pressed by Jackson on why she did not immediately report the alleged assault if she thought it a criminal act, F said: \u201cThis is to misunderstand the context ... Going to someone outside was completely unthinkable. This was the run-up to a referendum on independence. Everything we did which was outward-facing had potential ramifications which went well beyond personal experience\u201d.</p> <p>The trial continues. <br></p>",
  "<p>Social media companies should be forced to pre-screen all uploaded material to help law enforcement agencies cope with the \u201cexplosion\u201d in online child sexual abuse in the UK, a critical report says.</p> <p>The UK is identified as the third-biggest consumer in the world of the livestreaming of abuse in the 114-page study by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA).</p> <p>Published at the end of the inquiry\u2019s hearings into internet-facilitated exploitation, the report says social media companies appear motivated to \u201cavoid reputational damage\u201d rather than prioritising protection of victims.</p> <p>It calls for the industry to be legally required to pre-screen all uploaded material and adopt more stringent age-verification techniques for users.</p> <p>End-to-end encryption of messages will make it far more difficult for the police to prevent and detect online abuse, the report warns, adding \u201cregulation of the internet industry is now required\u201d.</p> <p>While enforcement efforts have reduced the global proportion of child sexual imagery on UK websites, the report notes, that has not hampered ease of access. Indecent photographs of children can still be reached \u201cfrom common search engines in only three clicks\u201d.</p> <p>Chief constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for child protection and abuse, has described the UK as \u201cthe third greatest consumer in the world of the live streaming of abuse\u201d.</p> <p>Since 2016, as many as 450 people a month are being arrested in the UK for abuse-related offences. \u201cDespite technological advances to detect and prevent online child sexual abuse,\u201d the study says, \u201claw enforcement is struggling to keep up.\u201d</p> <p>As many as half a million men may have watched indecent images of children online, it is believed.</p> <p>The IICSA is scathing in its criticism of social media companies, finding that \u201cresponses appeared reactive rather than proactive; action seemed driven by a desire to avoid reputational damage rather than to prioritise protection of children\u201d.</p> <p>It added: \u201cWe are unconvinced that internet companies fully understand the scale of the problem of livestreaming on their platforms such that they can properly assess whether they employ sufficient numbers of moderators to detect such offending.\u201d</p> <p>They need to ensure \u201cthere are sufficient numbers of human moderators with a specific focus on online child sexual abuse and exploitation\u201d, the report states. \u201cThe value of human moderation is evident from the success achieved by the social network Yubo, whose moderators interrupt livestreams to tell underage users to put their clothes on.\u201d</p> <p>Online grooming appears to be increasing, with up to 10 grooming offences a day, according to research by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). \u201cFacebook, Instagram and Snapchat are frequently named as the most common platforms where grooming takes place,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>The risks have become more widespread because the majority of UK children own a smartphone from around the time they start secondary school. \u201cAlthough industry companies either prohibit or discourage children under 13 years old from accessing their platforms or services, the age verification process can be often easily subverted \u2013 simply by inputting a false date of birth,\u201d the IICSA says.</p> <p>\u201cChildren aged under 13 years old need additional protection. The industry must do more than rely on children to supply their true age when signing up to a platform. There must be better means of ensuring compliance with the current age restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cThe Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) frequently encounters images of livestreams which involve children from western backgrounds, the majority of whom are girls aged between seven and 13 years old.\u201d</p> <p>The sums paid to watch \u2013 and in some cases direct \u2013 the abuse are trivial. Sometimes it costs little more than a pound. The IWF has helped reduce illegal content on UK websites.</p> <p>In one of its main recommendations, the report states: \u201cThe government should introduce legislation requiring providers of online services and social media platforms to implement more stringent age verification techniques on all relevant devices.\u201d</p> <p>From September this year, schools will have to include compulsory education in both primary and secondary schools that will help teach children about the need to stay safe online.</p> <p>Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of the inquiry, said: \u201cThe serious threat of child sexual abuse facilitated by the internet is an urgent problem which cannot be overstated.</p> <p>\u201cDespite industry advances in technology to detect and combat online facilitated abuse, the risk of immeasurable harm to children and their families shows no sign of diminishing.</p> <p>\u201cInternet companies, law enforcement and government [should] implement vital measures to prioritise the protection of children and prevent abuse facilitated online.\u201d</p> <p>The report makes four recommendations for action the government should take to tackle online abuse:</p> <ul> <li><p>Requiring industry to pre\u2010screen material before it is uploaded to the internet to prevent access to known indecent images of children.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Pressing the WeProtect global alliance to take more action internationally to ensure countries hosting indecent images of children implement legislation and procedures to prevent access.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Introducing legislation requiring providers of online services and social media platforms to implement more stringent age verification techniques on devices.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Publishing, without further delay, the interim code of practice in respect of child sexual abuse and exploitation as proposed by the online harms white paper<em> </em>(published April 2019).</p></li> </ul> <p>The IWF, a UK-based charity responsible for finding and removing child sexual abuse material online, is a core participant in the inquiry.</p> <p>Responding to the report, Susie Hargreaves, the IWF\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThere is no longer any reason not to be decisive on taking action against the predators who exploit and abuse children online. This report makes it abundantly clear there is no room for excuses. The internet industry and the government need to step up and tackle this head on.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Burrows of the NSPCC, said: \u201cThis report is a damning indictment of big tech\u2019s failure to take seriously their duty to protect young people from child abuse, which has been facilitated on their platforms on a massive scale.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the UK must lead the way with world-leading regulation that forces industry to acknowledge the inconvenient truth that they are putting children at risk.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It was hard, chilly work for nine-year-old Alfie Perry and his eight-year-old classmate Dempsey Owens.</p> <p>But, after a bit of cajoling from their pals and teacher on a windswept hillside above the town of Neath, the pair succeeded in planting a sessile oak that could soon be part of a forest stretching continuously the length and breadth of Wales.</p> <p>The Welsh government is initially ploughing \u00a35m into its national forest scheme, aiming to link existing woodland with new forests, parkland and hedges, creating green corridors for flora and fauna \u2013 and people.</p> <p>The Labour-led government says the scheme will help it to create new, important environments, meet carbon reduction targets, combat flooding \u2013 but also boost tourism and people\u2019s sense of wellbeing as they criss-cross the country under, or next to, trees.</p> <p>Lesley Griffiths, the Welsh government\u2019s environment minister, was on hand in Neath to help Alfie and Dempsey dig and set out the vision.</p> <p>\u201cWe love our woodland in Wales,\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cWelsh businesses, communities and, particularly, our farmers and foresters, will want to help create the national forest.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bace242acbfbed988bac5caac546b977ebe3d1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bace242acbfbed988bac5caac546b977ebe3d1a/484_548_1946_1168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pupils Alfie Perry and Dempsey Owens are pictured with Lesley Griffiths, centre, Chris Matts, left, and Natalie Buttriss at the Woodland Trust planting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pupils Alfie Perry and Dempsey Owens are pictured with Lesley Griffiths, centre, Chris Matts, left, and Natalie Buttriss at the Woodland Trust planting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Rees/Athena Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Griffiths accepted there would be challenges but pointed out that people had doubted the country could create a <a href=\"https://www.walescoastpath.gov.uk/?lang=en\">footpath right around the coast</a>, but it had done just that. \u201cWe\u2019re a small country. You\u2019re able to do things differently.\u201d</p> <p>The spot for the launch \u2013 Coed Brynau - is a beautiful one. High above Neath, with views of the Brecon Beacons and the Mumbles Lighthouse, Coed Cadw (the Woodland Trust in Wales) is in the process of planting 150,000 trees here by 2025, including rare species such as the small-leaved lime and the black poplar.</p> <p>The estate used to be owned by the coalmine owner and Tory MP Herbert Mackworth (1687-1765), who created a parkland on the hill. There are vestiges of ancient woodland that will be linked with the new tree planting.</p> <p>The area is home to barn owls, Daubenton\u2019s bats and possibly the very rare <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/22/country-diary-best-look-up-if-you-want-to-see-a-blue-ground-beetle-east-dartmoor-devon\">blue ground beetle</a>.

Trees are a brilliant multi-tasker, good for the environment, good for habitats, good for us.\u201d</p> <p>The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/08/best-of-wales-floods-bring-communities-together-to-recover\">the February floods</a> reinforced the need to plant more trees.</p> <p>\u201cIn planting, growing and protecting the right network of trees we can increase our resilience to flooding.</p> <p>\u201cTrees improve air quality, they remove harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, they provide material for construction, they regenerate soil for food, they clean the water in our rivers and they provide a home to all the life that finds shelter in their canopy.</p> <p>\u201cThe project is ambitious and dynamic and will not grow overnight. Over the next 20 years, we will work with all kinds of stakeholders \u2013 from the Woodland Trust to farmers, landowners and school pupils \u2013 to grow the right network of trees that will greatly improve biodiversity, trap carbon from the air and provide economic opportunities too.</p> <p>\u201cThese ambitious projects work \u2013 the Wales Coast Path, which created a path around the entire coastline of Wales, has been a real success story. We\u2019re looking forward to growing a forest that benefits Wales for future generations to come.\u201d</p>",

Downton Abbey (2019)</h2> <p>Perhaps this is cheating (you could as well put on something from your Downton Abbey TV DVD boxset) but a visit to the Crawley family\u2019s leisured world will go down like a non-Christmas glass of sherry.</p> <h2>20. Back to the Future (1985)</h2> <p>The Freudian themes might make it less comforting than other films here, but Marty McFly\u2019s time-travel adventures in the small-town America of his parents\u2019 youth is always reassuring.</p> <h2>19. Quiz Show (1994)</h2> <p>Great performances from Ralph Fiennes, Paul Scofield and John Turturro in this true story of a rigged TV quiz show. A morality tale that is weirdly calming and pacifying.</p> <h2>18. Guys and Dolls (1955)</h2> <p>Cinematic greatness is always comforting: wonderful songs and comedy in this fantastic New York musical with Vivian Blaine, Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons.</p> <h2>17.

Dreamgirls (2006)</h2> <p>Jamie Foxx, Beyonc\u00e9, Jennifer Hudson and Danny Glover in this outrageously calorific double-helping of music and romance, all about the Detroit music scene from the 60s and 70s.</p> <h2>15. Love &amp; Basketball (2000)</h2> <p>Here to prove that sports movies can be as comforting as romances, and that they can moreover be romances, is Gina Prince-Bythewood\u2019s Love &amp; Basketball. Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan star as the boy and girl next door who are both fiercely good at basketball, and pretty competitive, and perhaps not yet ready to confess how into each other they are. It\u2019s a very seductive love story with some sharp commentary on sexism on the basketball court.</p> <h2>14. Jupiter Ascending (2015)</h2> <p>This supremely wacky and world-historically daft sci-fi extravaganza is just what you need to cheer you up, featuring as it does an outrageous scene-stealing turn from Eddie Redmayne, playing the scheming space-lord Balem, an epicene pharaoh of intergalactic evilness. He completely upstages the film\u2019s notional leads Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis who encounter the vampirically arrogant alien clan \u2013 led by Redmayne. It really is wildly silly but very funny.</p> <h2>13. Mary Poppins (1964)</h2> <p>When you want cinema itself to be your nanny, dispensing wisdom and comfort, here is the Julie Andrews classic, cheering you up, spit-spot.</p> <h2>12. Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off (1986)</h2> <p>A wonderfully comforting movie that celebrates the world of idling, skiving, goofing off, and what the French flaneurs called \u201c<a href=\"https://hybridflaneur.wordpress.com/2015/03/05/the-metaphor-in-flaneur-botanizing/\" title=\"\">botanising on the asphalt</a>\u201d. Matthew Broderick plays a high-school kid from Chicago\u2019s North Shore called Ferris Bueller who fakes an illness so he can award himself a personal day in the city with his girlfriend and his best friend, who will be bringing his dad\u2019s treasured Ferrari. The movie bops around the city from joyous set-piece to joyous set-piece and some words from Ferris about how life goes by so fast that you have to make sure you appreciate it.</p> <h2>11. Clueless (1995)</h2> <p>The greatest Jane Austen adaptation in film history is also as richly comforting as drinking a mug of milky tea while curled up on the couch, eating a family-sized tub of Celebrations swathed in a cashmere slanket. Alicia Silverstone is glorious as Cher (the Emma of her day) who is happy, pretty and extremely well-meaning, with a great love of the mall, and an altruistic need to fix other people\u2019s love lives. She achieves a strange kind of intimacy with her stepbrother Josh, an earnest college kid home for the vacation, played by Paul Rudd, and they hang out in the kitchen or huddled up watching TV \u2013 and realise that have feelings for each other.</p> <h2>10. The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)</h2> <p>Unashamed and unabashed at all times, this is an industrial-strength Hollywood heartwarmer that lets you have the feelgood monosodium-glutamate right in your veins. Will Smith stars in this based-on-a-true-story of an ordinary guy who suffered heartbreak and homelessness as a single dad, and gets offered a once-in-a-lifetime shot out of poverty: an unpaid internship at a top financial firm. But he has to keep up appearances in front of all the other entitled Ivy Leaguers while covering up the fact that he is sleeping in a homeless shelter at night.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52x5HJ9H8DM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/52x5HJ9H8DM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>9. Paddington 2 (2017)</h2> <p>At a time when all of us feel like nothing more than self-isolating and eating marmalade direct from the jar, here is one of the most profoundly comforting comedies of recent times, which incidentally shows how a confident nation is happy about immigrants. Hugh Grant gives what many believe to be the finest performance of his career as the peevish, cravat-wearing actor Phoenix Buchanan who steals a precious pop-up book with clues to hidden treasure from Mr Gruber\u2019s shop \u2013 and frames Paddington for the crime. Despite doing jail time, the bear comes bouncing back.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzCx8bMMTOM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TzCx8bMMTOM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>8. Galaxy Quest (1999)</h2> <p>All together now: \u201cBy Grabthar\u2019s hammer, by the Sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged!\u201d Alan Rickman had a glorious role in this brilliant postmodern sci-fi comedy as Alexander Dane, the grumpy British thesp who had his moment of fame playing Dr Lazarus on a cancelled TV show called <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177789/\" title=\"\">Galaxy Quest</a> and now, like the rest of the jaded cast (including Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen), makes a living going round fan conventions, signing photos and reciting the catchphrases to the tragic nerdy fans. But then a deputation from outer space arrives believing the show to be a documentary history of what actually happened, and desperately needing our heroes\u2019 help. Galaxy Quest has one of the cleverest, funniest plot premises in film history, worked out to perfection.</p> <h2>7. The Princess Bride (1987)</h2> <p>William Goldman, who adapted this movie from his own novel, became famous for his screenwriting axiom: \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201d But we certainly know that this film is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/09/favourite-film-princess-bride\" title=\"\">absolutely great</a>: sweet, charming, funny, with a dash of idealism and a genuine eccentricity that distinguishes it from regular Hollywood product. Cary Elwes plays the handsome farmhand who falls in love with a beautiful noblewoman played by Robin Wright. Their love is sabotaged by evil court plotters but the lovers find friendship with the passionate, hot-headed Spanish swordsman Montoya, played by Mandy Patinkin. Great to watch with all the family, or the grownups can savour it all on their own.</p> <h2>6. Notting Hill (1999)</h2> <p>This inspirationally glutinous fantasy from screenwriter Richard Curtis is about what would happen if an ordinary civilian bloke (and a Brit, to boot) fell for a super-glamorous Hollywood star, and she with him. The bloke is the tousle-haired stammerer Hugh Grant (making his second appearance on this list) and the star is Julia Roberts, who had what some of us believe to be her greatest career moment in Notting Hill, and the scene when she tearfully tells him that she\u2019s just a girl standing in front of a boy is a classic. Rhys Ifans found stardom as Hugh\u2019s appalling flatmate Spike who says: \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins\u201d, which incidentally is what happens to the male audience when the arrogant star, played by Alec Baldwin, dismisses poor Hugh from the hotel where he had been hoping to have sex with Julia. But it all ends happily.</p> <h2>5. Duck Soup (1933)</h2> <p>A brilliant and rather prescient satire on 1930s nationalism and indeed fascism, but also a hilarious comedy. The bizarre Ruritanian state of Freedonia, in deepest central Europe, is enduring a continuous and worsening economic crisis and forever on the verge of war with its equally belligerent neighbour Sylvania. But a rescue plan is at hand. A wealthy American widow (played in magnificent deadpan by Margaret Dumont) offers a multimillion dollar loan to Freedonia\u2019s coffers on condition that they install her close friend as president \u2013 and that is the free-thinking visionary and genius, Rufus T Firefly, played by Groucho Marx. Wisecracking Rufus soon causes mayhem in Freedonia\u2019s quasi-fascist staterooms. Is this the US\u2019s quasi-colonialism in action?</p> <h2>4. It\u2019s Complicated (2009)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/11/nancy-meyers-focusing-on-my-movie-kitchens-is-sexist-director-its-complicated\" title=\"\">Nancy Meyers</a> is the Michelin-starred chef of cinematic comfort cuisine and here she serves up a richly flavoured dish of escapist storytelling, a veritable festival of gastro-lifestyle porn featuring very rich people who don\u2019t particularly regard themselves as rich. Meryl Streep is the divorced woman with grown-up kids who is now a \u201cchocolatier\u201d, of all the outrageously implausible things, running an upscale deli-cum-eaterie, although the actual work involved is minimal. Her roguish lawyer ex-husband, played by Alec Baldwin, broke her heart by running off with a hard-faced younger woman who is now failing to satisfy him on the life-affirming laughter front, so he starts having an affair with his ex-wife. You really do need to suspend your disbelief in this world of almost weightless freedom from work and ordinary money worries, but it is undeniably enjoyable and comforting in its weird way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHfRyFyuDKM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sHfRyFyuDKM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>3. Waiting to Exhale (1995)</h2> <p>Waiting to Exhale is basically the equivalent to eating an entire Haagen Dazs tub of ice-cream while watching the greatest daytime soap opera of all time \u2013 and it is tremendously addictive. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play four smart, successful women who are discontented with the men in their lives \u2013 and the way society somehow finds that a woman\u2019s inability to be in a relationship with a man makes their other accomplishments somehow second-rate. But these discontents are showcased in a horribly watchable world of nice clothes and nice cars. It also has a great male cast, including Wendell Pierce, later to be Bunk in The Wire and Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman on the London stage.</p> <h2>2. The Devil Wears Prada (2006)</h2> <p>Meryl Streep makes her second appearance on this list in this fashion comedy movie based on the Lauren Weisberger novel, reportedly inspired by the terrifying fashion empress Anna Wintour. It is a comedy, but without the sharp, angular edges of satire or bleakness that might endanger the comfort factor. New York City is replete with glamour and gorgeousness as the location for this aspirational story: Anne Hathaway is the callow literature graduate from the sticks who somehow flukes a job at the colossally prestigious fashion magazine Runway edited by Streep\u2019s terrifying Miranda Priestly, the boss from hell who enforces a Stockholm-Syndrome love on all her employees and on us, the audience. Stanley Tucci is wonderful as her long-serving, long-suffering senior executive and this was the film that launched the elegant Emily Blunt on the world, as the super-snobbish fashionista who is to be Hathaway\u2019s unwilling guide.</p> <h2>1. Titanic (1997)</h2> <p>There can surely be no doubt as to the No 1 slot. As Liam Neeson says in Love Actually: \u201cWe need Kate and we need Leo and we need them now.\u201d Cheesy it may be, but this film delivers weapons-grade feelgood \u2013 and, at well over three hours, it delivers an awful lot of it. Because, paradoxically, nothing says filmic comfort eating like screaming in terror and being plunged into the icy Atlantic ocean, resurfacing, discovering that for some reason the woman you are in love with somehow can\u2019t scooch up on her bit of driftwood to let you on, and then going back down again, with C\u00e9line Dion in the background singing that her heart will go on. Kate Winslet found her moment of global greatness as Rose, the young well-born passenger in first class who is unhappily engaged to creepy Billy Zane (fated not to cover himself with glory once the trouble starts). Rose finds that she has a distinct spark with Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Jack who has won his third-class ticket in a poker game and thinks himself the luckiest young fellow in the world to have got on board for this exciting maiden voyage \u2013 especially when he feels that Rose is in love with him, and secretly gets to paint her in the nude. (That\u2019s her in the nude, not him.) It is amazing to think that just before this film was released, all the talk was about how it could be a disaster \u2013 how it was going to be like Lew Grade\u2019s Raise the Titanic; what a tyrannical monster Cameron was to his cast etc \u2013 but the film\u2019s instant rip-roaring success simply blew all this away.

His decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/20/spending-review-2010-osborne-cuts\" title=\"\">cut public spending</a> during the worst recession since the second world war <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/apr/29/the-austerity-delusion\" title=\"\">flouted basic macroeconomics</a>, the Keynesian principle that in a deep recession governments should spend more, and was opposed by a majority of economists. It delayed the UK\u2019s recovery from the global financial crisis <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=efd1DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285&amp;dq=austerity+delayed+UK+recovery+by+three+years&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hCmj0KjmZg&amp;sig=ACfU3U2ps8Pg1scNwQbOeRyrztUk04FV6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwid25aD-ZToAhUsREEAHSuYA6wQ6AEwDnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=austerity%20delayed%20UK%20recovery%20by%20three%20years&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">by three years</a>, from 2010 until 2013. </p> <p>When the economy did finally recover, Osborne continued to cut areas of public spending. Rather than a response to the crash, austerity became just another byword for spending cuts. That policy of cutting areas of spending each year stopped under the previous chancellor, Sajid Javid. But just because the current chancellor has put an end to cutting spending, it does not mean that he has reversed any of Osborne\u2019s cuts.</p> <p>For example, the recent budget doesn\u2019t mean that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/29/council-spending-on-local-services-down\" title=\"\">local councils</a> will have as much money per person to spend tomorrow as they had 10 years ago. Nor does it mean that we will have as many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/28/britains-police-chiefs-leader-sara-thornton-says-she-wants-end-to-blame-culture\" title=\"\">police officers</a> per person as we had 10 years ago. The government has stopped cutting large areas of public spending, but the amount spent on those areas as a share of GDP is still far lower than it was before Osborne embarked upon his policy of cuts in 2010.</p> <p>That is the first confusion caused by the phrase \u201cending austerity\u201d. The second comes when we look at aggregate numbers. Some will argue the state hasn\u2019t been shrunk at all; total expenditure is projected to be almost <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-changing-size-and-shape-of-the-uk-state/\" title=\"\">41% of GDP</a>, which is nearly 1% above where it was in the financial year 2007/08. Austerity, they argue, is a myth.</p> <p>This confusion arises for a number of reasons. The first is that the total expenditure figure includes public investment, which is now projected to be at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents/budget-2020\" title=\"\">3% of GDP</a>, rather than below 2% as it was in the decade before the 2008 crisis. This change is welcome, although it\u2019s probably still well below the threshold that would be required to radically improve public infrastructure outside London and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/13/avoid-uk-recession-by-kickstarting-green-economy-says-thinktank\" title=\"\">green the economy</a> by enough to meet emissions targets. I really hope that when the chancellor revises his fiscal rule he abandons the arbitrary 3% limit for the public investment share. When borrowing costs are so low, he should be doing much more to invest, using bodies such as the <a href=\"https://www.nic.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Infrastructure Commission</a> to judge whether state investments are value for money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d0870a58052bd9f66f3e62036dd9b152d34b6cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d0870a58052bd9f66f3e62036dd9b152d34b6cd/0_68_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Osborne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018George Osborne\u2019s decision to cut public spending during the worst recession since the second world war flouted basic macroeconomics.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we exclude public investment, public spending is about half a percent of GDP below what it was in 2007. Yet even that figure is much higher than day-to-day spending on public services such as health, education, defence and local government. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), day-to-day spending on public services at the end of 2019 was just over 14% of national income, compared with just over 16% in 2007/08.<strong> </strong>One of the reasons current spending on public services has fallen by much more than total spending is pensions: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/27/pensions-triple-lock-questions-answered\" title=\"\">the triple lock</a>, which was introduced in 2011, substantially increased the share of these pensions in GDP.</p> <p>Even that 2% fall in the share of GDP spent on public services is misleading, because it includes health spending. Health spending has been steadily rising for decades thanks to factors such as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/jan/16/the-new-retirement-how-an-ageing-population-is-transforming-britain\" title=\"\">ageing population</a> and technological advances that enable doctors to offer more medical treatments. From 2010 the Conservatives tried to hold back this tide by slightly reducing health spending as a share of GDP, but they have now admitted this is unfeasible. Their previous attempts to reduce health spending has left the NHS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/18/nhs-crisis-20bn-standstill-budget\" title=\"\">in a far worse state</a> than it was before 2010.</p> <p>The IFS estimates that by the end of last year, public service spending excluding health stood at just over 8% of GDP, compared to just over 11% in 2007/08. This is the scale of the austerity we have seen. Day-to-day spending on public services, excluding health, is now three quarters of what it was in 2007. Nothing in the budget will reverse that squeeze to any noticeable extent.</p> <p>This government has rightly decided that the Conservatives have shrunk the state by as much as is feasible. Austerity is no longer a vote winner, but the government still won\u2019t reverse its effects; measures such as raising corporation tax or increasing taxes on top incomes would be an ideological step too far.</p> <p>It is worth making one final point about deficits. By spending more to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/chancellor-makes-30bn-budget-pledge-to-protect-economy-from-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">dampen the impact of coronavirus</a>, the chancellor has shown that ignoring deficit targets during emergencies is sensible. It simply doesn\u2019t matter that the deficit is likely to rise far above the OBR\u2019s projection for this year, which were made before the pandemic hit. It\u2019s a shame the previous Conservative government did not apply the same logic during the aftermath of the 2008 global recession.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/rishi-sunak-budget-tories-british-politics\">Rishi Sunak\u2019s big-spending budget throws Labour a huge challenge | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a lesson here for the media.

For in the course of nine minutes, Trump swiftly reverted to type. He described Covid-19 as a \u201cforeign virus\u201d, and took pains to point out that \u201ca large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe\u201d. His doctrine of \u201cAmerica first\u201d \u2013 a phrase he used once again \u2013 forever pits the US against the world, with its implication that America\u2019s purity is permanently under threat of contamination by alien hordes. Trump has used that imagery in the context of immigration for more than four years; it should hardly be a surprise that he uses it now in the context of disease.</p> <p>Equally in character was his preference for the vast, sweeping edict over the detailed, calibrated policy response. What the US needs most is a serious, extensive programme of testing. Currently, the US is bottom of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StewartWood/status/1238015271346020352?s=20\" title=\"\">global league</a> table for coronavirus testing, at a rate of just five people in every million. (South Korea is testing 3,692 people per million.) But that kind of announcement would require too much work, not least because Trump shut down the dedicated Obama-era, White House unit that had focused on preparedness against a global pandemic. It would be too dull and plodding for the man who made his name issuing orders on The Apprentice. Trump prefers the kingly diktat that makes instant headlines and good TV. In the 2016 campaign it was his call for a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\" title=\"\">total and complete shutdown</a>\u201d on Muslims entering the US.

But because this is Trump, his short speech was riddled with errors that had to be rapidly corrected \u2013 thereby spreading confusion rather than clarity. One example: he announced that his Europe ban would \u201capply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo\u201d across the Atlantic, prompting the White House to rush out a statement explaining that the president had got it wrong, and that the new policy would, in fact, only apply to people, not goods. If the plan was to project a White House coolly capable in the face of a crisis, that mix-up and Trump\u2019s halting discomfort in front of the teleprompter conveyed the precise opposite.</p> <p>Above all, the new policy lacked rhyme or reason. Why keep out almost all Europeans, as if this problem is exclusive to Europe (and China), rather than global, and when the US has a rising infection problem all its own? And why exempt the UK, which is hardly coronavirus-free? There was no explanation, so speculation filled the vacuum. Could it be a politically motivated swipe at the EU, which Trump once said he regarded as the US\u2019s greatest \u201cfoe\u201d, pointedly giving preferential treatment to Brexit Britain? Was it driven by a motive as base as the fact that Trump has <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/trumps-travel-ban-sidesteps-his-own-european-resorts/\" title=\"\">golf courses in the UK</a> (and Ireland), and he didn\u2019t want to harm his own businesses? Or did it spring from a crudely racist worldview that divides the globe into a clean, acceptable Anglosphere set against a tainted, diseased \u201cabroad\u201d?</p> <p>Whatever the explanation, the address did not work. The clearest proof came in the metric Trump understands best and that terrifies him most, because he believes it holds the key to his prospects of re-election.

  "<p>\u201cCivilisation is in crisis,\u201d warned the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/17/how-diet-latest-front-culture-wars-eat-less-meat-lancet\" title=\"\">EAT-Lancet international commission</a> of food scientists last year. \u201cWe can no longer feed our population a healthy diet while balancing planetary resources. For the first time in 200,000 years of human history, we are severely out of synchronisation with the planet and nature.\u201d We face climate crisis, ecological destruction, record obesity rates and rising hunger: food is threatening our future.</p> <p>Carolyn Steel recognises these challenges, but she also sees food as \u201cby far the most powerful medium available to us for thinking and acting together to change the world for the better\u201d. By reconfiguring our relationship with food, she argues, we can find new and better ways of living that will arrest the damage we are doing to ourselves and the Earth.</p> <p>Our world, Steel writes, is a \u201cSitopia\u201d, a \u201cfood place\u201d \u2013 from the Greek words <em>sitos</em> and <em>topos</em> \u2013 where everything from our environment to our societies to our bodies has been affected by our relationship with food, which \u201cpreceded us, anticipates us, sustains us\u201d. It shapes our lives, but since its influence is so pervasive, we often fail to notice it. Thinking about its realities can also make us uncomfortable. We don\u2019t want to know about the vast cruelty of industrialised meat and dairy production, the exploitation of migrant labourers, the deforestation and drought that are eating into the landscape of the global south, or how our addiction to processed foods is making us fat and ill.</p> <p>The toxic core of our current conundrum is the lack of value we place on food. \u201cCheap food is an oxymoron,\u201d Steel argues \u2013 low supermarket prices hide the costs of pollution, ecological destruction, poverty and obesity. She calls for a revelation of the true cost of food that will make industrial agriculture unaffordable and invigorate ecologically produced organic food, creating a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d in which \u201cthe market would favour foods that nurtured nature, animals and people\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5cd4a701fa1cc344b09c92947bc1110b09aac7d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cd4a701fa1cc344b09c92947bc1110b09aac7d6/0_0_1464_2000/732.jpg\" alt=\"A man works on his land in the mountains overlooking the Mondragon Cooperative.\" width=\"732\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man works on his land in the mountains overlooking the Mondragon Cooperative.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Dimis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Steel\u2019s range is vast and the book\u2019s breadth of subjects reinforces her conception that food influences everything, and that our troubled modern relationship with it reflects deeper existential problems. She argues that a loss of culinary heritage has created \u201ca deep confusion about what and how to eat\u201d. At times, this can drift into excessive nostalgia for the traditional (\u201cif you want to eat bhel puri and aloo tikki the traditional way, you had better get yourself off to India quick\u201d) or a lost past: \u201cwhile life in a pre-industrial household was tough\u201d, she writes, \u201cit had qualities that modern life also lacks: a clear sense of purpose and belonging\u201d.</p> <p>But she is well aware of the long history of anxieties over how we should eat and live, and moves skilfully through the answers offered by Greek Stoics, Enlightenment philosophers, clean-living crusaders and many in between. By moving away from asking ourselves such questions \u2013 \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for that!\u201d an exasperated businessman told Steel \u2013 we have forgotten where value really lies. A new \u201cSitopian contract\u201d would \u201cestablish the right of every human and non-human to eat well\u201d.</p> <p>Such shifts would require enormous change and Steel sketches a \u201cSitopian economics\u201d that would put food and its intrinsic value at the heart of economic life. In the slow food movement, \u201cslow money\u201d social investing and \u201cguerrilla localism\u201d, she sees the roots of new and democratic ways of reorganising commerce for a society whose new golden rule would be \u201cFeed thy neighbour as thyself\u201d. This radical revolution is unlikely to come from government, and anarchism\u2019s time, Steel writes, has arguably come. While truly anarchist societies would be \u201cnear-impossible to build or sustain\u201d, Steel feels its core message is perfect for an age squeezed by \u201cthe fatal duality of neoliberalism and totalitarianism\u201d. She draws inspiration from Peter Kropotkin and Pierre\u2011Joseph Proudhon in their desire for a third form of society between communism and capitalism, in which communities are freed from excesses of property and authority.</p> <p>Wealth taxes \u2013 \u201cIt is not necessary to confiscate land,\u201d Henry George wrote, \u201conly to confiscate rent\u201d \u2013 would \u201cre-establish the land as the true source of our common wealth\u201d, Steel believes, diminishing the value of property in ways that would free urban and rural communities to create vibrant and innovative new ways of living together. She highlights the Beddington Zero Energy Development (BedZED), vertical urban farms, the \u201cPreston model\u201d of urban regeneration, and the Basque country\u2019s Mondragon cooperatives: alternatives are possible.</p> <p>Steel is an architect by trade and training, and her expertise shines on the urban environment. Her previous book, <em>Hungry City</em>, explored how our vast conurbations feed themselves, and here she traces food\u2019s role in urban development from Sumerian Uruk to Renaissance Siena, industrial Chicago to postwar garden cities. Urban planning, she argues, is one of our most urgent tasks \u2013 to replace the wild sprawl of megacities with more considered urban forms that rethink how we can create socially and environmentally sustainable cities. She imagines city and country brought into harmony, with urban and rural dwellers enjoying commonly owned forest gardens and wild farms.</p> <p>She wonders if \u201csuch a vision is hopelessly utopian\u201d, and indeed it is hard to see how such change could be extended to the societies of totalitarian China and rapidly indutrialising India, to the conflict-ridden Middle East, or to the diversity of Africa. Certainly doing so would require culturally specific considerations of the way food intersects with inequality, race and power. In the age of Trump and Brexit, Putin and Bolsonaro, it is difficult to see how food-focused anarchism can help us create \u201ca new stratum of global governance, a polycentric network of nested local groups and international bodies based on the shared management of common resources\u201d.</p> <p>Utopian thinking, however, is by its very nature unrealistic by the standards of the world it seeks to transform. It is the industrialism and imperialism of the west that created many of today\u2019s crises, Steel argues, so it is the west\u2019s collective duty to explore alternative models of what she calls \u201csocial maturity\u201d. The deepest message of this ambitious book is a philosophical one, a vital call for us to rediscover the way that food binds us to each other and to the natural world, and in doing so find new ways of living.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Christopher Kissane\u2019s Food, Religion &amp; Communities in Early Modern Europe is published by Bloomsbury.

  "<p>Migrants on the Greek islands are to be offered \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,764) per person to go home under a voluntary scheme launched by the European Union in an attempt to ease <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/greeks-clash-again-with-riot-police-over-new-migrant-camps\">desperate conditions in camps</a>.</p> <p>The amount is more than five times the usual sum offered to migrants to help them rebuild their lives in their country of origin, under voluntary returns programmes run by the United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration (IOM).</p> <p>The offer will last one month, as the commission fears an open-ended scheme would attract more migrants to Europe. It will not apply to refugees who have no homes to return to, but is intended to incentivise migrants seeking better living standards to leave the islands.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, said the scheme was \u201ca window of opportunity for a targeted group\u201d, adding that the IOM would run the scheme with the EU border agency Frontex.</p> <p>\u201cRefugees will not return, of course, they can\u2019t return, but economic migrants that maybe know they will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/greece-warned-by-eu-it-must-uphold-the-right-to-asylum\">not get a positive asylum decision</a> could be interested in doing that,\u201d she told a small group of reporters.</p> <p>The scheme, she said, could be a quick way to relieve the pressure on camps on the Greek islands, where conditions are \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>The commission said it hoped 5,000 people will take up the offer, although it acknowledged it lacked statistics on how many people on the Greek islands were \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d, rather than refugees. Migrants on the Greek mainland were likely to be offered extra money to leave \u2013 much less than \u20ac2,000, but higher than the usual resettlement sum of \u20ac370.</p> <p>Since 2016, 18,151 people have chosen to return home from Greece under a voluntary returns programme funded by the EU and run by the IOM. Only about one-fifth of them (3,927) were on the islands.</p> <p>The extra money will come from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/migration-eu-praises-greece-as-shield-after-turkey-opens-border\">\u20ac700m emergency aid for Greece from the EU budget</a> promised by the commission earlier this month, after Turkey announced it was \u201copening the gates\u201d and sending migrants to Europe.</p> <p>The EU executive is also attempting to persuade more governments to take in unaccompanied children on the Greek islands. On Thursday, it emerged that Croatia and Ireland have joined Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal in agreeing to take in unaccompanied minors. Around 1,600 children will be distributed among the seven countries.</p> <p>Even before the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/erdogan-compares-greek-border-crackdown-to-nazi-atrocities\">flare-up in tensions at the Greek-Turkish border</a>, the UN refugee agency reported last month that more than 36,000 asylum seekers were staying in reception centres across five islands, originally designed for 5,400 people.</p> <p>Thousands are living in small tents with no electricity, heating or hot water.

About 85% of last year\u2019s arrivals were refugees, with most coming from Afghanistan and Syria, but also from Iraq, Palestine, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere.</p> <p>More than 18,300 Moria residents were living in a facility designed for 2,200, while others were living in nearby olive groves.</p> <p>Earlier this month, doctors volunteering at Moria were forced to flee after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/we-left-fearing-for-our-lives-doctors-set-upon-by-mob-in-lesbos\">attacked</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/we-left-fearing-for-our-lives-doctors-set-upon-by-mob-in-lesbos\"> by a mob carrying large sticks studded with nails</a>.

  "<p>The concentration of cocaine in London\u2019s sewers may have fallen by almost a third over three years, new research has suggested. Wastewater tests taken over a week in April 2019, published by the EU\u2019s drugs agency on Thursday, appeared to indicate a drop in consumption in the capital.</p> <p>The study\u2019s lead researcher, Dr Leon Barron, from King\u2019s College London, said the cocaine market in the city may have begun to be saturated. However, he noted tests at other times of the year could have delivered different results and urged caution in extrapolating his findings.</p> <p>\u201cMore regular monitoring in London and ideally across several locations is required to build up a more accurate national picture before we can conclude that cocaine use has actually dropped in the UK,\u201d Barron said.</p> <p>\u201cIt remains a major problem in London and wastewater analysis provides a unique way to help understand illicit drug use trends on a population level in near-real time.\u201d</p> <p>But while cocaine is far more prevalent in Antwerp and Amsterdam, according to the European monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction data, it remains widespread in London.</p> <p>In the city\u2019s wastewater per 1,000 people, there was 619mg of benzoylecgonine, the compound produced when the body breaks down cocaine, compared with 895mg in 2016 \u2013 a 31% fall. The research was not undertaken in 2017 and 2018.</p> <p>Last month, a landmark independent review commissioned by the Home Office reported that crack use in London had reduced substantially over the decade while powder cocaine use had fallen since 2014.</p> <p>Although the stimulant is used widely across socioeconomic groups, prominent figures including the Met police commissioner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/31/middle-class-cocaine-users-are-hypocrites-says-met-chief-cressida-dick\">Cressida Dick</a>, the mayor of London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/27/middle-class-cocaine-use-fuels-londons-rising-violence-says-sadiq-khan-knife-crime\">Sadiq Khan</a>, and David Gauke, when he was justice secretary, have denounced \u201chypocritical\u201d middle-class cocaine users for helping fuel drug-related violence.</p> <p>Recent nationwide increases in class A drug use, which is at record levels, are believed to have been primarily driven by powder cocaine and ecstasy use among 16- to 24-year-olds.</p> <p>However, many young people in London are known to be increasingly using other substances, particularly psychedelics.</p> <p>Seizures of cocaine in England and Wales \u2013 much of which would have been destined for the capital \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/05/cocaine-seizures-in-england-and-wales-at-highest-level-since-1973\">tripled last year</a> to almost 10,000kg, although the amount entering the UK undetected could be several factors larger.</p> <p>Organised crime sources said criminal groups in London had raised wholesale prices significantly over the last 18 months, blaming the threat of Brexit and greater checks at borders, along with the increased seizures.</p> <p>The apparent fall in the concentration of cocaine in the wastewater may also be down to reductions in its purity, after sustained increases in recent years. </p> <p>Lawrence Gibbons, the head of drug threat at the National Crime Agency, said: \u201cDrug trafficking is a global threat and its corrosive effects can be felt in the UK, causing violence and exploitation at every stage. We estimate that demand for all common drug types, including cocaine, remains steady.\u201d</p> <p>Steve Rolles, a senior policy analyst at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, said any fall in cocaine use in London would be welcome, but stressed that national survey data for the UK showed increased usage amid rising deaths.</p> <p>\u201cWastewater analysis doesn\u2019t distinguish between powder and crack cocaine, making it especially difficult to identify what is driving any change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe use of cocaine and other stimulants is rising across the whole of Europe, which clearly shows a failure of the current enforcement approach.\u201d</p> <p>The study also detected 58mg per 1,000 people of methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth, in London last year, while Prague in the Czech Republic recorded the most, at 727mg.</p> <p>The amount of MDMA, which is known to be more commonly used in most of Europe than crystal meth, found in London\u2019s wastewater fell from 55mg in 2015, the last year for which there was data, to 50mg in 2019. Across Europe, the highest concentration was recorded in Utrecht, at 129mg.</p>",

  "<p>When Josh Borden arrived for work at the Google offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday morning, it felt like arriving in a \u201cghost town\u201d. The parking lot was deserted, there was no breakfast being served in the cafeteria, and the nap rooms were tagged with signs announcing their closure \u201cas a precaution given the Covid-19 situation\u201d. \u201cThe office is so empty,\u201d he told me. \u201cEven more so than when the Googlers have their ski trip.\u201d</p> <p>The day before, Google had asked all its North American employees to begin working from home due to the coronavirus \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/tech/google-work-from-home-coronavirus/index.html\">policy</a> that has since been expanded to the rest of its global workforce. But Borden, a triage analyst who has worked for Google for about four years, is one of the approximately 135,000 people who make up Google\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/11/google-tvc-full-time-employees-training-document\">extended workforce</a>\u201d: temps and subcontractors who perform work for, but are not technically employed by, the $830bn company. And though Borden and his co-workers perform computer-based tasks that could just as easily be completed from home as those of other technical workers, Google does not allow them to access their work from home.</p> <p>\u201cThe FTEs [full-time employees] almost all seem to be heeding the recommendation to work from home, while we are sitting here in the Petri dish, with the choice of not getting paid, or maybe getting sick and then putting our family and friends at risk too,\u201d Borden said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from multiple people that they feel like we\u2019ve been forgotten and abandoned \u2013 and that our health and safety is clearly less important than the Googlers\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cOur second-class status now has literal health implications,\u201d he added.</p> <p>In many ways, the technology industry has been ahead of the curve in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook and Google were quick off the mark in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/27/facebook-f8-coronavirus-san-francisco-health\">cancelling conferences</a>, and the industry has for the most part adapted quickly to the global imperative for social distancing by <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-apple-google-and-twitter-ask-staff-to-work-remotely-due-to-coronavirus-heres-the-bad-news-for-the-rest-of-america-2020-03-08\">encouraging employees</a> to work from home.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not only the higher-paid technical workers who are being considered. Microsoft was the first to <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/03/05/covid-19-microsoft-hourly-workers/\">commit</a> to paying hourly workers such as shuttle drivers and food service workers, even if their work hours are reduced as a result of the disease, a policy that was then <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/coronavirus-google-facebook-twitter-contractors-to-get-regular-pay.html\">adopted</a> by other companies. Gig economy companies such as Uber and Lyft have announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-uber-lyft-workers-ab5\">fund 14 days of sick leave</a> for drivers who are diagnosed with Covid-19 or placed under quarantine. Amazon initially announced that it would <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/amazon-adjusts-attendance-policy-for-warehouse-workers-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.html\">not penalize</a> warehouse workers for taking unpaid time off if they were sick during the month of March. On Wednesday, it announced a new policy that will provide paid sick leave for all employees affected by the coronavirus, according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-offers-paid-sick-leave-to-all-employees-diagnosed-or-quarantined-with-coronavirus-11583956318\">Wall Street Journal</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/26/mike-bloomberg-social-media-strategy\">Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign is polluting the internet | Julia Carrie Wong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But why did it take a global pandemic for Amazon to consider that a policy that <em>penalizes</em> workers for taking <em>unpaid</em> time off <em>when they are</em> <em>sick</em> is fundamentally inhumane? Why is it still acceptable to put in place protective measures for some part of the workforce, but not for all? And when this outbreak \u2013 and the accompanying public pressure \u2013 subsides, will Amazon, Uber, Lyft and others go right back to the previous system of forcing the lowest-paid members of their workforces to either work while sick or go without pay?</p> <p>The situation recalled to me the work of Jacob Remes, a history professor at New York University who studies disasters. Several years ago, when I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/10/san-francisco-state-of-emergency-homelessness-crisis\">interviewed</a> Remes about homelessness, he told me: \u201cWhat the category of disaster does is sort people into worthy poor and unworthy poor.\u201d In America, if you are made homeless by a hurricane, you are considered \u201cworthy\u201d and are (usually) eligible for public relief or support. But if you are homeless due to job loss or eviction, you are generally viewed as unworthy \u2013 and scorned by politicians as a sponge on the system.</p> <p>Coronavirus is now creating a new division \u2013 between the worthy sick and the unworthy sick.</p> <p>\u201cBecause there is suddenly more generosity during a disaster, there\u2019s also a lot more policing to make sure that the \u2018bad poor\u2019 don\u2019t get any benefit,\u201d Remes told me on Wednesday.</p> <p>Why should Uber drivers and Amazon warehouse workers with a diagnosis of coronavirus be eligible for paid sick leave, but those with a diagnosis of cancer not be? And what does it say about our society that this sorting is acceptable?</p> <p>\u201cDisasters really show both the positive and the negative things that we have built into society, because they demonstrate who is vulnerable and who is less vulnerable,\u201d Remes told me on Wednesday. \u201cAnd vulnerability is socially created.\u201d</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has shone an unforgiving light on the social architecture that has both contributed to the tech industry\u2019s incredible wealth \u2013 and allowed large numbers of people to be left vulnerable. That workers like those in Google\u2019s Pittsburgh office are falling through the cracks is no accident \u2013 their vulnerability is part of the incredibly lucrative design.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Google said that some employees and contractors were still asked to come into the office \u201cto serve our users and keep our products running\u201d by performing work that \u201ccan only be done by people physically present at offices\u201d. She also noted that Google was taking \u201cnecessary and recommended precautions, including increased sanitization and social distancing\u201d.</p> <p>But Borden questioned whether his co-workers\u2019 presence at the office was really necessary, noting that his work is entirely computer-based, and he simply lacks permission from Google to access it from home. Couldn\u2019t a company with more than $100bn in cash on hand simply pay for subcontractors to take a paid day off while Google sorts out the security protocols necessary to provide them with remote access? I asked.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe this shows how much they really need us,\u201d Borden responded. \u201cOr, maybe it just shows how little they care.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Zambia is facing severe water and electricity shortages after a lengthy drought, with reservoir levels remaining worryingly low despite recent rains.</p> <p>Water levels in Lake Kariba, the world\u2019s largest artificial lake at more than 5,500 sq km, have dropped by six metres in the past three years.</p> <p>In early March, available water for hydroelectric production at the Kariba dam, which spans the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, was about 11.5%, a slight recovery on the record low in January.</p> <p>A year earlier, hydro levels at the lake exceeded 42%. When running at capacity, the <a href=\"https://www.ice.org.uk/what-is-civil-engineering/what-do-civil-engineers-do/kariba-dam\">hydroelectric plant</a> produces more than 2.1GW of electricity.</p> <p>\u201cPeople see the recent rainfall and the flooding and wonder why the lake isn\u2019t filling up, but what you have to understand is just how huge it is, and how much water has been lost\u201d, said Patrick Siptela, a design engineer with the <a href=\"http://www.zambezira.org/\">Zambezi River Authority</a>.</p> <p>It is now restricted to about a quarter of capacity, leading to frequent power outages across both countries, with many businesses relying on diesel generators for eight hours a day.</p> <p>About half of Zambia\u2019s total electrical power comes from the Kariba dam, Siptela said. However, this key source of low-carbon power is susceptible to climate-driven impacts in the region. <a href=\"https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Zambia%20First/FINAL+ZAMBIA%27S+INDC_1.pdf\">Records</a> dating to 1960 show a warming trend of 0.34C per decade.

After months of severe drought, recent torrential downpours have destroyed crops and infrastructure.</p> <p>\u201cSome of our roads that have stood the test of time for years are now succumbing.

It\u2019s not just immediate infrastructure damage \u2013 you realise it has an impact on education, on children who can\u2019t access schools. It also impacts health issues, nutrition, food security \u2013 and malnutrition is holding back children\u2019s development.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6a57fc819ab8801dac3671b38a3d133282dee19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6a57fc819ab8801dac3671b38a3d133282dee19/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children chat on arid land in Zambia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Average rainfall in Zambia has fallen by 2.3% per decade since 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guillem Sartorio/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zambia was also experiencing rapid deforestation of 276,000 hectares a year, Mwape Zulu said. Many traders sell baskets of charcoal on the roadside, much of it sourced from larger hardwood trees. In urban areas, charcoal is used for cooking because it is cheaper and more reliable than grid electricity.</p> <p>Some farmers whose crops and livestock have been hard hit by droughts are turning to charcoal production. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to cut the trees but we have no choice,\u201d said Diana Moono, a charcoal seller who has five children. \u201cThe drought has taken most of our crops, so we have to find some money somehow.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander Kasenzi, the director of the NGO <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hhzorg/\">Harvest Help Zambia</a> said the death of wild animals in Gwembe valley during the recent droughts was unprecedented. \u201cLocal people cannot recall a period when even the wildlife was affected,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Cattle herders abandoned their livestock in the bush and many cows and goats have died from the water shortage. Local women have to queue from 1am each day to access what limited water is available from boreholes.</p> <p>\u201cI have a strong feeling that what we\u2019re experiencing now has come to stay, and we have to completely change our thinking if we\u2019re to survive. It\u2019s getting tougher and tougher,\u201d Kasenzi said.</p> <p>In a remote rural part of <a href=\"https://www.sou.gov.zm/?page_id=5011\">Siavonga </a><a href=\"https://www.sou.gov.zm/?page_id=5011\">district</a>, Lanson Hannidra, an 80-year-old farmer, recalls a comparable period of severe drought in the 1950s. \u201cWhen that happened, we used to go looking for food and beg from our less affected neighbours \u2013 but this time, they too have nothing.\u201d</p>",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The chancellor also acknowledged the impact of coronavirus on the government after two health ministers \u2013 Nadine Dorries and Edward Argar \u2013 and another unnamed cabinet minister were forced to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>But Sunak came under pressure to have a coronavirus test himself after telling the Sky News broadcaster Kay Burley that he had not done so when she suggested that it would be responsible for him to do so.</p> \n<p>\u201cClose proximity to that person [Dorries] would be defined as having been in two metres of them for about 15 minutes. Obviously, that is not something that I have done. Otherwise I would have been contacted by Public Health England and had the contact testing.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/rishi-sunak-coronavirus-budget-speech\">Sunak reiterated a promise in Wednesday</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/rishi-sunak-coronavirus-budget-speech\">\u2019s budget</a> to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to support households and businesses through the worst of the coronavirus outbreak, as the global health emergency threatened to plunge Britain into a recession and unleash widespread social and economic disruption.</p> \n<p>But he also signalled that he would willing to borrow for day-to-day spending to tackle the coronavirus outbreak in the short term.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will this year do everything it takes to deal with the immediate challenge, that\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do, that\u2019s the right economic response,\u201d the chancellor told Sky News.</p> \n<p>In a far-reaching budget statement placing the government response to the pandemic at its core, Sunak said he was making \u00a312bn of emergency spending available as part of a three-point plan to keep public services running as smoothly as possible as the virus spreads.</p> \n<p>Asked about the impact the US flight ban would have on the countries it affected, Sunak told BBC Radio 4: \u201cYou are right, as I talked about yesterday, there will be an impact on the demand side of our economy as people are unable to spend in the way that they normally do and travel but it also affects supply chains for business and that impacts the supply side of our economy if those supply chains are disrupted.\u201d</p>",

Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now,  we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive. Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.  Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We\u2019ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!

Do your concerns around the ineffectiveness of lower interest rates bear much on the size of the stimulus that you\u2019re announcing today?</p> <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg: </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I think one important aspect of all of this is the alignment between monetary and fiscal policy. </p> <p>That\u2019s really important because, as the prime minister said, this is a $17.6 billion package, the bulk of which is going out the door before June 30, and we did welcome the fact that the interest rates were passed on by the banks. </p> <p>I\u2019ve spoken to <strong>Phil Lowe</strong> actually today. And he continues to watch very closely what\u2019s happening with debt yields, what\u2019s happening with bond yields, what\u2019s happening with credit spreads, what\u2019s happening with liquidity in global markets. </p> <p>He\u2019s made some comments about that and obviously monetary policy is the remit of the independent Reserve Bank of Australia. </p> <p>But I think it\u2019s important to understand that this is very different to the GFC in a number of respects. </p> <p>This is not a financial system problem. This is not a liquidity crisis. This is a health crisis. But one of the other differences is that with the GFC, there was a lot more room with monetary policy to respond. </p> <p><strong>This time, monetary policy globally is pretty much exhausted</strong> and we did see the Bank of England substantially reduce their rates down to, I think, 0.25% overnight. So it\u2019s a different situation, but there is an alignment between this government and the Reserve Bank about getting money out the door to support jobs and growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>That is an acknowledgement that the economy is in worse shape, globally, then when the GFC hit.

  "<p>A global summit on food security is at risk of being dominated by big business at the expense of farmers and social movements, according to the UN\u2019s former food expert.</p> <p>Olivier De Schutter, the former UN special rapporteur on the right to food, said food security groups around the world had expressed misgivings about the UN food systems summit, which is due to take place in 2021 and could be crucial to making agriculture more sustainable.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big risk that the summit will be captured by corporate actors who see it as an opportunity to promote their own solutions,\u201d said De Schutter, who criticised the opaque evolution of plans to hold the meeting, which he said emerged from \u201cclosed-door agreements\u201d at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p> <p>His comments followed protests last month over the announcement that Agnes Kalibata, the former Rwandan minister for agriculture, would lead the event, despite her role as president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (Agra), which has been accused of promoting damaging, business-focused practices. De Schutter emphasised that his comments were not directed at Kalibata personally. </p> <p>In February, 176 organisations from 83 countries signed a letter to the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, saying Kalibata\u2019s appointment was \u201ca deliberate attempt to silence the farmers of the world\u201d and signalled the \u201cdirection the summit would take\u201d.</p> <p>Kalibata was appointed by Guterres to serve as his envoy to the summit.</p> <p>Last year, the US national academy of sciences awarded Kalibata the public welfare medal for her work in improving livelihoods.

The CFS was formed in 2009 with the aim of giving farmers and communities an equal say with big businesses.</p> <p>\u201cIf anything, [CFS] has been more successful than anticipated,\u201d said De Schutter. \u201cThe reality is the private sector has felt, whether correctly or not, it was marginalised in the CFS and thus it was tempting for them to establish other forums where they might feel more comfortable and set the tone for discussions.\u201d</p> <p>He called for the summit to be built around the CFS and to highlight and support sustainable systems that worked for small-scale farmers.</p> <p>The letter to Guterres said: \u201cWith 820 million people hungry and an escalating climate crisis, the need for significant global action is urgent to deliver on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2020/jan/15/environment-inequality-hunger-which-global-problems-would-you-fix-first\">sustainable development goals</a> by 2030\u201d.

  "<h2>Donald Trump bans Europeans from travelling to the US</h2> <p>The US president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">has suspended all travel to the US from Europe</a> as he tries to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Passengers from the UK, Ireland and countries outside the EU\u2019s Schengen travel zone would be exempt from the travel ban as Trump appeared to blame European travellers for \u201cseeding\u201d virus hotspots in the US. In a primetime address from the Oval Office, Trump also unveiled a series of measures worth around $250bn to cushion the economic impact of the virus, including a tax payment holiday and billions of dollars pumped into the financial system to ease liquidity. The sense of unease about Trump\u2019s language prompted one former Obama speechwriter to say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">\u201che\u2019s gonna get us all killed\u201d</a>.</p> <h2>Asia Pacific markets hammered again, with Europe and US to follow</h2> <p>Despite what Trump called the biggest package ever assembled to tackle a \u201cforeign\u201d virus, investors were not convinced that it was enough to prevent the world economy from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-global-recession-fears-intensify-as-trumps-europe-ban-fails-to-reassure\">careering into a recession</a>.

When the Morrison government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/02/coalition-federal-budget-2019-woos-low-and-middle-income-earners-with-195bn-tax-cuts-in-budget\">gave people income tax cuts</a>, they didn\u2019t spend their windfall, they saved it. So targeting one-off payments at people who lack the luxury of saving does seem the best way of sending cautious consumers to the shops to deliver the desired economic benefit.</p> <p>That strategy worked during the global financial crisis, and it is reasonable, in the broad, for Treasury to assume it can work again.</p> <p>My only question would be whether $750 is the magic number; whether that is enough money to coax people to get out and spend for Australia at a time when people are fretful enough to be stampeding into supermarkets and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/07/it-isnt-mad-max-police-warning-after-shoppers-brawl-over-toilet-paper-in-sydney\">getting into punch-ups over toilet paper</a>.</p> <p>Because if we cut to the chase, the success of this package requires two things: speed of delivery and confidence in the community.</p> <p>It requires people and businesses to go out and spend their government handouts, not retreat to their bunkers like doomsday preppers.</p> <p>The problem for Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg is a circular one. As a government you can try to engender national confidence by projecting steadiness, by working up a plan and telegraphing it with as much competence as you can muster. But you are also hostage to events largely beyond your control.</p> <p>The government is hostage to people worried about whether they, or their loved ones, are going to succumb to an illness, which is a visceral fear; hostage to how and when this illness will spread, and the practical consequences of the pandemic (health systems stretched, schools and shops and businesses closing); hostage to whatever market-moving madness comes out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth on any given day (which must be one of the adrenaline-thumping unknowns of all).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/what-australian-governments-coronavirus-stimulus-package-means-for-you-explainer\">What the Australian government's $17bn coronavirus stimulus package means for you</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In closing, a couple more things can be noted.</p> <p>The first is that the government has managed to land this package, and the show hasn\u2019t exploded \u2013 even though this is the Coalition, funding cash handouts to benefit recipients. This is behaviour that in more ideological quarters of the government could be considered highly suspect, even if the overarching objective is to keep people employed and the country out of recession.</p> <p>Just remember the Coalition has spent much of the last 10 years characterising fiscal stimulus, including cash payments, as budget-wrecking communism, so assuming the current discipline holds, this collective epiphany is genuinely interesting.</p> <p>It suggests that sober, expert advice and pragmatic thinking can sometimes prevail over the brimming feelings of the overconfident ignoramuses who loom large in public life and make it their business to be as destructive as possible.</p> <p>I was beginning to wonder whether hoping for sense was a waste of energy, and this stimulus package suggests to me that the technocrats, both in the political and bureaucratic class, are still in the fight.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know about you but I find this reassuring.</p> <p>The second thing to note is that the government has been sensible enough to reserve the right to do more in the event it needs to do more. It has given itself scope to go again at budget time in May if it judges a second round of stimulus is required.</p> <p>This is good scope to have, because right now, we need all options on the table.</p>",

  "<p>The first inhabited place on Earth to ring in the year 2000 was probably the Pacific island nation of Kiribati. As dancers on the beaches welcomed the dawn of the millennium, on the other side of the planet, in Greenwich, final preparations were underway for the opening ceremony of the Millennium Dome. This was the night when the first 10,000 specially invited people would finally see what was inside the big white tent in south-east London that had been the subject of intense speculation and scrutiny for the previous four years. It had to be perfect.</p> <p>By 7pm in Greenwich, it was apparent that there was a problem. In the weeks before the event, because of a logistical cock-up, hundreds of guests had not received their tickets through the post. Ticketless guests had been instructed to pick them up on New Year\u2019s Eve at Stratford station, before hopping on the newly completed Jubilee line to the Dome for the festivities. But on the night, body scanners installed by police at Stratford weren\u2019t working, and before long, several hundred people were stuck in the station. When the prime minister, Tony Blair, arrived two hours later \u2013 while fireworks illuminated more than 1 million people gathered in Moscow\u2019s Red Square \u2013 angry invitees, including many of the UK\u2019s newspaper editors, were still no closer to boarding a train to Greenwich.</p> <p>There was more trouble to come. At 10pm GMT, as Nelson Mandela marked the new year by lighting a single candle in his old prison cell on Robben Island, Jennie Page, the chief executive of the Dome company, had just received some further unwelcome news. Rushing to witness the Queen receiving the Millennium medal, a specially commissioned honour to mark the occasion, Page was stopped and, in her words, \u201ctold about the bomb\u201d. The police had received a call to inform them that there was an explosive device in the Blackwall tunnel, which ran beneath the Dome. Blair and the Queen were also informed.</p> <p>About 15 minutes later, Peter Higgins, designer of one of the Dome\u2019s 14 \u201czones\u201d, was giving a tour to Blair, his wife Cherie and their children. \u201cI just thought: this guy\u2019s not listening,\u201d recalled Higgins. \u201cHe was ashen-faced, and holding his family.\u201d During the tour, Blair, as well as the police and Page, had to decide whether or not to cancel the country\u2019s millennium celebration, the culmination of many years\u2019 work and \u00a3750m of investment. \u201cIt was a decision one would have preferred not to have to take,\u201d Page said, gravely.</p> <p>They carried on. The call turned out to be a hoax, there was no explosion, and the stranded guests at Stratford did eventually make it to the Dome for the countdown, despite having missed the festivities beforehand. After four years of politicians and press forecasting the project\u2019s failure, by the time midnight reached Greenwich, just as 39 tonnes of fireworks were forming a \u201criver of fire\u201d down a four-mile stretch of the Thames in central London, it seemed as if the people behind the Dome had pulled it off.</p> <p>The next morning, the headlines told a different story. \u201cThe Black Hole of Stratford East\u201d read one. \u201cThe \u00a3758m disaster zone\u201d read another. Michael Heseltine, who sat on the Millennium Commission, which had brought the Dome to life, blames the standstill at Stratford. \u201cIt was a PR disaster,\u201d he told me recently. \u201cA lot of the people who didn\u2019t get there on time were the very people who were going to report the event.\u201d</p> <p>But for the thousands of people involved in putting on the Millennium Experience, from government ministers to service staff, the worst was yet to come. For the duration of the year that the Dome was open, it was perceived as a catastrophe. Richard Rogers, one of the architects behind the building, said in 2015 that it \u201ccouldn\u2019t have had a worse reception if you\u2019d worked hard to deliberately upset everybody\u201d. Twenty years later, it is still a byword for New Labour hubris, squandered resources and hideously bungled planning.</p> <p>In fact, it was a byword for all of these things before it even opened. The urge to think of the Dome as something pitiable was apparent long before anybody actually saw what was inside. In the final paragraph of Elizabeth Wilhide\u2019s official book on the Millennium Dome, published in 1999, she writes that \u201cits legacy, the Dome\u2019s true meaning, will only be known long after the moment has passed, when the children who are its visitors today grow up and look back\u201d. Now, doing just that, it is clear that the prevailing narrative that the Dome was a total failure is not \u2013 or at least not quite \u2013 the full story.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When we met recently, in a country pub near her home, Jennie Page spoke of her time on the Dome with the same dignified forbearance you sometimes see in military veterans. \u201cThere are a lot of things I will not talk about,\u201d she told me. In 1995, she became head of the Millennium Commission, which had been established to distribute funds generated by the National Lottery. She now carried the daunting responsibility of deciding on a once-in-a-lifetime exhibition to mark the new millennium.</p> <p>In February 1996, Greenwich was selected as the site for the Millennium Exhibition, not least because of the connection to Greenwich mean time, but it would be years before real progress was made in deciding what form the exhibition itself would take. At that point, the commission\u2019s most urgent task was coming up with the structure, or structures, to house the exhibition. Mike Davies, who went on to become the lead architect on the Dome in April 1996, knew that once the site was chosen, construction would need to start as soon as possible. Four years is not very long for big projects. John McElgunn, a partner at Davies\u2019s old firm Rogers Stirk Harbour, said: \u201cIt\u2019s like asking somebody to hurry through their pregnancy in four months.\u201d</p> <p>The building would also need to solve the problem of the site\u2019s exposure to the elements. \u201cIn March, we were on the site, and it was minus four,\u201d Davies told me. Whatever else they did, the site was definitely going to need shelter. Standing there in the bitter wind on the peninsula, he had his eureka moment: \u201cLet\u2019s do a mega cover.\u201d</p> <p>Davies, who always dresses head to toe in red, is still clearly infatuated with the design of the Dome. For more than two hours, he spoke animatedly about it, showing me early drawings like a proud parent with an ultrasound picture. He was particularly enthused about the way the Dome embodied the concept of time. \u201cTwelve months of the year, so 12 masts, 365 metres in diameter, and with 24 scallops, like 24 hours in a day,\u201d he explained. The concept fit the bill perfectly, and was phenomenally cheap at \u00a342m. When plans for the building were released in June 1996, though, not everybody was impressed. Wonderbra ran an ad campaign with the slogan \u201cNot all domes lack public support\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ddcc911767dffd984093fcdcc8ec8f72c766f1b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddcc911767dffd984093fcdcc8ec8f72c766f1b2/0_0_5174_3428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The body zone inside the Millennium Dome in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The body zone inside the Millennium Dome in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Kase RF/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over Christmas 1996, Page and her team settled on a budget<strong> </strong>for the whole Millennium Experience: \u00a3750m, pieced together from corporate sponsorship, National Lottery money and ticket revenue from 12 million visitors. But there was a potential iceberg on the horizon. Although there had been a Labour minister on the Millennium Commission, this was a Conservative government project, and Labour looked likely to win the general election in May 1997. If the new prime minister wasn\u2019t on board, the whole project would be axed. But if the building was going to be finished in time for 1 January 2000, they had to keep going regardless. \u201cThat was a terrible period,\u201d Page said briskly.</p> <p>On 1 May, Labour won the election by a landslide, ending almost 20 years of Conservative rule. The mood of triumphant invulnerability in the Labour camp was one the Dome company could capitalise on. As media scrutiny of the project intensified, with the Sun running headlines like \u201cDump that Dome\u201d, Page\u2019s team put their plan to the government \u2013 a plan that emphasised New Labour-friendly aims. The Dome would, among other things, \u201craise the self-esteem of the individual\u201d and \u201cenhance the world\u2019s view of the nation\u201d.</p> <p>Despite misgivings about the cost, the scale, and the London location for an event that was supposedly for the whole country, on 19 June 1997, Blair announced that Labour was on board. Here, perhaps, was a chance to make a physical monument to everything that New Labour Britain would be about: youthful exuberance, unashamed pleasure, looking with optimism to the future rather than clinging to tradition; a single amazing experience that could bring the country together. \u201cNew Labour really did think it was going to be some sort of quasi-political, sociological experience that would underpin everything that they were about,\u201d the exhibition designer Peter Higgins told me incredulously.</p> <p>Speaking to his party about possible celebrations for the millennium at the 1995 Labour conference, Blair had announced that there were now \u201ca thousand days to prepare for a thousand years\u201d. By mid-1997, time was already running out to get what was the largest construction project in Europe finished before the deadline to end all deadlines.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Now that the Dome had Labour\u2019s stamp of approval, the organisers were faced with a pressing question: what was the Dome actually going to be? There were nine ideas for \u201czones\u201d \u2013 body, mind, spirit, work, rest, play, local, national, global \u2013 but beyond that, not much. Only now, two years into the project, was serious thought devoted to the contents of this exhibition, already being billed by the government as \u201cthe biggest, most thrilling, most entertaining, most thought-provoking experience anywhere on the planet\u201d.</p> <p>Under the supervision of Peter Mandelson, the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC), as the Dome company had been renamed, gave designers a brief that consisted mostly of open-ended questions. For the body zone, they included \u201cAre we what we eat?\u201d and \u201cWhat about designer people?\u201d Higgins, whose company, Land Design, ended up creating the Dome\u2019s play zone, told me \u201cthe brief was very thin, and we weren\u2019t given a budget at all\u201d. For Blair\u2019s part, he was on the lookout for content that had what he called \u201cthe Euan factor\u201d \u2013 content cool enough that his 13-year-old son would want to see it.</p> <p>In addition to the zones, a spectacular performance would take place in the Dome\u2019s central space. An initial proposal from the theatre impresario Cameron Mackintosh, involving an enormous stage and a huge cast including children, was rejected by Page. \u201cIt involved 42 horses,\u201d she told me, shaking her head. Instead, the rock show designer Mark Fisher took over. With singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel, he came up with a story inspired by Romeo and Juliet, which would be performed by more than 100 aerial gymnasts, who would be gathered from all over the country and trained for two years beforehand.</p> <p>There were now 14 zones, each designed by a different company. In an attempt to try to give the visitor experience some kind of coherence, Stephen Bayley, a design consultant and critic who had worked with Terence Conran, was drafted in. Six months later, in December 1997, he parted ways with the Dome, after his proposals were deemed too highbrow. When we spoke last year, in his studios in Chelsea, Bayley lamented the \u201csub-Disney\u201d plans for the zones. Higgins agreed that the project had needed a \u201cmaster puppeteer\u201d, but smiled wryly when Bayley came up in our conversation. \u201cHe was so the wrong person. He sat in one of our meetings just reading Proust in French on a sofa.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"84a94122268081d92c30b84d0b8983c0e2906305\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84a94122268081d92c30b84d0b8983c0e2906305/0_468_4761_2857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Millennium Dome during construction.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Millennium Dome during construction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Avalon/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, Page and her team came up with something they called the Litmus Group to oversee the content of the Dome, composed of cultural luminaries such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/13/alan-yentob-last-impresario-bbc\" title=\"\">Alan Yentob</a> and Michael Grade. Their suggestions were of varied quality, according to the zone designers. \u201cGod, the input was totally worthless,\u201d said Higgins.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Peter Mandelson visited Disneyworld Florida in search of inspiration. According to Adam Nicolson\u2019s richly informative book on the Dome, Regeneration, Mandelson spent this trip breaking into a run to avoid being photographed in the same frame as Mickey Mouse. It was leapt on by the press, which ran headlines such as \u201cMandelson in a Disney about his Dome\u201d. \u201cIt was so predictable,\u201d Mandelson told me, \u201cthe press thought they were entitled to know everything, and anything that was held back, they\u2019d punish you for it.\u201d</p> <p>By February 1998, the Dome\u2019s contents were secure enough that prototypes of six of the zones \u2013 body, mind, spirit, rest, work and living island \u2013 were ready to be unveiled. The launch ceremony took place at the Royal Festival Hall on London\u2019s South Bank, once the site of the Festival of Britain, the much-revered 1951 exhibition that served as inspiration to many of the Dome\u2019s creators. \u201cThis is a chance to demonstrate that Britain will be a breeding ground for the most successful businesses of the 21st century,\u201d Blair told the audience. Mandelson spoke, too, telling the room that \u201cif the Millennium Dome is a success, it will never be forgotten. If it is a failure, we will never be forgiven.\u201d</p> <p>The launch did not go down well. Everybody found their own problem with it: it was too political, insufficiently historical, too populist, not populist enough. \u201cThe moment you have a big project in this country, the forces of darkness gather,\u201d Heseltine grumbled to me. Davies remembers how strongly people felt: \u201cI would go home in a taxi, and this vituperation would pour out about what a scandalous waste of money the Dome was.\u201d</p> <p>Since it was a government project, the government kept tight controls on what those involved could and could not say. Gez Sagar, an ex-Labour party press officer who was now doing press for the Dome, briefed everybody on what he called the line to take (LTT). It consisted of four central messages: \u201cIt\u2019s the people\u2019s show. It\u2019s the most exciting experience of the millennium. It\u2019s good for Britain. It\u2019s going well.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In June 1998, the final piece of the 10 hectares of fabric went up on the Dome\u2019s roof, and the people involved in the project stood awe-struck beneath its complete canopy for the first time. The Dome is huge; weather systems would form inside it if it wasn\u2019t for its Teflon roof, and the air it contains weighs more than the structure itself. \u201cIt just had this gorgeous sense of space when you walked into it,\u201d Chris Smith, then the culture secretary, told me. Charles Falconer, who later took over from Mandelson as Labour\u2019s Dome minister, recalled this feeling with evident pleasure: \u201cI loved being inside it, I loved the whole physicality of the Dome. I absolutely loved it.\u201d</p> <p>Beneath the roof, however, all was not well. Political advisers, who referred to themselves as \u201ccontent editors\u201d, clashed with the zone designers, as they attempted to ensure it was New Labour-appropriate. If this was to be a flagship for Blair\u2019s vision of Britain, it needed to send the right messages: the content had to be popular, pro-business, future-oriented and, above all, optimistic. \u201cKeeping the politicians\u2019 hands off it was a big struggle,\u201d Page told me.</p> <p>With more than 30,000 visitors expected every day in 2000, one thing the Dome would need was extensive catering. There were to be two enormous branches of McDonald\u2019s, as well as a YO! Sushi and a cafe called Simply Internet. Twenty years on, Bayley still rues the catering. He proposed a farmer\u2019s market; he got fast food. \u201cYou could have had sourdough bread and goat\u2019s cheese,\u201d he told me. \u201cInstead the public had to eat filth from McDonald\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Pleasing the sponsors, of which McDonald\u2019s was one, was of paramount importance. Without sponsorship money of \u00a312m per zone, the project was financially unviable. But what the zone designers wanted, what the politicians wanted and what the sponsors wanted were often incompatible. Higgins\u2019 play zone was initially paired with Sky. \u201cIt was hopeless,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey said to us, in a very aggressive way, the future of play is about digital television, because that\u2019s what they were launching at the time.\u201d Zaha Hadid\u2019s mind zone was sponsored by the arms manufacturers Marconi and BAE systems.</p> <p>One of the designer Tim Pyne\u2019s four zones was work, previously titled Licensed to Skill, which was sponsored by the recruitment giant Manpower. He told me that his zone ended up reflecting the sponsor\u2019s very particular idea of what an exhibit about the future of work should be: \u201cNo job security, zero-hours contracts and moving from job to job as an agency worker.\u201d Pyne\u2019s initial plans for the zone had involved visitors \u201cgetting sacked\u201d at the beginning, but Labour party advisers instructed him to scrap the idea because it was thought a recession might be coming.</p> <p>No zone saw more interference than the faith zone. The triangular, non-denominational design for the space, by Eva Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1, was met with outcry from religious leaders all over the country, who were also worried that the commercialised environment of the Dome would make a mockery of religion itself. \u201cIs Rupert Murdoch\u2019s name going to appear on the manger at Bethlehem?\u201d asked the Bishop of Woolwich. The government felt that the structure Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1 designed looked too much like a pyramid, which would evoke new-age spirituality rather than religion. Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1\u2019s solution was simple: \u201cI put a plastic blob hat on it,\u201d she told me. The hat did not pass muster, and the final design that the UK\u2019s religious leaders agreed to was all but disavowed by Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1 by the end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In October 1998, on the building site inside the Dome itself, the BBC held a televised debate about whether the Dome was going to be good or bad. All the participants wore hi-vis jackets and hard hats. While the children in the audience looked on nonplussed, the art critic Brian Sewell jabbed his finger at the Dome\u2019s director of operations, Ken Robinson, and demanded repeatedly: \u201cTell us what is in it.\u201d Robinson declined, and the rumour mill continued to turn. I remember that in the years before the opening, when I was about seven years old, my school playground in London was abuzz with talk of what might be inside. More than one person I know remembers hearing that there was going to be an anti-gravity chamber.</p> <p>Six months before the grand opening, details of all 14 zones were finally made public. The money zone featured a tunnel made of \u00a350 banknotes behind glass amounting to \u00a31m, and an invitation to guests to \u201cgo on a million-pound spending spree\u201d with virtual cash. At the \u201cour town story\u201d zone, schools from around the country were invited to put on performances about their local area. These were strictly limited to 20 minutes each. (Nicolson quotes Robert Warner, the head of the Dome\u2019s live events, as saying at the time that they didn\u2019t want \u201ca three-hour opera about Grimsby\u201d.) The body zone would allow visitors to walk through the inside of a human body, complete with moving organs and animatronic pubic lice.</p> <p>During the final months of preparations, the Dome attracted yet more sceptical comment. JG Ballard wrote in the New Statesman that the building resembled \u201ca sinister abattoir disguised as a circus tent\u201d. According to Page, those months were \u201ca frightful rush, and it was made much worse by the government changing the policy about ticketing, 10 months before we opened\u201d. She whispered \u201c10 months\u201d again and shook her hands at the ceiling in disbelief. Falconer had decided to give away 1 million free tickets to schoolchildren, an idea that was not in the business model. \u201cBut the Dome was the property of the nation,\u201d Falconer told me. \u201cWe wanted as many school children as possible to come.\u201d</p> <p>As the Dome finally began to take shape, the conceptual weakness of the experience was becoming increasingly clear. It was, after all, pretty difficult to deliver an \u201cexperience\u201d for \u201cthe nation\u201d \u2013 a grand day out that could, in some way or other, delight every single person in Britain, while staying within budget, keeping the sponsors happy, pleasing the press and embodying the government\u2019s preferred vision for the future of the country. The Dome needed to be educational, but fun. Accessible yet challenging. Entertaining for children, stimulating for adults. It had to be \u201cthe greatest show on earth\u201d, but also serve as an advertisement for sponsors like Boots the chemist.</p> <p>As with any big project, the final weeks were chaotic. With just a few weeks to go until opening night, Tim Pyne was working on the world\u2019s largest billboard \u2013 about as tall as a four storey house and as wide as a Boeing 747 \u2013 which would form the outside of the learn zone. It was a photograph of Richmond Park, which was being printed in a special facility in Iceland because of its enormous size. The printers called Pyne to ask whether the naked man in the woods, visible in the photograph at its full size, was a deliberate inclusion. Pyne had to make clear that the flasher was an unintentional feature, and that the whole billboard would need to be reprinted. Elsewhere, glass pillars for the faith zone languished in Paris, incomplete, and the dark brown paint on the pubic hairs for the body zone had been chipped off in transit.</p> <p>I asked Ray Winkler, who worked on the Dome\u2019s central show, what the mood was like in those last few weeks. \u201cOh you know,\u201d he replied. \u201cMild panic? Sheer panic?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I probably had a breakdown,\u201d said Pyne.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 1 January 2000, when the Dome finally threw open its doors to the public, what did the people involved think of what they saw? Some remember enjoying the exhibition, but Michael Heseltine paused before choosing his words: \u201cI think that \u2026 we could have done a better job.\u201d Chris Smith told me that the content was \u201cworthy\u201d. Simon Jenkins, who was on the Millennium Commission, said it was \u201cdull\u201d. Bayley noted that the Dome was, in a sense, quite impressive. He added: \u201cYou could spend \u00a3750m on a pile of horseshit and it would be impressive, but would it be worth the money?\u201d</p> <p>Soon reports were emerging that turnout was low. In certain parts of the Dome, though, the problem was too many visitors at once. Queues for the body zone spiralled up to two hours long. \u201cIn one sense, we\u2019d overhyped it,\u201d Page admitted of that exhibit. In early February, it was announced that in the previous month, the Dome had welcomed less than half the number of visitors required to break even. Page was asked to resign, something that few people I spoke to think was fair. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anybody so dedicated in my life,\u201d Mike Davies told me, \u201cand I\u2019m prepared to say in public that I think she was the scapegoat.\u201d</p> <p>By aiming for 12 million visitors, the company behind the Dome created the impossible criteria by which its success would be judged. The combined number of tickets sold for Alton Towers, Madame Tussauds and the London Eye in 2000 was 8m. As the actual number of visitors began to look more like half their projection, the Dome team were forced back to the Millennium Commission to ask for emergency funding three separate times over the course of the year.</p> <p>After Page\u2019s resignation, the man hired to rescue the Dome was PY Gerbeau, an infectiously optimistic ex-Eurodisney executive who wore suits slightly too big for him and rode around the Dome on a micro-scooter. Newspapers nicknamed him \u201cthe Gerbil\u201d. \u201cI do not think,\u201d Falconer began to laugh, \u201cand this is our fault, not his, that he quite had an understanding of the scale of the problem.\u201d Gerbeau seemed to have grasped it by the time he left in 2001, at least, when he told the New Yorker magazine that the 12 million visitors estimation \u201cwas one of the two or three stupidest things I have ever heard\u201d.</p> <p>Gerbeau\u2019s main job was damage limitation. He reduced ticket prices, and brought in a funfair around the edge of the Dome in the summer, and a skating rink in the winter. In the face of adversity, the marketing team for the Dome gamely attempted to turn the ever-worsening reputation to its advantage. Adverts ran of disappointed children asking their parents why they never went to the Dome, with a voiceover saying \u201cThe Millennium Experience at the Dome is closing for ever. Maybe you\u2019ll love it \u2013 maybe you won\u2019t. Why not come and decide for yourself, while you still can?\u201d</p> <p>One set of visitors the Dome company could have done without was a gang of would-be thieves who drove a JCB digger into the side of the Dome one day in November, in a failed attempt to steal the Millennium Star, a large gemstone that the diamond company De Beers had contributed to the money zone. Adam Liversage, a press officer at the Dome, was asked about it by a journalist a few weeks later. \u201cIn any other press office, something like that would be the story of a lifetime,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut here it was just a question of, OK, I\u2019ll go and take a look.\u201d Shortly afterwards, JCB ran an advert featuring a picture of one of their diggers with the tag line \u201cthe only thing that worked to plan\u201d.</p> <p>The Dome closed, with relatively little fanfare, at 6pm on 31 December 2000. Blair had appeared on BBC One\u2019s Breakfast with Frost a few months earlier, and admitted: \u201cIf I had known then what I know now about governments trying to run a visitor attraction \u2013 it was too ambitious.\u201d At the end of Nicolson\u2019s book, he describes the organisers, under constant attack and fighting an uphill battle to deliver the project, as \u201cthrowing a dance on Omaha beach\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an expression I\u2019ve never forgotten,\u201d Page said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"28d8b47ce3aadcf27c39455f422a8dc46cc7e37f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28d8b47ce3aadcf27c39455f422a8dc46cc7e37f/0_0_1953_1344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Mandelson, John Prescott and Tony Blair attending the topping out ceremony at the Millennium Dome in 1998.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Mandelson, John Prescott and Tony Blair attending the topping out ceremony at the Millennium Dome in 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In February 2001, a public auction for the Dome\u2019s contents was held at the site. One of the most eye-catching lots, a six-foot plastic hamster, went for \u00a33,700 to a man named Brent Pollard, to furnish a visitor attraction he ran in Kent. These days, Millie \u2013 short for millennium, as the local Kent schoolchildren named her \u2013 resides in a warehouse near the town of Sandwich, along with a large collection of military vehicles owned by Rex Cadman, a friend of Pollard\u2019s who accompanied him to the auction.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s just lovely,\u201d Cadman said proudly, as we stood in front of the slightly chipped fibre-glass figure a few weeks ago. The warehouse also contains a number of other Dome items that Cadman picked up at the auction, including a large oil painting of Blackadder, who featured in a specially commissioned film shown at the Dome. Having spent several months researching how these objects came into existence, I felt strangely humbled by seeing them preserved there, as if I was in the presence of artefacts from some once mighty civilisation. An alien, presented with only these objects as evidence, would have to assume that the civilisation that produced them was naively optimistic, concerned primarily with jolly novelties and with no coherent sense of style whatsoever.</p> <p>Perhaps the most recognisable element of the Millennium Experience, the outer shell of the body zone, was too big to be sold in its entirety, although tiles from its surface were used as the bidding paddles at the auction. In the end, the body was eventually dumped in a hole near the Dome as landfill. Higgins told me that the feeling was \u201cjust get it done, and then line up the skips\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Dome lay empty, a ruin before its time, for 18 months while the government struggled to find it a future. Proposals for the building\u2019s afterlife included a super casino, a business park and a stadium for Charlton Athletic. In May 2001, on the morning of Labour\u2019s manifesto launch, the leader of the Conservative party, William Hague, stood outside the Dome to deliver a <a href=\"https://conservative-speeches.sayit.mysociety.org/speech/601112\" title=\"\">short speech</a>. This \u201cTeflon tent,\u201d he said, \u201cis the ultimate monument to Labour, and today they both stand empty.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until a year later, in May 2002, that the US entertainment company AEG stepped in to purchase the building. The deal was that AEG would invest hundreds of millions of pounds into redeveloping the site as a music venue, later to be named the O2 Arena, and give the government 15% of its profits. The site itself was sold for \u00a31.</p> <p>\u201cI guess they didn\u2019t really have any other alternative,\u201d Alex Hill, the present head of AEG Europe told me as he showed me around the O2 late last year, \u201cbut I think the vast majority of people did not believe that something would be created of this level of success.\u201d The O2 Arena opened its doors in 2007, and has been the most popular music venue in the world every year since.</p> <p>Mike Davies\u2019s versatile building adapted well to its new purposes. Apart from the 20,000-seat live music and sports venue, the Dome now houses an outlet shopping centre, an indoor trampoline park and a bowling alley. There is also a pop-up football experience where you can play against a virtual goalie, just as you could in Higgins\u2019 play zone 20 years earlier.</p> <p>The success of the O2 is the most obvious vestige of the Millennium Experience, and the one that people involved in the Dome are most keen to emphasise. It\u2019s \u201ca brilliant success\u201d, Mandelson told me a number of times during our conversation. \u201cI\u2019m not going to look you in the eye and say that this is what we always intended,\u201d said Heseltine, \u201cbut we\u2019ve taken a lot of stick and, well, I\u2019m going to take a bit of credit.\u201d</p> <p>It was undoubtedly an expensive way of doing it, but the Dome did give some badly needed new life to the Greenwich peninsula. By 1998, Greenwich had one of the highest levels of unemployment in the country. Regeneration was one of the Millennium Commission\u2019s key considerations when choosing the site. When I mentioned this to Heseltine, he suddenly lit up. \u201cI was absolutely clear that we needed to use this as a regenerative process,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no apologies for that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a855b6b0f33da1f59d6df9a5b469fd9a0244807e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a855b6b0f33da1f59d6df9a5b469fd9a0244807e/465_37_2232_1339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mabel performing at the Brits in February 2020.

From the apex of the Dome\u2019s curve, the entire peninsula is visible, a landscape that has transformed during the past two decades. When the construction workers building the Dome looked out from this point in the late 90s, they would have had an uninterrupted view of the Thames looping around them. Today, that great sweeping view is partially obscured by an Intercontinental hotel, several new blocks of flats and Ravensbourne University, which relocated to Greenwich peninsula in 2010. </p> <p>Before the Dome was built, the peninsula was empty of buildings and covered with toxic soil from the gasworks that had closed back in 1976. Today, the land has been detoxified and the Dome continues to create jobs for local people. But the \u201cregeneration\u201d is still far from perfect. Unemployment rates <a href=\"https://www.gmblondon.org.uk/news/16-boroughs-in-london-have-employment-rate-below-uk-average.html\" title=\"\">remain relatively high</a>, and although more affordable housing was built in Greenwich between 2012 and 2016 than in any other London borough, the figure was still only 40%, even as new developers throw up luxury apartment blocks. A Chinese company called Knight Dragon has secured planning permission for 15,000 more homes on the peninsula, and a \u201cdesign district\u201d of artists\u2019 studios and shops.</p> <p>There have been other, less visible legacies. Matt Costain, who played the lead role of Sky Boy in the Dome\u2019s central show, told me that the performers\u2019 training programme created an entire industry of circus and acrobatics in the UK. \u201cI meet \u2018domies\u2019 all the time,\u201d he told me. \u201cSome of those people are now Cirque du Soleil\u2019s top troubleshooting clowns.\u201d Many of the performers who trained at the Dome went on to perform in that much more successful act of nation branding, the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.</p> <p>Like the Olympics, the Dome has left a firm imprint in the national imagination. It is remembered as a white elephant, a cautionary tale. But the truth is that this doesn\u2019t match up with the visitor response at the time. Independent visitor approval polls carried out by Mori showed as many as 90% of the 6 million people who visited the Dome enjoyed themselves. \u201cThe thing wasn\u2019t built for architects, it was built for the public,\u201d said Mandelson. \u201cIt was for families.\u201d</p> <p>Children in particular loved the Dome, as the people who were in charge are quick to affirm. Lord Falconer told me he went a staggering 57 times with his family, a fact I confirmed with his daughter Rose, who was nine-turning-10 in 2000. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d she told me, \u201cbecause we did go about 50 times, and we loved it, but when I think about the Dome even I think of it as a complete disaster.\u201d</p> <p>For this piece, I spoke to people from all over the country who remember going as children. Some didn\u2019t enjoy themselves, of course. Many remember being frightened of the body zone\u2019s beating heart. But most remembered visiting the Dome as a vivid, strange and invigorating occasion. They told me about the thrill of going to London, of seeing a digital camera for the first time, of feeling part of something bigger than themselves, of excitement about the future they were stepping into, and of dreaming about the Dome even now. One person who visited from south Wales aged 12 told me that she remembers not understanding at the time why the papers were calling it a failure. \u201cI was blissfully unaware of the politics behind it,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a great time.\u201d</p> <p>The Dome\u2019s less than glorious reputation is a source of regret for some. \u201cOne of the things that makes me crossest, when I admit to being cross,\u201d Page confessed, \u201cis that so many people who worked on the Dome, who were so good, have not been allowed to feel good about themselves.\u201d Falconer feels the same. \u201cIt was the failure of the politician,\u201d he said, pointing to himself, \u201cnot the failure of the people working in the Dome.\u201d It is, however, difficult to know how it could have gone differently. Page told me that, in her view, much of the negative press was to do with the influence of politics on the Dome. \u201cBut on the other hand,\u201d she said, \u201cWithout the politics, it would never have happened.\u201d</p> <p>The creators of the Dome set out to provide an experience that would unite the country. In a way, they succeeded. There is something unifying, and typically British, in our collective enthusiasm for enshrining the memory of the Dome as being a bit shit, be that memory accurate or not. It may well be that this same sort of national unity in disdain will repeat itself in the near future. In 2018, Theresa May announced plans for a \u00a3120m \u201cFestival of Brexit Britain\u201d, now renamed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/12/festival-of-brexit-boss-120m-event-will-prove-cynics-wrong-martin-green\" title=\"\">Festival 2022</a>, showcasing \u201cthe best of the UK\u2019s talent in business, technology, arts and sport\u201d.

But the problem is not confined to distant seas, or to tuna fisheries. On average, two dolphins or porpoises are <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/science/news/4896-marine-mammals-stranded-on-uk-coast-in-seven-years\" title=\"\">washed up on UK beaches</a> every day. Many of them show the scrapes and indentations caused by fishing nets. Discoveries of dead dolphins around the Bay of Biscay this year are likely to beat the grisly record set in 2019, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/31/mutilated-dolphins-wash-up-on-french-coast-in-record-numbers\" title=\"\">1,100 were found</a> on the French coast.

Dolphins are long-lived and reproduce slowly. In the north Atlantic, the common dolphin calves only about <a href=\"https://www.ascobans.org/sites/default/files/document/Inf22_Murphy%20et%20al.%202013%20OMBAR%20CD%20Review.pdf\" title=\"\">once every four years</a>. The unquantified mass slaughter caused by fishing boats, if it is allowed to continue, is likely soon to drive them to extinction.</p> <p>Almost all commercial fishing presents a threat to dolphins and porpoises. But some techniques are more lethal than others. While gill nets kill large numbers of porpoises, and all kinds of trawling and seine netting endanger dolphins, there\u2019s a particularly strong correlation between dolphin deaths and two types of fishing: pair trawlers catching bass and supertrawlers pursuing small, midwater fish.</p> <p>Pair trawlers (two boats pulling a net between them) move much faster than single trawlers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/07/ban-supertrawlers-from-uk-waters-after-brexit-say-green-campaigners\" title=\"\">Supertrawlers</a> \u2013 100m or more in length \u2013 tow gigantic nets that scoop up entire shoals, and the predators hunting them. Because these ships tend to pursue species used for making the pellets fed to farmed fish \u2013 such as salmon, bass, halibut and prawns \u2013 scarcely any species on sale today can be safely dissociated from dolphin killing.

They know their system for monitoring dolphin killing is useless. It consists of placing observers on around <a href=\"https://www.wcl.org.uk/docs/Gearing%20up%20to%20eliminating%20cross-taxa%20bycatch%20in%20UK%20fisheries%20FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">1% of fishing vessels</a>, and only with the consent of the vessel\u2019s master. Inevitably, the boats most responsible for the problem tend to be the least monitored. For a quarter of the price of this useless and outdated system, every boat could be fitted with <a href=\"https://greeneruk.org/sites/default/files/download/2018-11/The_importance_of_Remote_Electronic_Monitoring_1.pdf\" title=\"\">remote monitoring equipment and CCTV</a>. But they refuse to enter the 21st century.</p> <p>Last year, the campaign group, Sea Shepherd, sailed into this regulatory chasm, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxJ53j_bHaw\" title=\"\">filmed</a> a French trawler in the Bay of Biscay hauling a dead dolphin on to its deck. The official response? The president of Brittany\u2019s fisheries committee characterised the filming as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/hundreds-of-dead-dolphins-washed-up-on-french-coast/a-52537366\" title=\"\">harassment</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Neither the European commission nor the British government, to judge by the current draft of the <a href=\"https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2019-21/fisheries.html\" title=\"\">fisheries bill</a>, intends to put this right. Their refusal properly to monitor or regulate the industry amounts to an intentional and systematic cover-up. The measures required to protect dolphins are similar to the measures required to allow fish populations to recover. Large zones should be declared closed to all fishing. Instead, almost all our \u201cmarine conservation zones\u201d can legally be ploughed by trawlers throughout the year. They are meaningless paper parks. Other areas should be closed at certain seasons, when dolphins congregate.</p> <p>Fisheries policy should begin with the protection of dolphins and other vulnerable species, and then decide where and how fishing vessels can operate. But the opposite approach is taken: allow boats to work almost everywhere, unmonitored and scarcely controlled, then wonder what to do about the dead dolphins. The grip of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/05/uk-to-strengthen-sea-patrols-to-ward-off-post-brexit-fishing-wars\" title=\"\">fishing industry</a> on government policy remains as powerful and mysterious as ever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/09/boris-johnson-trade-uk-fishing-fleet-industry\">Boris Johnson\u2019s hard line on trade could sink the UK\u2019s fishing fleet | John Lichfield</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is there any difference between the accidental but inevitable mass killing of dolphins by the fishing industry, and the deliberate annual massacre in Japan, that rightly causes such public outrage? If something is morally wrong, no amount of money can make it morally right. The slaughter of dolphins and other magnificent wildlife is, on any measure, morally wrong.</p> <p>If you agree, there\u2019s a simple answer. Stop buying fish.

  "<p>When the former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq told the hosts of Loose Women that she had not bought any clothes in a decade, she was met with consternation and shock from the show\u2019s famously forthright panellists. \u201cYou\u2019re not still wearing Blue Peter clothes!\u201d exclaimed Janet Street-Porter. Huq acknowledged, sheepishly, that the lilac cardigan she was wearing did in fact date from her days on children\u2019s TV.</p> \n<p>Huq\u2019s decision to step away from consumerism and wear the clothes she already has is to be commended, given that the UK <a href=\"https://www.wrap.org.uk/content/clothing-waste-prevention\" title=\"\">sends around \u00a3140m</a>-worth of clothing to landfill every year. And, as the public becomes increasingly aware of the social and environmental impact of the fashion industry, it is likely that more will do the same. Already consumers are turning away from fast fashion. New research from the <a href=\"https://dailybusinessgroup.co.uk/2020/03/gretas-green-plea-turns-shoppers-against-fast-fashion/\" title=\"\">Fashion Retail Academy</a> finds that 51% of Brits are opting to purchase expensive but longer-lasting clothes, rather than cheaper throwaway items, up from 33% a year ago. Many attribute this move towards more sustainable consumer behaviour to the so-called \u201cGreta\u201d effect. (Famously, the 17-year-old Swedish climate activist, Greta Thunberg, doesn\u2019t buy new clothes, telling Democracy Now that <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2019/9/11/greta_thunberg_swedish_activist_climate_crisis\" title=\"\">she shops secondhand</a>, or wears other people\u2019s hand-me-downs.)</p> \n<p>Huq\u2019s no-clothes purchasing policy made headlines across the UK. But away from media scrutiny and bemused TV hosts, many ordinary people have been quietly wearing the same clothes day-in, day-out, for the past decade, too. We spoke with Guardian readers who never buy clothes, to ask them how they stay presentable, stop things from wearing out and where they would be if their loved ones didn\u2019t buy them socks come Christmas.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ca007ae35558480fbcd3fd57807a9c48e3579a1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ca007ae35558480fbcd3fd57807a9c48e3579a1/844_817_4275_2565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alfy Fowler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alfy Fowler \u2026 \u2018We have become so selfish as human beings.

But then I went to university to study product design and I realised that consumer culture really didn\u2019t sit well with me. We were being trained to design want and need in people. It didn\u2019t feel right.</p> \n<p>The majority of my clothes are well over a decade old. Some of them do look a bit tatty, I\u2019m not going to lie. I do understand that your first appearance counts for something in society, and that people might look at my clothes and think about me in a certain way. But for me personally, it is more important to be true to what I believe in than care about what other people might think.</p> \n<p>I last bought a Paul Smith jumper about nine or 10 years ago. It was \u00a3140, which is a lot of money, but I still wear it today, and it looks the same as the day I bought it. The most loved item in my wardrobe is a pair of David Beckham-endorsed Adidas shorts I bought when I was 14. I still wear them all the time. The elastic is gone, so I do have to be careful to make sure the drawstring is tied up! They have started to peel a bit.</p> \n<p>My mum and dad are always trying to buy me new clothes. They are Thatcher\u2019s children: materialism was drilled into that generation; buying stuff empowers them. My mum recently insisted on buying me a coat, but only because she was so fed up with the old Barbour jacket I had been wearing.</p> \n<p>It was my grandad\u2019s Barbour: he has sadly passed away, so I took it from his house after he died. That\u2019s not the only thing I took, actually; I wear my grandad\u2019s old Slazenger boxers. My girlfriend thinks it is really weird.</p> \n<p>I loved that Barbour jacket. It was ancient; I kept sending it to the Barbour shop to get it repaired, but they repaired it so many times it was basically a new coat.</p> \n<p>I never get bored of my clothes. I think that people are told that they need to buy new clothes to fit in and seem trendy, but it is only you who inherently cares what you look like. People are too immersed in their own lives to notice you only have four T-shirts. That stuff doesn\u2019t matter. We have become so selfish as human beings. We are bred to consume. Nothing has any value any more.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b08f39ce88d43f212abac92f0e76864ee2309a8e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b08f39ce88d43f212abac92f0e76864ee2309a8e/0_223_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abi Jenkins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abi Jenkins \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s horrible to know how people of my heritage are abused by the garment industry.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Abi Jenkins, 49, dressmaking teacher from Stockport</strong></h2> \n<p>I am of Asian heritage: my family is from India and Pakistan. I think that\u2019s why I am really reluctant to buy clothes. It is horrible for me to know that people of my heritage are being abused by the garment industry to produce clothes for people in the west who don\u2019t care about their wellbeing.</p> \n<p>I remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/bangladesh-textile-factory-fire\" title=\"\">watching the footage of the 2012 Dhaka garment factory fire</a>. It was horrific, watching people try to escape. I don\u2019t like to stand on a soapbox and say: \u201cYou should do this, and you should do that.\u201d But for me personally, buying clothes isn\u2019t something I want to do. It\u2019s how I am.</p> \n<p>Apart from tights and the odd bit of underwear, I haven\u2019t bought any clothes for a decade. I make all of my clothes, myself, by hand. I learned to sew from my mum. She was always immaculate; she never had a hair out of place. Just the sweetest, most caring person. She died recently. When I am sewing, I feel close to her. She really knew how to sew.</p> \n<p>Virtually all the fabric I use is vintage. Buying new fabric is really the same as buying fast fashion, in my book. Why do we need new fabric? There\u2019s already so much beautiful fabric in the world. I work with a charity called <a href=\"https://www.tfsr.org/\" title=\"\">Tools for Self Reliance</a>, and they get donated lots of old material. If I see something I like the look of, I pop a donation in the collection box. I also have reams and reams of fabric that I purchased in the 1980s from a dressmaking shop: it was closing down, and the owner let me have it cheap.</p> \n<p>Most of the time, I am a bit of a scruff. But when I am teaching dressmaking, I make an effort. You want to look nice, because you\u2019re an advert for the clothes you are teaching people to make. I follow trends on social media, and then teach people how to make the clothes <a href=\"https://abis-den-sewing-machine-services.business.site/\" title=\"\">at my workshops</a>. You get all sorts: doctors, solicitors, care workers. They all say it is therapeutic.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t get bored of my wardrobe, because if I want something new I can just nip upstairs to my sewing room and make it. I can make a shift dress in half an hour; I call them my half-hour dresses. I just made a ball gown from old fabric over a few days.</p> \n<p>I never want to buy things. I look at things in shops and think the quality is abysmal. My daughter makes her own clothes now. I am so glad she is not spending her pennies in those dreadful shops. But I really don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m on my high horse. I just want to educate people.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730d5f4253f676a166c011a29c293cc50a7dca87\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730d5f4253f676a166c011a29c293cc50a7dca87/0_282_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jon Watkins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jon Watkins \u2026 \u2018The last time I bought clothes was in 1984\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Jon Watkins</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Jon Watkins, 70, retiree from Llangollen</strong></h2> \n<p>Everything in my wardrobe is certainly not from this century. I have had the same ties since the 1980s. I think the last time I bought clothes was in 1984: I was on a business trip and they lost my suitcase, so I went to a shop in Rome and bought new suits, shirts, trousers and underwear.</p> \n<p>Technically, I could buy clothes. I know where Marks &amp; Spencer is! I just prefer not to go shopping. Ever since Woolworths closed, I can\u2019t think of a decent shop. Shopping is so tedious. I can do a supermarket shop, because I have to, otherwise I would starve. But that\u2019s it.</p> \n<p>I do occasionally get marched to TK Maxx by some lady friends who buy things for me. Whatever they choose is fine. Everything else in my wardrobe seems to arrive! My brother-in-law gives me shirts and pullovers. It\u2019s usually when people think I am looking mucky that stuff tends to turn up. I never ask for anything new. Hand-me-downs look new to me! I can\u2019t tell the difference.</p> \n<p>I look like a mess, but I don\u2019t really care. It is the same with haircuts: I only get them if I have got to meet the bank manager or something like that. The only thing I buy for myself is socks and pants.</p> \n<p>I have a woman who comes to clean my house for me and she\u2019s not averse to throwing clothes and shoes away that she deems unwearable. I don\u2019t mind as long as she tells me what she\u2019s chucking out, otherwise I spend ages looking for it and can\u2019t find it. She thinks shirts should have all the buttons on them and rubbish like that. They don\u2019t really. As long as there are some buttons, it will work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d715a9e1619a9cb388c026628c34113e8e31ee1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d715a9e1619a9cb388c026628c34113e8e31ee1/0_936_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Athena Drakou\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Athena Drakou \u2026 \u2018Never buying clothes feels liberating\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Athena Drakou</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Athena Drakou, 59, </strong><strong>semi-retired accountant living in West Sussex, but originally from Greece</strong></h2> \n<p>Thirty-four years ago, I was pregnant with my daughter back home in Greece. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened and pregnant women were advised not to eat any fresh food. That experience really changed my thinking about the environment.</p> \n<p>I became an accountant, then moved to the UK and studied environmental science. But my interest in the environment and how we consume clothes never went away. Back in Greece when I was growing up, everything was about consumerism. Being a Greek woman who never went shopping, people thought I was crazy!</p> \n<p>I think I have bought one pair of jeans in the past 10 years. That\u2019s it. My wardrobe is basically empty. It is easy to find everything in there. When I need clothes for a special occasion, like a wedding, I either borrow something from a friend, or there are platforms now where you can rent clothes.</p> \n<p>It helps that I am the same dress size I was when I was 20. I try to keep fit and not gain weight. Everything in my wardrobe still fits. All my clothes are very good quality: I have a coat that I have worn for 24 years. I take excellent care of it and it\u2019s still in good condition. If you looked at it, you wouldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d had it for so long.</p> \n<p>Part of the reason my clothes last is because I don\u2019t over-wash them. I have a rule that I wear everything at least twice \u2013 underwear excluded, obviously \u2013 before washing it. I can wear jeans five or six times before putting them in the machine. I mend all my clothes. If I need a new sweater, I knit something. My friends will often give me wool or yarn. Knitting helps me relax.</p> \n<p>Never buying clothes feels liberating. I love not having to think about clothes all the time. I have a few things in my wardrobe. Everything goes together. I never worry about what I am going to wear. For me, it has always been simple.</p> \n<h2><strong>Andrew Ledwidge, 52, public-sector worker from south London</strong></h2> \n<p>I have a bit of a phobia about new clothes. It is about comfort; I\u2019m very particular about things. I hate clothes that are too clingy or tight. Animal fibres make me really itchy. I think maybe I am a bit allergic to wool.</p> \n<p>I like to wear old clothes, because I know they will be comfortable. I don\u2019t like the texture of new clothes at all. It is a bit of a paradox, because in order for things to get old you have got to wear them a lot. If I had the choice between wearing an old item or something new, I\u2019d always go for the old thing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eb84d92b-e466-44d5-b40e-9490e6a0a260\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RR7aP4U2L6o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>My wife likes to sneak a few new things in my wardrobe from time to time, so I am better presented.

She hasn\u2019t stopped trying to smarten me up a bit and get me into some newer things, but I don\u2019t find those things comfortable. It is a long-running battle, but we have a laugh about it. Sometimes she will drag me into a clothing store, and within 30 seconds I want to walk out.</p> \n<p>I am not bothered about my appearance or anything like that. Clothes for me are about comfort.

The financial system would be bolstered by an extra $200bn in liquidity, he said, and small businesses would be given access to more capital and liquidity.</p> \n<p>But Mohamed El-Erian, the highly respected chief economist of insurer Allianz, said such measures would not do enough to prevent the shutdown of economies across the world, which was now gripped by the \u201ceconomics of fear\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe advanced economies are now likely to feel the full force of economic sudden stops that destroy both supply and demand at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe collapse in economic activity risks being amplified by the economics of fear, uncertainty and adverse economic-financial feedback loops.</p> \n<p>\u201cI believe there is a high probability of global recession.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tom Hanks\u2019 revelation that he had become infected was also seen as significant factor, given the spread of the contagion to such a well-known person.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe news about Tom Hanks will fuel uncertainty, prompting people to disengage more from economic activities,\u201d said El-Erian.</p> \n<p>His gloomy analysis was reflected in financial markets in Asia Pacific, which plummeted into full selling mode during and after Trump\u2019s address.

Australia\u2019s Qantas fell 11%, Singapore Airlines was down 4%, as was Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, was badly affected by new of the travel ban, falling 5.3% to $33.88.</p> \n<p>The price action pointed to more selling in Europe and the US when markets open on Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/us-stocks-latest-bull-to-bear-market-signs-coronavirus-impact\">entered bear market territory</a> on Wednesday \u2013 defined by a 20% fall from its most recent high \u2013 and futures trading suggested it would lose another 4.4% on Thursday.

After the crew of the space shuttle Challenger perished in a disaster in 1986, <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/speeches/reagan_challenger.html\">Ronald Reagan promised:</a> \u201cWe will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \u2018slipped the surly bonds of Earth\u2019 to \u2018touch the face of God\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>George W Bush made half a dozen Oval Office addresses, including <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?165970-1/presidential-address\">on the night of the September 11</a><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?165970-1/presidential-address\"> terrorist attacks</a>. Barack Obama delivered three. Trump has typically resisted conventions \u2013 it has been exactly a year since the last White House press briefing \u2013 but even he finds some of them necessary or useful.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday he wore a blue suit, white shirt and blue patterned tie \u2013 not his favourite red. He also sported a stars and stripes pin and had his hands folded before him (he said nothing about the potential perils of shaking hands). His face looked undeniably orange. Behind him were framed photos, including portraits of his parents, and flags and gold curtains.</p> \n<p>At 9.02pm, Trump began as presidents so often do: \u201cMy fellow Americans.\u201d But in the next breath, he reverted to his familiar us-versus-them nationalism, referring to the coronavirus outbreak \u201cthat started in China\u201d and is now spreading throughout the world. \u201cThis is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.\u201d Not just a virus. A <em>foreign</em> virus.</p> \n<p>The president touted his own sweeping travel restrictions on China and, far from expressing sympathy and solidarity with allies, argued the European Union \u201cfailed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump announced the US will be banning travelers from many European countries to the US for the next 30 days with exemptions for Americans, permanent residents and family of US citizens who have undergone screenings and, mysteriously, the UK, despite it having a higher caseload than some other European countries. Could Brexit be the new TSA PreCheck?</p> \n<p>The president then made an awful bungle. He said \u201cthese prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval\u201d. Such words could trigger global economic panic. Trump was forced to hastily clarify on Twitter: \u201c... very important for all countries &amp; businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.\u201d</p> \n<p>He went on to talk of the pathogen as if it was a foreign army or terrorist network. \u201cThe virus will not have a chance against us,\u201d he said. \u201cNo nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States.\u201d</p> \n<p>And seen in the midst of an emergency, Trump could not resist some campaigning. \u201cBecause of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world by far,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many observers found the address unreassuring and downright weird. Susan Glasser, a staff writer from the New Yorker, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sbg1/status/1237916933619679236?s=20\">tweeted:</a> \u201cThe militaristic, nationalistic language of Trump\u2019s speech tonight is striking: a \u2018foreign virus,\u2019 keeping out China and Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Litt, who wrote speeches for Obama, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidlitt/status/1237924132047785986?s=20\">posted:</a> \u201cAs a former presidential speechwriter, my careful rhetorical analysis is that he\u2019s gonna get us all killed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s second Oval Office address was over in 10 minutes. Then a man off camera said: \u201cWe\u2019re clear.\u201d The president unbuttoned his jacket and exclaimed with relief: \u201cOK!\u201d</p> \n<p>To millions of viewers, it was anything but.</p>",
  "<h2>A step in the right direction to boost GDP growth</h2> \n<p>The government\u2019s announced fiscal stimulus worth around $17.6bn, or about 1.2% of GDP. Importantly, 60% of the spend will land in 2Q, boosting GDP growth sizeably in the quarter. Cash payments to welfare recipients will support consumption, as should the increase in the instant asset write-off for business. The transfer/subsidy to business is also reasonably generous, and should go some way to insulating the labour market by providing an offset to any liquidity issues.</p> \n<p>Generally we view this package as a step in the right direction, and it is worth noting that the government retains the option to scale or add to these measures in the May budget if required. The government has been reasonably short term in dictating the duration of stimulus, with all of it to be spent or distributed before mid-2021. This should go some way to insulating budget estimates in the out years from too much deterioration.</p> \n<p><em><strong>\u2013 Sally Auld is the head of Australia and New Zealand economics and markets research at JP Morgan.</strong></em></p> \n<h2>Handing money to the lowest earners is effective</h2> \n<p>The government\u2019s decision to provide cash payments and incentives to the supply side of markets, helping companies continue to fund their payrolls (including apprenticeships) and in other ways negotiate supply-chain disruptions, is welcome news. This support could have been even more targeted to sectors that are worst affected. Extra support to the health sector \u2013 an obviously affected industry \u2013 is also welcome, though the opportunity was missed to underscore facts about hygiene habits, bug virulence, and our country\u2019s preparedness, that would reduce public panic.</p> \n<p>The decision to write cheques to welfare recipients seems sourced in the notion, valid or not, that such people are most likely to feel the pinch of supply-side disruptions. Handing out money to our lowest earners is a more effective spending stimulus than handing it out to the highest earners, due to the former\u2019s higher marginal propensity to spend. While a once-off handout to Australia\u2019s worst-off gets my vote, as with the infusions for suppliers the tailoring of this government response to the Covid-19 virus disruption could be better. To counter Covid-19\u2019s effects, we would target directly affected workers, not implement a blanket demand-side stimulus to poor people. I expect administrative feasibility featured in the government\u2019s deliberations.</p> \n<p><em><strong>\u2013 Gigi Foster is a professor in the School of Economics at the University of New South Wales, and co-host with Peter Martin of the Economists on ABC RN.</strong></em></p> \n<h2>Striking in its similarity to Rudd response</h2> \n<p>The most striking feature of the government\u2019s response is that it is identical in outline, and in many of the details, to the Rudd government\u2019s response to the global financial crisis. The central elements are a cash handout aimed at sustaining consumer demand and broad measures to stimulate investment. The idea of <a href=\"https://au.news.yahoo.com/government-tipped-for-5-billion-response-to-coronavirus-as-economy-sags-001837649.html\">a modest and tightly targeted stimulus, with a price tag of around $5bn, being promoted by government leaks as recently as last weekend</a> has been abandoned.</p> \n<p>Instead, we have a package with an initial cost of nearly $18bn. Allowing for inflation and population growth, that\u2019s very similar to the $10bn cost of the Rudd government\u2019s initial stimulus. As with the Rudd package, the plan is to wind that back rapidly once the crisis is over \u2013 we all know how that worked out. It\u2019s highly likely that the economic aftershocks will be felt for years to come, and that the impact on the budget will be well over $100bn by the time we recover.</p> \n<p>The big question is whether anything will change in the longer term. In the immediate aftermath of the GFC, we saw some attempts at rethinking the failed ideology of market liberalism, and accepting that a modern society can only function with a strong government and a commitment to a just society. The looming disaster of the coronavirus is exacerbated by growing inequality and insecurity. Hopefully, the response will mark a turning point.</p> \n<p><em><strong>\u2013 Professor John Quiggin is the VC senior research fellow in the school of economics at the University of Queensland</strong></em></p> \n<h2>Whether this is enough is the big question</h2> \n<p>Go hard, go early, go business is the message from today\u2019s stimulus announcement and it\u2019s the right one for this stage of the crisis.</p> \n<p>The government has significantly ramped up the ambition of its stimulus package from what it was considering just a week ago and will pump close to $18 billion into the economy \u2013 around 0.9 % of GDP \u2013 this financial year.</p> \n<p>The measures to support business cashflow are welcome and should give businesses confidence that the government is willing to support them during what will be a very challenging period. The $25,000 income tax write-off for businesses with turnover of less than $50m is effectively a cash payment for all small and medium businesses with staff. The wage subsidy for apprentices should provide an incentive for businesses to keep on their younger workers, those that are otherwise most vulnerable to losing their jobs in a downturn. And the extension of the instant asset write-off \u2013 already on the cards before the coronavirus shock \u2013 will underpin investment and provide further cashflow benefits for business with turnovers up to $500m.</p> \n<p>Household support of up to $750 goes to those getting government payments \u2013 Newstart, pensions and family tax benefits, among others. While some of this will boost demand \u2013 most Newstart recipients will spend every cent \u2013 pensioners save a lot of their income and will be less economically affected by the virus.</p> \n<p>The government has partially addressed the problem of income risk for casual workers required to quarantine, by waiving the waiting period for the sickness allowance. Whether this is enough to cushion the income hit for these and other workers is the big question. In the (likely) event that still more stimulus is needed after virus containment measures like closing schools are workplaces are enacted, this is where the government should focus.</p> \n<p><em><strong>- Danielle Wood is program director, budget policy and institutional reform, at the Grattan Institute</strong></em></p> \n<h2>Appropriate response that avoids misallocating resources</h2> \n<p>The fiscal package is of appropriate magnitude and is focused on alleviating cash constraints and providing incentives to maintain investment spending. It leaves decisions on how to spend and save largely with the private sector and so avoids misallocating resources. The additional resources allocated to the health system are obviously needed and welcome.</p> \n<p>The government could have also given consideration to allowing individuals to access their superannuation balances up to a maximum cap.</p> \n<p>\u2013 <em><strong>Stephen Kirchner is the program director, trade and investment, at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney</strong></em></p> \n<h2>Sound package that mimics Rudd\u2019s GFC stimulus</h2> \n<p>The overall package is sound. Morrison has learnt from the stunning success of the Rudd government stimulus package during the global crisis for examples of how to manage the economy during times of crisis. Pumping cash totalling over 2% of quarterly GDP into the economy in the June quarter 2020 will almost certainly avoid a negative quarter for GDP growth and therefore a recession. This seems to be the key focus politically, but also the benefits are clear for the economy. The residual stimulus measures will underpin growth past the June quarter but more stimulus may yet be needed. Global and domestic events may require further cash injections, but for now, this Rudd mark II package will help the economy and do its bit to boost confidence.</p> \n<p>\u2013 <em><strong>Stephen Koukoulas is the managing director of Market Economics</strong></em></p> \n<p><br><br></p>",

High income earners got smaller amounts.</p> \n<p>Morrison\u2019s handout is more miserly, at $750, and restricted to people on welfare benefits or receiving family tax benefits.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s also no increase in the Newstart rate, which economists say would have immediately pumped cash into the economy through increased spending.</p> \n<p>The market\u2019s verdict on the package was clear: thumbs down.</p> \n<p>As soon as Morrison opened his mouth at 10.35am on Thursday morning, the benchmark ASX200 index, which was already down about 2%, began falling. Within half an hour it was down another percentage point.</p> \n<p>And that was before Donald Trump announced he was closing the US to most of Europe.</p> \n<p>By 12.30pm, the index was down more than 4%.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cMy fellow Americans: Tonight, I want to speak with you about our nation\u2019s unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world.</p> \n<p>Today, the World Health Organization officially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">announced that this is a global pandemic.</a></p> \n<p>We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshalling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people.</p> \n<p>This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history. I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.</p> \n<p>From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats. This is the way it always was and always will be. It only matters how you respond, and we are responding with great speed and professionalism.</p> \n<p>Our team is the best anywhere in the world. At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/04/coronavirus-us-quarantine-travel-ban-response\">sweeping travel restrictions on China</a> and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection.</p> \n<p>And taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. <br> The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe.</p> \n<p>After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans.</p> \n<p>To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground.</p> \n<p>There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>At the same time, we are monitoring the situation in China and in South Korea. And, as their situation improves, we will re-evaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing.</p> \n<p>We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.</p> \n<p>Additionally, last week, I signed into law an $8.3bn funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies. Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day. We are moving very quickly.</p> \n<p>(For) The vast majority of Americans: the risk is very, very low. Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful.</p> \n<p>In particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits. In general, older Americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded areas.</p> \n<p>My administration is co-ordinating directly with communities with the largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing, and reducing large gatherings.</p> \n<p>Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow.</p> \n<p>Every community faces different risks and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts \u2013 and they are the best.</p> \n<p>For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practise good hygiene. Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus. Wash your hands, clean often-used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home.</p> \n<p>To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus.</p> \n<p>I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief.</p> \n<p>Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world, by far.</p> \n<p>Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong. Our unemployment is at a historic low. This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way.</p> \n<p>This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.</p> \n<p>However, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions: I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Effective immediately, the SBA will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories. These low-interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus. To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50bn.</p> \n<p>Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments, without interest or penalties, for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted. This action will provide more than $200bn of additional liquidity to the economy.</p> \n<p>Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief. Hopefully they will consider this very strongly.</p> \n<p>We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus. We made a life-saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe. We will not delay. I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people. I will always put the wellbeing of America first.</p> \n<p>If we are vigilant \u2013 and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will \u2013 we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus. The virus will not have a chance against us.</p> \n<p>No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States. We have the best economy, the most advanced healthcare, and the most talented doctors, scientists, and researchers anywhere in the world.</p> \n<p>We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one nation and one family.</p> \n<p>As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity.</p> \n<p>Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine. Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens, and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before.</p> \n<p>God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has announced that the US would temporarily suspend most travel from the European Union, as the country reckons with the spread of coronavirus and the White House grapples with the severity of the situation.</p> \n<p>The restrictions, which would begin on Friday and last for 30 days, would not apply to US citizens or to travelers from the UK. The restrictions apply to most foreign nationals who have been in the 26 countries of the Schengen area during the 14 days before their planned arrival in the US.</p> \n<p>Trump made the announcement in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237841878889840642\">an Oval Office speech</a> on Wednesday evening on the federal response to what the World Health Organization has declared a global pandemic.</p> \n<p>During the rare address to the nation, Trump defended his administration\u2019s response while laying blame on the European Union for not acting quickly enough to address the \u201cforeign virus\u201d, saying US clusters had been \u201cseeded\u201d by European travelers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe made a lifesaving move with early action on China,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we must take the same action with Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also downplayed warnings of a potential recession: \u201cThis is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world,\u201d he said. <br><br>\u201cThe vast majority of Americans, the risk is very, very low,\u201d he added, but he said that older Americans should avoid travel and endorsed social distancing and avoiding large gatherings. \u201cEvery community faces different risks,\u201d he noted and encouraged Americans to listen to local officials.</p> \n<p>The president also said he would take \u201cemergency action\u201d to provide relief to workers who are affected. He said he was asking Congress for $50bn for small business loans, and he also called for \u201cimmediate\u201d payroll tax cuts.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s speech came on a tumultuous day as cases in the US topped 1,000 and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/us-coronavirus-death-toll-states-total-cases\">number of deaths rose to 37</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/us-stocks-latest-bull-to-bear-market-signs-coronavirus-impact\">fluctuations in the financial markets</a> continued and Washington strained to respond. Testifying on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that the outbreak in the US is going to get worse.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now,\u201d Fauci told the House Oversight and Reform Committee. He said it is \u201c10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/donald-trump-coronavirus-response\">'A tweet can't knock over a pandemic': has Trump met his match in coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In a statement, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the affected countries include: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland\u201d.</p> \n<p>The acting DHS secretary, Chad Wolf, said that guidance on the travel suspension would come within the next two days.</p> \n<p>The department also clarified that restrictions would not apply to legal permanent residents, or to most immediate family members of US citizens.

Many who planned on flying to Europe that evening had no guarantee that they would be able to return to the United States once their trips had concluded, forcing some to make last-minute calls on dream vacations.</p> \n<p>Tulio Mello, 51, was preparing to board his flight to Istanbul when his friend called and told him not to get on the plane. \u201cThey had started announcing group one,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Turkey is not one of the countries included in the travel ban, but a mixture of misinformation, panic and precaution dominated the decisions made at San Francisco\u2019s airport. A number of passengers on Mello\u2019s Turkish Airlines flight left with him, waiting by the airline\u2019s counter for their luggage, some on hold with customer service.</p> \n<p>Reggie Chand, 34, and Esther Goundar, 32, were flying through Istanbul to Athens, one of the affected countries, for a two-week trip to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe got checked in, we got our boarding tickets from here to Turkey, from Turkey to Athens,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting in the lounge area and then I got a text message from my friend: \u2018Hey, are you going to get stuck in Europe?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Chand and Goundar are American citizens. They did not know when they cancelled the trip they had been planning since October that the ban did not apply to them, but looking back, they still think they made the right decision. \u201cIt\u2019s too much risk,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cEven if the vacation goes well, and we come back, either way you stay two weeks on vacation and then stay isolated for two weeks. It\u2019s too much.\u201d</p> \n<p>The couple felt a mixture of disappointment and anger over the whole ordeal \u2013 Chand had been on hold with Turkish Airlines for more than an hour, looking to get a refund for their tickets.</p> \n<p>Jennifer Tseeng, 36, and her husband were planning on flying to Valencia, Spain, for the Las Fallas festival. But then the festival was canceled because of coronavirus fears \u2013 and then came the travel restriction.</p> \n<p>\u201cThings are changing so quickly and you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen in the next hour or two hours,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The couple tried calling the airline, Lufthansa, but the customer service line was overrun, Tseeng said. They ended up driving to the airport to cancel their flight to Spain in person, but after Tseeng canceled the flight, they learned that the rule did not apply to American citizens like them.</p> \n<p>In the end, they felt it was best that they postponed their trip for now. \u201cIn one day, the whole situation completely changed,\u201d Tseeng said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to risk not being able to come back.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Agencies contributed reporting</em></p>",

It also found that social distancing, such as cancelling large public events, working from home and closing schools, were predicted to have a much greater impact on containing the virus than travel restrictions.</p> \n<p>The chief executive of the Grattan Institute, John Daley, said of the countries with more than 100 confirmed cases of Covid-19, there were two distinct \u201ccamps emerging: countries that saw an exponential and uncontrolled spread of the disease (such as China, Italy and Iran), and those who have maintained a managed caseload (Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong).</p> \n<p>He said Australia would need to act soon to keep its caseload manageable.</p> \n<p>Italy was slow to implement containment measures, and their enforcement has been weaker. The virus has spread exponentially in that country.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt took Italy around two weeks to go from having fewer than 100 diagnosed cases of coronavirus to having nearly 10,000 cases,\u201d Daley said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe health system in the richest part of Italy is now struggling to cope with the load. The terrifying maths of exponential growth can see pandemics spread very, very fast. The rate at which the virus spread in Italy is not an outlier \u2013 it spread at a startlingly similar pace in Iran, South Korea and China.\u201d</p> \n<p>Daley said Australia could choose to enforce social distancing measures now, or be forced to later on.</p> \n<p>\u201cAustralia can slow or stop the spread of the virus now by adopting social distancing measures that will have a real economic cost. One alternative is to adopt social distancing measures later with an even higher economic cost.

  "<p>Women and girls face a \u201cgrowing crisis\u201d of online harms, with sexual harassment, threatening messages and discrimination making the web an unsafe place to be, Sir Tim Berners-Lee has warned.</p> <p>The inventor of the world wide web said the \u201cdangerous trend\u201d in online abuse was forcing women out of jobs, causing girls to skip school, damaging relationships and silencing female opinions, prompting him to conclude that \u201cthe web is not working for women and girls\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe world has made important progress on gender equality thanks to the unceasing drive of committed champions everywhere,\u201d Berners-Lee wrote in an open letter to mark the web\u2019s 31st birthday on Thursday. \u201cBut I am seriously concerned that online harms facing women and girls \u2013 especially those of colour, from LGBTQ+ communities and other marginalised groups \u2013 threaten that progress.\u201d</p> <p>The warning comes a year after Berners-Lee launched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet\">Contract for the Web</a>, a global action plan to save the web from forces that threaten to drag the world into a \u201cdigital dystopia\u201d.

First is the digital divide that keeps <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/facts/default.aspx\">more than half of the world\u2019s women offline</a>, largely because it is too expensive, or they do not have access to the equipment or skills to use it.</p> <p>Second is online safety: according to a survey by Berners-Lee\u2019s Web Foundation, more than half of young women have experienced violence online, including sexual harassment, threatening messages and having private images shared without consent. The vast majority believe the problem is getting worse.</p> <p>The third threat comes from badly designed artificial intelligence systems that repeat and exacerbate discrimination. \u201cMany companies are working hard to tackle this discrimination. But unless they dedicate resources and diversify teams to mitigate bias, they risk expanding discrimination at a speed and scale never seen before,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>Amalia Toledo, a lawyer and activist at Fundaci\u00f3n Karisma, a Colombia-based group that lobbies for a safer internet, said that women\u2019s rights defenders and female journalists were targeted for abuse more than most.</p> <p>\u201cIf they are talking about issues that are pressing in the country, questioning the status quo, or denouncing what the state is doing, they will receive a lot of attacks, and there are more and more coordinated attacks from trolls, attacking their bodies, their families or relationships, and insulting how they look,\u201d said Toledo. \u201cTheir opinions are not even discussed.\u201d</p> <p>Fundaci\u00f3n Karisma runs an online campaign, \u201cAlerta Machitroll\u201d, which calls out misogynistic attitudes and abuse online. \u201cWhat victims are told all the time is \u2018Oh, that\u2019s nothing, ignore it, or close your account. But this has a big impact on people\u2019s lives. They want to control women, they want women to be silent,\u201d Toledo said.</p> <p>Berners-Lee said the coronavirus outbreak showed how urgent it was to take action. As workplaces and schools are forced to close, the web should be a \u201clifeline\u201d that allows people to keep working and children to be educated.</p> <p>He called on companies and governments to tackle online abuse as a top priority this year. More data needs to be collected and published on women\u2019s experiences online, while products, polices and services should all be designed based on data and feedback from women of all backgrounds, he said.</p> <p>Finally, he urged governments to strengthen laws that hold online abusers to account, and the public to speak up whenever they witnessed abuse online.</p> <p>Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said: \u201cTech firms are not neutral actors, and their decisions have real-world consequences.

In China, wind was already cheaper than any coal power, and solar electricity was forecast to on average cost less than existing coal later this year. Renewable energy in South Korea was expected to be cheaper than existing coal within two years.</p> <p>The report acknowledged this trend did not necessarily mean coal power would be pushed from the market within a decade. It said some governments were effectively incentivising or underwriting new coal power through regulatory programs that either directly subsidised coal operators or passed the higher cost on to consumers.</p> <p>But the group found that coal power would struggle if markets were priced fairly. It called on governments to block new coal projects and phase our existing coal plants, in part by changing regulations to allow renewable energy to compete on a level playing field.</p> <p>Carbon Tracker\u2019s Matt Gray, a co-author of the report, said proposed coal investments risked becoming stranded assets that locked in increasingly expensive power for decades.

The spot price of thermal coal slumped more than a third from US$100.73 to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/The_AMEGroup/status/1207508214121553920?s=20\">US$66.20</a>, its biggest fall in more than a decade.</p> <p>Before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> outbreak, the government\u2019s latest <a href=\"https://publications.industry.gov.au/publications/resourcesandenergyquarterlydecember2019/documents/Resources-and-Energy-Quarterly-December-2019.pdf\">resources and quarterly energy report</a> estimated the declining price would cut earnings from thermal coal exports from a record A$26bn in 2018-19 to A$20.6bn this financial year.</p> <p>In terms of coal use, the International Energy Agency found it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/17/world-demand-for-coal-falls-despite-growth-in-asia\">declined last year</a>, but forecast a slight increase over the next five years due to rising demand from India.</p> <p>A more detailed analysis by several thinktanks found that coal-fired electricity fell about 3% in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/25/global-use-of-coal-fired-electricity-set-for-biggest-fall-this-year\">the biggest drop on record</a> after more than four decades of near-uninterrupted growth in which coal power has been a primary driver of the climate crisis. China\u2019s use of coal plants continued to climb while generation in the US and Europe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/09/carbon-emissions-fall-as-electricity-producers-move-away-from-coal\">fell by 16% and nearly a quarter</a>.</p> <p>Within Australia, black and brown coal provide about two-thirds of the electricity used in the five eastern states, but this is expected to fall as old plants continue to close. <a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/4aa038fc-b9ee-4694-99d0-c5346afb5bfb/files/australias-emissions-projections-2019-report.pdf\">According to federal government projections</a>, renewable energy is expected to meet nearly 50% of national demand by 2030.</p> <p>In 2018 the UN\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ipcc\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> examined how rapidly global coal power needed to be phased out to give the world a chance of <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\">limiting global warming to 1.5C</a> , a goal referenced in the Paris agreement.</p> <p>It found this would require a cut of 59% to 78% below 2010 levels by 2030, before declining to zero.</p>"
