There are now 125,000 cases and 3,700 deaths.</p> \n  <p>Some observers have raised the possibility that the slow spread of the disease in Africa is due to the relative youth of populations. Moeti said data suggested that, as elsewhere, age and pre-existing conditions appeared important in determining the severity of each case, but countries everywhere on the continent faced significant difficulties accessing test materials and personal protective equipment for health workers.<br></p> \n  <p>A traditional remedy endorsed and distributed by the government of Madagascar will be tested thoroughly, she said. The WHO has previously <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2243669-no-evidence-madagascar-cure-for-covid-19-works-says-who/\">said there is no scientific evidence</a> that the herbal treatment is in any way effective.</p> \n  <p>Governments in Africa moved quickly to impose lockdowns and restrictions which helped slow the spread of the virus, but caused very significant problems to hundreds of millions of people living in poverty.<br></p> \n  <p>These are now being progressively removed, with South Africa, which imposed one of the strictest lockdowns, moving to level three on a scale of five this Monday. There has been controversy in the country - sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s most-developed - over a decision to allow religious services to go ahead if worshippers are restricted to less than 50 and strict social distancing precautions are observed. A ban on alcohol sale and transport will also be lifted.</p> \n  <p>Zweli Mkhize, South Africa\u2019s health minister, told reporters that no lockdown could last for ever and that it was time to provide some social and economic relief. It was hoped that religious leaders could educate congregations about the virus and how to keep safe, Mkhize said, adding that it had become clear that the country would be dealing with the pandemic for one to two years so \u201cthere has to be a degree of easing\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The emerging hotspot for the disease in South Africa - and in Africa overall - has been the Western Cape province, which includes Cape Town, the international tourist destination.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfe9978f084e882655a8d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T16:42:18.110Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>GSK, the British pharmaceutical company, said on Thursday that its previous flu pandemic <strong>vaccine</strong> was not linked to a rise in cases of the sleep disorder narcolepsy.</p> \n  <p>The claim comes as the company said it planned to produce large volumes of an ingredient used in that vaccine for possible use in Covid-19 vaccines currently being developed.</p> \n  <p>According to <strong>Reuters</strong>, a spokesman for GSK said the \u201cscience has moved on\u201d since concerns were raised about links between narcolepsy and its H1N1 vaccine, called Pandemrix, which was developed during the flu pandemic 10 years ago. He said evidence now suggests the link is to the H1N1 flu virus itself, not the vaccine.</p> \n  <p>Previous studies in several countries, including Britain, Finland, Sweden and Ireland, had suggested Pandemrix was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/09/ministers-lose-fight-to-stop-payouts-in-swine-flu-jab-narcolepsy-cases\">linked to a significant rise in cases of narcolepsy in children</a>.</p> \n  <p>Pandemrix\u2019s ingredients included a booster, or adjuvant, known as AS03, that could potentially be an ingredient in at least seven experimental COVID-19 vaccines, including one being developed by Sanofi, with whom GSK signed a collaboration deal in April.</p> \n  <p>Wendy Barclay, a professor and chair in flu virology at Imperial College London, said that since the link between narcolepsy and the 2009/10 flu pandemic is thought to have been due to cross-reactivity between parts of the H1N1 virus and human proteins that control sleep patterns, the Pandemrix vaccine\u2019s adjuvant may have played a role.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the virus/host cross-reactivity is the mechanism or explanation, then using an adjuvant in the vaccine to boost the immune response may have increased the chances that this cross-reactivity was generated,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cWe still don\u2019t really know if this was the case or not.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfd9108f087e3ca0f652e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T16:27:14.177Z\">5.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Israel</strong> has launched a campaign to test 100,000 people for coronavirus antibodies, in preparation for a potential \u201csecond wave\u201d of cases, a top official said on Thursday, according to <strong>AFP</strong>.</p> \n  <p>The initiative is one of the world\u2019s largest such schemes and aims to test Israel\u2019s \u201ccollective immunity\u201d against the COVID-19 disease by determining how widely the virus has spread and who is most at risk going forward.</p> \n  <p>In parallel to the national campaign, authorities are also running separate surveys of \u201chigh-risk areas\u201d.

Even hairdressers have reopened (what did we learn during lockdown? How many Danes are natural blondes).</p> \n   <p>There are no face masks in sight, few gloved hands, and little sign of any seismic global interruption. The only visible difference between the throng pre-lockdown and now is that pedestrians walk in \u201clanes\u201d, depending on their direction of traffic, and mobile hand sanitiser stations are parked at intervals along the high streets. Sanitiser pumps grace every shop doorway and smaller retailers display signs instructing customers how many are allowed in at any given time.

The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,442. Earlier this month, president Donald Trump said 100,000 deaths would be \u201chorrible\u201d, but he claimed that actions by his administration had prevented a much higher toll.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Military virus aid could look different if 2nd wave hits, says US defence secretary.</strong> US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said that as the US military prepares for another potential wave of the coronavirus, it may do things a bit differently, providing more targeted aid for cities and states and possibly shorter quarantine times for troops, AP reports.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea faces return to coronavirus restrictions after spike in new cases. </strong>South Korea has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in 53 days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/south-korea-faces-return-to-coronavirus-restrictions-after-spike-in-new-cases\">triggering warnings it may have to revert to stricter social distancing measures</a> after appearing to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/south-korea-first-steps-post-covid-world\">brought the outbreak under control</a>.The Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 79 new infections on Thursday with 67 of them from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to about half of the country\u2019s population of 51 million.</li> \n   <li><strong>UN: Virus could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America. </strong>The UN World Food Program is warning that upward of at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, shuttering people in their homes, drying up work and crippling the economy, AP reports. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Coronavirus knocks a third of European Foreign Direct Investment \u2013 survey. </strong>Over a third of European foreign direct investment projects announced in 2019 have been either delayed or cancelled outright because of the coronavirus pandemic, an annual survey by professional services group EY found.

The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,047.

The former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with more than 60 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him.Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips.</li> \n   <li><strong>Argentina \u2018cordons off slums\u2019 after surge in cases.</strong> Security forces in Buenos Aires <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/argentina-cordons-off-coronavirus-slum-ghettoes-for-poor-people\">cordoned off one of the city\u2019s largest and poorest slums</a>, stopping inhabitants from entering or leaving Villa Azul, on the outskirts of the Argentinian capital, after a surge of Covid-19 cases.Police officers erected barriers on Monday after widespread testing was launched in Villa Azul.

Had the Games proceeded as scheduled from 24 July, Asher-Smith and her peers would have faced a monumental task to keep in peak condition over the following four months.</p> <p>\u201cOn the day it was announced it was cancelled, I remember feeling relieved in a way. I think it had become unfeasible in the situation we were in at the time. I remember thinking: \u2018How am I meant to do Olympic standard training and keep up the shape I need and want to be in for the Olympics from training in my flat? </p> <p>\u201cBefore that, I went through a period like a lot of athletes did of disbelief, thinking: \u2018No, don\u2019t be silly. It won\u2019t be cancelled.\u2019 Then, as everything got worse, I thought: \u2018I don\u2019t know how tenable this is.\u2019 Then gradually I was accepting: \u2018Yeah, this is pretty unlikely.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Asher-Smith was speaking, along with fellow British athletes Katerina Johnson-Thompson and Adam Gemili, on How Dina and Kat Struck World Gold, which will be aired on BBC One on Sunday.</p> <p>Johnson-Thompson, who beat the Olympic champion Nafi Thiam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/03/katarina-johnson-thompson-british-record-heptathlon-gold\" title=\"\">to win the world title in Qatar</a>, said she took the Tokyo 2020 postponement well but found the delay of the world indoor championships, which will now take place next year in Nanjing, harder to take. \u201cThen I didn\u2019t have any focus to train for,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Johnson-Thompson made the difficult decision to return to Liverpool from her base in Montpellier, after being confined to her apartment for training. \u201cIt was a lot easier than being in France.

  "<p>Global talks aimed at staving off the threat of climate breakdown will be delayed by a year to November 2021 because of the coronavirus crisis, the UN has confirmed.</p> <p>The summit, known as Cop26, which 196 nations are expected to attend, will now take place in Glasgow from November 1 to 12 next year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/26/cop26-climate-talks-in-glasgow-likely-to-be-delayed-again\">as reports had anticipated,</a> with the UK government acting as host and president. They were originally set to take place from 9 November this year.</p> <p>Earlier dates were thought to be too difficult, as travel restrictions may still be in place in some countries next year and finding a new date was further complicated by the scheduling of other major international environmental meetings, including global talks on the biodiversity crisis.</p> <p>Alok Sharma, UK business secretary and Cop26 president, said: \u201cWhile we rightly focus on fighting the immediate crisis of the coronavirus, we must not lose sight of the huge challenges of climate change. We are working with our international partners on an ambitious roadmap for global climate action between now and November 2021. Everyone will need to raise their ambitions to tackle climate change.\u201d</p> <p>Cop26 is the most important <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world\">international meeting on the climate emergency</a> since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">Paris agreement was signed in 2015</a>. Under the landmark accord, countries must come forward every five years with revised plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris goal of limiting global heating to no more than 2C, and preferably no more than 1.5C.</p> <p>Current national targets would take the world to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un\">at least 3C above pre-industrial levels</a>, scientists warn, so countries are under pressure to come up with more stringent commitments.</p> <p>According to the timetable, those emission-cutting targets \u2013 known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \u2013 should be put forward this year, even though the meeting itself has been delayed. The UK has not yet submitted its NDC, but has pledged to do so before Cop26.</p> <p>Many developing countries and civil society groups were supportive of the delay, but called for governments to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/uk-urged-to-tie-green-recovery-from-covid-19-crisis-to-cop26-summit\">bring forward plans for a green recovery from the Covid-19 crisis</a>, to set the world on the right track to meet the Paris goals.</p> <p>Patricia Espinosa, the UN climate chief, also linked the two: \u201cOur efforts to address climate change and Covid-19 are not mutually exclusive. If done right, the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis can steer us to a more inclusive and sustainable path.\u201d</p> <p>Sonam Wangdi, from the Kingdom of Bhutan, who chairs the Least Developed Countries group at the UN climate talks, said: \u201cThe postponement of climate negotiations should not be taken as postponement of climate action. Climate action has been delayed long enough \u2026 To focus on recovering from the Covid-19 crisis while ignoring action to address the climate crisis would only lead to more devastation in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Poor countries are concerned that the damage caused by the coronavirus crisis and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/heed-lessons-of-2008-crisis-experts-warn-global-leaders\">global economic shock</a> will mean less assistance is available to help them reduce carbon emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.</p> <p>Janine Felson, Belize\u2019s ambassador to the UN and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: \u201cSmall island developing states are at the brink of economic collapse, with the major drivers of our economies at a standstill. This comes at a time when we are preparing for a volatile hurricane season.\u201d</p> <p>As well as the Cop26 presidency, the UK will hold the revolving presidency of the G7 group of industrialised countries next year, and Italy \u2013 which will co-host Cop26 with the UK \u2013 will be president of the G20 group, which includes major emerging economies.</p> <p>That puts the Cop26 hosts in pole position to steer both sets of discussions towards a green recovery, experts said.

(We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general Government guidance to \u201cstay at home\u201d.)</p> \n   <p>On April 12 2020, Mr Cummings drove approximately 26 miles from his father\u2019s property to Barnard Castle with his wife and son. He stated on May 25 2020 that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended.</p> \n   <p>Durham Constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR, witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings\u2019 press conference on May 25 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.</p> \n   <p>Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis.</p> \n   <p>Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.</p> \n   <p>In line with Durham Constabulary\u2019s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings differently from other members of the public. Durham Constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person.</p> \n   <p>By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed Government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing 4Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement.</p> \n   <p>Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on April 19 2020. Mr Cummings denies this and Durham Constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation.</p> \n   <p>Therefore Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T12:29:31.340Z\">at 1.29pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfac088f084e882655a5b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T12:18:26.804Z\">1.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson still backs Cummings despite 'minor breach' of lockdown rules</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A No 10 spokesman said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations.

That trip is about 260 miles and came just over a week after the prime minister\u2019s key aide decided to drive with his wife and child from his London home to his parents\u2019 farm, fearing being struck down by coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The trip by Cummings has led to no action by police, and its revelation on Friday by the Guardian and Daily Mirror led to calls for Cummings\u2019 resignation, but he has maintained his actions were lawful and not in breach of the lockdown.</p> \n  <p>Cummings also admitted to a trip on 12 April to a beauty spot, Barnard Castle, with his wife and child. He said on Monday he had been testing his eyesight and fitness to drive after being struck down by the virus.</p> \n  <p>Durham police say since the original news stories, they have received further claims and complaints from the public and are examining that information. </p> \n  <p>Cummings said he travelled to ensure childcare in case he and his wife were struck down by the virus, and claims an exemption to the stay at home order issued by his boss, the prime minister, allowed him to make the trip.

<strong tabindex=\"-1\">National Association of Head Teachers</strong> (NAHT), said fewer teachers would be available to support children with remote learning if pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 are taught in smaller groups from next week.</p> \n  <p>His comments came ahead of the government\u2019s final decision on whether to reopen primary schools in England to more pupils from as early as Monday.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, the school standards minister, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Nick Gibb</strong>, said it was \u201cdifficult to say\u201d whether the government\u2019s aim to get all primary school pupils back in class before the summer break will occur.</p> \n  <p>He told MPs on the education select committee: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Remote education, home education, will continue for the majority of pupils and young people \u2013 probably until the end of the summer term.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Findings from the NAHT suggest nearly three in five (57%) schools are providing home-learning resources for pupils daily and more than a quarter (29%) provide them weekly.</p> \n  <p>The survey of 4,784 school leaders, carried out earlier this month, also found that the majority of schools have been creating their own online resources as well as liaising with parents about home learning.</p> \n  <p>But the NAHT is concerned that the quality of remote learning on offer for the year groups that will not be returning to school in the summer term may suffer amid a wider reopening of schools in England.</p> \n  <p>Whiteman told the PA news agency: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Splitting classes in order to reduce the risk of transmission requires twice the number of staff, leaving fewer teachers to support those other children still at home.</p> \n   <p>I worry that an unintended consequence will be a detrimental impact on home learning.

  "<p>Why did so many people die in care homes? That may be the most urgent question of the likely public inquiry into the UK\u2019s Covid-19 response. The NHS wasn\u2019t overwhelmed, but 16,000 residents of care and nursing homes have died so far, compared with fewer than 3,000 in Germany and none in Hong Kong. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, claims the government \u201cthrew a protective ring\u201d around care homes. So, what went wrong?</p> <h2><strong>Controlling the infection</strong></h2> <p>In late January, as the Covid-19 death toll ticked up in Wuhan, China, care operators in Britain grew nervous. The Care Providers Association asked contacts at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) if there was any specific action they needed to take. Word came back: there was nothing to advise. A week later, the industry group tried again. How should it isolate infected residents and restrict visits, and who would supply personal protective equipment (PPE)?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/26/care-workers-should-be-better-paid-and-valued-after-covid-19-poll\">Care workers should be better paid and valued after Covid-19 \u2013\u00a0poll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-social-or-community-care-and-residential-settings-on-covid-19/guidance-for-social-or-community-care-and-residential-settings-on-covid-19#guidance-on-facemasks\">guidance</a> that finally came on 25 February bore a relaxed tone. Face masks \u201cdo not need to be worn by staff\u201d, there was no block on visits and there was \u201cno need to do anything differently in any care setting at present\u201d. It said: \u201cIt remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home ... will become infected.\u201d</p> <p>Over the following three months, care homes across the UK have been devastated by Covid-19. Forty per cent of homes have been hit in England, more in Scotland, and at least a dozen care workers are dead. The advice, officials stress now, was \u201crelated to what we knew at the time\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe should have been focusing on care homes from the start,\u201d said Prof Martin Green, chief executive of the industry association Care England. \u201cWhat we saw \u2026 was a focus on the NHS and that meant that care homes often had their medical support from the NHS withdrawn.\u201d</p> <p>There were warning signs that care homes would suffer. In early February, the government\u2019s own Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/882710/15-spi-m-o-consensus-statement-03022020.pdf\">reported</a> that infections were doubling at least every five days in China. There was probably already sustained transmission in the UK and \u201csevere cases are more common in older age groups\u201d.</p> <p>But there was no rush, continued the message. On 3 March, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, defended a lack of specific measures to protect care homes, saying: \u201cOne of the things we are keen to avoid is doing things too early.\u201d</p> <p>It was already too late for many. The following week, as the NHS pushed to discharge patients into care homes, came the first care home outbreaks in London, Nottingham, Stockport and Tameside. Green is angry. \u201cIn every crisis [the DHSC] go into overdrive about the NHS and forget social care. They should take it off their name,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Thirty-three outbreaks in the first week of March turned into 793 by the end of the month. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/covid-19-number-of-outbreaks-in-care-homes-management-information\">Data tracking the spread</a> was not made public by Public Health England (PHE) until 29 April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/care-homedeathsupdate/giv-3902z5dEIeMpG61S/\" data-alt=\"Care home v hospital covid death graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/care-homedeathsupdate/giv-3902z5dEIeMpG61S/\">Care home v hospital covid death graph</a> </figure>  <p>Neither was the government stopping visits to care homes by family and friends, which \u201csurprised\u201d the former Conservative health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200316125115/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance/covid-19-guidance-on-residential-care-provision\">PHE guidance </a>on 13 March asked homes only to keep out unwell visitors and those with suspected Covid-19.

Spain responded to care home deaths in late March by isolating \u201cpossible and probable\u201d cases as well as symptomatic residents. Germany kept its care home outbreaks to a minimum by saying that no one was allowed into care homes from hospitals without a negative Covid-19 test, or having undergone quarantine in designated centres or repurposed hotels for at least 14 days.</p> <p>DHSC says it is \u201cnot advisable\u201d to draw international comparisons and that since 2 April it urged the use of PPE with all patients, symptomatic or not.</p> <h2><strong>Hospital discharges</strong></h2> <p>To protect the NHS from the devastating situation that emerged in Italy \u2013 with the near collapse of hospitals \u2013 UK ministers ordered 15,000 hospital beds to be vacated by 27 March.

More certain was that their presence put others at risk in residential homes designed for communal activity, not isolation. With staffing stretched by absences and a chronic lack of protective equipment, infections spiralled upwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/care-home-map-zip/giv-3902GWpOUeoGEyXb/\" data-alt=\"Map of care home deaths\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/care-home-map-zip/giv-3902GWpOUeoGEyXb/\">Map of care home deaths</a> </figure>  <p>Some homes have now alleged that hospitals covered up infections of discharged patients.

Another risk was Covid-19-negative patients being discharged into infected homes, and subsequently catching coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cAt the peak of the outbreak we had admissions from hospital,\u201d said a nurse at a residential home where eight people died. The same staff treated everyone so infection spread was inevitable, she said on condition of anonymity, adding that two of the discharged people died from Covid-19. \u201cImagine if that was your relative,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people know what is happening.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 16 April that the government <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879639/covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan.pdf\">announced</a> NHS patients being discharged into care homes would be first tested for Covid-19 \u2013 by which time almost 1,000 homes in England had suffered outbreaks. The guidance still allows discharges pending test results. By the end of April, 6,500 care home residents in England were dead from Covid-19.</p> <h2><strong>Testing</strong></h2> <p>On 12 March, around the time the pandemic took off, the government decided to reduce testing for Covid-19 in the community. Care homes desperate to know more about infection felt they suddenly knew less.</p> <p>They were spotting puzzling symptoms like loss of appetite and sudden confusion, which differed from the standard advice to watch for coughs and a fever. Testing, though, was limited.

  "<p>Climate breakdown and the mass felling of trees has made the world\u2019s forests significantly shorter and younger overall, an analysis shows.&nbsp;</p> <p>The trend is expected to continue, scientists say, with worrying consequences for the ability of forests to store carbon and mitigate the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/climate-emergency-global-action-way-off-track-says-un-head-coronavirus\">climate emergency</a> and for the endangered wildlife that depends on rich, ancient forests.&nbsp;</p> <p>The analysis of more than 150 previous studies found the death rate of trees has increased, doubling in North America and significantly increasing in the Amazon, for example. The impact of forest destruction had cut the area of old growth forest by a third since 1900, the researchers said.</p> <p>But rising temperatures caused by global heating also cuts growth and increases tree deaths by&nbsp;limiting photosynthesis and causing stress. Furthermore, high temperatures, drought, high storm winds and pests and disease affect older trees more and are all on the rise.</p> <p>Tom Pugh, a scientist at the University of Birmingham, UK, said: \u201cOur study reviews mounting evidence that climate change is accelerating tree mortality, increasingly pushing the world\u2019s forests towards being both younger and shorter. </p> <p>\u201cThey have been getting smaller and younger over the last century, primarily because of the effects of human land use change, and disturbances like wildfires and insect outbreaks and droughts. These are things that are increasing in frequency and severity.\u201d</p> <p>There were exceptions, Pugh said, such as forests in high latitudes: \u201cBut in a world that\u2019s generally hotter, more of the world will be covered by forests that are generally shorter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOver the last hundred years we have lost a lot of old forests,\u201d said Nate McDowell, at the US Department of Energy\u2019s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, who led the analysis. \u201cThey\u2019ve been replaced in part by non-forests and in part by young forests. This has consequences on biodiversity, climate mitigation, and forestry.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/12/deforestation-world-losing-area-forest-size-of-uk-each-year-report-finds\">World losing area of forest the size of the UK each year, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The research, <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaz9463\">published in the journal Science</a> and including analysis of satellite data on land-use change, estimated that human felling of trees had cut total forest area by 12% since 1900. The proportion of old growth forest, more than 140 years old, fell from 89% to 66% in that time. Lack of data meant the researchers were not able to make a precise estimate of how much shorter the forests had become.</p> <p>Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could increase tree growth but the researchers said this appeared to happen only in younger forests with abundant nutrients and water. However, most forests have limited nutrients and water, which drastically reduces the carbon dioxide benefits to trees.</p> <p>Pugh said the vast majority of forests in the UK and Europe were examples of unnaturally short and young woodlands. \u201cThey are not of the stature that many of those forests would have been before humans fundamentally changed them by harvesting at regular intervals and planting new species, in some cases monoculture,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Prof Tom Crowther, at ETH Zurich University in Switzerland and not part of the analysis team, said the study was extremely important: \u201cFor a long time, scientists have predicted that elevated CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and warming will increase carbon storage in forests that will help to offset climate change. But this study adds to a growing concern that these factors, along with human disturbance, may in fact be decreasing the amount of carbon stored in these ecosystems.</p> <p>\u201cBut it also suggests that, if we can protect the forests that we already have, and allow them to grow to maturity, there is a huge potential for them to capture a lot of additional carbon,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Prof Simon Lewis at University College London said: \u201cBecause old-growth forest is being lost, then on average, across the globe, forests are getting shorter and younger. Yet, counter to this, and what the researchers don\u2019t highlight is that within many old-growth forests the opposite is happening.</p> <p>\u201cThe world\u2019s intact tropical and boreal forests are both globally important as carbon sinks, and are getting larger. The world\u2019s forests currently slow climate change, and while future mortality trends could reverse this, the ideas in the new report don\u2019t change what the world needs to do: stabilise the climate by quickly driving fossil fuel emissions to zero and protect the world\u2019s forests.\u201d</p> <p>Pugh said the analysis of changing conditions across the world also had implications for protecting forests. \u201cWhen you\u2019re thinking in conservation terms, it can be quite poignant,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might be trying to preserve a [forest] ecosystem that fundamentally cannot continue to exist in the way that it has existed over the past.\u201d</p>",

I told you it was confusing.</p> <p>Hon says he learned the whipped coffee technique from \u201ca foreign couple\u201d years earlier. It\u2019s unclear if the couple were just explaining the common Indian homestyle \u201cbeaten coffee\u201d (for which the technique is identical), but soon Dalgona coffee (now named for its resemblance to a nostalgic Korean honeycomb candy) was spreading among YouTubers, TikTokkers and Instagrammers. In the second half of March, YouTube views of videos with \u201cDalgona\u201d in the title increased 5,000%.&nbsp;</p> <p>I tried it. It\u2019s pretty good.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Power ranking:</strong> 4/10 indignant Indian grandmothers</p> <h2><strong>2.

We hoarded pasta, tinned tomatoes and mince \u2013 everyone decided it was time to get their bolognese on.&nbsp;</p> <p>Did you have spaghetti bolognese during isolation? Yes, you did. Did you make a lasagne because that was the only pasta left that you could buy? You probably did that too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Adam Liaw's lasagne\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

Secret corporate recipes</strong></h2> <p>By April corporations had well and truly leaped on to the isolation cooking bandwagon, releasing official recipes for popular food products.

The only thing required was for the public and media to ignore how these recipes bore no resemblance whatsoever to the products actually on sale \u2013 which by and large, we did.</p> <p><strong>Power ranking: </strong>2/10 free column inches&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>7.

Of course not.</p> <p>Personally, I don\u2019t think you need to provide a dissertation on the origins of every spice when you decided to put a teaspoon and a half into a recipe. Does putting chickpeas and literally two spices into a stew even make it Indian? If an Indian person puts chilli in a recipe do they need to give a shout out to Christopher Columbus and the new world 500 years after the fact?</p> <p>I can tell you with some degree of certainty that if Alison Roman had dared call #thestew Indian, the rebukes would have been fast and severe. Besides, I\u2019m pretty sure she isn\u2019t trying to convince anyone she invented turmeric.</p> <p>Of course we should be aware of which voices are elevated in food media, and divorcing recipes from their cultural origins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/feb/23/do-online-recipes-come-with-too-much-backstory-its-all-part-of-the-joy-of-food\">has its problems</a>, but attribution isn\u2019t one of them.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s not as if the cooks of the subcontinent never published their own recipes for chickpea stews. You could have cooked one of those if you wanted to.</p> <p>When a thing goes viral it\u2019s not because of the person who made the thing. It\u2019s not even because of the media. It\u2019s because of us.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you want to know why chickpea stew took off in a New York minute, or why it took a Korean actor to send Indian beaten coffee around the world, don\u2019t ask Alison Roman or Jung Il-woo.

However, the true number of infections is likely to be much higher, however, given the vast number of unrecorded and asymptomatic cases.</p> <p>The&nbsp;US&nbsp;is home to around 30% of people with the disease around the world, the data shows, way ahead of&nbsp;Brazil&nbsp;(7.2%),&nbsp;Russia&nbsp;(6.6%), the&nbsp;UK&nbsp;(4.7%),&nbsp;Spain&nbsp;(4.1%) and&nbsp;Italy&nbsp;(4%).</p> <h2>England to allow up to six people to meet outside</h2> <p>Boris Johnson announced that from Monday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/groups-up-to-six-people-allowed-meet-england-monday-coronavirus-lockdown-easing\">up to six people will be able to meet outside</a> providing members of different households continue to stay two metres apart. This will be allowed in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, the British prime minister added.</p> <p>Health authorities in the&nbsp;UK reported 377 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the total official death toll in Europe\u2019s worst-affected country to 37,837.</p> <h2>Paris risk lowered to \u2018orange\u2019</h2> <p>Paris&nbsp;is no longer deemed to be a \u201cred\u201d coronavirus danger zone, the risks posed by the virus moving down a notch to \u201corange\u201d, France\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said.</p> <p>The orange rating means Paris is not as free of the virus as the majority of regions in&nbsp;France&nbsp;designated \u201cgreen\u201d. However, earlier lockdown measures will still be eased in Paris, with parks in the capital due to reopen next week.</p> <p>Philippe said health results have been good so far as the country prepares to enter a second phase in its relaxation of lockdown rules on 2 June.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <h2><strong>Italy death toll rises by 70</strong></h2> <p>Deaths from coronavirus in&nbsp;Italy&nbsp;rose by 70 on Thursday, down from 117 on Wednesday, bringing the total to 33,142. There are 47,986 people who are currently suffering from the virus in Italy, down by 2,980 within the last 24 hours. Italy has 231,732 confirmed cases to date.</p> <h2>Moscow adds patients who \u2018died with\u2019 virus to total toll</h2> <p>Health officials in Moscow updated their figures on coronavirus deaths. On top of 636 deaths in April directly caused by Covid-19 reported earlier, the Moscow health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes.</p> <p>In 360 of those cases, it noted the coronavirus acted as a catalyst, exacerbating the patients\u2019 conditions and contributing to their deaths. The health department also factored in 169 deaths of people who tested negative but autopsies showed had likely succumbed to the virus.&nbsp;</p> <h2>US job losses pass 40m</h2> <p>The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million as the number of unemployment claims continued to rise with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week.</p> <p>The latest figures from the Department of Labor show that the rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall over the last few weeks, down from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">its peak</a>&nbsp;in early April, when 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment in a single week.</p> <p>While the growth of unemployment claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number of unemployed to a rate not seen since the Great Depression.&nbsp;</p> <h2>New York governor to sign executive order on mask usage</h2> <p>New York governor&nbsp;Andrew Cuomo&nbsp;said he would sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers who are not wearing masks.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect himself. That store owner has a right to protect the other patrons in that store.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to wear a mask, fine. But you don\u2019t have a right to then go into that store if that store-owner doesn\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>US deaths pass 100,000</strong></h2> <p>Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-deaths-toll-1000000\">United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths</a>&nbsp;from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p> <p>The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain.</p> <h2>159,000 excess deaths in Europe since early March</h2> <p>There have been more than 159,000 excess deaths in&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;since since early March, during the height of the coronavirus epidemic, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) regional office for the continent has said.</p> <p>Hans Kluge, director of WHO Europe, said that 2 million people had been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus since it was first detected on the continent four months ago. About 175,000 had died of Covid-19.</p> <h2>New outbreak in Western Australia</h2> <p>The number of Covid-19 cases linked to a live export ship which docked in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/western-australia\">Western Australia</a>&nbsp;doubled from six to 12.</p> <p>Of these seven new cases recorded in the state on Thursday, six are crew members from the Al-Kuwait ship which docked in Fremantle this week. The only other case was a returned overseas traveller who is already in hotel quarantine.</p>",
  "<p>When officials in western Canada received the squashed remains of a hornet in late May they immediately knew trouble was in their hands.&nbsp;</p> <p>With its hulking orange and black body, the insect sent in by a concerned resident was unmistakably an Asian giant hornet \u2013 an aggressive predator&nbsp;increasingly known as the \u201cmurder\u201d hornet.</p> <p>Fears have grown that the hornet \u2013 given the \u201cmurder\u201d moniker by Japanese media \u2013 is spreading throughout the Pacific north-west.&nbsp;And the latest discovery suggests that the species has reached far deeper into British Columbia than previously thought.</p> <p>In a letter to beekeepers, Paul van Westendorp, the province\u2019s chief apiarist, said more sightings were expected and urged them to remain \u201cvigilant\u201d as hornets and wasps slowly emerge from their nests.</p> <p>His team plans to conduct a DNA analysis of the dead hornet to determine if it was a queen or a worker. A dead queen would be a welcome find, meaning any attempts by the hornet to gain footing in the region have been slowed. But a dead worker would signal an underground nest had already been established.&nbsp;</p> <p>An apex predator as large as an adult thumb, the hornet is endemic to forested and mountainous regions in Asia \u2013 a landscape similar to much of coastal British Columbia and Washington state.</p> <p>In 2019 bee keepers spotted \u2013 and subsequently eradicated \u2013 a nest near the city of Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, sustaining numerous painful stings in the process.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/02/murder-hornets-washington-state-bees-twitter\">'Murder hornets' in Washington state threaten bees and whip up media swarm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Soon after, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/asian-giant-hornet-washington.html/?2020-05-02T09%3A00%3A13%2000%3A00\">beekeepers near the American border city of Blaine also found </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/asian-giant-hornet-washington.html/?2020-05-02T09%3A00%3A13%2000%3A00\"> thousands of dead honeybees</a> \u2013 the first evidence that the hornets had spread into the US.</p> <p>\u201cThey have massive heads with these giant mandibles and they just chop them in half,\u201d Gard Otis, a&nbsp;bee specialist at the University of Guelph told the Canadian Press. \u201cThey just cut their heads off, cut their bodies in half, and you end up with a slaughter on the ground in front of the hive.\u201d</p> <p>Beekeepers are increasingly concerned that the hornet could continue its spread, putting more pressure on bees whose declining population <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/26/decline-of-bees-poses-potential-risks-to-major-crops-says-un\">already poses a threat to major crops</a> and other plant life.</p> <p>Experts say that widespread proliferation of the hornets can be contained if individuals are quickly tracked back to a nest.</p> <p>A handful of deaths are recorded each year in Asia from the hornets\u2019 sting, largely the result of accidentally disturbing their buried nests.</p>",
  "<p>The European commission has put down a marker for the world with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/eu-pledges-coronavirus-recovery-plan-will-not-harm-climate-goals\">green recovery package</a>. It sets a high standard for other nations, using the rebuilding of coronavirus-ravaged economies to tackle the even greater threat of the climate emergency, in principle at least.</p> <p>With the world fast approaching the point when climate chaos becomes inevitable, how the trillions of recovery dollars \u2013 or euros \u2013 are spent is a use-it-or-lose-it moment, so what the EU does really matters. Climate change is a global crisis, meaning all nations must act and some must lead the way.</p> <p>Under Donald Trump, the US is slashing green protections while the biggest polluter, China, is sending mixed messages by backing coal power stations as part of its recovery. The UK, host of the next critical UN summit, has been all but silent.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s plan seeks to <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-eu-budget-recovery-climate-factbox/factbox-key-climate-spending-in-eus-green-recovery-plan-idUKKBN2331RB?utm_campaign=Carbon%20Brief%20Daily%20Briefing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\">pour money into emissions-busting sectors</a>: \u20ac91bn (\u00a381bn) a year for home energy efficiency and green heating, \u20ac25bn of renewable energy, and \u20ac20bn for clean cars over two years, plus 2m charging points in five years. Up to \u20ac60bn will go to zero-emissions trains and the production of 1m tonnes of clean hydrogen is planned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf0d90d7af3172ce965817353bab0ac46a02982f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf0d90d7af3172ce965817353bab0ac46a02982f/0_303_4043_2426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A charging point for electric cars in Gdansk, Poland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A charging point for electric cars in Gdansk, Poland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At least a million green jobs will be created, with workers in polluting industries helped into new roles, a critical part of the plan. Increasing the Just Transition Fund more than fivefold to \u20ac40bn minimises the risk of protests against green measures, especially in states with the heaviest coal use such as Poland, Germany and Romania, which will be among the biggest recipients. This is politically necessary, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/green-stimulus-can-repair-global-economy-and-climate-study-says\">investment in the green economy already being a no-brainer</a>.</p> <p>The EU plan may even have a direct impact on the rest of the world, with a border tax on carbon-intensive industrial imports from other nations <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a165a7c9-85d8-4ec9-9a1a-70d86412ac07\">potentially raising up to \u20ac14bn</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>But despite the European commission saying \u201cpublic investments in the recovery should respect the green oath to \u2018do no harm\u2019\u201d, critics worry there are no hard guarantees against the money seeping into dirty projects. The Covid-19 crisis has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-profiteers-condemned-as-polluters-gain-bailout-billions\">polluters lobbying hard for bailouts</a>.</p> <p>The Just Transition Fund will be routed through the European Investment Bank, but campaigners say its climate criteria allow the backing of gas projects that would lock in emissions for years. Another key fund, the \u20ac150bn React EU programme, allows member states to decide how to spend the money \u2013 most of the almost \u20ac2tn in coronavirus rescue funds spent by EU nations so far has had no green guarantees.</p> <p>Worse, say critics, climate conditions on large parts of the main EU budget have been lifted for three years because of the pandemic. The proportion of the budget reserved for climate projects remains stuck at 25%, despite demands by the European parliament and many others to raise it.</p> <p>The commission rejects these criticisms, saying the \u201cobjective of the green economy is present throughout the whole management of the funds\u201d. Whether this oversight proves effective will be the critical test.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-green-light-email\">Sign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most important stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, green-leaning business and investor groups have welcomed the recovery package, calling it bold and substantive.

  "<p>Rebecca Willis has done a great service in confirming that there has long been a deeply rooted socially constructed silence on climate change among MPs (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/i-dont-want-to-be-seen-as-a-zealot-what-mps-really-think-about-the-climate-crisis\" title=\"\">\u2018I don\u2019t want to be seen as a zealot\u2019: what MPs really think about the climate crisis</a>, Long read, 21 May). However, there is a silence within that silence: namely the refusal of MPs who do engage with climate change to acknowledge it as first and foremost a global issue, and not merely an international or even national one.</p> <p>It is no longer tenable for the world to rely solely on individual countries such as the UK to blaze trails towards net-zero emissions in the hope that others will voluntarily follow at their own pace. World leaders need to wake up to the looming security threats from burning fossil fuels (and forests) and start tackling them at their sources \u2013 in the first instance by setting enforceable controls on extraction of fossil fuels, akin to controls on nuclear arms.</p> <p>Perhaps this is the \u201cstory on climate change\u201d that Rebecca Willis discerns to be lacking on the political right (although its few advocates so far seem to be on the left). It need not be in conflict with the left\u2019s desire for a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d, or any sane person\u2019s wish for a sustainable world beyond the Covid-19 crisis.<br><strong>Hugh Richards</strong><br><em>Stroud, Gloucestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Willis\u2019s excellent article portrays clearly why our government is unlikely to lead the world by example during its presidency role for the 2020 UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26). Ministers know that people will only vote for things that they want. With Covid-19, the public have willingly sacrificed many rights and liberties because the threat to their health and wellbeing has been repeatedly explained.</p> <p>But the government consistently fails to explain that the world is headed for warming well in excess of the safe limit of 1.5 degrees which was identified in the IPCC special report in 2018.</p> <p>We need degrowth, with regard to both population and all those non-essential indulgences that come with a significant carbon footprint. Already the UK cannot sustain its growing population with its own resources. If told the truth, the public will be selfless and courageous. We cannot negotiate with physics, we cannot say: \u201cHold on, we\u2019re dealing with another crisis.\u201d While the government continues to seek a return to business as usual, we are failing to set an example for other world leaders.

  "<p>Curbing the coronavirus outbreak involves a familiar mantra: test, trace, isolate. As of this week, the government will begin to roll out the second part of this strategy. In theory, contact tracers will call or text people in England who test positive for coronavirus, asking them to provide a list of everyone they have met for longer than 15 minutes, who will then receive a message instructing them to self-isolate for 14 days (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are rolling out separate programmes).</p> <p>But already, England\u2019s contact-tracing strategy looks set to be hobbled by the government\u2019s reluctance to involve local authorities and regional public health expertise in its coronavirus response from the outset, and its dogmatic commitment to outsourcing health services to the private sector. &nbsp;</p> <p>Baroness Dido Harding, who is leading the programme of testing and tracing, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenPBradshaw/status/1265943777589551104?s=20\">recently conceded</a> that the system won\u2019t be fully operational at the local level until late June.

Although it recently announced <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/300-million-additional-funding-for-local-authorities-to-support-new-test-and-trace-service\">an extra \u00a3300m</a> to support local authorities in England to deliver the new test and trace strategies, these authorities will have their work cut out to quickly stitch together a coherent and organised programme from a confusing landscape of NHS commissioners and providers, parallel central initiatives, outsourced private contractors, and the recently established Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC). The JBC\u2019s roles include collecting and analysing data about Covid-19 infection rates across England, identifying and providing real-time analysis about local outbreaks and recommending appropriate responses to spikes in infections \u2013 for example, whether schools or workplaces in local areas should be closed, or whether different restrictions should be imposed in different areas.&nbsp;</p> <p>Details on how the JBC will be staffed or set up to provide real-time data and intelligence for local authorities haven\u2019t been published. Somewhat bizarrely, rather than appointing a public health specialist to lead the body, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/former-counter-terror-official-tom-hurd-put-in-charge-new-uk-biosecurity-centre-coronavirus\">the government has appointed Tom Hurd</a>, a senior Home Office counter-terrorism official. According to <a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/joint-biosecurity-centre\">the Institute </a><a href=\"https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/joint-biosecurity-centre\">for Government</a>, the JBC is modelled on the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which analyses counter-terrorism intelligence and sets the terrorism threat level for the country. In much the same way, the JBC will set a coronavirus threat according to five different levels. But as with all centralised bureaucracies, there\u2019s a risk that the JBC will contribute to delays, as data trickles down to the local areas where it\u2019s needed most. There\u2019s also a risk that members of the public will be put off by their data being held by an organisation modelled on a centralised counter-terrorism organisation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Crucially, test results can\u2019t be anonymised if they are to be used in local disease control management. Once again, trust in the system is vital. Both the JBC and local authorities will have to rely on the various private companies that have been contracted to deliver aspects of the testing and contact-tracing strategy in England, including Randox, Deloitte, Serco, G4S and Sodexo. The detailed specifications of their contracts are not public, and the division of roles and responsibilities between the centre, local authorities and the private sector remain unclear. It\u2019s hard not to wonder why England has created such a complicated and fragmented architecture for itself, rather than following the example of other countries that have involved local authorities from the outset.</p> <p>I previously worked as director of public health in Hammersmith and Fulham, and I\u2019ve seen the efforts of public health teams in north-east London during this epidemic. Across the country, we have smart, competent and committed public health officers. Indeed, the UK has one of the best specialised public health training programmes in the world.

He said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the slow progress of compensation payments, but urged people who have been affected to come forward and make claims.</p> \n<p>Judy Griffith was told by a jobcentre employee that she was an illegal immigrant, 52 years after moving to the UK from Barbados. She could not travel, so was unable to see her mother before she died. As a result of being unable to work she got into significant arrears on her flat. She is waiting for compensation so she can pay back the arrears and repay friends and relatives who helped her when she was classified as an illegal immigrant. She applied for compensation more than six months ago and is still waiting.</p> \n<p>\u201cI understand that they have to verify everything but I am still in arrears, still trying to keep my head above water, still getting calls from the council about the arrears. We\u2019re still suffering and they don\u2019t seem to understand how badly it has affected our lives,\u201d she said. </p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>South Korea tightens restrictions again after spike in cases</h2> <p>South Korea has tightened restrictions in the metropolitan area of Seoul after a spike in infections.&nbsp;Restrictions had been lifted across the country on 6 May after the outbreak appeared to be brought under control. However, officials have recorded the biggest spike in infections in nearly two months, prompting the closure of museums, parks and art galleries in the Seoul area for two weeks from Friday. Half of South Korea\u2019s 51 million people live in the metropolitan area where restrictions are being tightened.</p> <h2>US deaths pass 100,000</h2> <p>Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-deaths-toll-1000000\">United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths</a>&nbsp;from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain.</p> <h2><strong>Trump silent on US death toll</strong></h2> <p>Donald Trump remained silent on the death of more than 100,000 Americans from Covid-19 as the US mourned the milestone. The president made no comment on Twitter about the momentous day, but used the platform to attack tech companies for trying to censor him, a day after Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/trump-twitter-fact-check-warning-label\">put a fact-check warning on one of his claims.</a></p> <h2>Total case numbers exceed 5.7m worldwide</h2> <p>The number of people infected by the coronavirus has exceeded 5.7 million, according to data compiled by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">the John Hopkins University</a>.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>US</strong>&nbsp;is home to to 29.8% of the 5,707,163 people with the disease around the world, the data shows, way ahead&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>Brazil</strong>&nbsp;(7.2%),&nbsp;<strong>Russia</strong>&nbsp;(6.6%), the&nbsp;<strong>UK</strong>&nbsp;(4.7%),&nbsp;<strong>Spain</strong>&nbsp;(4.1%) and&nbsp;<strong>Italy</strong>&nbsp;(4%).&nbsp;The true number of infections is likely to be much higher, however, given the vast number of unrecorded and asymptomatic cases.</p> <h2><strong>UN: Virus could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America</strong></h2> <p>The UN World Food Program is warning that at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on.

Some 65% of the 6,412 projects in question are already in place or continuing \u201calbeit with downgraded capacity and recruitment\u201d, EY said. A further 25% were delayed and 10 percent cancelled, its Europe Attractiveness survey found.</p> <h2>Ireland faces record recession, says think tank</h2> <p>Ireland is facing its deepest ever recession as the coronavirus lockdown devastates jobs and strains the public finances, a think tank said Thursday. A report by Ireland\u2019s Economic and Social Research Institute predicts the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) will decline 12.4% this year.

How we\u2019ve missed you. In the dark initial days of Covid-19, many feared Australia\u2019s winter codes would be done for 2020. But some old-fashioned bullocking from the NRL saw it return to action first, and tonight\u2019s game between Brisbane and Parramatta was the first step towards completing an unlikely premiership season. </p> <p>And what an advert for the sport it was. The Eels were irrepressible, bossing the Broncos from the first minute to the last in a fine advertisement for their title credentials. They are now unbeaten after three rounds and, revealingly, revelled in the new environs formed by the six-again rule. Parramatta held the ball well, attacked and capitalised when Brisbane made their errors \u2013 and there were plenty of them. </p> <p>On this evidence, the awarding of a fresh set of six tackles for ruck infringements opens the game up and forces it to be played at a greater speed. Inevitably this also leads to a higher incidence of errors, leading to the conclusion there are fewer places to hide for inferior teams. Blowouts could become frequent in this brave new world for rugby league. </p> <p>The move to use just one referee was ridiculed by some but tonight, Gerard Sutton was barely sighted. And that it always a good thing. So while cardboard cutouts and virtual crowd audio was as close as fans got to the live experience, the reboot of the 2020 season should be considered nothing other than resounding success for the NRL. </p> <p>For more of the same, we hope, be sure to return tomorrow night for our liveblog of the Roosters-Rabbitohs clash. Thanks for your company. Footy\u2019s back. How good is that?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98d62ceddc4836501c72e43a854101f42804c441\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98d62ceddc4836501c72e43a854101f42804c441/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Suncorp Stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not a fan in sight, but Parramatta put on a showing worthy of a packed stadium against the Broncos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren England/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T12:10:48.348Z\">at 1.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ecfa3368f0898700351dd37\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T11:42:15.206Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FT: Brisbane 6-34 Parramatta</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Well, it wasn\u2019t the 58-0 flogging of 2019 but the Eels were no less impressive in putting Brisbane away to shoot to the top of the ladder with a 3-0 record.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T11:44:06.584Z\">at 12.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ecfa23e8f084e882655a524\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T11:40:34.621Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">TRY!

The Eels are on top everywhere: 59-41% in possession, 1,130-779 in metres run, 135-87 in total passes, 12-6 on the scoreboard. The Broncos are finding it hard to get the ball, and then keep it when do.

In a recent field test, users in multiple remote locations chose from a range of on-screen options that sent their cheers, applause, chants and boos into the 50,000-seat Shizuoka Stadium Ecopa via 58 speakers set up among the empty seats. The app does not, as yet, allow fans to question the referee\u2019s eyesight, or the eating habits of players who struggled to stay match-fit during the league\u2019s virus-enforced break.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/japan-launches-remote-cheering-app-to-boost-atmosphere-in-empty-stadiums\">Remote cheering app could boost atmosphere in Japan's empty stadiums</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Less technological but none the less innovative has been the NRL\u2019s own attempt to give off the impression a stadium is full, with fans able to buy $22 cardboard cutouts of themselves, which would be placed in the stands.

  "<p>Timing matters. Early 2020 saw an economic collapse the likes of which have not been seen in living memory. Growth has collapsed, unemployment has soared, poverty has increased.</p> <p>Yet in different circumstances the past few months would have been dominated by calls for countries to do more to cut carbon emissions. As 2019 drew to an end, everybody from the managing director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/30/imf-boss-kristalina-georgiva-climate-crisis-financial-crash-economics\">International Monetary Fund</a>&nbsp;to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/13/firms-ignoring-climate-crisis-bankrupt-mark-carney-bank-england-governor\">governor of the Bank of England</a> was warning of the threat of global heating.</p> <p>A year of floods, hurricanes and bush fires had made a strong case for action to make economies more sustainable. What was lacking was a profound shock that would make change possible. Now we\u2019ve had one.</p> <p>Governments are creating, borrowing and spending money like never before in peacetime, in an attempt to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. They have the opportunity to reshape their economies in a way that would be consistent with preventing catastrophic increases in global temperatures. Businesses are already learning lessons from the lockdown, such as that modern technology no longer makes it essential for an executive to travel half way round the world for a business meeting, and that employees can be just as productive working from home as they can when sat in expensive set-piece city centre offices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/17/labour-to-plan-green-economic-rescue-from-coronavirus-crisis\">Labour to plan green economic rescue from coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The world has been here before, though, and there is no guarantee that an opportunity proffered will be an opportunity taken. One was certainly missed at the back end of the 2000s, when the banks nearly went bust. Supporters of a <a href=\"https://greennewdealgroup.org/\">Green New Deal</a>&nbsp;(of whom I was one) said governments should avert the possibility of a second Great Depression by investing in decarbonisation of their economies and programmes that would put people back to work by making their homes energy-efficient.</p> <p>As now, the global economy contracted. As now, this led to a fall in carbon emissions. Yet, there was only a brief flirtation with the idea of a Green New Deal, and the attraction of a return to business as usual proved more powerful. A <a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/30797/EGR2019.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">1% fall in emissions in 2009 was followed by a </a><a href=\"https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/30797/EGR2019.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">near 6%</a> rise in 2010 as conventional stimulus packages kicked in. The banks were bailed out; governments took fright at the size of budget deficits and imposed austerity; nothing really changed.</p> <p>Things look a bit different this time. The UK economy shrank by as much in March \u2013 when there was barely more than a week of lockdown \u2013 as it did in the whole of the 2008-9 recession. April\u2019s number will be a lot worse, and recovery is going to be slow, even assuming there is no second wave of infections.</p> <p>During the financial crisis, the then Labour government took a stake in two of Britain\u2019s high-street banks. This time, a Conservative government has effectively nationalised the railways, announced plans to support strategically important companies, and is paying the wages of more than 10 million workers.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, it has been a case of money is no object. The UK is on course to borrow \u00a3300bn this year at dirt cheap interest rates. The Bank of England is creating money through its quantitative easing programme. The argument that a Green New Deal is unaffordable is still knocking around, but is much less powerful than it was a decade ago. Ministers can decide whether they want to do more than respond to the immediate crisis and they certainly have the power to shape the recovery by making demands of the companies they are supporting, if they choose to use it.</p> <p>Here the picture is mixed. Governments make all the right noises about sustainability, yet many of them have used the crisis as an excuse for relaxing or suspending environmental regulations in order to stimulate activity of any sort. Those who think action of global heating should be a matter for markets not governments see Covid-19 as an opportunity too.</p> <p>The mood has changed, though. The World Economic Forum, the body that organises the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos noted in a recent <a href=\"https://www.zurich.com/en/knowledge/topics/global-risks/covid-19-risks-outlook\">report</a>&nbsp;that carbon emissions were on course to decline by 8% this year, but in order to limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5C they would have to fall by a similar amount every year for a decade. When the world\u2019s biggest investor, BlackRock, says it will vote<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/27/blackrock-to-flag-climate-concerns-at-exxonmobil-agm\"> against ExxonMobil at its annual meeting</a> because the oil giant is failing to do enough to hit emissions targets, it is clear that global heating has permeated the mainstream.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/28/so-much-living-to-do-stories-of-the-uks-coronavirus-victims\">'So much living to do': stories of the UK's coronavirus victims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But only up to a point. For some, lockdown has provided a glimpse of what a sustainable economy might look like. For others \u2013 those who face losing their jobs in carbon-intensive sectors \u2013 that sort of future doesn\u2019t look so attractive.</p> <p>Politics reflects this tension. If parties of the left sometimes seem less enthusiastic about a GND than they might be, it is because a lot of the people who vote for them like the idea of cheap flights and rely on their old banger to pay visits to their mum. No question, any transition to a greener, more sustainable economy will have to overcome not just active opposition but passive resistance from those who would like life to return to its pre-Covid-19 crisis state.</p> <p>One solution might be to trial in one of the UK\u2019s big cities \u2013 Manchester or Glasgow, say \u2013 to see whether a GND creates jobs, cuts emissions and generates a new wave of profitable environmental innovation. Opponents of change don\u2019t need to do anything; they simply need to wait for inertia to kick in. Those who want a different sort of economy need to start somewhere. And they should start with a simple question: if not now, when?</p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor</p>",

  "<p>The gyms, pools and squash courts are shut. Joe Wicks is showing you how to get fit in your living room, but really all you want to do is get out of your living room. Now is the time to go for a run.</p> <p>If you are worried you\u2019re not a running type, don\u2019t be. I wasn\u2019t either until I decided that I didn\u2019t feel safe going to the gym in mid-March. Eight weeks later, I finished my first half-hour run, covering an apparently respectable 4.83km in the process. Almost anyone can be a runner, it turns out. So why not give it a try?</p> <h2>Get the kit</h2> <p>The great thing about running is that you don\u2019t need membership of a fancy club, expensive equipment or a qualified coach. But you do have to get some stuff: a good pair of shoes is non-negotiable, as is a sports bra if you need one.</p> <p>You don\u2019t need to go wild for these things: yes, \u00a3200 will get you the pair of shoes that helped Eliud Kipchoge run the first sub-two-hour marathon, but beginners can settle for something much cheaper. But do resist the urge to just whack on the pair of throwback Nikes you bought for fashion purposes last year.</p> <p>\u201cFor people who are starting out, it\u2019s important not to get bogged down in the kit, and actually think about the action of running,\u201d says Anna Harding, the host of YouTube\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9rMjzx9lj0\">the Running Channel</a>. \u201cBut I would suggest investing in a new pair of specific running trainers, and, for women, a sports bra. You don\u2019t know the state of your old shoes, and it\u2019s important to take care of your feet and knees. Other than that, though, wear what you feel good in.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"029858e331c30d4940b5c80c5ffa8dd780f795df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/029858e331c30d4940b5c80c5ffa8dd780f795df/63_0_3330_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wear what you feel good in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wear what you feel good in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Start slow</h2> <p>When you first hit the road, you need to run slowly. Really slowly. So slowly you feel silly because of how slowly you are running. Slow enough that you\u2019re pretty sure you could overtake yourself at a brisk walk.</p> <p>The point of running is endurance, and the most important thing to do is to make sure that you keep your heart rate elevated for the entire period of every training run. That means, especially at the beginning, erring on the side of caution: if you run slowly and find yourself barely breaking a sweat 20 minutes in, then you can speed up, but if you go too fast at the start, those last five minutes are going to be tough.</p> <h2>Get with the programme</h2> <p>\u201cStart slow\u201d also applies to how you should build up stamina over the first few weeks and months of your run. Thankfully, there is a best-in-class option here: the Couch to 5k programme, originally created by Josh Clark, an American software designer, in 1996. The idea is simple: run three times a week for eight weeks, beginning with sessions that involve more walking than actual running, and ending with 30 minutes of non-stop jogging.</p> <p>Your first session sees you running for a minute then walking for 90 seconds, and repeating the pattern eight times \u2013 enough to get an elevated heart rate for 20 minutes, and to get a solid eight minutes of actual running in. Four weeks later, the running has increased to three sets of five minutes, separated by three minutes of walking. And at the end of week five, the training wheels come off, and you run for a full 20 minutes non-stop.</p> <p>When I first tried to become a runner, in 2009, I would manually create those routines, booting up GarageBand on an old laptop and recording myself saying \u201crun\u201d and \u201cwalk\u201d over the top of whatever I wanted to listen to, then loading it on to an iPod Shuffle. No wonder I didn\u2019t stick with it. These days, it\u2019s easier: the <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/couch-to-5k-week-by-week/\">NHS has produced a podcast and app</a> that automatically coaches you through the first nine weeks of your run.</p> <h2>Find what motivates you to keep going</h2> <p>Some people think I\u2019m daft for running to podcasts, wondering how on earth I can get into a good rhythm while catching up on Today in Focus. Sometimes, I think they\u2019re nuts for running to music: no matter how good a tune is, it\u2019s not distracting enough to save me from getting a bit bored 20 minutes in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"332ee261be6facd1daf5f52c39ad2b2ca5025a4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/332ee261be6facd1daf5f52c39ad2b2ca5025a4b/0_0_1024_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zombies, Run!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zombies, Run!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you want something more active still, you could try <a href=\"https://zombiesrungame.com/\">Zombies, Run</a>! The app, which first launched eight years ago, lets you play through audio adventures timed to encourage and motivate you throughout a workout. A stand-alone couch-to-5k version can accompany you right from the start.</p> <p>\u201cI started running when I was 20 or 21, and when we started Zombies, Run!, I was 28 or 29. Now I\u2019m 37,\u201d says Adrian Hon, the app\u2019s co-creator. \u201cI was a runner at that point, but I intensely remember the experience of not being a good runner. It came to me hard.\u201d</p> <h2>Don\u2019t worry about how you look</h2> <p>No one cares how sweaty you are, whether the top you run in is too bright or how fast or slow you\u2019re going. So don\u2019t worry about it. \u201cA lot of the advertising, marketing and branding around running is incredibly unhelpful,\u201d Hon says, \u201cbecause it makes people think that a runner is some athletic supercharged person in Nike gear who doesn\u2019t sweat. People get really self-conscious about that, and they get embarrassed. But no one gives a shit. Really: no one gives a shit what you look like.\u201d</p> <h2>Try to keep your distance</h2> <p>Pavement space is at a bit of a premium right now, and in some places, that has led to hard feelings between runners, walkers and cyclists \u2013 not to mention the drivers who still get the majority of the road.</p> <p>\u201cIt has certainly become more of an obstacle course as we try to maintain the two-metre distance,\u201d Harding says. \u201cAnd I think as runners we are getting a little bit of side-eye from pedestrians, perhaps because of some reports suggesting that runners aren\u2019t adhering to physical distancing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"034f46b18a2b0da7b29291a20c30ec75b9d5da6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/034f46b18a2b0da7b29291a20c30ec75b9d5da6c/0_271_2464_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Physical distancing can be tricky.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Physical distancing can be tricky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It isn\u2019t all negative, says Hon. \u201cObviously, there are more people running. Which is nice in some ways \u2013 you feel like you\u2019ve got company. But it\u2019s also tricky; you\u2019re having to weave in between people.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a game: how do I maintain physical distancing while running? But there\u2019s a happy medium, and there can occasionally just be too many people trying to share one fairly thin pavement. You\u2019ve got to be very forgiving. It\u2019s hard \u2013 sometimes I get annoyed when people run close to me. But risk is, I think, not as high as many other activities.\u201d</p> <h2>Don\u2019t compare yourself with others (unless it helps)</h2> <p>There are an awful lot of services that will track your stats, engage in virtual races or let you join a global community of runners. But before you jump in, remember why you\u2019re running. It\u2019s probably not to be the fastest among your friends, and if you\u2019re not careful, such features can be more dispiriting than motivating.</p> <p>\u201cPeople react to this stuff differently. In general, it is quite motivating to see yourself get faster, and to see yourself run further,\u201d says Hon. \u201cBut when you have this social-media stuff \u2026 I think people are just too different. It becomes hard for it to be interesting or useful. Some people may like it, but the problem is that for most people, unless all their friends are runners, their range of abilities are all over the place.\u201d</p> <p>Harding agrees: \u201cThe first thing to overcome is pride. For a lot of people, they\u2019ll either compare themselves with where they used to be or to their friends who are running, or have been running a while.\u201d</p> <h2>Just don\u2019t stop</h2> <p>\u201cMotivation is something that will hit you during your early stages of running,\u201d Harding says, \u201cand continue to hit you after your running journey. And so that first day of \u2018I really don\u2019t fancy it today\u2019 is one to overcome. But to steal a slogan from a well-known brand \u2026 just do it. You will genuinely feel better. I have never gone for a run and regretted it.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Details have emerged of more than 30 migrants&nbsp;allegedly&nbsp;robbed, beaten and spray-painted with red crosses on their heads by Croatian police officers who said the treatment was the \u201ccure against coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian has interviewed asylum seekers, obtained photographs and collected dozens of testimonies, including from minors, revealing how the Croatian authorities were laughing and drinking beer while spray-painting migrants attempting to cross the border from Bosnia-Herzegovina, as EU parliamentarians have now begun pushing for an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the abuses.</p> <p>According to migrants\u2019 accounts, confirmed by numerous charities, at least two groups of migrants were apprehended by military personnel and handed over to police between 6 and 7 May near the Slovenian border, on route 61 in the area of Rijeka.</p> <p>\u201cWe were caught at 3am by a couple of military guys in a green uniform,\u201d said a migrant from Pakistan. \u201cThey searched us to make sure we were not smuggling anything and then they called the police. A police van with four officers in black uniforms arrived. They crammed us into the van and took us to a police station where we were photographed. They made us sign some paper. We asked for asylum but they told us to shut up.\u201d</p> <p>That night at the police station, Croatian officers would have allegedly taken in dozens of asylum seekers, predominantly from Pakistan and Afghanistan, who were captured in different locations. Following these events, about 4pm on 7 May the Croatian police allegedly piled them into four vans and drove them near to the border with Bosnia.</p> <p>\u201cOur group was in a van with a glass partition from which I saw the van stop at a store where they bought beer,\u201d said another man from Pakistan. \u201cThey were drinking along the way before we stopped near a small river close to Velika Kladu\u0161a.\u201d</p> <p>According to the migrants, that is where the abuse began. The police allegedly asked them to get out of the van one by one. Then, with a spray can, they began painting crosses on their heads and faces.</p> <p>\u201cThey made crosses on our heads and on some guys they coloured their moustaches or foreheads,\u201d said an asylum seeker. \u201cThey then made us take off our clothes and shoes, took our money and mobile phones and set fire to our clothes and belongings. Around 10 of them stood in a line and made us walk past them while they beat us with wooden sticks and police batons. After this they pushed us into the river and told us not to come back.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cde42667e511ee2477159f6d172f1609b2ec92a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cde42667e511ee2477159f6d172f1609b2ec92a/0_0_2428_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"migrants spray painted by the Croatian police\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Danish Refugee Council has collected testimonies from many of the alleged victims</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Danish Refugee Council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of the 33 people interviewed by the Danish&nbsp;Refugee&nbsp;Council (DRC),&nbsp;one of the main responders providing healthcare for migrants in Bosnia-Herzegovina,&nbsp;\u201c29 reported being beaten with police batons. A family of two people (father and son) reported being forced to place their heads between the body and the door of a police vehicle, while police officers kicked the vehicle door. The family further reported that the Croatian police fired at them (7 shots) after they had swum across the river to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u201d</p> <p>All of the refugees interviewed by the DRC reported having crosses sprayed on their heads with orange or red paint by Croatian police before being forced across the border to Bosnia-Herzegovina. \u201cOne group of 11 persons (including an unaccompanied minor) reported that police were drinking beer while \u2018marking\u2019 and beating them \u2013 beer which they had stopped to buy at a store while they were driving to the border,\u201d&nbsp;said the DRC.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/09/croatian-pm-defends-handling-of-migration-amid-claims-of-abuse\">Croatian PM defends handling of migration amid claims of abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In another case involving four people, interviewees reported Croatian police telling them \u201cthis is a medicine for corona\u201d, while painting their heads with crosses. The family of two (a father with his son, a minor) reported that police officers were laughing while spray-painting their heads.</p> <p>The group of four said that the abuse took place near the village of Glinica; the family of two maintained they were abused on the other side of the border from the village of Sturlic, both in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot speculate as to the reasons behind this practice,\u201d said Nicola Bay, the DRC country director for Bosnia. \u201cWhat is clear however is that \u2018branding\u2019 humans with painted crosses is an extreme example of abusive and degrading treatment of people attempting to cross the border to Croatia. While these incidents are truly shocking, they unfortunately seem to fall into a pattern of abuse consistently reported by refugees and migrants attempting to cross the border between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.\u201d</p> <p>In April alone, DRC teams in Bosnia-Herzegovina recorded 1,641 cases of refugees and migrants pushed back to Bosnia from Croatia. Of these, 891 reported being subjected to violence or physical assault; 1,253 reported having their belongings confiscated or destroyed (set on fire); 871 people said they\u2019d had identity documents confiscated or destroyed by Croatian police; 445 people said they had been denied access to asylum procedures in Croatia, despite having explicitly requested it.</p> <p>Contacted by the Guardian, the Croatian police and the Croatian interior ministry did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>However, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/12/croatian-police-accused-of-shaving-and-spray-painting-heads-of-asylum-seekers\">Guardian reported</a> the Croatian police\u2019s spray-painting of migrants on 12 May, the country\u2019s interior minister drafted a lengthy rebuttal on the ministry\u2019s website, calling the allegations \u201ccompletely absurd\u201d and accusing the Guardian of organising a \u201cpre-meditated attack against the Republic of Croatia\u201d.</p> <p>Following that report, a group of EU parliamentarians in Brussels is pushing for an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the abuses. \u201cWe believe the European Commission should join the investigation efforts of the UN to stop the alleged abuse and hold the perpetrators accountable for their actions,\u201d reads an internal memo circulating among MEPs. \u201cIf these allegations prove to be true, this is a serious case of abuse and in clear violation of the Schengen Border Code. In view of the seriousness of the allegations, we expect the Commission to undertake swift and thorough action in order to answer these questions, and to inform the European Parliament as soon as possible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0ea907de9cbe5bf9b4a9d0befb6d10e3d586d51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0ea907de9cbe5bf9b4a9d0befb6d10e3d586d51/0_0_3229_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marks from beatings and the \u2018branding\u2019 by spray paint\" width=\"1000\" height=\"372\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marks from beatings and the \u2018branding\u2019 by spray paint are clearly visible</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Danish Refugee Council</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe very fact that of the \u20ac6.7m (\u00a36m) which was given (by the EU) to Croatia to deal with border issues, only a paltry \u20ac300,000 was given for an independent monitoring mechanism to oversee and ensure that human rights and international law was being upheld, shows the priorities,\u201d said Irish MEP Clare Daly, a member of Independents 4 Change. \u201cThey have, in essence, enabled the Croatian authorities and are therefore culpable in the latest round of vicious abuse and unlawful pushbacks. It is an utter scandal, a shameful abandonment of everything they claim to stand over in terms of respect for fundamental rights. Shame on them.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the protests of journalists, charities and even the UNHCR, all calling for an investigation into the alleged abuses of migrants at the hands of the Croatian police, the EU has not intervened.</p> <p>\u201cThe only conclusion you can reach about why they are silent is that as long as the borders are reinforced, then human rights obligations can be conveniently ignored,\u2019\u2019 said Daly. \u201cFor business reasons they are keen on the extension of Schengen and if refugees and migrants are sacrificed in delivering that then clearly for them, so be it. It makes me sick and ashamed to be a member of an EU which would operate in this way. I have no doubt whatsoever that the commission is fully aware that the allegations are correct and they have sacrificed refugees and migrants and their obligations under international law, in the interests of extending Schengen for big business &amp; geo-political reasons. [They] will not be allowed to get away with this, accountability must prevail, or the EU is over.\u201d</p> <p>In an email the Croatian Ministry of the Interior denied&nbsp;police had acted violently towards migrants, but added that \u201can extensive investigation of the allegations\u201d would be conducted.</p> <p>The email suggested migrants could have fabricated the news. \u201cWe find it highly probable that thousands of migrants are ready to use all means at their disposal to accomplish their goal, including giving false testimonies against police officers,\u201d it said. \u201cWhen lacking evidence, the simplest and easiest thing to do is to fabricate events which never happened or to portray real events in a distorted manner.\u201d</p>",

As a rule-abiding bunch, Danes trusted that the government had their best interests at heart and so did as they were told. Every Saturday during lockdown, locals flew the Danish flag in solidarity and instead of clapping for health workers, Denmark\u2019s answer to TV choirmaster Gareth Malone led <em>Daily Morgensang</em> (Daily Morning Song) on TV station DR1 to keep morale up. And it worked. Prime minister Mette Frederiksen\u2019s hard and fast coronavirus strategy paid off \u2013 in a country of 5.8 million, the number of Covid-19 deaths stands at just <a href=\"https://www.sst.dk/da/corona-eng/covid-19-update_-statistics-and-charts\">563</a> at time of writing and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-denmark/second-virus-wave-very-unlikely-in-denmark-says-expert-idUSKBN22O15L\">infection rates are low</a> (0.7).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2139aeba3dfc34dac98111a16a298ba5a163fbf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2139aeba3dfc34dac98111a16a298ba5a163fbf6/0_246_5315_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schoolchildren have their lunch in Randers, Denmark\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pupils from different classes are assigned different entrances and no parents are allowed inside the school.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bo Amstrup/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Curve duly flattened, Denmark was the first country in Europe to reopen primary schools \u2013 as well as kindergartens and day-care institutions \u2013 in mid-April, following the advice that young children were the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2020-05-12/kids-cornavirus-symptoms-spread-schools-kawasaki/12236614\">least at risk</a>. Some were nervous at the idea of sending small children out to test the water, but after five weeks of supposedly \u201cworking from home\u201d with three kindergarteners, I was tempted. With work Zoom calls regularly gatecrashed by Elsa from Frozen and bare bottoms (lockdown brought out the nudist in my kids), my husband and I decided to go for it. Socialising young children is considered crucial in Denmark and as one psychologist friend put it: \u201cWe like the idea that children are brought up not only by their parents but by a whole society, including teachers, school friends, grandparents etc. They learn different perspectives from different relationships.\u201d He added: \u201cI also like the idea that I\u2019m not the only one responsible for their development and wellbeing.\u201d </p> <p>Danes worked out quickly that social distancing was impossible with young children, who essentially lick everything they see. Instead, kids stay in \u201cprotective bubbles\u201d \u2013 keeping to their own zones in the playground in small groups and sticking with the same teacher. Pupils from different classes are assigned different entrances and no parents are allowed inside the school. There are no face masks \u2013 for pupils or teachers; lessons are outside whenever possible, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/keep-it-clean-the-surprising-130-year-history-of-handwashing\">handwashing</a> is hourly (eczema flare-ups abound). Teachers sport hand-sanitiser sprays like cowboys in a weird western and all equipment is disinfected several times a day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/17/denmark-can-teach-england-safe-reopening-of-schools-covid-19\">Split classes, outdoor lessons: what Denmark can teach England about reopening schools after Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Denmark\u2019s schools started off with a two-metre social distancing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/17/denmark-can-teach-england-safe-reopening-of-schools-covid-19\">rule</a>, but this has now been reduced to one metre and dropped entirely for kindergarteners. From 18 May, kids aged 11-plus returned to school, and they were also separated into smaller groups. This has been a logistical challenge but teachers have already seen the better teacher/child ratio as beneficial to behaviour \u2013 and kids polled say they\u2019re glad to be back, following the isolation of home schooling.</p> <p>Many adults, by contrast, are content to still be working from home (without distractions). Denmark was already renowned for its work-life balance, but lockdown life has highlighted the importance of flexibility for employees. Some office workers are returning to their desks a few days a week, but there\u2019s a sense that employers can no longer demand the same presenteeism or demanding commutes as before. Meeting face to face isn\u2019t always necessary and shaking hands \u2013 previously a stalwart of Danish etiquette, done with everyone from your GP to your dentist and every member of a social gathering \u2013 is now a thing of the past.</p> <p>I can live without handshakes. What I miss are hugs, from friends. Socialising online made many of us strangely intimate. We didn\u2019t know when we\u2019d next see each other and so we opened up, skipping the small talk. Once we were officially allowed to socialise again in small groups, it was strange at first, tuning into friends in real life and talking about things other than coronavirus. But after the initial awkwardness, it was \u2026 brilliant (and blurry. Sore heads all around the next day). When restaurants and bars reopened, we emerged, blinking, from our homes, conscious of trying to keep up the meaningful connections that were somehow easier and more frequent when \u201cnormal life\u201d wasn\u2019t in the way.</p> <p>Danes have now been advised that they can see and even hug grandparents again, but for those with very elderly relatives or in at risk groups, the isolation continues. Hospitals are coping, but the threat of coronavirus means that anyone admitted is tested for Covid-19 as a matter of course and no visitors are allowed. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll see family in the UK since borders are still <a href=\"https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/travel-essentials/coronavirus\">closed to foreign visitors</a> (with some exceptions). But for the majority of those living Danishly, the silence of lockdown has been a time to re-evaluate \u2013 to notice things, good and bad, take stock, break habits and start over. Many are relearning the delights of the Danish countryside, of slowing down, of looking after each other. And now, in Denmark, there\u2019s a mood of optimism best summed up by the slogan <em>det bliver godt igen</em> \u2013 or \u201cit will be good again\u201d.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Helen Russell is the bestselling author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/05/the-year-of-living-danishly-helen-russell-denmark-happy\">The Year of Living Danishly</a>.

BirdLife International recognises the sanctuary as <a href=\"http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/factsheet/khonoma-nature-conservation-and-tragopan-sanctuary-iba-india\">one of the 555 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in India</a>, and the <a href=\"http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/22679163\">Blyth\u2019s </a><a href=\"http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/22679163\">tragopan</a>, a large pheasant which is the state bird of Nagaland, thrives in the higher reaches of KNCTS.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f56568f293f31ecd17b00b0969fbee9ef09f722\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f56568f293f31ecd17b00b0969fbee9ef09f722/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blyth\u2019s tragopan, a vulnerable species of bird which thrives in the higher reaches of Khonoma Nature Conservation and Tragopan Sanctuary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blyth\u2019s tragopan, a vulnerable species of bird which thrives in the higher reaches of Khonoma Nature Conservation and Tragopan Sanctuary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rofikul Islam/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khonoma, like the rest of the world, is coping with the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown in India, which began on 25 March. Visitors stayed away during the peak birding season of March and April.</p> <p>Meyase, chairman of KNCTS, says: \u201cYes, people from the village providing tourism-related services have lost cash income due to the lockdown. But they are still able to sustain themselves by farming and rearing livestock.\u201d</p> <p>He remains optimistic. \u201cSoon after the lockdown is lifted, people from neighbouring villages and from within the state will start visiting.\u201d</p> <p>Dismissing concerns about hunting in the sanctuary during the lockdown, Meyase adds: \u201cAs long as there is no free movement of people, the sanctuary is safe.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the lockdown is lifted, the Khonoma Youth Organisation, which is responsible for monitoring the sanctuary, will continue their surveillance.\u201d</p> <p>A steep fine of 20,000 rupees (\u00a3210) for any person caught hunting in KNCTS, as well as Khonoma\u2019s long history as a village of fierce warriors, serve as deterrents to any potential poachers, he adds.</p> <h2>Pulling together</h2> <p>Khonoma\u2019s residents belong to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angami_Naga\">Angami </a>people, who have lived off the forest for centuries, with hunting being a sacred cultural practice. In the early 1990s, following the mass slaughter of Blyth\u2019s tragopans by villagers over the Christmas period, a few of Khonoma\u2019s conservation-minded elders began campaigning for a protected area. They also recognised that conserving the forest, which is a rainwater catchment area, would secure water for the village and for the rice terraces in the valley below.</p> <p>Their sustained efforts bore fruit when the Khonoma village council passed a resolution for the creation of KNCTS in 1998. The hunting and logging ban was soon extended beyond the sanctuary, to include the entire village.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6507b5446eccd8bc93edb7b265846336680cc0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6507b5446eccd8bc93edb7b265846336680cc0a/0_94_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The younger residents of Khonoma are well aware of the importance of conserving our forests and wildlife.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The younger residents of Khonoma learn the importance of conserving the village\u2019s forests and wildlife.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adnan Abidi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To ensure that the men wouldn\u2019t return to hunting, they were recruited as forest wardens for three years and paid a salary via a grant from the Gerald Durrell Memorial Fund. Women, who had traditionally foraged in the sanctuary for fruit and vegetables to sell, were banned from doing so. </p> <p>Vitsokhono Pier, 35, who owns a plant nursery in Khonoma, says: \u201cWomen turned their attention to other income-generating activities like running a homestay or maintaining a nursery. Poinsettias are in big demand before Christmas.\u201d </p> <p>The initial trickle of tourists to Khonoma led to the opening of the first homestay \u2013 homes offering accommodation to paying guests \u2013 in 2006. There are 12 homestays in the village today and before the lockdown 20 people were employed as guides. Several more made handicrafts while others provided taxi services. The cash earned from tourism enables these families to buy groceries, pay for their children to go to school and meet other household expenses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f2f81a2fcb2b2518d8f0c4773be3c52b8476cceb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2f81a2fcb2b2518d8f0c4773be3c52b8476cceb/0_201_2479_1559/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Village elder Tsilie Sakhrie, 77, was instrumental in the formation of KNCT.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Village elder Tsilie Sakhrie, 77, was instrumental in the formation of KNCTS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne Pinto-Rodrigues</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to Tsilie Sakhrie, 77, one of the village elders instrumental in the formation of KNCTS, about 100 (out of 600) families in the village have benefited from the tourist trade.</p> <p>But despite the lockdown and the loss of income from tourism, the village continues to have a high level of food security. Khonoma is known for its sustainable agriculture, and takes great pride in the fact that it has been self-sufficient since ancient times. Paddy terraces are positioned at the base of surrounding hills and the fields are irrigated by nutrient-rich rainwater that flows down the slopes. More than 20 rice varieties are grown in the village.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition to rice, we also grow a variety of grains like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/25/against-the-grain-why-millet-is-enjoying-an-indian-revival-nagaland\">millet</a>, corn and Job\u2019s tears,\u201d says Kevikelie Pier, 52, a teacher at the local government school. \u201cAnd our livestock can last us for at least a year.\u201d</p> <p>Produce such as squash, pumpkin, carrot, cabbage, potato, mustard, ginger, garlic and king chilli are also grown in the village, in home gardens and rotating, shifting cultivation plots. Vegetables are also bartered with neighbours.</p> <p>Following the creation of KNCTS, several villages in the state<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/i-swapped-my-gun-for-binoculars-indias-hunters-turn-to-conservation-aoe\"> began to emulate</a> Khonoma\u2019s conservation efforts. Village elder Khriekhoto Mor, 64, says: \u201cToday, there are over 700 community-conserved areas (CCAs) in Nagaland, though only a handful are as actively conserved as Khonoma.\u201d</p> <p>In November 2014, the <a href=\"https://ccaforumnagaland.blogspot.com/p/about-nagaland-community-conserved-area.html\">Nagaland Community Conserved Areas Forum</a> (NCCAF) was formed with 22 members to facilitate the exchange of ideas and strengthen the conservation movement in the state. Mor currently serves as chairperson of NCCAF.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96d59365e53c5961fe214b065db44f62a4069622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96d59365e53c5961fe214b065db44f62a4069622/0_0_5138_3419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thanks to its sustainable agricultural practices, Khonoma has a high level of food security despite loss of tourist income.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thanks to its sustainable agricultural practices, Khonoma has a high level of food security despite loss of tourist income.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: robertharding/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khonoma\u2019s conservation success did, however, create an unforeseen problem for its residents. With the increase in wildlife populations, animals began to venture out of the forest and destroy crops. Wild boar and porcupines would dig up vegetable patches while large flocks of birds such as munias and parakeets attacked grain crops.</p> <p>Most of Khonoma\u2019s residents, who are subsistence farmers, were badly affected by this loss. To manage the situation, the KYO was empowered to issue a three-day hunting permit to a farmer requesting to get rid of a nuisance animal. The permit is strictly limited to the area of the farmer\u2019s land. Thirty such permits were issued in 2019, ensuring villagers remain on board with the conservation measures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/i-swapped-my-gun-for-binoculars-indias-hunters-turn-to-conservation-aoe\">\u2018I swapped my gun for binoculars\u2019: India\u2019s hunters turn to conservation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than 20 years since the formation of KNCTS, it remains a safe haven for a multitude of rare species.

It describes some of the ways in which we can begin to turn things around, if only we all have the will to do so. Surely together we must now find that determination, and begin to make that change, for the sake of all the inhabitants of our planet.\u201d</p> <p>The broadcaster and natural historian said he has had \u201can extraordinary life\u201d, and that \u201cit\u2019s only now that I appreciate how extraordinary\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cAs a young man, I felt I was out there in the wild, experiencing the untouched natural world \u2013 but it was an illusion.

I have been a witness to this decline, and this book contains my witness statement, and my vision for the future \u2013 the story of how we came to make this, our greatest mistake.

<p>South Australia has called a halt to granting international travel exemptions on compassionate grounds after SA Health bungled the case of a British woman who arrived on the weekend and tested positive to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Premier <strong> Steven Marshall </strong>says he wants to get to the bottom of the problem, which resulted in the woman presenting herself to authorities on arrival in Adelaide rather than being met by health officials, before allowing any further international travellers into SA in such circumstances.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be granting any further exemptions for overseas travel to South Australia until we\u2019ve ironed out this administrative error,\u201d Mr Marshall said on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we have airtight systems going forward before we grant further exemptions for people coming from overseas.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But Marshall said he did not intend to \u201chang SA Health out to dry\u201d and praised the department\u2019s overall handling of the pandemic as well as the previous arrival of international travellers.</p> \n  <p>The premier also confirmed police commissioner Grant Stevens would meet the SA Health chief executive to develop new arrangements for future transfers.<br></p> \n  <p>Before Sunday\u2019s case, 21 other people had come to SA from overseas on compassionate grounds, about half to attend a funeral and the others to visit a dying relative.</p> \n  <p>The British woman, in her 50s, was granted her exemption to visit a dying relative.<br></p> \n  <p>She had spent about a week in quarantine in Victoria after arriving in Australia from the UK and had tested negative while in isolation.</p> \n  <p>She wore a mask while travelling to SA and made herself known to airport authorities and was then escorted out by police.</p> \n  <p>When tested again, she returned the positive result, becoming the state\u2019s 440th case of Covid-19 and the first for almost three weeks.</p> \n  <p>The woman was returned to quarantine while almost 20 close contacts were also ordered into self-isolation.</p> \n  <p>After initially saying Victorian officials did not tell them when the woman would arrive, chief public health Officer <strong>Nicola Spurrier </strong>issued a statement on Thursday conceding the flight information was passed on.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cDue to an administrative oversight, we can confirm the relevant flight details involving an overseas traveller arriving in South Australia were provided to SA Health prior to their arrival,\u201d Spurrier said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat this issue has highlighted is the need to strengthen the processes involving travellers arriving from overseas and travelling between states during their quarantine period.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>After SA\u2019s initial comments, Victorian chief health officer <strong>Brett Sutton</strong> said South Australia was told of the woman\u2019s travel details and he had the email to prove it.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why there is a misunderstanding about having been informed, but that email was sent and South Australian authorities were alerted about the time and flight details,\u201d Sutton said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T04:14:10.397Z\">at 5.14am BST</time></p>

Under the rule, if a customer cannot produce their driver\u2019s licence or birth certificate, or show a different address, banks and other regulated businesses can use alternative ways to verify their customer\u2019s identity. </p> \n  <p>Financial abuse is a form of family and domestic violence and will be experienced by over 2 million Australians over their lifetime, with 63% of women experiencing financial stress having a background of financial abuse. The abuser uses violence and intimidation to restrict access to a person\u2019s bank accounts, prevent them from working or accessing benefits, or withholds living expenses from them or their children. <br></p> \n  <p>Austrac\u2019s CEO, <strong>Nicole Rose </strong>PSM, said having a bank account independent of an abuser was essential for those who are leaving or have left an abusive relationship. This rule supports our regulated businesses to uphold their AML/CTF obligations while adopting a flexible approach to customer identity processes.<br></p> \n  <p>Austrac collaborated on the rule change with the Australian Banking Association and the Australian Israel Chamber of Commerce NSW who initiated the project and identified the opening of bank accounts as a significant barrier. Austrac consulted with the financial sector and community organisations including family violence services, community legal services and financial counselling services, many of who offer frontline services to people experiencing family violence and financial abuse. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T00:12:20.372Z\">at 1.12am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecef96f8f084e882655a078\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T23:36:54.628Z\">12.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A reminder that the ABC is about to undergo more cuts as well, because of cuts to its recurrent funding.</p> \n  <p>Regional and rural communities are losing their voices all over Australia. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecef76b8f084e882655a062\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T23:32:42.295Z\">12.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Senate committee looking at the Covid response has <strong>P</strong><strong>hil Lowe</strong>, the RBA governor, in front of it today, along with heads of Apra and Asic.</p> \n  <p>Together the troika make up what the business calls \u201cthe Regulators\u201d (capital R) but in the least <strong>Warren G </strong>way possible.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T00:10:32.742Z\">at 1.10am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecef6fe8f087e3ca0f64b6b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T23:27:21.341Z\">12.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Lots more people are getting the flu vaccine this year, which is great, but GPs fear they are missing out on their allocation for their patients.</p> \n  <p>The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners wants the government to prioritise GP clinics when distributing the stockpile:</p> \n  <p>In a survey in April 2020 of more than 1,100 GPs from every state and territory in Australia, 55% reported that they were unable to access enough stock to provide flu vaccinations to their patients.</p> \n  <p>The RACGP president, Dr <strong>Harry Nespolon</strong>, said the delay many patients faced to get their flu vaccine this year was unacceptable and needed to be urgently addressed:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The problem was never that there was shortage of the flu vaccine.

Youth allowance (plus these supplements) was $164pw below the poverty line ($232pw without rent assistance).</li> \n   <li>Households that have to rely mainly on social security payments (eg unemployment, parenting, and disability payments) are five times more likely to experience poverty (36%) than those receiving most income from wages and salaries (7%). However, 38% of those in poverty are in wage-earning households; the majority of whom are households with children.</li> \n   <li>In households where the main earner is a female, the poverty rate is 19% \u2013 almost double the rate when the main earner is male \u2013 10%. </li> \n   <li>In single parent families in which the main earner is a woman the rate of poverty (37%) is twice that in which the main earner is a man (18%).</li> \n   <li>The biggest differences in poverty rates between households with male and female main earners are in families with children. The average poverty rate among people in families with children where the main income-earner is female is 23%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male (which is the more common arrangement). In contrast, among households without children, the average poverty rate where the main income-earner is female is 12%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male.</li> \n   <li>Nearly half the children in sole parent families live in poverty (44%) compared with 13% for children living with both parents.</li> \n   <li>While those of working age are at greater risk of poverty than older people, over 65s who are living in private rental face a relatively high risk of poverty (41%).</li> \n   <li> Renters are almost twice as likely to live in poverty as home-owners (19% compared with 9%) with public housing tenants at greatest risk (58%).</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>You can read the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/Poverty2020pt2\">whole report here</a>. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T00:01:37.126Z\">at 1.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecee3f58f0898700351d85f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T22:07:26.544Z\">11.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Services has released a report \u2013 Poverty in Australia 2020: Part 2 \u2013 Who is affected? <em>\u2013 </em>which looks at the impact of poverty before the Covid-19 crisis.</p> \n  <p>Its findings, unfortunately shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone.

The challenges faced by single mothers that lead to so many being on low incomes have serious implications for the wellbeing of those women and their children.</p> \n   <p>Early indications suggest that women have been suffering some of the worst economic impacts of the current pandemic, and effective policy action is needed to ensure this does not translate into an ongoing reduction in female employment or an increase in poverty amongst women and children.

  "<p>A plan to conclude the A-League season has been announced by Football Federation Australia, A-League clubs and the players\u2019 union. If it materialises, 32 matches will take place in 35 days from mid-July to mid-August. \u201cWe are committed to delivering the completion of the Hyundai A-League 2019-20 season,\u201d said FFA CEO James Johnson.&nbsp;</p> <p>But there\u2019s a catch. Broadcast partner Fox Sports has not yet agreed to the terms of the resumption, and until that matter is resolved everything is on hold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/17/no-a-league-grand-final-no-hype-no-football-at-all-but-also-no-despair\">No football, no A-League grand final, no hype... but also no despair | Jonathan Howcroft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The suspension of sporting activity in Australia amidst the Covid-19 pandemic has brought into play the force majeure provision in the broadcast agreement. This means that while matches are not being played Fox Sports can terminate the remaining three years of the deal without penalty. Even if they don\u2019t want to walk away entirely, the option to do so provides enormous leverage in any attempt to renegotiate the terms of the contract.</p> <p>Consequently, FFA are incentivised to return to action as swiftly as possible; Fox Sports are not. By announcing a formal plan to resume the A-League, FFA are telling fans and stakeholders they are ready, and in so doing inviting Fox Sports to communicate why a restart should not go ahead (for example for reasons of scheduling or production) alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/28/nrl-takes-centre-stage-as-grand-old-game-returns-with-a-covid-19-era-twist\">the return of the NRL </a>and AFL.</p> <p>Moreover, in the announcement, head of the A-League Greg O\u2019Rourke indicated a return to competition would not just see the A-League return to business as usual, but feature enhanced commercial opportunities to make the existing deal even sweeter for a broadcaster. \u201cWe will be including new and innovative elements to the matchday broadcast experience,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said, adding: \u201cOur focus is also on optimising the broadcast flow and therefore providing football content seven days a week. We believe that there are great opportunities for our broadcast partner and therefore the fans.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, a broadcast partner would need a compelling reason to turn down such an offer. But bringing discussions into the public domain, however coded, is not without risk. \u201cWe never comment on commercial negotiations or speculation about broadcast rights,\u201d asserted head of Fox Sports Peter Campbell recently when Rugby Australia was in a not dissimilar predicament. That episode <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/12/rugby-australia-is-on-a-final-warning-drastic-measures-must-be-taken-to-ensure-survival\">did not end well</a> for rugby, bringing to mind the old adage of not picking fights with anyone who buys ink by the barrel.</p> <p>So, what is on the table? SBS <a href=\"https://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/fox-sports-multi-million-dollar-roadblock-to-a-league-restart\">reported on Wednesday</a> that Fox Sports want to reduce the value of their remaining $57m per year obligations by up to 50%.&nbsp;Nine newspapers later indicated <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/a-league-restart-could-be-stymied-by-fox-demand-for-rights-fee-cut-20200527-p54x11.html\">that figure</a> could be as high as 70%. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VinceRugari/status/1265770084036796418/photo/1\">Further reports </a>have since <a href=\"https://footballtoday.news/features/just-walk-away\">circulated</a> that the game has been asked to accept as little as $10m per year.&nbsp;They are not insignificant sums, even in an exceptional environment whereby some level of downsizing by all parties must have been expected.</p> <p>Fox Sports has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/australian-footballs-fox-sports-conundrum-looming-disaster-or-reset-opportunity\">signalled its dissatisfaction</a> with professional football for some time as viewing figures and public interest have failed to match the expectations set following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/dec/20/football-federation-australia-set-to-announce-a-league-tv-deal\">extension of their relationship</a> with the A-League in late 2016. This has been accompanied by <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/fox-sports-axes-news-staff-citing-weak-advertising-20200318-p54bfd.html\">commercial challenges for the broadcaster</a>, exacerbated by the pandemic.</p> <p>How much do they now value the content for their own platforms? How much do they not wish to see the product they have invested in for 15 years go elsewhere, and possibly flourish? How much reputational damage are they prepared to sustain if they are perceived to be opportunistically strong-arming a long-term partner during a crisis?</p> <p>As the standoff has progressed, the Australian football community has found itself in the not always common position of finding players, clubs and administrators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/17/no-a-league-grand-final-no-hype-no-football-at-all-but-also-no-despair\">aligned strategically</a> under FFA leadership. Discussions have been kept largely in-house until this week when a degree of urgency was added owing to a sizeable proportion of <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/anxious-a-league-players-in-limbo-over-contracts-20200525-p54wa9.html\">A-League players coming out of contract</a> on 1 June.</p> <p>After intense discussions on Tuesday and Wednesday fears of a pay war were averted and the unified bloc prevailed. \u201cToday we took an important step with the clubs and FFA toward ensuring the health of the game\u2019s short and long-term future,\u201d said Professional Footballers Australia CEO John Didulica.</p> <p>Australian football is once again on the verge of a boardroom fight that has at stake the professional game as we know it. Only this time, for now at least, there is unity within the tent. \u201cFFA, the clubs and the PFA have all worked collaboratively throughout this process,\u201d said Western Sydney Wanderers chairman Paul Lederer. \u201cThis is about teamwork for the good of the game.\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen if this teamwork is sufficient to restarting the A-League campaign and returning it to television sets any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>After Denisa\u2019s son was born premature at 26 weeks she was unable to hold him, but spent as much time as possible near his incubator so he could get used to her voice.

On 17 March, the day Denisa left the hospital, just 97 people had tested positive.</p> <p>\u201cYet she was asked to vacate her bed for patients that never arrived,\u201d says Zuzana Kriskova, chairwoman of Slovakia-based <a href=\"https://zenskekruhy.sk/\">Women\u2019s Circles</a>, which advocates for childbirth rights.</p> <p>Kriskova estimates that around 500 premature babies in Slovakia may have been affected so far by hospital rules banning parents from visiting since the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cIn some areas since last week you can go to the hairdresser but you can\u2019t visit your sick baby in hospital. It\u2019s absurd. Yet we know without a primary caregiver a baby will suffer. The risk of infection is higher, the risk of dying is higher, these babies have already been born premature,\u201d says Kriskova.</p> <p>Since the pandemic, Women\u2019s Circles has been inundated with messages from expectant and new parents seeking support and advice about their rights. The organisation has criticised the government for allowing hospitals to enforce their own rules and for lack of clear national guidance.</p> <p>Birth companions have been banned, and some providers have cancelled prenatal appointments and scans. In some hospitals women have been told they can\u2019t have epidurals because the anaesthetists are reserved for Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>\u201cThese rules have been been created out of fear of what might happen. In some cases, it amounts to prioritising patients that don\u2019t exist over the basic human rights for pregnant women, new mothers and their babies,\u201d says Kriskova.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-crisis-may-deny-95-million-women-access-to-family-planning\">Coronavirus crisis may deny 9.5 million women access to family planning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The organisation Human Rights in Childbirth (HRiC) <a href=\"http://humanrightsinchildbirth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Human-Rights-in-Childbirth-Pregnancy-Birth-and-Postpartum-During-COVID19-Report-May-2020.pdf\">published a report </a>this month documenting evidence that maternity healthcare is being undermined by the pandemic. Changes in practice aimed at controlling the spread of Covid-19 are disproportionately infringing on the human rights of women giving birth, it claims.</p> <p>The World Health Organization recommends that women continue to have a companion during birth, yet partners have been banned in countries including Slovenia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Germany at some types of births.</p> <p>Daniela Drandic, one of the authors of the report, is based in Croatia where leading doctors have declared that pregnant women suspected of having Covid-19 should have a caesarean section and be separated from their baby, she says.</p> <p>\u201cWomen are being kept from their newborns for 14 days if they are suspected of having the virus but these measures are not proportionate on the balance of risk. In Romania babies are removed from their mothers regardless of their Covid-19 status. Yet there have been reports of at least 10 newborns becoming infected from healthcare staff.\u201d</p> <p>In many countries community services are closed or being used as Covid isolation units so women have no choice but to give birth in hospitals. Marginalised groups have been worst affected, with some women refused care because they are believed to have the virus, the report finds.</p> <p>In Macedonia, a pregnant Roma woman who was showing signs of infection and who had rushed to the emergency department was left outside for more than six hours while medics tested her for Covid-19. In India a woman who developed a severe lung infection died after being turned away from 10 hospitals including a Covid-19 facility in Hyderabad.</p> <p>Elena Skoko, founder of the <a href=\"https://ovoitalia.wordpress.com/2020/04/01/italy-position-statement-for-respectful-maternity-care-in-covid-19-crisis/\">Obstetric Violence Observatory</a> in Italy, says women were being abandoned giving birth. </p> <p>Skoko says one woman who came from the \u201cred zone\u201d in Calabria was <a href=\"https://www.quotidianodelsud.it/calabria/crotone/cronache/saluteeassistenza/2020/03/30/coronavirus-partorisce-da-sola-a-crotone-in-ospedale-perche-di-cutro/\">left to give birth</a> in an isolated hospital room because it was assumed she had Covid-19 and would risk infecting others. Only by chance was the woman attended in the final moments of labour by a passing doctor who caught the baby \u2013 without gloves. The woman later tested negative for the virus.</p> <p>In Poland, where there are 380 maternity wards, the Childbirth with Dignity Foundation says it has been recommended that Covid-19 positive mothers be separated from their newborns and breastfeeding should be treated with caution.</p> <p>Advocates say that years of progress on improving women\u2019s birth choices in some countries have been undone in just a few weeks.</p> <p>Drandic says: \u201cCovid is a watershed moment for birth rights. It will either magnify the existing bad policies around maternity care leading to positive change or could undo the progress made and turn the clock back 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>More than 4,500 people signed an open letter to the Slovakian government warning the separation of premature babies from their parents is a violation of human rights.</p> <p><a href=\"https://zenskekruhy.sk/oddelenie-predcasne-narodenych-deti-od-rodicov-vyvolalo-vlnu-nevole/\">Women\u2019s Circles, which drafted the letter</a>, says that in the last week some hospitals had lifted the ban following public pressure. The Guardian contacted the Slovakian Department of Health but it declined to respond.</p> <p>Denisa finally has her baby boy at home but she has been left wondering how he will be affected by the time they spent apart. \u201cIs it really necessary to separate a mother from her child like this?\u201d she asks.</p>",

  "<p>On Thursday night, Denmark will become the second country in Western Europe to restart their league season after neighbouring Germany. In the opening fixture AGF Aarhus welcome local rivals Randers but it is on the sidelines where history will really be made.

  "<p>On a Tuesday in early April, viewers around the globe watched streamers on Twitch play one particular game for a combined 34m hours, smashing established live-streaming viewership records. The game in question, Valorant by Riot Games, has been averaging hundreds of thousands of daily spectators ever since, quickly displacing Twitch stalwarts such as League of Legends and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/fortnite\">Fortnite</a>.</p> <p>Valorant is a ready-baked esport: a competitive shooter designed to be watched as well as played. After a few weeks with Valorant, I\u2019ve found it to be a careful mix of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\u2019s meticulous but rewarding gunplay and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/27/overwatch-review-blizzard\">Overwatch</a>\u2019s characters and soft-edged charm.</p> <p>This combination \u2013 complemented by expensive anti-cheat measures and super-fast servers \u2013 has made it an easy sell for hardcore players. Many professional crack shots are jumping ship from games such as Apex Legends and Fortnite, the most notable departure thus far being 2019 Overwatch League MVP Jay \u201cSinatraa\u201d Won, who revealed in April that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SFShock/status/1255250197510225922?s=20\">he was leaving Blizzard\u2019s hero shooter behind to focus on Valorant.</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8amyzDHOKw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g8amyzDHOKw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Yet for the casual player like me, Valorant still has a lot to offer. While I might not be the most accurate shot, I can still be useful in other areas. My preferred character, Cypher \u2013 one of nine in the game right now \u2013 has the tools to provide match-winning information about the enemy team through careful camera placement and pesky tripwires. It turns every round into a battle of wits as well as accuracy, weaving personal narratives into a conventionally cold competitive format.</p> <p>The game\u2019s slick design has enabled its meteoric rise on Twitch, but a crucial difference between this game and previous contenders is that almost no one could get their hands on it for weeks. Valorant spent almost two months in a very limited closed beta stage, which ends today on 28 May, and the digital keys to the virtual kingdom were a hot commodity. Riot Games\u2019 clever marketing scheme was to let streamers give away keys to their viewers, incentivising millions of people to watch the game being played in the hopes of gaining access for themselves.</p> <p>This led to an initial boom, but it didn\u2019t take long for things to turn sour. Top streamer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drdisrespect/status/1248075009790103554?s=20\">Dr Disrespect was caught fraudulently advertising</a> beta keys, and some players with access took to eBay to trade their accounts for profit. In an attempt to keep the system fair, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayVALORANT/status/1248047652500992002?s=20\">Riot swept its player database, banning many account sellers</a>, and later opened up giveaway drops to all streamers with beta access instead of a curated few. But then people started streaming prerecorded footage of their gameplay, claiming that they were \u201clive-playing\u201d Valorant, trying to bring in more viewers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb60cbe2d88c971202e0e542f129890248aea9c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb60cbe2d88c971202e0e542f129890248aea9c6/0_0_1634_920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Team game\u2019 \u2026 Valorant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Team game\u2019 \u2026 Valorant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riot Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Under lockdown, when viewers may have more free time than usual, Riot\u2019s approach has created a perfect storm of hype. But it has also left some debris in its wake. While writing this, I watched a houseful of streamers play the game in shifts to a drop-desperate audience in the hundreds \u2013 yet the chat was devoid of conversation, beyond viewers pinging the watch-time command to expose the nauseating amount of hours they\u2019ve spent watching and hoping for access. I\u2019m not sure this is what Riot had in mind when it kicked off this campaign.</p> <p>For those who snagged a coveted beta key, the watching and waiting was worth it. Having played Counter-Strike for almost two decades, Kai Powell spent roughly 50 hours waiting for Valorant access over three or four days. \u201cI like that Valorant feels different from other hero shooters because the abilities supplement the gunplay,\u201d Powell tells me. \u201cIf you look at Overwatch, you\u2019re locked into whatever weapons that character comes with.\u201d</p> <p>Natalie Flores has spent more than 1,500 hours in Overwatch, but now plays Valorant on a daily basis. \u201cValorant is a team game, but doing well individually is enough to lead your team to victory,\u201d Flores tells me. \u201cToo often, I\u2019m doing well in Overwatch, but my teammates will deny constant opportunities to coordinate attacks together \u2026 even if it ends in a victory, the process leading up to the win was so exhausting that it usually doesn\u2019t feel rewarding!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9994506c0e7ed9948badb94c3988ef2844b3f571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9994506c0e7ed9948badb94c3988ef2844b3f571/0_0_1400_700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Instant hit \u2026 Valorant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Instant hit \u2026 Valorant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Riot Games</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet like many competitive esports \u2013 including Riot\u2019s own League of Legends \u2013 Valorant already has a toxicity problem. (A recent example posted to Twitter shows a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Evergreenily/status/1253769891720511488?s=20\">Riot developer being hit on and then harassed </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Evergreenily/status/1253769891720511488?s=20\">while playing her own game</a>.) \u201cRiot will need to focus on creating some structural changes or else many people, especially people of colour or women like me, won\u2019t stick around,\u201d Flores says. \u201cAnd we make up a too significant portion of every game\u2019s player base for any company to ignore.\u201d</p> <p>With the recent introduction of a ranked mode bringing structure to competitive play, Valorant\u2019s success appears to be a foregone conclusion. Esports organisations such as Sentinels, T1 and Ninjas in Pyjamas <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sentinels/status/1255291066028261377\">are stocking teams with ex-Overwatch and Counter-Strike professionals as we speak</a>, and given the streaming numbers, it\u2019s hard to accuse any of them of jumping the gun. Riot will have an esports giant in its roster when the game launches next week.</p> <ul> <li><p>Valorant is out on 2 June; playable for free on PC.</p></li> </ul>",

A formal decision on the delay will be taken by the UN Thursday evening.</p> <p>Tying the Cop26 talks to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/heed-lessons-of-2008-crisis-experts-warn-global-leaders\">green recovery from the Covid-19 crisis</a> is now essential to regain momentum and ensure the summit produces the fresh global commitment needed on the climate crisis, experts say.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theelders.org/profile/mary-robinson\">Mary Robinson</a>, former UN climate envoy, and chair of the Elders group of international leader, said: \u201cVery definitely we need to tie together a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">green recovery</a> and Cop26 \u2013 that is imperative. UK leadership can and should urge forward a net-zero carbon transition from the Covid-19 crisis. Leadership is needed, moral, political, economic and social leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, said: \u201cThe UK presidency comes at an absolutely critical time. There is an extraordinary opportunity to restart the economy and look at creative ways [to recover]. We need to find ways to become more resilient.\u201d</p> <p>The Cop26 talks are seen as vital because nations are obliged under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">Paris agreement of 2015</a> to present renewed plans every five years on how to meet the legally binding goal of holding global heating to no more than 2C, and preferably no more than 1.5C, above pre-industrial levels.</p> <p>Current commitments on curbing emissions, set in Paris, would take the world far beyond those limits, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/03/world-on-track-for-3c-of-warming-under-current-global-climate-pledges-warns-un\">about 3C of heating</a>, which scientists say would spell disaster around the world. That means fresh national commitments on carbon reductions by 2030 must be set this year, ahead of the Cop26 talks.</p> <p>As host nation the UK carries responsibility for bringing governments together to make Cop26, the most important conference since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">Paris in 2015</a>, a success.</p> <p>Without a clear plan of its own to reach net-zero carbon emissions, a target <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/theresa-may-commits-to-net-zero-uk-carbon-emissions-by-2050\">enshrined in British law</a>, the UK will struggle for credibility in urging other countries to come forward with national plans, according to participants and close observers of the talks.</p> <p>Some countries would like to see the UK present a formal submission to the UN, setting out its emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2050. Known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC), these formal plans are a legal requirement under the Paris accord.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be a very welcome and important signal [to set out an NDC],\u201d said Steiner. \u201cWe need to see a high level of ambition and a national strategy.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://christianafigueres.com/#/\">Christiana Figueres</a>, the former UN climate chief, told a committee of MPs last week: \u201cIt definitely would set a good example to other countries. I believe the UK should do it as soon as it responsibly can.\u201d</p> <p>Developing countries are also anxious that NDCs should not be delayed by the long hiatus before Cop26.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.aosis.org/about/lead-negotiator-for-oceans/\">Janine Felson</a>, Belize\u2019s&nbsp;ambassador to the UN<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: \u201cAll developed countries should bring forward their NDCs.\u201d</p> <p>Few large-scale economies have submitted an NDC yet. Chile, the original host of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world\">Cop25</a>, in 2019 (before the transfer to Madrid), submitted its plan earlier this year, Norway has strengthened its NDC, and Rwanda last week became the first African nation to do so. Japan set out plans that drew widespread criticism for lack of ambition but China, India,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/11/european-green-deal-will-change-economy-to-solve-climate-crisis-says-eu\"> the EU</a>, and other large green house gas emitters are still holding back.</p> <p>Leading figures have said that the formal submission of NDCs can wait while ministers and officials consider the impact of the Covid-19 crisis. Yet the UK has to urgently show leadership by announcing concrete measures for a green economic recovery.</p> <p>Lord Stern, a climate economist, said: \u201cIt\u2019s more important to set out actions for a green recovery, that is key. We can do that now, bring forward these carbon reductions. Set out policies and then we can see how the NDC can become more ambitious.\u201d</p> <p>The Committee on Climate Change, the UK government\u2019s independent advisers, has delayed until December the publication of its advice on the country\u2019s sixth carbon budget, in order to take account of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged\">impact of the Covid-19 crisis</a>. Chris Stark, chief executive of the committee, said it would be better for the government to delay the NDC too.</p> <p>Setting out a formal NDC was less urgent than setting out a clear direction for the economic recovery, added Robinson. \u201cI was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/07/mary-robinson-attacks-unhelpful-uk-over-cop-26-climate-talks\"> very close to despair in January</a>,\u201d she said, referring to a flawed start to the UK\u2019s presidency, when the government<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/04/sacked-cop-26-chair-claire-oneill-berates-boris-johnson-over-climate-record\"> fired its initial choice for Cop president</a>, the former MP Claire O\u2019Neill, and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/04/boris-johnson-promises-urgent-climate-action-after-stinging-criticism\"> failed to produce a clear plan for the summit</a>. \u201cI could not see an ambition [to have a good Cop26]. Now Covid-19 has turned the world upside down. We have to get up momentum for a green and nature-based recovery.\u201d</p> <p>The delay of Cop26 also means that other international meetings can lay the ground for success. The UK holds the 2021 presidency of the G7 group of industrialised nations, whose leaders are likely to meet in the summer when Cop26 will be discussed. Italy, co-host with the UK of Cop26, will chair the G20 with a similar aim.</p> <p>Carbon dioxide emissions have fallen sharply amid the lockdowns, by about 17% on average in early April, according to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/lockdowns-trigger-dramatic-fall-global-carbon-emissions\">recent study</a>. But that will have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/steep-fall-emissions-during-coronavirus-no-cause-for-celebration\">no measurable effect</a> on efforts to meet the Paris goals, as emissions will<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/paris-climate-deal-world-not-on-track-to-meet-goal-amid-continuous-emissions\"> resume their rise</a> as the lockdowns ease unless lasting changes are made to countries\u2019 energy production and consumption patterns.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the UK government said: \u201cAs hosts of Cop26 and the first major economy to legislate for net zero, the UK is committed to delivering a clean and resilient economic recovery from Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThe great global challenges like climate change and biodiversity loss have not gone away and it will be the duty of every responsible government to see our economies are revived and rebuilt in a way that stands the test of time. That\u2019s why&nbsp;we\u2019re calling on&nbsp;all nations&nbsp;to&nbsp;come forward with more ambitious climate plans.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Top story: \u2018We\u2019ll make it mandatory if that\u2019s what it takes\u2019</h2> \n<p>Good morning, Warren Murray here and you can check your eyesight on the following.</p> \n<p>Coronavirus test and trace comes into effect in England today from 9am. The system is intended to allow lockdown to be replaced with local measures where the disease flares up again. Testing is being extended to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/government-unveils-covid-19-test-and-trace-strategy-for-england\">everyone with coronavirus symptoms including under-5s</a>. Those testing positive will be called and asked to give names and phone numbers of those they\u2019ve come within 2 metres of for more than 15 minutes in the previous two days.

Prof Sheila Bird, a biostatistics expert, said it was \u201cpretty incredible stuff\u201d that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/government-target-of-200000-covid-19-tests-meaningless\">each individual swab from a single individual was reportedly counted as a separate test</a> in thousands of cases. \u201cConsidering the swab of the left nostril and the right nostril of the same person as two tests would be most unfortunate.\u201d Prof John Ashton, a former medical and public&nbsp;health official, said the published statistics were \u201call over the place \u2026&nbsp;We don\u2019t know how many people have been tested.

One study showed the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/studies-add-to-alarm-over-deforestation-in-brazil-under-bolsonaro-covid-19\">lost 12,000 square kilometres (4,633 sq miles) of forest in 2019</a> while the other flagged a 27% increase in destruction of tropical forests in eastern Brazil. The environment minister, Ricardo Salles, has&nbsp;advocated&nbsp;that&nbsp;the government use the cover of the coronavirus pandemic to weaken already shaky environmental protection laws. Amazon deforestation and fires have&nbsp;soared&nbsp;since Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, vowing to end the \u201cfines industry\u201d of environment agencies and develop the rainforest.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Crisis in Fiji parliament \u2013&nbsp;</strong>Fiji\u2019s politics are in a tailspin again after the suspension of the main&nbsp;opposition&nbsp;party, which has left parliament <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/fiji-politics-in-chaos-after-main-opposition-party-suspended\">with just three opposition members</a> on the eve of a major national budget debate. The suspension of the Social Democratic Liberal party for alleged breaches of party registration laws leaves little in the way of checks on prime minister Frank Bainimarama, who came to power in a coup before winning the 2014 and 2018 elections with his FijiFirst party. Fiji&nbsp;had four coups from 1987 to 2006, largely due to tensions between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendants of colonial era indentured labourers.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Two-Prom strategy \u2013&nbsp;</strong>There will be&nbsp;Prom concerts&nbsp;this summer but not as we know them.

  "<p>No planes in the sky, empty hotels and deserted attractions: with the world at a standstill, tourism has been one of the industries worst-hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/07/world-tourism-faces-worst-crisis-since-records-began-says-unwto-report\">International arrivals this year could be down by 80%</a> compared with 2019, according to the World Tourism Organization, and more than 100 million jobs are under threat.</p> <p>But as destinations slowly start to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/18/europe-holidays-which-european-countries-are-easing-coronavirus-travel-restrictions-lockdown-measures\">emerge from lockdown and borders tentatively reopen</a>, many in the sector are wondering if this is a chance for tourism to rebuild in a greener, more sustainable way.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s completely devastating \u2013 but it\u2019s also provided a much-needed chance for introspection,\u201d said Sam Bruce of Much Better Adventures, who is a co-founder of campaigning group <a href=\"https://www.tourismdeclares.com/\">Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency</a>. \u201cThings needed to change. It\u2019s an opportunity for everyone from tourist boards to tour operators to reset and to look at how things can be better \u2013 for the planet, for local communities and for travellers.\u201d</p> <p>In Venice \u2013 one of the most overtouristed cities, with an estimated 25 million foreign visitors a year \u2013 officials are using the pause to rethink \u201can entire Venice system\u201d, with sustainability and quality tourism at its core, said Paola Mar, the city\u2019s councillor for tourism. Part of the plan is to lure locals back to live permanently in the city. The mayor is in discussions with universities, aiming to offer tourist rentals to students, and old buildings are being restored for social housing. Measures to control visitor numbers \u2013 including a tax on day trippers, which was due to be introduced in July \u2013 will go ahead next year, while the debate around cruise ships continues.</p> <p>\u201cOur goal is to trigger a renaissance of the city,\u201d said Mar. \u201cWe want to attract visitors for longer stays and encourage a \u2018slower\u2019 type of tourism. Things can\u2019t go back to how they were.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"609c0d03a9531d95d4155eefc01e9248ff3c6e5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/609c0d03a9531d95d4155eefc01e9248ff3c6e5c/0_82_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign in Amsterdam\u2019s Leidseplein counting the days until bar terraces are allowed to reopen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign in Amsterdam\u2019s Leidseplein counting the days until bar terraces are allowed to reopen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Remko de Waal/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>City authorities in Amsterdam \u2013 which was struggling to cope with an estimated 18.3 million overnight tourist stays in 2019 \u2013 are also quietly hopeful that the pandemic will be a catalyst for change. Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/22/amsterdam-mayor-urges-extreme-caution-over-return-of-tourism-to-the-city-covid-19\">the mayor urged extreme caution in reopening to tourists</a>, while nonprofit group <a href=\"https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/our-network/amsterdam-and-partners\">Amsterdam&amp;Partners</a> believes the tourist hiatus pushes to the top of the agenda plans to cut numbers, give Amsterdam back to locals and attract the \u201cright\u201d kind of visitor, and has launched a sustainability taskforce to map the way forward.</p> <p>\u201cWe are working with partners to discuss how we can restart in a more sustainable and responsible way,\u201d said Amsterdam&amp;Partners spokeswoman Heleen Jansen. \u201cThe main focus is that we want a sustainable visitor economy that doesn\u2019t harm the livability of our city. If you have the right balance between living, working and visiting, you can have the right visitor economy. That\u2019s what went wrong in the last years in the old city centre, and we have to entice locals to discover their city centre again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Customers will be more aware of the impact of travel on environment and communities, and  make more considered choices</p> <footer> <cite>James Thornton, Intrepid Travel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, the suddenly empty streets of Barcelona have made local businesses and the tourist board re-evaluate their priorities too. \u201cWhile we couldn\u2019t continue at the speed things were, this is showing us that no tourists is no good either \u2013 there needs to be a more moderate way,\u201d said Mateo Asensioof the Barcelona tourist board. \u201cOur first task is getting locals back out into the city, then the domestic market and our neighbours. When the international market returns, we\u2019ll focus more on specific sectors. It\u2019s an opportunity to change the rules.\u201d</p> <p>With the world\u2019s \u201cnew normal\u201d including social distancing, an increased fear of crowds and busy places \u2013 and the future of airlines in the balance \u2013 over-tourism may not be a pressing issue for some time.</p> <p>Other changes in cities around the world include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/cleaner-and-greener-covid-19-prompts-worlds-cities-to-free-public-space-of-cars\"> reshaping in favour of cyclists and pedestrians</a>: Athens is accelerating plans for a car-free historic centre, Berlin is introducing 14 miles of new bike lanes, and Paris is also significantly increasing its bike lanes, to ease potential overcrowding.</p> <p>Destinations likely to see the first surge in visitor numbers are remote coastal and rural areas, places seen as \u201csafe\u201d, said Patricia Yates, acting CEO of Visit Britain/Visit England. It will be longer before cities bounce back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0912867e74edef6f1a277e726247d2f26ba1ee8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0912867e74edef6f1a277e726247d2f26ba1ee8c/0_133_5106_3064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coast path near Langland beach, Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quieter coastal areas, such as the Gower in Wales, will see the first rise, says Visit Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Rees/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur weekly consumer sentiment surveys show that the domestic market is very nervous \u2013 so we will be focusing initially on reassurance,\u201d she said. \u201cBut beyond that we will be looking at promoting areas outside the honeypots. What is needed is destination management to rebuild tourism more slowly and keep residents, visitors and businesses that depend on tourists happy \u2013 it\u2019s quite a balancing act.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the progress made on sustainable tourism is likely to go into reverse at first, she added \u2013 with people eschewing public transport in favour of car travel and infection control measures leading to more single-use plastic.</p> <p>Many tour operators, however, believe the pandemic could engender a positive change in client behaviour. Intrepid Travel CEO James Thornton said: \u201cDuring this hibernation period we\u2019ve seen the benefit to nature and the climate \u2013 fish spotted in Venice\u2019s clearer canal water, the Himalayas visible in India \u2013 and people have had time to reflect. I think customers will be more aware of the impact of travel on the environment and the communities they visit, and make more considered choices.\u201d</p> <p>A renewed focus on slower travel, including train journeys and cycling, as well as keeping experiences as local as possible and offering more off-season departures are part of Intrepid\u2019s post-Covid plans, with wilderness and wellness trips tipped to be of most interest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aeb8a7c05f1b9ae86fabbe4b9c9a21ae46c12412\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeb8a7c05f1b9ae86fabbe4b9c9a21ae46c12412/0_0_4287_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bikes on the Runkerry Trail near Bushmills, Northern Ireland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Runkerry Trail in Northern Ireland: slower travel could include more trains and bikes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Lyons/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Launching new adventures in even more remote destinations to assist with economic recovery is on the agenda for Much Better Adventures when tourism opens up again. \u201cThe crisis has shown just how much communities in less-developed parts of the world rely on tourism,\u201d said Sam Bruce. \u201cWe will look to spread tourism to areas that would genuinely benefit. But it has to be done in the right way. We risk a flood to remote places that aren\u2019t prepared and could be taken advantage of.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that a new, slower tourism will emerge \u2013 but the recovery needs to be slow enough for the industry to make the right decisions as it rises from the ashes.\u201d</p> <p>G Adventures founder Bruce Poon Tip \u2013 who has just published Unlearn: The Year the Earth Stood Still,<em> </em>an e-book looking at the impact of the pandemic on tourism \u2013 believes the industry can emerge as a stronger force for good.</p> <p>\u201cPeople will travel again. We don\u2019t yet know when, but we know that they will. I want to challenge everyone who travels to \u2018unlearn\u2019 what they think they know. We have the opportunity to use this reset to be more conscious about how we can improve, as individuals and as a wider travel community.\u201d</p> <p>The biggest issue in the move to a more sustainable tourist industry, though, is air travel \u2013 aviation accounted for 2% of global carbon emissions in 2019 and was one of the fastest-growing polluters<strong>.</strong> With airlines grounded, emissions from aviation declined by about 60% in early April compared with 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/lockdowns-trigger-dramatic-fall-global-carbon-emissions\">according to the journal Nature Climate Change</a>.</p> <p>With the pause likely to be temporary, campaigners from Greenpeace to Flight Free are demanding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/is-covid-19-crisis-the-catalyst-for-the-greening-of-worlds-airlines\">airline bailouts </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/is-covid-19-crisis-the-catalyst-for-the-greening-of-worlds-airlines\">come with strict conditions</a> on their future climate impact and say Covid should be the catalyst for greening the world\u2019s airlines.</p> <p>But in a race for economic recovery, rebuilding the industry quickly could sideline climate change and aviation issues, said Justin Francis of Responsible Travel, who is calling for a \u201cgreen flying duty\u201d, with more regulation and tax revenues invested in renewable fuels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3609d5c642c48832cb03ec10951e0c35809d435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3609d5c642c48832cb03ec10951e0c35809d435/0_12_1728_1037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queues at the Ryanair desk at Stansted Airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queues at Stansted Airport: many people were \u2018hooked on short breaks\u2019, says Responsible Travel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cost of flights is likely to rise in the long term, he added. \u201cShort term, the where and how we travel has had to change. But new, more entrenched, norms could form from that. Many people were hooked on frequent short breaks, but key to more sustainable tourism is taking far fewer flights \u2013 we may now see a return to longer, less frequent holidays, with more time spent getting to know a place, and a rise in slower forms of travel.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever happens, it\u2019s unlikely travel will ever be the same as in pre-Covid days. An industry known for its resilience will find a new way forward, adapting to an unknown global market, but whether sustainability can be at the heart of a new model of tourism is hard to predict.</p> <p>\u201cTourism will be smaller, and so more sustainable per se. Fewer flights means less C02, fewer guests means less waste, and there will be much more focus on localism, at least initially,\u201d said Graham Miller, professor of sustainability in business at the University of Surrey.</p> <p>\u201cHow the nature of the product changes, however, remains to be seen. There are huge vested interests to contend with \u2013 like the cruise industry in Venice and big businesses \u2013 but it feels like the moment we have been waiting for. If we are going to redesign tourism, this is about the best chance we can wish for.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Known global cases near 5.7m</strong></h2> <p>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 5,693,066 people are known to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/global-report-trump-silent-on-us-death-toll-as-south-korea-sees-new-covid-19-rise\">contracted the virus since the pandemic began</a>, while at least 355,653 people are known to have died. The true death toll and number of cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</p> <h2><strong>US deaths pass 100,000</strong></h2> <p>Data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/us-coronavirus-deaths-toll-1000000\">United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths</a> from Covid-19, moving past a sombre milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain.</p> <h2><strong>South Korea could face return to coronavirus restrictions</strong></h2> <p>South Korea&nbsp;has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in 53 days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/south-korea-faces-return-to-coronavirus-restrictions-after-spike-in-new-cases\">triggering warnings it may have to revert to stricter social distancing measures</a> after appearing to have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/south-korea-first-steps-post-covid-world\">brought the outbreak under control</a>.The Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 79 new infections on Thursday with 67 of them from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to about half of the country\u2019s population of 51 million.</p> <h2><strong>UN: Virus could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America</strong></h2> <p>The UN World Food Program is warning that at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on. New projections released late on Wednesday estimate a startling four-fold increase in severe food insecurity.</p> <h2><strong>European investment slashed</strong></h2> <p>Over a third of European foreign direct investment projects announced in 2019 have been either delayed or cancelled outright because of the coronavirus pandemic, an annual survey by professional services group EY found. Some 65% of the 6,412 projects in question are already in place or continuing \u201calbeit with downgraded capacity and recruitment\u201d, EY said. A further 25% were delayed and 10 percent cancelled, its Europe Attractiveness survey found.</p> <h2><strong>Ireland faces record recession: think tank</strong></h2> <p>Ireland is facing its deepest ever recession as the coronavirus lockdown devastates jobs and strains the public finances, a think tank said Thursday. A report by Ireland\u2019s Economic and Social Research Institute predicts the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) will decline 12.4% this year. That was the \u201cmost likely\u201d scenario under a government plan to lift the lockdown in August but with the economy struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels owing to physical distancing measures, ESRI said.</p> <h2>Tory anger at Dominic Cummings builds</h2> <p>61 Conservative MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/tory-anger-at-dominic-cummings-grows-as-dozens-of-mps-defy-boris-johnson\">defied British PM Boris Johnson\u2019s calls to \u201cmove on\u201d&nbsp;from the Dominic Cummings crisis</a> as a senior minister broke ranks to accuse the special adviser of inconsistencies in his account of his behaviour during lockdown.

Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips.</p> <h2>Hydroxychloroquine study raises concerns</h2> <p>Questions have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/28/questions-raised-over-hydroxychloroquine-study-which-caused-who-to-halt-trials-for-covid-19\">raised about a study published in the Lancet</a> that prompted the World Health Organization to halt global trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine.

  "<p>Just after 7am on the morning of 23 March 2017, journalist <a href=\"https://cpj.org/data/people/miroslava-breach-velducea/\" title=\"\">Miroslava Breach Velducea</a>, a 54-year-old mother of three, was driving her 14-year-old son to school in the city of Chihuahua, Mexico, when a man walked up to her car and shot her eight times. According to reports, her son was not injured, but Breach died on the way to hospital.</p> <p>The Mexican newspaper la Jornada reported that a cardboard note was found at the scene of the murder, which read: \u201cFor being a snitch. You\u2019re next, Governor \u2013 El 80.\u201d According to Mexican police, \u201cEl 80\u201d was Carlos Arturo Quintana, son of the leader of an organised crime syndicate known as La L\u00ednea, which in its heyday controlled one of the lucrative smuggling routes for the supply and transfer of drugs from Colombia to the US. Three days before Breach was murdered, Quintana\u2019s father had been killed in a confrontation between rival gangs.</p> <p>Breach worked for la Jornada and for the regional paper Norte de Ciudad Juarez, covering politics and crime; she had also set up her own news agency, Mir. She had reported extensively on the links between organised crime and politicians in Chihuahua state. On 4 March 2016, Breach wrote in la Jornada about the alleged criminal connections of mayoral candidates in several small towns in western Chihuahua. Breach had received threats to her life on at least three occasions as a result of her reporting. In October 2016, she had told a meeting of the Federal Mechanism for Journalists and Human Rights Defenders that she had been threatened. Nevertheless, on the day she was killed, she had no protection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa6f80423c5348af2f2d9f685c8f7b0d7d947b5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa6f80423c5348af2f2d9f685c8f7b0d7d947b5d/0_93_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest in Mexico City after the murder of Miroslava Breach in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest in Mexico City after the murder of Miroslava Breach in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Cardenas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Breach\u2019s story is not an isolated one. She was one of six journalists killed in Mexico in 2017; more than 150 journalists have been <a href=\"https://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/default/files/documentos/2019-08/COMUNICADO%20324-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">killed</a> there since 2000, 22 of them in the state of Chihuahua. In 2019, according to <a href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2019/10/getting-away-with-murder-killed-justice.php\" title=\"\">data compiled</a> by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Mexico had the seventh-highest number of unsolved murders of journalists in the world, behind Somalia, Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, the Philippines and Afghanistan. On 18 May this year, gunmen killed the owner of a newspaper, Jorge Miguel Armenta \u00c1valos, and one of the policemen assigned to protect him, following earlier threats. Armenta, who is at least the third journalist to be murdered in Mexico in 2020, was attacked in broad daylight while leaving a restaurant.</p> <p>According to the World Press Freedom Index for 2020, compiled by <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/mexico\" title=\"\">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RSF) and released in March, journalists in Mexico face a dire situation: \u201cCollusion between officials and organized crime poses a grave threat to journalists\u2019 safety and cripples the judicial system at all levels. Journalists who cover sensitive political stories or organized crime are warned, threatened and often gunned down in cold blood.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Attacks on journalists around the world take many forms, some of which are sanctioned in law. Legal or quasi-legal mechanisms include the use of civil or criminal legal actions, covert surveillance, overt censorship and financial threats (such as withdrawing state advertising), as well as more direct intimidation and threats.</p> <p>In recent years, another way of silencing journalists has proliferated: the use of what are known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/help-record-rise-of-slapp-lawsuits-aiming-to-silence-journalists-comment/\" title=\"\">Slapps</a>, where defamation or criminal lawsuits are brought with the intention of shutting down forms of expression such as peaceful protest or writing blogs. Originally regarded as an American legal mechanism, such lawsuits are now fairly widespread in Europe. Before she was killed in 2017, the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was facing around 40 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/malta-urged-to-drop-libel-lawsuits-against-daphne-caruana-galizia\" title=\"\">libel lawsuits</a> filed by companies, government officials and individuals, which were described by her son Matthew as a \u201cnever-ending type of torture\u201d.</p> <p>V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the vice-president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, has been working on introducing protections against Slapp lawsuits, the defence of which can cost individuals a fortune and tie up their time and resources. Justin Borg-Barthet, a legal academic at Aberdeen University, has called for EU law to be changed to prevent \u201cforum shopping\u201d to countries with claimant-friendly laws, so that defamation suits would have to be filed in the courts of the country where the media organisation or journalist was based. Slapp lawsuits are commonly used against journalists investigating government corruption or exposing corporate abuses, but are also used against civil society organisations, activists such as environmental campaigners, trade unionists and academics, to shut down or silence acts of criticism and protest.</p> <p>In France, media organisations and NGOs <a href=\"https://actionaid.org/stories/2019/slapp-face-accountability\" title=\"\">have been hit</a> with what they view as Slapp suits for publishing accusations of land-grabbing from villagers and farmers in Cameroon by companies associated with the Bollor\u00e9 Group. In the UK, fracking companies including Ineos, UK Oil &amp; Gas, Cuadrilla, IGas and Angus Energy have since 2017 <a href=\"https://www.lag.org.uk/article/205728/fracking-and-the-right-to-protest\" title=\"\">sought and been granted</a> wide-ranging court injunctions, often directed against persons unknown, to prevent protests and campaigning activities at drilling sites. These injunctions had a chilling effect on the right to protest and free speech, until the court of appeal <a href=\"https://drillordrop.com/2019/04/03/breaking-anti-fracking-campaigners-win-appeal-against-ineos-protest-injunction/\" title=\"\">ruled in April 2019</a> that parts of an Ineos injunction prohibiting protests on the public highway and against the Ineos supply chain, and which had been used as a template for similar orders granted to other oil and gas companies, were unlawful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4079b38e070089a37d3e8539102f970c5c9e899e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4079b38e070089a37d3e8539102f970c5c9e899e/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered by a car bomb in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered by a car bomb in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside Slapp suits, there are more traditional ways to keep journalists quiet. More than 150 countries retain some sort of criminal defamation laws, many of which include the possibility of imprisonment. Blasphemy and insult laws remain commonplace in many countries, and are often used by politicians and government officials against any critical media. A number of countries including Turkey and Egypt have expansive definitions of \u201cterrorism\u201d that allow them to arrest and detain anyone who voices political dissent or opposition, including journalists.</p> <p>In countries such as Hungary and Poland, governments and political allies exercise quasi-legal control of public information. Media owners can be pressured on what content to publish by threats to limit access to finance and advertising revenues.</p> <p>Separately, the lack of legal protections for journalists against those who attack them acts as a strong deterrent. Impunity fuels a vicious cycle of violence, bolstering those who aim to silence public debate and block sensitive information.</p> <p>In 2013, the UN published a <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/un-plan-action-safety-journalists\" title=\"\">plan of action</a> on the safety of journalists, and the problem of impunity for perpetrators. The plan provides a framework for co-operation between UN bodies, national authorities, media actors and NGOs. Spearheaded through Unesco, the plan was incorporated into the Declaration of the Council of Europe in April 2014, and in guidelines published by the EU soon after. In April 2016, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors.</p> <p>By the end of 2018, the Council of Europe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/the-platform\" title=\"\">Platform for the Protection of Journalism and Safety of Journalists</a>, set up to record information on serious concerns about media freedom and the safety of journalists in Council of Europe (CoE) member states, had registered more than 500 <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/all-alerts\" title=\"\">alerts</a>, with year-on-year rises of incidents in every year except 2017. Nearly half of all alerts are marked as category 1, covering the most severe and damaging violations of media freedom, such as murder, direct threats to life and physical assaults. The majority of threats came from the state, with physical attacks and detentions making up nearly half the alerts. Since 2015, only 11% of all alerts have been marked as resolved, a figure that goes down to 1.82% for alerts entered in 2018. Interviews with journalists echo these statistics. In 2017, a study that interviewed 940 journalists from all CoE member states found that a staggering 40% of them had suffered slander.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://rm.coe.int/background-paper-safety-of-journalists-and-other-media-actorsfinal/168094b396\" title=\"\">May 2020 report</a> by Peter Noorlander on the implementation of the 2016 CoE recommendation, attacks against journalists remain insufficiently investigated, and a very high percentage of incidents go unpunished. \u201cJournalists have little confidence that attacks or threats against them will be investigated, and often do not report them,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis has a grave effect on them, and many no longer report attacks but instead self-censor and shy away from potentially controversial issues \u2026 [CoE] Member States have committed to creating an enabling environment for freedom of expression, yet, what journalists experience on the ground is increased violence, threats, denigration, arbitrary arrests and detention.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Some of the most high-profile cases of attacks against the media in the last few years have involved journalists in countries where neither democracy nor the rule of law is respected. Many of the more recent attacks have been perpetrated or encouraged by heads of state.</p> <p>They include cases such as the politically sponsored harassment of Philippines journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/maria-ressa\" title=\"\">Maria Ressa</a>, the editor of Rappler, a social news network. Under Ressa, the site has revealed the activities of the online \u201ctroll army\u201d that supports the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte and spreads disinformation about his opponents. Rappler has also reported critically on extrajudicial killings, human-rights violations and the rising death rates from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-war-on-drugs-catholic-church\" title=\"\">Duterte\u2019s war on drugs</a>. The law suits that would follow were presaged during Duterte\u2019s state of the union speech in July 2017, when he declared that Rappler was \u201cfully owned\u201d by the Americans, and therefore in violation of the constitution.</p> <p>In January 2018, the Philippine securities and exchange commission revoked Rappler\u2019s licence. The government then investigated Rappler for tax evasion, and a warrant for Ressa\u2019s arrest was issued in November 2018. In February 2019, Ressa and Rappler were hit with another lawsuit alleging libel relating to a story published in 2012, using a law enacted four months after the story was published.</p> <p>Other infamous cases of state-sponsored crimes against journalists include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/23/jamal-khashoggi-timeline-of-key-events\" title=\"\">the brutal murder</a>, on 2 October 2018, of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The CIA have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/cia-khashoggi-findings-highly-damaging-to-saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman\" title=\"\">concluded</a> that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the journalist\u2019s assassination. On 19 July 2019, the office of the UNHCR released a report <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24713\" title=\"\">describing</a> Khashoggi\u2019s death as \u201cpremeditated extra judicial execution\u201d.</p> <p>In many western countries, there is a risk that intimidation and violence against the media is becoming normalised. On Czech election day in October 2017, Czech president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/milos-zeman-czech-leader-refugees\" title=\"\">Milo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/milos-zeman-czech-leader-refugees\" title=\"\">\u0161 Zeman</a> held up a mock assault rifle with an inscription that was translated as \u201cAt journalists\u201d.

But that would be a mistake. In 2007, Thames Valley police searched the home and office of Sally Murrer, a local journalist. \u201cI was just pottering around doing typical local stories and in May 2007, eight police officers swooped at my home while eight swooped simultaneously at the office,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/local-press-reporter-police-surveillance-destroyed-my-life-the-snoopers-charter-absolutely-terrifies-me/\" title=\"\">told</a> reporters from the Press Gazette. \u201cThey seized all my computer equipment, searched my house, phones, laptops. They took me into custody where I stayed for a couple of days, strip-searched me. I honestly had no idea [why]. They said the charge was aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office and it carried life imprisonment.</p> <p>\u201cIt was only later when they interviewed me, which they did copious times, and played me tapes and showed me transcripts of texts, that I realised I had been under surveillance for the previous eight weeks. It was just a ghastly feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Thames Valley police had secretly recorded a conversation that took place between her and a police officer. Murrer was accused of receiving sensitive stories from the police officer and selling them to the News of the World. \u201cThe stories were about a local GBH committed by a footballer, and the murder of a local man where there was a link to cannabis and his wife was the secretary of the then-MP.\u201d After 19 months, during which she had been on police bail, Murrer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/28/pressandpublishing-medialaw\" title=\"\">trial collapsed</a> after the judge ruled police had breached her rights.</p> <p>More recently, in August 2018, the police in Northern Ireland arrested two journalists, Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey, over the alleged theft of documents from the Northern Ireland police ombudsman into the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/mar/22/investigating-the-loughinisland-murders\" title=\"\">Loughinisland massacre</a>, when members of a loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, burst into a pub with assault rifles and fired on the customers.

The raid on the home of the News Corporation journalist was in response to a story she had written about how the Australian Signals Directorate was seeking new powers to spy on Australian citizens. In February, a court ruled the search was legitimate as the police were investigating valid national security offences. ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, described the decision as \u201ca blow for public interest journalism\u201d and argued that it highlighted a \u201cserious problem\u201d with Australia\u2019s national security laws.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Since the outbreak of coronavirus, protections for journalists have become <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52363305\" title=\"\">more urgent than ever.</a> According to RSF\u2019s secretary-general, Christophe Deloire, \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth China and Iran censored their major coronavirus outbreaks extensively.

  "<p>The government\u2019s target of hitting 200,000 Covid-19 daily tests by Monday has been described as \u201cmeaningless\u201d by senior scientists, who say that the published data on testing does not adhere to the basic rules of statistics.</p> \n<p>Experts told the Guardian the published daily testing figures appeared \u201calmost designed to confuse\u201d and made it impossible to judge whether current levels of testing are adequate to support the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/government-unveils-covid-19-test-and-trace-strategy-for-england\">track, trace and isolate programme</a> that is said to be essential for easing lockdown.</p> \n<p>Concerns included the failure, for the past five days, to release data on how many people have been tested, the reported double-counting of multiple swabs (nose and saliva) from the same individuals, and the inclusion of tests that have been mailed out to homes and satellite labs, but not returned, in the daily tally.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a8aefc4-c87c-430c-81cd-7b8b5fa27431\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIZouD5qaLM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of&nbsp;public&nbsp;health and regional medical officer for the&nbsp;north-west of England, described the published statistics as \u201call over the place\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult, even for someone like me whose living has centred on numbers, to know exactly what is going on. We don\u2019t know how many people have been tested. We don\u2019t know how many tests have been satisfactory. There\u2019s a real problem of transparency and trust,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Prof Sheila Bird, formerly of the Medical Research Council\u2019s biostatistics unit at the University of Cambridge, described the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/tens-thousands-coronavirus-tests-have-double-counted-officials/\">reported double-counting of tens of thousands of swabs</a> where saliva and nasal samples taken from the same patient were counted as two tests, as \u201cpretty incredible stuff\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cConsidering the swab of the left nostril and the right nostril of the same person as two tests would be most unfortunate,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there are those issues in the hinterland, they need to come to the fore and be explained.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cGood statistical practice says that you must first define what you\u2019re counting,\u201d she added. \u201cThat would be a&nbsp;good start.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 6 May, Boris Johnson said that \u201cthe ambition clearly is to get up to 200,000 [tests] a day&nbsp;by the end of this month\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However,&nbsp;on 26 May, 117,000 daily tests were performed or mailed out and no total figure was available for how many people were tested. And there are unexplained gaps in the published daily figures that raise further questions about the true extent to which testing capacity has been scaled up in the past month.</p> \n<p>Since testing was expanded to include home testing and tests mailed out to satellite sites, a gulf has opened between the number of pillar 2 tests carried out each day and the number of people tested \u2013 by 21 May the gap had reached more than 500,000 tests (45% of the total).</p> \n<p>The Department of Health said this is due to retests and because some tests mailed out have not yet been returned or used. It declined to say what proportion of tests have left the system and not come back.</p> \n<p>For the past five days, no figures have been provided for the number of people tested in pillar 2 \u2013 or overall \u2013 and the latest bulletin states reporting of these figures have been temporarily paused <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1265658306850324480/photo/1\">\u201cto ensure consistent reporting across all pillars\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>David King, former government chief scientist and chair of the independent Sage committee, said the lack of transparency over figures was \u201cvery concerning\u201d and that his advisory committee had reached a point of \u201csheer frustration\u201d over the handling of testing.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe real value of testing in the middle of a pandemic is to couple testing with the track and isolation that follows,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re opening up from the lockdown without having the test, track and trace process fully operative. It should\u2019ve been tested for a week beforehand and showing good results.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to ask what\u2019s the point of aiming for 200,000 if we haven\u2019t even got up to 100,000 with track and trace?\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re much more likely to go into a second peak in the outbreak unless we have test, trace, isolate fully in place.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Two studies have raised further alarm about deforestation in Brazil during the first year of the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s government.</p> <p>One study showed the country lost 12,000 km<sup>2</sup> (4,633 sq miles) of forest last year and also provided important information about those behind deforestation.

A vote on the law was postponed this week amid outrage over Salles\u2019s comments.</p> <p>The MapBiomas study shows Brazil already knows who is responsible for deforestation. The issue is not finding the offenders, it is that fines are often ignored. A <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/20/brazil-amazon-penalties-suspended-october\">study</a>&nbsp;by Human Rights Watch shows that Amazon fines have been suspended since October after the introduction of new procedures by the Bolsonaro government.</p> <p>The NGO SOS Atlantic Forest has also released figures that showed a 27% increase in the destruction of tropical forests in 17 states in eastern Brazil from October 2018 to October 2019 after two years of falling deforestation.

  "<p>In early 1976 Gary Green, aged 22 and not long out of college, was living with his parents in the suburbs of Long Island. On weekends he would travel into Manhattan to watch shows by the likes of glam-rock veterans the New York Dolls and aspiring punk poet Patti Smith.

Green was a clued-up music fan with a camera in the right place at exactly the right time. He began shooting in venues like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/11/cbgbs-rocks-backpages\">CBGB </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/11/cbgbs-rocks-backpages\">on</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/11/cbgbs-rocks-backpages\"> the Bowery</a>, where a scene was coalescing around groups such as the Ramones, Television, Blondie and Talking Heads. Green took his photos to the music paper New York Rocker, he says. \u201cThe editor, Alan Betrock, gave me my first assignment, which was to photograph this young rockabilly-obsessed singer, Robert Gordon. It all started from there.\u201d</p> <p>It has taken 44 years for Green\u2019s monochrome photographs of New York\u2019s punk and post-punk scene to see the light of day with the publication of <a href=\"https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/products/when-midnight\">When Midnight Comes Around</a>.

What sets it apart is the sense that Green was both an insider \u2013 for a time, he shared an apartment with Sylvain Sylvain of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/14/popandrock.shopping8\">New York Dolls</a> \u2013 and an acute social observer who understood that he was witnessing an important pop-cultural moment driven by outsiders and misfits.</p> <p>His photographs of the soon-to-be-famous are punctuated by portraits of anonymous individuals who caught his eye with their style or attitude. The result is a democratic portrait of an emerging New York punk scene that looks both distant and timeless.</p> <p>\u201cI thought what I was doing was a kind of social documentary. I had seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/diane-arbus\">Diane Arbus</a>\u2019s work and would later take a class with Lisette Model, who had taught Arbus. I think this accounts for my straight-on approach, but also my desire to shoot people who weren\u2019t famous,\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, I was never a fan of live photography.

This is another New York, grittier and edgy, a city close to financial bankruptcy. Its more neglected neighbourhoods, where rents were low and crime rates high, drew artists and musicians attuned to an emerging punk aesthetic that fed off and was energised by the surrounding seediness. \u201cThe lower East Side is trendy now, but back then I didn\u2019t go there unless I really had to.

Alongside New York scenesters such as Anya Phillips, co-founder of the Mudd Club, Green also snapped a young, dapper Tom Waits, a lonesome-looking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/02/alex-chilton-big-star-biography-rocks-backpages-melody-maker\">Alex Chilton</a> in CBGB, and Lou Reed with Andy Warhol at an early solo show by erstwhile New York Doll David Johansen at the Bottom Line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3540a5f8fcf80a5340f17eb0f2309afb5ffdaac3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3540a5f8fcf80a5340f17eb0f2309afb5ffdaac3/0_0_2031_1505/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Johansen, Lou Reed and Andy Warhol, backstage at the Bottom Line in the 1970s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"741\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hanging out \u2026 David Johansen, Lou Reed and Andy Warhol, backstage at the Bottom Line in the 1970s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Green</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople were there in those clubs to be noticed,\u201d he says, \u201cso it was never that difficult to get access.

This hospital should have more appropriately been assigned to the Asian continental designation.\u201d</p> <p>He said the error did not change the overall study findings. It did mean that the Australian data in the paper would be revised to four hospitals and 63 deaths,.</p> <p>Dr Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist and infectious disease doctor with Alfred Health in Melbourne, said the Australian hospitals involved in the study should be named. He said he had never heard of Surgisphere, and no one from his hospital, The Alfred, had provided Surgisphere with data.</p> <p>\u201cUsually to submit to a database like Surgisphere you need ethics approval, and someone from the hospital will be involved in that process to get it to a database,\u201d he said.

Turkey is home to 4 million mostly Syrian refugees. </p> \n  <p>Memories are still fresh of the crisis that erupted when thousands responded to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s abrupt decision to \u201copen the gates to Europe\u201d for refugees earlier this year. An estimated 30,000 men, women and children - many bussed in by Turkish forces - converged on the frontier with thousands then attempting to illegally cross over into Greece. In recent days bilateral tensions have been on the rise over Athens\u2019 declared intention to build a fence to bolster the border \u2013 reiterated by Chrysohoidis this afternoon. </p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, migrants forced to endure prolonged quarantine in a facility in the Peloponnese also took to the streets in protest today. </p> \n  <p>Greek authorities announced lockdown measures would be extended for another 14 days after three more coronavirus cases were confirmed in the holding centre \u2013 a hotel in the southern town of Kranidi hosting 470 migrants and refugees mostly from sub-Saharan Africa. The hotel has been under quarantine since 21 April when 153 people first tested positive for the virus. </p> \n  <p>Growing disquiet is also being expressed by aid workers over refugee camps having to put up with prolonged lockdowns when the rest of Greece is relaxing restrictions and re-assuming a semblance of normality. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe have seen a noticeable rise in all sorts of violence, from tent violence to sexual violence because people are forced to spend much more time in camps,\u201d Apostolos Veizis, the medical director of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Greece told the Guardian. \u201cThese people are not treated as human but numbers.

The current toll stands at 350,456. The number of confirmed cases is 5,589,932, after the number of declared cases doubled in a month, with more than one million new cases registered in the last 11 days. There were 500,000 cases registered in just 48 hours, between Sunday, when cases passed 5 million, and Tuesday, when cases passed 5.5 million. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.
