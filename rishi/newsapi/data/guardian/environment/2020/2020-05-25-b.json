  "<p>Mexico City issued 8,072 more death certificates than usual between 1 January and 20 May, according to a new study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400.</p> <p>Research <a href=\"https://datos.nexos.com.mx/?p=1388\">published</a> in the Mexican magazine Nexos on Monday used information from the capital\u2019s 52 civil registries to estimate the number of death certificates created in the period up to 20 May.</p> <p>The report\u2019s authors, investigators Mario Romero Zavala and Laurianne Despeghel, found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than the average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number would mushroom by 120%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/22/planes-spray-the-city-at-night-covid-19-conspiracy-theories-in-mexicos-motor-town\">'Planes spray the city at night': Covid-19 conspiracy theories in Mexico's motor town</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The authors said not all those excess deaths were caused by Covid-19, but some of those who died \u201cdidn\u2019t go to hospitals for fear of catching it\u201d and died of other causes.</p> <p>Romero and Despeghel put the percentage of excess deaths officially attributed to Covid-19 in Mexico City at 25% \u2013 lower than the rates of 97% in Germany and 54% in the UK.</p> <p>As of Monday, Mexico City had recorded 1,963 Covid-19 deaths, according to its mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum. That is the highest tally of any Mexican state, but a figure that is coming under increasing scrutiny since the country\u2019s rate of testing remains low.</p> <p>Mexico has now officially recorded 7,394 deaths and 68,620 Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>The investigation into Mexico City\u2019s death certificates added to growing questions about the official Covid-19 death count in both Mexico and its capital. Sheinbaum and federal health officials deny any deliberate miscounting of the official figures.</p> <p>Mexico <a href=\"https://www.as-coa.org/articles/chart-covid-19-testing-recovery-and-mortality-rates-latin-america\">ranks</a> near the bottom in testing among Latin American countries with just 99 tests per 100,000 residents as of 15 May.</p> <p>Romero, the report author, told the Guardian: \u201cGiven the low number of deaths reported in Mexico, one would assume that we are undercounting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConfirmed cases are highly correlated with testing. Given that correlation, if a country takes a strategy where they do very little testing, it\u2019s safe to assume confirmed deaths will also be undercounted,\u201d Romero added.</p> <p>Coronavirus tsar Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell previously predicted Mexico would hit its peak number of Covid-19 cases during the first 10 days of May and estimated <a href=\"https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/lopez-gatell-estima-que-el-coronavirus-dejara-cerca-de-6-mil-muertos-en-mexico\">the death toll</a> would peak at about 6,000.</p> <p>The country recorded 479 deaths on Friday \u2013 its highest daily total yet \u2013 although both L\u00f3pez-Gatell and President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador claim the Covid-19 curve has \u201cflattened\u201d.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has claimed to have \u201ctamed\u201d the coronavirus, is pushing ahead with plans to open the country in stages, despite the rising death toll.</p>",

Again, this change will be contingent upon progress against the five tests and will only be permitted for those retail premises which are Covid-secure.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecc14ea8f08a1782fa81521\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-25T19:09:59.331Z\">8.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And a little more from lobby journalists:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/georgeeaton/status/1264988486639194112\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The question Conservative MPs will be asking is not whether Boris Johnson's eyesight has failed but whether his political judgement has.</p>\u2014 George Eaton (@georgeeaton) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/georgeeaton/status/1264988486639194112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 25, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/adampayne26/status/1264987048848564224\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Verdict from a Conservative MP not using the \u201cmove on\u201d line:<br><br>Cummings \u201cclearly broke guidelines\u201d <br><br>\u201cThere was no need for him to leave London and the bit about driving to Barnard Castle....<br><br>\u201cI think the overwhelming feeling is that if he can use his interpretation, so can we\u201d</p>\u2014 Adam Payne (@adampayne26) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adampayne26/status/1264987048848564224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 25, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/georgeeaton/status/1264987046478786560\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Boris Johnson confirmed failing eyesight can be a problem of Covid-19 - he didn't say whether he agrees that driving 30 miles with your wife and son is the appropriate treatment.</p>\u2014 George Eaton (@georgeeaton) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/georgeeaton/status/1264987046478786560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 25, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mikeysmith/status/1264986884842938370\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Unbelievable.

  "<p>Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 26 May.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>Scott Morrison will today warn that government support measures are only a temporary form of \u201cmedication\u201d for a sick economy</strong> and microeconomic reforms will be needed to spur growth. In an address to the National Press Club the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/25/morrison-says-support-measures-are-only-temporary-medication-for-sick-economy\">will put households, businesses and states who are expecting</a> further taxpayer support on notice. And in a special investigation, launched today, Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/the-cliff-what-happens-when-australias-coronavirus-stimulus-runs-out-of-road\">looks at the impact </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/the-cliff-what-happens-when-australias-coronavirus-stimulus-runs-out-of-road\">of the government\u2019s recovery spending</a> and asks: what happens after September, when most of these measures run out?</p> \n<p><strong>China\u2019s trade bans are retaliation for Australia leading calls for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19</strong>, according to more than half of the respondents to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The survey finds strong support for the country\u2019s stance on \u201cstanding up to China\u201d and a huge decline in in those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/chinas-trade-bans-are-retaliation-to-covid-19-inquiry-more-than-half-of-australians-say\">with a favourable view of the bilateral </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/chinas-trade-bans-are-retaliation-to-covid-19-inquiry-more-than-half-of-australians-say\"> trading relationship</a>. But respondents were split on whether Australia should avoid a trade war or impose its own tariffs on Chinese imports.</p> \n<p><strong>The world\u2019s deep oceans may experience climate change seven times higher than current levels by the second half of this century</strong>, even if global emissions are cut dramatically.<strong> </strong>The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found different parts of the ocean would change at different rates as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/26/climate-change-in-deep-oceans-could-be-seven-times-faster-by-middle-of-century-report-says\">extra heat from increasing levels of greenhouse gases moved through the vast ocean depths</a>. Prof Jorge Garc\u00eda Molinos, a climate ecologist at Hokkaido University and a co-author of the study, said: \u201cOur results suggest that deep sea biodiversity is likely to be at greater risk because they are adapted to much more stable thermal environments.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Boris Johnson\u2019s beleaguered political aide Dominic Cummings says he drove to popular tourist destination Barnard Castle during lockdown to test his eyesight. </strong>Cummings made the claim while refusing to resign over his alleged flouting of lockdown rules <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/25/uk-coronavirus-live-boirs-johnson-dominic-cummings-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ecbe78b8f0864e579f176e5#block-5ecbe78b8f0864e579f176e5\">when he was symptomatic in April</a>. Cummings, who masterminded the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, is under huge pressure to step down but has been backed by the prime minister, Boris Johnson.</p> \n<h2>Australia</h2> \n<p><strong>Lawyers for Drew Pavlou, a student facing expulsion over his pro-Hong Kong protests, have demanded that the University of Queensland sack the Chinese diplomat Xu Jie from his role as an adjunct professor</strong>. Xu made comments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/lawyers-for-student-drew-pavlou-demand-university-of-queensland-sack-china-diplomat-from-role\">\u201cpraising [the] violence\u201d of a pro-Beijing group who targeted peaceful protesters</a> including Pavlou.</p> \n<p><strong>Australia\u2019s peak cycling organisation is calling on governments to fast-track the construction of planned bike lanes as bike sales surge. </strong>Queensland\u2019s transport and roads minister, Mark Bailey, said he expected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/call-to-fast-track-bike-lanes-to-boost-jobs-and-take-advantage-of-lockdown-induced-bicycle-sales\">many of the new riders would \u201cstick with it permanently\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>A scheme allowing welfare recipients to opt out of the controversial cashless debit card program is experiencing delays of up to five months. </strong>Data shows that of the 859 applications lodged since September, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/welfare-recipients-facing-five-month-delays-to-exit-cashless-debit-card-scheme\">only 30 have been accepted</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>The Australian government says it will not commit to net zero emissions by 2050, and is not due to set a new target until 2025. </strong>The statement was made after Boris Johnson, who hosts the next major climate meeting, urged all countries to hit the target, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/26/australia-stalls-on-emissions-target-update-as-un-urges-deeper-cuts\">noting that 121 nations had already done so</a>.</p> \n<h2>The world</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e30dd393bfa3243932f348f6d6e6e23c1165c148\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e30dd393bfa3243932f348f6d6e6e23c1165c148/0_136_4073_2444/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hydroxychloroquine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pharmacy technician holds a hydroxychloroquine pill.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Frey/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>The WHO has suspended a trial of hydroxychloroquine over safety fears after a study shows taking the drug could raise the risk of death and heart problems. </strong>The antimalarial has been touted by Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">as a preventative measure for coronavirus</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Trump has spent the Memorial Day weekend playing golf and insulting female politicians. </strong>Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic rising star Stacey Abrams were derided for their looks or weight, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/25/donald-trump-twitter-coronavirus-golfing\">while Trump\u2019s former opponent Hillary Clinton was denounced as a \u201cskank\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Queen\u2019s guitarist Brian May says he was \u201cnear death\u201d after a heart attack while gardening. </strong>May used a series of posts on his Instagram account to describe the episode, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/25/brian-may-queen-near-death-heart-attack-gardening\">which led to the discovery of three blocked arteries</a>.</p> \n<h2>Recommended reads</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88f03228b2d6ad114d35e13afec04022504d99ed\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88f03228b2d6ad114d35e13afec04022504d99ed/0_88_2530_1518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iron ore workers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exports in the mining industry do little to help the average Australian.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent du/REUTERS</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Greg Jericho highlights a looming issue for the Australian economy: healthy exports in the mining industry might be good for GDP but do little to help the average Australian.</strong> With agricultural exports included, despite many being under threat from Chinese tariffs, exports as a whole are more important to Australia than ever before . \u201cThe value of our exports is now bigger than that of the entire domestic private sector,\u201d Jericho writes. The biggest reason for that change is China\u2019s rocketing demand for iron ore but the downside is that mining creates relatively few jobs compared with its effect on GDP.

  "<p>\u2018If King Kong used toilet paper,\u201d said Gregg Wallace, \u201cthis is what he would use.\u201d The MasterChef host was visiting a Manchester mill that had increased production from 700,000 to 1m toilet rolls a day to satisfy increased demand during lockdown. The British spirit of stockpiling that led Margaret Thatcher to collect tinned goods for her larder in the 70s is still thriving. The reason for his quest? A new Inside the Factory spinoff, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07mddqk\">Keeping Britain Going</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07mddqk\"> (BBC Two)</a>. <br><br>Before Wallace was a 1.2-tonne so-called mother roll. \u201cThat gives birth to thousands of rolls,\u201d he explained. Does it, Gregg? Even in Call the Midwife mothers don\u2019t give birth by being chopped into pieces by, effectively, a giant bread slicer.<br><br>Like a labrador puppy with lavatory paper, Wallace revelled in stretching metaphors to breaking point, and beyond. Before the chopping begins, he told us, this mother roll must be spliced together with another mother toilet roll in a special splicing machine. Suddenly Wallace was officiating at a wedding weirder than <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2074301/Woman-with-objects-fetish-marries-Eiffel-Tower.html\">the one</a> where a woman agreed to love, honour and obey the Eiffel Tower. \u201cDo you, toilet roll,\u201d Wallace said solemnly, \u201ctake this other toilet roll \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Each year, the average Briton uses 100 toilet rolls. More if, as I do, you\u2019ve been using them to make a soundproof fort to muffle screams over TV during lockdown. Joe Pasquale delivering PPE? Couldn\u2019t he and other virtue-signalling celebs have done that without cameras? I couldn\u2019t get toilet rolls thick enough. Seven ply. Eight ply. Nothing was fit for purpose. <br><br>Here, Wallace was doing his bit to increase scream-related toilet-roll purchases by recycling material from a two-year-old show and topping it off with catch-up interviews via video link. It was like one of those disappointing Simpsons clip shows, but with the twist that we got to see Wallace at his laptop in his den chatting to workers on the frontline of toilet-roll production. My favourite interviewee was the 24-year-old who suggested that he isn\u2019t averse to telling prospective romantic partners where he works. It\u2019s a steady job. Recession proof. Probably gets a staff discount, too.<br><br>Wallace found that even though some staff have been working from home during quarantine, the few who work in the mill have produced more toilet rolls than before. Which, let\u2019s hope, won\u2019t give managers ideas. <br><br>The programme exasperated me, because the firm that plunders koala bears\u2019 image rights for their packaging should have paid for this free advertisement, rather than the bill being footed by licence-fee paying mugs like me.<br><br>Worse, Wallace never questioned the business he spent an hour eulogising. Is toilet roll essential? If we are to learn any lessons about sustainability as a result of lockdown, then maybe our dependence on unsustainable industries needs to be questioned. Here, though, Wallace portrayed toilet roll manufacture as sustainable. In Sweden, lavatory paper expert and possible lumberjack Bjorn told him that the hundred year old trees felled in minutes to make paper and loo roll were replaced by planting many more.<br><br>That\u2019s as maybe, but here\u2019s my worry. The long fibres for this brand of toilet roll come from eucalyptus pulp shipped from Brazil. They provide the raw material for the sturdy middle section of toilet paper, while the short fibres from Swedish trees provide the material for the soft outer coverings so that your ickle botty doesn\u2019t get splinters. Even if the forests are run along sustainable lines, surely carbon footprint involved in dehydrating pulp, shipping it from two distant nations, then rehydrating it and fashioning it into roll-ups is even more loony than, say, flying beans from Kenya that can be grown here.<br><br>Wouldn\u2019t we do better to install bidets or take the shower head off and point the nozzle where the sun doesn\u2019t shine? Or learn from the ancients? Romans, after all, used sponges on sticks that they stored in jars of vinegar. </p> <p>The truth seems, to me, to be one unexamined by Wallace. Toilet roll is neither necessary nor sufficient for that issue that concerns everyone, maximum anal daintiness. There are cultures who look on Britons\u2019 dependence on toilet paper and despair at our lack of hygiene and concern for the environment. Yes, Britons may use 183,000 miles of toilet paper every day, enough to circle the globe 11 times, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. King Kong conquered New York without wiping his jacksy. Fact.</p>",
  "<p>The Unite union has claimed that British Airways plans to fire the vast majority of its workforce and rehire them on reduced pay and worse terms.</p> <p>BA informed unions last month that it was holding a consultation on as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">many as 12,000 job cuts</a>. The notice under section 188 of the Trade Union Act means workers could be made redundant as soon as 15 June.</p> <p>Relations between the company\u2019s owner, International Airlines Group, and the unions have broken down. BA\u2019s boss, Alex Cruz, wrote a letter to staff on Friday criticising the Unite and the GMB unions for failing to attend consultation meetings to discuss the plans. Balpa, the pilots\u2019 union, had engaged in consultations, the airline said.</p> <p>The unions say they are unable to negotiate with the airline on major job cuts and changes to working conditions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/ba-to-press-ahead-with-job-cuts-plans-despite-furlough-extension-willie-walsh-coronavirus-airline\">while workers are furloughed</a>, as meetings of large groups of people are difficult.</p> <p>Both Unite and GMB are understood to be considering legal action against BA on the basis that a meaningful consultation is impossible during lockdown.</p> <p>Unite\u2019s general secretary, Len McCluskey said: \u201cWe cannot tolerate BA using this crisis as cover to impose a long-term plan to slash jobs, pay and conditions. No other employer has threatened to effectively fire and rehire its entire workforce. Over 40,000 loyal BA staff now face the prospect of losing either their livelihoods or potentially being re-interviewed for their own jobs on vastly reduced terms and conditions.</p> <p>\u201cIf the proposals were about dealing with the Covid crisis, why is the company threatening to terminate contracts, including eliminating disciplinary procedures? This will not help the company get through Covid-19. This is nothing more than a cynical act of corporate greed and a betrayal of the BA workforce and Britain.\u201d</p> <p>McCluskey has written to the IAG board demanding it withdraw the section 188 notice, which the union argues would give more time for meaningful negotiations.</p> <p>The airline says the job cuts are necessary because of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/british-airways-owner-reports-big-loss-coronavirus\">prospect of lower demand</a> for flights for years to come.</p> <p>A BA spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are acting now to protect as many jobs possible. The airline industry is facing the deepest structural change in its history, as well as facing a severely weakened global economy<strong>. </strong>We are committed to consulting openly with our unions and our people as we prepare for a new future.\u201d</p> <p>A GMB official declined to comment.</p>",

Daily EU imports from China amount to \u20ac1bn (\u00a3895m), but economists say there are already signs that some trade is not returning.</p> <p>On issues ranging from supply chains to telecoms security, diversification has become the watchword. Borrell has spoken of his surprise at discovering that all of Europe\u2019s supplies of paracetamol derive from China. The German cabinet has already approved new laws to prevent foreign takeovers of medical companies. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has said \u201csome companies are vulnerable, some technologies are fragile and could be bought by foreign competitors at a low cost. I won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d Sweden\u2019s relations with China are close to breakdown.</p> <p>Andrew Small, an associate senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said Beijing had been able until recently to hide behind EU suspicions of Russia.</p> <p>He wrote: \u201cIt benefited from the contrast that many Europeans drew between China and Russia. In this view, whereas Russia was actively hostile to the EU, China only sought to stymie European unity on a set of narrowly Sinocentric issues; whereas Russia thrived on chaos, China could be relied on as a status quo actor during crises; and whereas Russia pumped out disinformation, targeted European citizens, and sought to bring populists to power, China focused on positive image management and behind-the-scenes elite capture.\u201d</p> <p>China had after all helped Europe\u2019s economic recovery in 2007-8 by buying debts and failing assets after the financial crash. It did not join Russia in becoming part of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit chorus and it avoided support for Russia over Ukraine.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s natural desire to be tougher on China has been held back by revulsion at Trump\u2019s methods and a fear that if Europe jettisoned China altogether, its chief partner would have to be Trump.</p> <p>A key change came in spring 2019 when, frustrated by difficulties accessing the Chinese market and alarmed by the nationalist direction of Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership, the EU labelled China \u201ca systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance\u201d in a landmark strategy paper. Even now it is used in evidence by the US state department for similarities to its own stance.</p> <p>Many factors prompted a change of heart. The expected bonanza from China\u2019s \u201cbelt and road\u201d initiative had by and large failed to materialise as China\u2019s own economy slowed down. \u201cThe period of romantic optimism had come to an end,\u201d said Latvia\u2019s foreign minister, Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds. \u201cFour years ago it was only about the economy, about trade, about the \u2018belt and road\u2019, about more investment. Now, it is more balanced.\u201d Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in particular lobbied for the change, urging Europe to look to Russia for an alliance.</p> <p>But it was not immediately clear how much the 2019 strategy paper would translate at a nation-state level. In the same month it was published, Italy became the first European country to sign a \u201cbelt and road\u201d investment memorandum with China. Many European countries individually gave Huawei the go-ahead to run their 5G networks.</p> <p>Beijing itself wanted to halt the slide in relations, declaring 2020 would be the year of Europe with two large summits and many ceremonial signings. China also continued courting eastern Europe in what has been known as the 17+1 group.</p> <p>Philippe Le Corre, a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says Covid has been \u201cthe game-changer\u201d in finally altering European perceptions of China. \u201cChinese diplomacy backfired. It did not acknowledge the initial help Europe gave to China, perhaps due to the regime being discomforted by foreigners providing help. There were fake videos in Rome of Italians singing the Chinese national anthem. It was very strange.\u201d</p> <p>Small suggested Beijing appeared to have decided to use Europe at a moment of deep internal strain in a broad information battle about the supposed inadequacies of western democracy. \u201cIt was not enough to argue that the Chinese Communist party had succeeded; others had to be seen to fail,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Borrell called China\u2019s \u201cpolitics of generosity\u201d a stunt and the European External Action Service, the EU\u2019s diplomatic arm, swung into action accusing China of running a \u201cglobal disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image\u201d.</p> <p>China\u2019s behaviour has also backfired with European public opinion. A poll published by the K\u00f6rber-Stiftung thinktank showed that 71% of Germans believe \u201cgreater transparency by China would have mitigated the corona epidemic\u201d. A net 68% of Germans said their opinion of the US had deteriorated over the past year, but China\u2019s reputation had also suffered, dropping by a net 11%. In France, an Ifop/Reputation Squad poll conducted at the end of April found only 12% saw China as best placed to meet the challenges of the next decade.</p> <p>The key exception is Italy, but it has long been more sympathetic to China, and opinion appears fluid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/china-raises-us-trade-tensions-with-warning-of-new-cold-war\">China raises US trade tensions with warning of \u2018new cold war\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The question for European politicians now is how to harness this new awareness to resist China, without tumbling into Trump\u2019s cold war. The first step is to compile what is being described as inventory of dependence on China, and investment screening reviews are now under way in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Le Maire has promised \u201cto strengthen our sovereignty in strategic value chains\u201d, such as those of the automotive, aerospace and pharmaceutical industries.</p> <p>The next test is China\u2019s own direction. Veteran officials and advisers are not enamoured by what has been described as China\u2019s \u201cSopranos school of diplomacy\u201d. The Chinese scholar Lanxin Xiang admits he has kicked up quite a bit of dust by arguing it undermines China\u2019s strategic objective of turning the EU into a buffer zone against the US.</p> <p>Similarly Long Yongtu, who negotiated China\u2019s passage to the World Trade Organization in 2001, which led to China\u2019s astonishing economic growth, warned in May that China risked<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3083874/coronavirus-china-risks-being-left-out-new-global-economic\"> </a>isolating itself from a new global economic order. \u201cChina is also an important participant in globalisation, so when somebody begins to talk about \u2018deglobalisation\u2019, of course, we need to be highly wary of that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But with Trump seeking to rally the G7 \u2013 and specifically European powers \u2013 against China, using the fate of Hong Kong as his cause, China may find it is too late to get Europe to turn back.</p>",

Under Germany\u2019s federalist system, the 16 regional states have far more leeway to set policy than in more centrally governed countries such as Britain and France.</p> \n<p>Officials fear muddying the message could undermine public discipline. \u201cUnder no circumstances should the impression be given that the pandemic is over,\u201d the health minister, Jens Spahn, told Bild newspaper, adding that clear messaging was vital to ensure the virus did not spread faster.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fe25a28ae639b006092a4d8513041f1ed03394a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fe25a28ae639b006092a4d8513041f1ed03394a/0_28_3516_2111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A student tries out a face shield at a school in Cologne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A student tries out a face shield at a school in Cologne.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Meissner/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Shops, bars, restaurants, museums and churches have reopened in Germany, though many people continue to work from home.

  "<p>People from Yorkshire are often stereotyped as being proud of their identity and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/28/buy-nowt-protest-urges-yorkshire-shoppers-to-ignore-black-friday\">careful with money</a>, and a \u201cfirst of its kind\u201d investment fund could be said to tick both boxes \u2013 as it will only put investors\u2019 cash into companies based in the county.</p> <p>There are plenty of investment funds that concentrate on just one country, but the <a href=\"https://mvam.com/mvam-products/yorkshire-t20-portfolios/\">Yorkshire T20 Portfolio</a> goes one step further by having a strict regional focus.

  "<p>Ever since the Bundesliga\u2019s fixture list was released way back in July last year, the timing has looked delicious. For neutrals, the two fixtures that tend to leap out are the confrontations between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. Fans have practically been able to set their watch on the arrival of the return fixture, placed within the span of a week in early April for five of the last seven seasons.</p> \n<p>In 2019-20, the return had a twist. For the first time since 2016, the second match would be played in Dortmund, more significant than it sounds given BVB\u2019s woeful record in Munich in recent years \u2013 six successive Bundesliga losses, with three goals scored and 24 conceded. For Dortmund, another trip to their Allianz Arena field of screams in a potential title run-in would have been a major psychological obstacle.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/24/bundesliga-football-roundup-schalke-augsburg-bayern-dortmund-mainz-leipzig\">Bundesliga roundup: Werner treble fires Leipzig back to third, Schalke crash</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even if circumstance dictates that the white-hot atmosphere of Westfalen \u2013 which in 2013 prompted the recently departed Mario G\u00f6tze to warm up in the tunnel on his return \u2013 Lucien Favre\u2019s side will be grateful for even adjusted home comforts. The scheduling always offered hope for competitive balance, as well as for Dortmund. For everyone else, there is hope of a contest.</p> \n<p>Now, with the Bundesliga the only elite European league back from hiatus, there will be more watching neutrals \u2013 or perhaps not-so-neutrals \u2013 watching on than ever before. Though a crowd-free German domestic game is not the platform its proponents would have dreamed of, the on-pitch balance is almost as enticing as any could have wished for. Four points separate Bayern, chasing an eighth successive title, from Dortmund. A home win would beckon the world further into the closing stages of the Bundesliga season, via a medium familiar to millions of world football fans.</p> \n<p>It was already neatly packaged \u2013 and had been for some time \u2013 as <em>Der Klassiker</em>, the German equivalent of Barcelona taking on Real Madrid. There is not quite the same historical resonance here: Bayern\u2019s decades-long dominance of the league has meant the epithet \u201cKlassiker\u201d has habitually been applied to a face-off between the <em>Rekordmeister</em> and their biggest threat, none of whom has been exactly eternal.</p> \n<p>That the moniker has stuck to Bayern v Dortmund is not just an expression of how successfully the Bundesliga markets itself on the international stage these days, but of how enduring this rivalry has been over the last decade. BVB\u2019s successive titles in 2011 and 2012, prefacing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/25/borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich-champions-league\">2013 Champions League final</a> between the two teams, are responsible not only for the genesis of this rivalry, but for Bayern\u2019s apparent impregnability of the moment.</p> \n<p>The gall of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team in denying Bayern two years in a row, then humiliating them in the 2012 German Cup final in Berlin (which Dortmund won 5-2 with a Robert Lewandowski hat-trick) cajoled and provoked the Bavarians into becoming the most ruthless versions of themselves. The tension has continued to crackle in the meetings since, from the robust meeting between the pair at Signal Iduna Park in May 2013, 20 days before the Champions League final, through the defections of G\u00f6tze, Lewandowski and Mats Hummels.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83a9d208042ab9eb2d1df4cc681d46a12dd01b55\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83a9d208042ab9eb2d1df4cc681d46a12dd01b55/0_0_2084_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Lewandowski scores for Bayern against his former club earlier this season\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Lewandowski scores for Bayern against his former club earlier this season.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boris Streubel/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dortmund would like to believe they are now past the stage where they can be picked off by the Bayern behemoth \u2013 and whatever the optics were to the international stage, they had control over Hummels\u2019 exit to a far greater extent than they did those of G\u00f6tze and Lewandowski. Though their budget is just over half that of the champions, a second straight season as genuine title contenders shows that much has changed since 2013, in expectation as much as image.</p> \n<p>So while Erling Haaland and Jadon Sancho are forging their reputation as world superstars in Dortmund, attracting established stars is also possible. Emre Can has arrived for big money from Juventus and Hummels made the return journey from Bayern in 2018 (the former replaced the latter, who has a sore achilles, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/23/bundesliga-roundup-jadon-sancho-cameo-keeps-dortmunds-hopes-alive\">Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win at Wolfsburg</a>).</p> \n<p>Bayern have evolved too since the rivalry took hold, albeit in a more subtle way. The appointment of Pep Guardiola in 2013 underlined their ambitions to become synonymous with a seductive brand of football rather than simply success. Reassuring constants remain \u2013 not least the outstanding form of Thomas M\u00fcller, again superb in Saturday\u2019s 5-2 defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt \u2013 but a desire to add a cosmopolitan streak to old cliches of German grit is clear. The \u20ac80m (\u00a371.6m) signing of the French defender Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2019 nearly doubled their previous record transfer fee paid \u2013 although the World Cup winner is only on the bench at present.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/10/premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-serie-a-and-ligue-1-top-scorers-2019-20\">Bundesliga, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1 top scorers 2019-20</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>With the world watching, this is Bayern\u2019s chance to shatter the myth outside Germany that their relentless winning football is not entertaining \u2013 and, refocused under Hansi Flick, they are as irresistible as they have been at any point since the end of Guardiola\u2019s reign. At 31, Lewandowski is looking better than ever, and has scored 16 times against his former club since leaving in 2014. At the other end Alphonso Davies, the teenage Canadian winger now established as a rampaging attacking left-back with Flick, adds another dimension.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will have to endure phases in which Bayern will dominate,\u201d said Dortmund\u2019s sporting director, Michael Zorc, on the eve of the game with some understatement. He is well aware that doesn\u2019t preclude his side \u2013 so able on the counterattack, as they have shown since returning to action \u2013 from winning.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include</p> <h2>Japan ends state of emergency</h2> <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe has lifted<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/25/coronavirus-live-news-us-bars-travel-from-brazil-as-british-pms-adviser-reported-to-police-over-lockdown-breach?page=with:block-5ecb913d8f0886ce4f5d9d54#block-5ecb913d8f0886ce4f5d9d54\"> the state of emergency imposed due to the coronavirus crisis</a>. He said on Monday that the country had managed to get the spread of the virus under control in under two months. Social distancing curbs were loosened for most of the country on 14 May as new infections fell, but the government has kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under watch.</p> <h2>Restrictions ease in Madrid and Barcelona</h2> <p>Major parks and cafe terraces reopened in Madrid for the first time in more than two months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/25/coronavirus-live-news-us-bars-travel-from-brazil-as-british-pms-adviser-reported-to-police-over-lockdown-breach?page=with:block-5ecb8dd28f0886ce4f5d9d3a#block-5ecb8dd28f0886ce4f5d9d3a\">as the capital and the surrounding region moved into the second phase of the loosening of lockdown restriction</a>s. The Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of Castilla y Le\u00f3n also joined Madrid in the same phase, which allows groups of up to 10 people to meet as long as they maintain physical distancing. Small shops can also open without prior appointments and places of worship can reopen at 30% capacity.</p> <h2>Germany enters recession in first quarter</h2> <p>Falling consumer spending, capital investments and exports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/25/coronavirus-live-news-us-bars-travel-from-brazil-as-british-pms-adviser-reported-to-police-over-lockdown-breach?page=with:block-5ecb69f58f0864e579f17296#block-5ecb69f58f0864e579f17296\">pushed the German economy into a recession</a> in the first three months of the year, the national statistics office said this morning, as the virus continued to hurt the major economies. Capital investments slumped by 6.9%, private consumption by 3.2% and exports by 3.1% between January and March compared with the last three months of 2019.</p> <h2><strong>Global cases pass 5.4m</strong></h2> <p>There are currently 5,424,718 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University tracker</a>. The death toll stands at 345,296. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting.</p> <h2><strong>China says virus pushing US ties to brink of \u2018Cold War\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said that Washington seemed infected by a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source. \u201cSome political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,\u201d Wang said.

The UK prime minister backed his senior aide at a defiant press conference on Sunday, saying it had been within the rules for Cummings to drive his family 264 miles to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham while his wife was suffering coronavirus symptoms.</p> <h2><strong>Chile\u2019s healthcare system \u2018very close to the limit\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The Chilean president,Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, said on Sunday that the country\u2019s healthcare system is under strain and \u201cvery close to the limit\u201d, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718.</p> <h2><strong>South Africa announces further easing of lockdown</strong></h2> <p>South <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a> will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. \u201cCabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,\u201d he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic.</p>",

And he has found in the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, a kindred spirit who has embraced his role as Trumpism\u2019s number one proselytizer to the world.</p> <p>Pompeo doesn\u2019t wield nearly as much power or have the jurisdiction to inflict damage on as wide a range of issues as the president. He\u2019s not as crass or erratic as Trump, and his Twitter feed seems dedicated more to childish <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/clarissajanlim/mike-pompeo-lisa-simpson-tweet-nancy-pelosi-sotu\">mockery</a> than outright attacks. But when it comes to foreign policy, Pompeo\u2019s penchant for undermining America\u2019s credibility is top-notch.</p> <p>At Pompeo\u2019s recommendation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/steve-linick-state-department-official-investigating-pompeo-is-fired\">Trump fired</a> the state department\u2019s inspector general, who is supposed to be an independent investigator charged with looking into potential wrongdoing inside the department. Steve Linick was just the latest in a <a href=\"https://time.com/5817188/trump-inspectors-general/\">series</a> of inspectors general across the government that Trump had fired in an attempt to hide the misconduct of his administration \u2013 but it also shone a spotlight on how Pompeo has undermined his agency.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/mike-pompeo-investigation-steve-linick-arms-sales-personal-errands\">Watchdog was investigating Pompeo for arms deal and staff misuse before firing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to news reports, Pompeo was being investigated by the inspector general for bypassing Congress and possibly breaking the law in sending weapons to Saudi Arabia, even though his own department and the rest of the US government <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/mike-pompeo-trump-emergency-arms-sales-saudi-arabia-271943\">advised</a> against the decision. He was also supposedly <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/pompeo-s-elite-taxpayer-funded-dinners-raise-new-concerns-n1210746\">organizing</a> fancy dinners \u2013 paid for by taxpayers \u2013 with influential businesspeople and TV personalities that seemed geared more towards supporting Pompeo\u2019s political career than advancing US foreign policy goals. And he was reportedly being <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/17/politics/state-department-inspector-general-pompeo-errands/index.html\">scrutinized</a> for using department personnel to conduct personal business, such as getting dry cleaning and walking his dog.</p> <p>But these revelations merely reaffirm a pattern of activities by Pompeo unbecoming of the nation\u2019s top diplomat. When the House of Representatives was in the process of impeaching Trump over his attempt to extort Ukraine for personal political purposes \u2013 an act that Pompeo was aware of \u2013 Pompeo defended Trump while throwing under the bus career state department officials, like the ousted US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who spoke out. Pompeo has regularly ignored Congress, withholding documents from lawmakers \u2013 including during the Ukraine impeachment investigation \u2013 and refusing to appear for testimony. In 2019, the IG released a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016c-9671-d6fb-a96e-d7ffe9da0000\">report</a> detailing political retaliation against career state department officials being perpetrated by Trump officials. And Pompeo has spent considerable time traveling to Kansas and conducting media interviews there, fueling speculation that he has been using his position to tee up a run for the Senate, a <a href=\"https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/menendez-calls-for-hatch-act-review-into-pompeo-travel-to-kansas\">violation</a> of the Hatch Act.</p> <p>Pompeo is a natural Trumpist. In her fantastic <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/08/26/mike-pompeo-the-secretary-of-trump\">profile</a> of the secretary of state, Susan Glasser notes of his first congressional race: \u201cPompeo ran a nasty race against the Democrat, an Indian-American state legislator named Raj Goyle, who, unlike Pompeo, had grown up in Wichita. Pompeo\u2019s campaign tweeted praise for an article calling Goyle a \u2018turban topper\u2019, and a supporter bought billboards urging residents to \u2018Vote American \u2013 Vote Pompeo\u2019.\u201d Later, as a member of Congress, Pompeo made a name for himself by helping to fabricate the Benghazi conspiracy theories that shamelessly used the memory of a deceased foreign service officer to undermine the state department.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b193baf173dcf57b7ea496d7ed325d7f248c4c11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b193baf173dcf57b7ea496d7ed325d7f248c4c11/0_95_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pompeo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Trump is undermining American leadership in incalculable ways, and Pompeo has weaponized the state department on the president\u2019s behalf.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Next to Trump\u2019s assault on US values, Pompeo\u2019s role as top Trump lackey may seem insignificant. But the secretary of state is often the most senior US official that other countries and publics hear from on any number of issues. Even with Trump in the Oval Office, a secretary of state that was committed to the constitution - not Trump - would at least be able to fight for the values that US foreign policy should embody, and shield the department\u2019s day-to-day business from Trump\u2019s outbursts. The work that department professionals conduct around the world \u2013 helping American citizens abroad get home in the early days of the pandemic or coordinating assistance to other countries to cope with the coronavirus \u2013 is vital to American national security, and at the core of the image that America projects abroad.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump is undermining American leadership in incalculable ways, and Pompeo has weaponized the state department on his behalf</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The world today needs principled and active US leadership as much as ever. In a normal world, the US secretary of state would be working through international organizations like the WHO to lead the response to the coronavirus, not threatening to withdraw from the global body. The secretary would be pushing for robust foreign assistance to help other countries fight the pandemic, not <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/who-worries-trump-pulling-us-funds-may-hurt-emergency-program-meant-to-help-fragile-countries.html\">cutting</a> funding. They would be trying to find a path that balances working with China on responding to the pandemic with pushing back on the Chinese Communist party\u2019s disturbing behavior \u2013 like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/world/asia/hong-kong-china.html\">signaling</a> it may end Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy \u2013 instead of scapegoating China.</p> <p>But Trump is undermining American leadership in incalculable ways, and Pompeo has weaponized the state department on the president\u2019s behalf. Like Trump, Pompeo\u2019s behavior is sending signals to other countries that the US government is acting more like the autocratic and corrupt regimes that Pompeo so regularly calls out. As Trump hurls daily attacks on the media, Pompeo has taken to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/968bb9a73fde1ce0c083df55fafe72c1\">berating</a> journalists. These assaults by America\u2019s leaders on the free press are giving <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/blogs/on-media/2018/07/donald-trump-fake-news-rhetoric-crops-up-around-the-globe-media-social-media-foreign-affairs/\">cover</a> to dictators around the world to criticize their countries\u2019 media. Firing government watchdogs who are investigating top officials is exactly the kind of behavior that the United States would normally criticize in its annual human rights reports.</p> <p>The fish, they say, rots from the head. And Pompeo, like his boss, is actively undermining the values embodied by the state department, its professionals and the Americans they represent.</p>",

  "<p>While nobody knows anything for certain, all signs are pointing to the NBA at least attempting to resume its season \u2013 which was suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 possibly as soon as July. One of the biggest questions the league will have to answer is where the teams will actually play. It turns out the answer may involve the Magic Kingdom. Yes, the NBA has set its sights on Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, something which probably raises quite a few questions among sports fans.</p> <h2><strong>What, </strong><em>the</em><strong> Walt Disney World? The one with Mickey Mouse and Space Mountain?</strong></h2> <p>The one and the same. On ESPN\u2019s First Take, Los Angeles Lakers guard Danny Green confirmed reports that the league was seriously looking into playing games at Disney World. \u201cIt looks like we have multiple options for locations, but I think leaning toward Orlando and Disney to where it\u2019s the safest,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2020/05/21/lakers-danny-green-says-nba-is-leaning-toward-restarting-season-at-walt-disney-world-in-orlando/#169e41a66030\">Green said</a>. </p> <p>Soon afterwards, the NBA released <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29213517/nba-talks-resume-play-disney-espn-wide-world-sports-complex\">an announcement</a> through spokesperson Mike Bass: \u201cThe NBA, in conjunction with the National Basketball Players Association, is engaged in exploratory conversations with The Walt Disney Company about restarting the 2019-20 NBA season in late July at Disney\u2019s ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Florida as a single site for an NBA campus for games, practices and housing.\u201d</p> <h2>Does the plan make any sense?</h2> <p>Oddly, yes. If the NBA were to restart the season, they would want to limit the number of people involved. The ideal spot would be a controlled, centralized environment in order to lower the risk of outside infection. As the NBA\u2019s announcement notes, Disney World would provide its own housing accommodation for players and staff in the form of hotels, as well as basketball courts that could handle both practices and official games.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/24/michael-jordan-was-years-ahead-of-his-game-the-last-dance-showed-that-he-still-is\">Michael Jordan was years ahead of his game. The Last Dance showed that he still is</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s hard to imagine a place more controlled than Disney World, especially since it\u2019s owned by a private entity. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the teams would be situated in Florida, which seems to be <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/21/860575502/florida-theme-parks-getting-ready-to-reopen-with-anti-coronavirus-measures\">determined to reopen</a> at a quicker pace than most other states in the US. (Whether or not this <a href=\"https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/2020/05/21/coronavirus-florida-records-1204-new-cases-as-officials-press-on-with-reopening-plans/\">is especially wise</a> is another question altogether.)</p> <h2>How did the idea first come about?</h2> <p>It was first raised a few weeks ago by Yahoo Sports writer Keith Smith, who wrote <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/why-walt-disney-world-would-be-the-ideal-spot-for-the-nba-to-salvage-its-season-142557713.html\">an extended piece</a> (which bordered on an advertisement, at times) about how Disney World would be the perfect place for the NBA season to resume. It seemed, on paper, to be a ludicrous idea \u2013 and some noted Smith is a former Walt Disney World employee. But unconventional problems call for unconventional solutions, and Smith\u2019s idea promptly gained traction within the league itself.</p> <h2>How exactly would this work?</h2> <p>Let\u2019s make this clear: players won\u2019t be shooting hoops among the rollercoasters. In <a href=\"https://www.orlandopinstripedpost.com/2020/5/21/21266496/nba-disney-world-keith-smith-orlando-magic\">an interview with SB Nation</a>, Smith made a strong case that it wouldn\u2019t take much to convert pre-existing spaces into basketball courts. \u201c[The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex] has three primary indoor facilities that would be the hub of this,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI assume two would be set up for games. The third is a giant, customization space. I think they lay out courts in there for practices and possibly shootarounds \u2026 if necessary, Disney could convert some of their own convention space into practice areas.\u201d</p> <h2>Would playing at Disney World cheapen the 2019-20 season?</h2> <p>For some, sure. For starters, it isn\u2019t yet known whether the league could make up all of the regular season games that have yet to be played. Even if all goes to plan, we could end up with a shortened season. In fact, the league could decide it would make more sense <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/05/23/this-nba-playoff-idea-could-leave-knicks-nets-in-trouble/\">to skip right to the postseason</a>.</p> <p>Also, having all the games take place in one location would render home-court advantage essentially meaningless. Even in the best-case scenario, a NBA champion crowned at Disney World would probably \u201cfeel\u201d different for many fans. One doubts that the NBA itself is too concerned that people won\u2019t take the remainder of this season seriously \u2013 it\u2019s not like the league has had any issues associating its brand with animated characters <a href=\"https://www.spacejam.com/\">in the past</a>.</p> <h2>What would be the biggest drawbacks?</h2> <p>They would be the same drawbacks as trying to continue the NBA season anywhere. Any plan will require frequent testing for Covid-19, not just of the players but of the other NBA and Disney World employees who would be in regular contact with them. Obviously, anyone testing positive would have to be immediately quarantined and, should the number of positive tests get out of hand, the league would probably be forced to shut down for a second time. If that happens, it could very well be the end of the season.</p> <p>Right now <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2020/5/20/21264742/nba-coronavirus-testing-covid-19\">the league is having discussions</a> with coronavirus testing providers. This leads us to another problem: NBA commissioner Adam Silver has made it clear that the season won\u2019t resume until there are <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29151422/some-nba-teams-allowed-test-asymptomatic-players-staff-coronavirus\">enough tests for the rest of the country</a>. Will we be there by July? That\u2019s impossible to say right now.</p> <p>Then, of course, there\u2019s the worst-case scenario: let\u2019s assume the season starts up again and, as a direct result, somebody gets infected and suffers life-altering health effects or dies. What if there are multiple coronavirus-related deaths because of the resumption? It\u2019s something that will weigh on the minds of those deciding whether to play in the middle of a pandemic. Is the NBA so eager to crown a champion for the that it is willing to risk a tragedy at the so-called Happiest Place on Earth? The answer is starting to look more and more like \u201cyes\u201d.</p>",

Another 3,000 are currently planned.</p> <p>African Masks, as they are dubbed, rely on networks of local tailors and volunteers working to an approved pattern. Each mask has two layers of bright African textiles and a pocket for a disposable filter. In Kenya, the masks are made by fashion house Tenge Vuli; in Nigeria, Senegal and the DRC by local tailors.</p> <p>Serralta had a number of contacts to call on when trying to find local partners for the venture, she says, from women\u2019s groups to human rights defenders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"113fa3842b66db4c617c3fbc3be0baf6d16a1ffb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/113fa3842b66db4c617c3fbc3be0baf6d16a1ffb/0_38_1278_787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Masks being distributed in Goma.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Face masks being distributed in Goma, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Goma Actif/AfricanMasks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The venture has contributed to the local economies at a time of major upheaval. \u201cThe tailors have been very grateful for the work because at the moment with the lockdown it\u2019s really challenging,\u201d says Serralta.</p> <p>\u201cIn Kenya, the project has helped employ people for nearly a month when otherwise they\u2019d have had very little or no work.

Making masks was an attempt to protect people and their communities.\u201d</p> <p>Distribution has been left entirely up to the local partners, says Serralta, who chose the recipients on a needs basis. In Kenya, the masks were given to stallholders at a market which had seen two cases; in the DRC, volunteers handed out masks to minibus and taxi drivers.</p> <p>\u201cThis really is a project of international solidarity,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe initiative in terms of fundraising came from me, but the initiative to do something about Covid came from all the people on the ground. They didn\u2019t wait for the government to act, they stepped in and stepped up right from the start.

  "<p>Two-and-a-half months after the last race in Great Britain before lockdown, racing is on course to resume at Newcastle next Monday, when jockeys will become the first professionals in a major British sport to go public since mid-March.</p> <p>Everything about the experience will be strange and unsettling, from temperature checks on arrival to physical distancing in the weighing room and stalls handlers wearing face masks. So how will riders respond to the physical and mental demands of going back to work on 1 June?</p> <p>The latest document from the British Horseracing Authority setting out the procedures to be followed if racing returns next week includes dozens of new rules and requirements to keep the sport running without allowing any spread of Covid-19. Trainers have been asked not to enter \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cfractious\u201d horses, which should make a rider\u2019s job a little easier, but every part of the race-day experience bar the leg-up into the saddle will take place under physical distancing measures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/24/senior-bha-official-incredibly-confident-of-racing-return-on-1-june\">Senior BHA official 'incredibly confident' of racing return on 1 June</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Michael Caulfield spent 15 years as chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association before <a href=\"https://www.justcaulfield.com/\">launching a second career</a> as one of Britain\u2019s leading sports psychologists working with players and coaches in football, cricket and rugby, and even he is not entirely sure how riders will react.</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cBut as they are jockeys, they will want to go and get back to work, because they are self-employed sole traders. Will they return in the best physical nick of their lives? I doubt it, but no other athlete will either, and the one thing with jockeys will always be that they want to get their weight right, as the weights [carried in races] are not going to go up by two stone overnight.</p> <p>\u201cBut one thing that people in racing do really well is to learn to understand and accept risk. If you work in racing, on the coalface side of it, it\u2019s a job with an element of risk and danger, which is one of the reasons that you do it in the first place. It keeps you on your toes, that\u2019s the whole point of it. So I could be wrong, and three jockeys might come out tomorrow and say they don\u2019t want to go to Newcastle or Ascot, but in the main, they\u2019ll want to be back at work.\u201d</p> <p>Since racing is not a contact sport and the horses are the principal athletes, the BHA is confident it will be possible to return to action while adhering strictly to physical distancing guidelines. The Hong Kong, Australia and Japan tracks, and a handful in the United States, have continued to race behind closed doors throughout the pandemic with distancing in place, though the British rider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/09/talking-horses-tom-marquand-seeks-another-big-day-in-australia\" title=\"\">Tom Marquand</a> was fined A$2,000 (around \u00a31,050) last month for hugging his horse\u2019s groom after a big-race win.</p> <p>Riders will also be urged \u201cto avoid taking unnecessary or avoidable risks\u201d, while their equipment will be disinfected on arrival as part of a racecourse-wide effort to eliminate the risk of any spread of coronavirus. <br>\u201cThe point about racing is that jockeys do the risk and racing does viruses and biosecurity,\u201d Caulfield says. \u201cIn racing yards, the tack rooms and feed rooms are spotless. You don\u2019t share tack any more, you don\u2019t share brushes, you don\u2019t share anything.</p> <p>\u201cRacing is used to biosecurity because viruses have been affecting racehorses for decades, it\u2019s something we do and we do it well. So jockeys will understand how it works, it won\u2019t be a shock to them and they will adapt.\u201d</p> <p>Caulfield will host an online conference for 360 leaders in sport this week and believes sport will be an essential part of the national process of recovery after coronavirus, for professionals and amateurs alike. \u201cGetting people back out there in a safe environment is the best thing we can do for people\u2019s mental health,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI believe in health and activity and the joy and power or sport. We should be doing everything we can to get it back, and that includes racing, not so that people can make money and get Sky contracts back, but so that people can go on park runs and be healthy.</p> <p>\u201cSport keeps you active and it keeps you outdoors and it keeps you connecting with people.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Photographer Sandrine Joseph fell in love with this fallen elm tree on one of her daily walks around Hampstead Heath in north London. She was captivated by how much it looks like the figure of a woman. \u201cIt was winter when I took the picture. The light was perfect, there was no one around and I didn\u2019t have to shoot many pictures to get the perfect shot,\u201d she says. \u201cThe tree is dead but at the same time it feels timeless. It makes me think of petrified wood.\u201d She decided to name the photo Lying because \u201cit looks like a woman\u2019s body lying and at the same time it is a lie\u201d.</p> <p>Sandrine, 53, passes the tree roughly once a week depending on the route she takes through the heath. She often sees people sitting on it or walking or jogging past the tree without paying it any attention. She would love it if visitors would walk through the heath as if they were at an exhibition or a gallery. \u201cThe tree is an amazing sculpture created by nature, which reminded me of Man Ray\u2019s reclining model in <a href=\"https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/man-ray-1890-1976-primat-de-la-5733970-details.aspx\">Primat de la Mati\u00e8re sur la Pens\u00e9e</a><strong>.</strong> There\u2019s a melancholy about it, like an ancient statue forgotten in the middle of the woods.\u201d</p> <p>All of Sandrine\u2019s art revolves around trees and she has a <a href=\"https://www.sand-jo.com/\">website</a> dedicated to Hampstead Heath, showing the hidden beauty she finds within trees. She has included the image of the fallen elm in a series called Mother Nature alongside other pictures of trees that look like women\u2019s bodies. All trees are \u201cgenuine masterpieces\u201d to her and she is constantly inspired by how they change during the year. As well as taking photos, she likes to write poems and stories about nature. \u201cI know almost all of the trees on the heath. I\u2019ve got other favourites, some more hidden, others more obvious.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/02/trees-have-rights-too-robert-macfarlane-on-the-new-laws-of-nature\">Should this tree have the same rights as you?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sandrine was born in Paris and moved to Hampstead with her husband and son in 2005. She visited the area for the first time in 2000. \u201cWhen I discovered Hampstead Heath, I felt like I belonged there,\u201d she says. Ever since she was a child, Sandrine has enjoyed being around trees. \u201cI feel this connection in my heart and my brain.\u201d</p> <p>Between 2016 and 2018, Sandrine and her family lived in Brooklyn.

We are very lucky to have this space.\u201d</p> <p>Sandrine\u2019s love of nature has inspired many of her friends to take pictures of interesting trees when they go on holiday. In Paris, her friends can\u2019t go to any parks during lockdown because they are closed. They look forward to her daily posts from Hampstead Heath. \u201cFor me, taking photos of trees has become a meditative way to connect people to nature.

  "<p>While Australians have among the highest life expectancy in the world, premature deaths associated with inequality and living in remote and regional areas are contributing to a stagnation in the nation\u2019s overall life expectancy.</p> <p>Researchers from the University of Melbourne analysed de-identified death registration data from the decade to the end of 2016. The data recorded age of death and place of residence, allowing analysts to match it to location remoteness and socioeconomic profile.</p> <p>They found premature deaths between the ages of 35 and 74 occurred in the lowest socioeconomic areas at double the rate of those in the highest. This gap widened by 26% for women and 14% for men. People living in outer regional, remote and very remote areas had premature death rates about 40% higher than those in major cities, and this gap was also increasing, the research published in the peer-reviewed journal, Australian Population Studies, on Monday found.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/12/rural-australia-is-used-to-isolation-but-covid-19-gives-it-a-whole-new-meaning\">Rural Australia is used to isolation, but Covid-19 gives it a whole new meaning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The overall life expectancy for Australia is 80.5 years for men and 84.6 years for women. The study found the highest excess mortality compared with the national average was reported for the Northern Territory, Hobart, outer regional, remote and very remote areas in New South Wales. Notably, death rates between the ages of 35 and 74 among the lowest area socioeconomic quintile and outside of major cities have not fallen since 2011.</p> <p>\u201cEven within major cities, there has been a widening in inequalities in death rates between lower and higher area socioeconomic deciles, but notably no slowdown in the rate of mortality decline in the highest deciles,\u201d the study found.</p> <p>While the research did not examine the cause of death, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data shows that in the lowest socioeconomic areas, smoking prevalence is 2.7 times higher and obesity 1.6 times higher than in the highest socioeconomic ones. Dr Tim Adair, from the University of Melbourne\u2019s Global Burden of Disease Group, said obesity in particular was an issue. While health-promotion campaigns had led to great success in reducing overall smoking rates over time, campaigns were having little effect on rates of obesity, which are increasing Australia-wide.</p> <p>\u201cIn particular it\u2019s getting worse among younger adults, and as they grow older this will become more concerning as they will get to ages where obesity can interact with other health conditions and it may well have a detrimental impact on life expectancy,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He said it was unclear why the premature mortality rates in low socioeconomic areas were higher for women than for men, but he said much of that may be to do with life expectancy for women generally being higher than men.</p> <p>\u201cSo there is an element of men catching up to women as this gap between men and women reduces,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Dr Melissa Stoneham, a research fellow with and former director of the Public Health Advocacy Institute Western Australia, said she was recently in a remote area where a tin of baby formula cost $64. Fresh produce also costs significantly more in rural, regional and remote areas.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders live in remote communities, especially in the Northern Territory and Western Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that their life expectancy is a lot lower than non-Indigenous people. A lot of regional communities are also farming communities, with young people not having same opportunities on farms as they used to and leaving, creating an older age demographic [that are] more prone to diseases and with more difficulty accessing healthcare.\u201d</p> <p>She said a key way to address disadvantage was getting essential services into affected communities.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, getting services into those remote communities is a very expensive to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s true some people choose to live in these communities but it doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be given the opportunity to access the same services.

Kids aren\u2019t going hungry. And when people are less stressed, hungry and poor, domestic violence rates come down and we are seeing that in communities like Katherine in the Northern Territory.\u201d</p> <p>People living in those areas needed not only resources, but hope for the future, to improve their health, she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching television and seeing people going on cruises and travelling and getting good education and you know those things are out of reach for you, why wouldn\u2019t you reach for a smoke?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I have said it before and I\u2019ll say it again \u2013 finding good trash in the age of quality television is HARD. It has to sit firmly in the Goldilocks zone: not too good, not too bad, holding together but never threatening greatness. It\u2019s a small target to hit, and of course, every viewer\u2019s tolerance varies slightly.</p> <p>For the avoidance of doubt \u2013 I mean drama series trash, not daytime TV or fun evening ephemera such as Queer Eye. I mean something with a story that you can still follow while you\u2019re mostly staring at your phone, and characters just above cipher-level in whom you can become marginally invested while you put your phone down, eat your dinner and drink your wine.</p> <p>But good news! Cometh the Covid hour of comfort-watching need, cometh the trash \u2013 this time on a giant armoured train, 1,001 self-sustaining carriages long, unstoppably circling an Earth \u201cfrozen to the core\u201d by attempts to reverse global warming! I know. You\u2019re hooked already, right? And that\u2019s even before you know that this funicular ark was meant to carry only the elite, but was stormed by proles at the last minute before it began its endless journey, who live in dire conditions at the back, reluctantly fed on nutritional jelly slabs by guards and planning rebellion, while the billionaires, beauties and businessmen live upfront in sybaritic luxury. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen \u2013 let me just check your tickets \u2013 to Snowpiercer (Netflix). It should hit the spot for just about everybody.</p> <p>The TV series is based on the original series of graphic novels by Jacque Lob, Jean-Marc Rochette and Benjamin Legrand, and Bong Joon-ho\u2019s 2013 film, which took the novels and stripped them down into a rigorous yet somehow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/20/snowpiercer-first-look-review-edinburgh-2014\">absolutely demented fable about life under capitalism</a>. If you have not already had the pleasure, go and watch it now. We will Zoom-rave about Tilda Swinton\u2019s off-the-chain performance as the train\u2019s nutso overseer \u2013 Margaret Thatcher-as-Jane-Horrocks-by-way-of-Victoria-Wood-and-Maggie-Smith in furs and a set of buck-tooth prosthetics \u2013 when you get back.</p> <p>Snowpiercer the series manages, gloriously, to bypass all that is great and almost all that is good about both of its sources of material, and turn it instead into a police procedural that just happens to be set on the aforementioned giant armoured train. Think of it as steampunk Law &amp; Order. CSI: Wastelands. NYPD Brrr, It\u2019s Cold. Send me a postcard if you want more of these. I\u2019m self-isolating again. I got time.</p> <p>Andre Layton (Daveed Diggs) is one of the stowaways. They are called Tailers because they live in the far end of the train called the Tail and they do that because the budget went on creating the exterior shots of the train plunging through icy wastelands and not on the script, as is trash-right and proper. The Tailers are plotting revolution. Layton is urging caution when he is suddenly summoned Up Front by \u201cvoice of the train\u201d Melanie Cavill (Jennifer Connelly) who is in charge of executing the directives of the revered Mr Wilford \u2013 the godlike, unseen inventor of the train. Layton used to be a homicide cop, and there is a serial killer preying on third-class passengers and threatening the fragile, well, Law &amp; Order, you might say, of the train. Mr Wilford needs him to solve the crime.</p> <p>OK.</p> <p>Layton is the only former homicide cop on the train. The train that has a miniature ocean to supply fresh sea urchins to its paying passengers and full-sized hydroponic cherry trees in one of its 300 agricultural carriages did not install any kind of police presence.</p> <p>OK.</p> <p>Layton\u2019s ex, who chose to leave the Tail five years ago to work in the Night Car \u2013 OK \u2013 is one of the suspects.</p> <p>OK.</p> <p>Layton is now perfectly placed to case the entire train and plan a proper revolution while he solves the murder.</p> <p>OK?</p> <p>OK. I think that\u2019s all you need. There\u2019s a gory fight scene, a near-love interest, a sweet child, some half-hearted gesturing towards class loyalty, trust and treachery, and a twist at the end of the first episode that you probably saw coming before the opening credits. Exposition barrels along faster than the train itself (\u201cJust making a quick stop at Gun on the Mantelpiece Station!\u201d). In short, it\u2019s perfect.

  "<p>If you were in Liverpool in 1982 and had a habit of wandering down Mathew Street, perhaps on your way to Probe record store, you are likely to have seen Courtney Love. She was 17 and living in the city, having been invited there by Teardrop Explodes frontman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jun/27/julian-cope-interview-visionary-state-wild-beast\">Julian Cope</a>. Probe was one of her favourite places to go \u2013 if not to buy records, then to sit outside on the steps, drinking cider with her friend from back home in America, Robin Barbur.</p> <p> A hundred yards from Probe was the site of Eric\u2019s. From 1976 to 1980, Eric\u2019s had hosted everyone from the Ramones to Joy Division. One band formed by the venue\u2019s regulars was Big in Japan with lineups including Jayne Casey (later of Pink Military), Bill Drummond (later of the KLF), Holly Johnson (later of Frankie Goes to Hollywood) and Ian Broudie (later of the Lightning Seeds). \u201cWe were the most damaged children society turned out that year!\u201d recalls Casey. \u201cAnd we just happened to be on stage together.\u201d</p> <p>Love wanted to get close to them, particularly the Teardrop Explodes and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. She later recalled seeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/11/ian-mcculloch-echo-bunnymen-interview\">Ian McCulloch</a> of the Bunnymen \u201cswanning around\u201d the city: \u201cHe used to wear a big thick coat and glasses and hang out with Pete Wylie and mumble.\u201d Wylie, of the band Wah! Heat, also had a big coat. Liverpool winters are cold \u2013 but the coats stayed on at parties and gigs. Love claims she once stole McCulloch\u2019s, but he isn\u2019t so sure: \u201cI think she might have stolen a look rather than actual clothes. But if she did, good luck to her.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c47b9dca68f757a74e4bb553604235addaa1d3a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c47b9dca68f757a74e4bb553604235addaa1d3a3/0_639_2717_2715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Love gravitated closer to him\u2019 \u2026 Julian Cope performs with the Teardrop Explodes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Love gravitated closer to him\u2019 \u2026 Julian Cope performs with the Teardrop Explodes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Rasic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Drummond recalls Love as a \u201cloud-mouthed American punkette\u201d. She <em>was</em> loud, that\u2019s something everyone agrees on. Pete Burns, later of the band Dead or Alive, had a clothes shop at the back of Probe. In his autobiography, Freak Unique, he described how it felt to be assailed by Love: \u201cIt\u2019s like when a baby throws a rattle across the room and screams because it can\u2019t communicate.\u201d</p> <p>Love\u2019s parents, Linda Risi and Hank Harrison, met at a party for Dizzy Gillespie in San Francisco in 1963. \u201cWe were doing tons of acid,\u201d Harrison recalled, \u201cchanging sex partners, and tripping out.\u201d Apparently, he managed the Warlocks in 1965 before they became the Grateful Dead. Risi, then 19, came from a wealthy family. Love\u2019s grandparents provided her with a trust fund of $500 a month. This paid for the trip to Liverpool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d6c55788c6054e9f93761300e7310ad2a009201\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d6c55788c6054e9f93761300e7310ad2a009201/0_539_679_741/458.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Before Liverpool, my life doesn\u2019t count\u2019 \u2026 Love in Sefton Park.\" width=\"458\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Before Liverpool, my life doesn\u2019t count\u2019 \u2026 Love in Sefton Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin D Bradbury</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 9 July 1964, Risi gave birth to Love Michelle Harrison \u2013 later known as Courtney. But Risi and Harrison fought and, after they divorced in 1970, a custody battle ensued. Risi and one of Harrison\u2019s girlfriends testified that he had given his daughter LSD when she was four.</p> <p>By the end of 1973, Risi had moved to New Zealand, leaving Love behind. She was just eight. Risi then invited her daughter over, where she spent a term at Nelson College for Girls before returning to California. Love finally ended up in an institution for wayward teenagers, after being caught shoplifting. By the time she was 17, she had decided to leave behind her unhappy San Francisco childhood and, in 1981, set off for Ireland. She moved into a squat in Dublin and started hanging out at <a href=\"https://medium.com/@NickCD/mcgonagles-dublin-an-icon-of-a-gloriously-shabby-golden-age-cb19794f889e\">music venue McGonagles</a>, where she collided with the post-punk Liverpool scene.</p> <p>The Teardrop Explodes played Dublin in December. According to Bernie Connor, who was mates with Cope and sold T-shirts on the tour, Love passed the monitor engineer a note for Julian. \u201cAre you married?\u201d it said. \u201cSo Courtney comes back to the hotel,\u201d continues Connor, \u201cattaches herself, and gravitates a little closer to Julian with every passing minute.\u201d</p> <p>Cope gave Love and Barbur his Liverpool address and said they could stay, neglecting to mention he wouldn\u2019t be there. They soon moved in to a \u201chorrible\u201d flat in Princes Avenue.Love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/nov/12/biography.music\">recorded it all in her diary</a>, from the \u201ctextured tawny-beige-green and brown-silver and white-old-human wallpaper\u201d to \u201cswirlfudgesludgepatterned earth tones carpet\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ad0477b68ab92c569c1dd6e4d9868b7e47c6d85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ad0477b68ab92c569c1dd6e4d9868b7e47c6d85/0_164_4961_2977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The right place at the right time \u2026 Liverpool\u2019s Albert Dock was redeveloped in 1982.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Right place, right time \u2026 Liverpool\u2019s Albert Dock was redeveloped in 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It possibly didn\u2019t feel like it, as they sat in their coats in a cold, dimly lit flat on the edge of Toxteth, but Love and Barbur were in the right place at the right time. In April 1982, John Peel broadcast a Radio 1 show live from Liverpool. The week-long extravaganza fuelled and celebrated the scene that so thrilled the girls. It was a time of energy and ambition, with bitchiness galore.</p> <p>While the sharp-tongued Burns was often at the centre of the acrimony, one feud \u2013 between Cope and McCulloch \u2013 has had a staggering shelf life. The pair haven\u2019t had a good thing to say about each other in the four decades since. In Liverpool, making music and making enemies went hand in hand \u2013 a lesson that would stand Love in good stead.</p> <p>David Balfe at Liverpool label Zoo was keen to launch a female version of Soft Cell, so he lent her a synth and a four-track recorder. She didn\u2019t know how to use them, but his enthusiasm galvanised her. As for the compositions, it seems her sludge-coloured flat came in handy. \u201cI went on about porridge,\u201d she recalled, \u201cbecause all we had was porridge.\u201d While she describes the songs as \u201cstupid\u201d, they at least reflected her life in Liverpool. One of the first numbers was an ode to Cope, with a chorus beginning: \u201cJulian, Julian, where have you been?\u201d</p> <p>Love once once said: \u201cBefore Liverpool, my life doesn\u2019t count.

I don\u2019t want to be a bitch, but maybe by this point she\u2019d got a little famous and he\u2019d got a little bit bitter. He hadn\u2019t seen her since she was 17, 18. He probably saw this bratty, obnoxious girl was now a superstar pretty much, and thought, \u2018Damn her.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. She really adored Julian.\u201d</p> <p>Love wrote to Cope and said that his ad had made her violently ill: \u201cImagine that it\u2019s 1983, 82, 81 and 80, you\u2019re a teenage piece of white trash and not even remotely decorative, but you love the great rock dream and it\u2019s all you\u2019ve got \u2026 And you buy a guitar and it burns like a coal in your hand and you feel some power and for once it isn\u2019t the power of being made fun of or picked on, it\u2019s [\u2026] the power to change the fucking world.\u201d</p> <p>I suggest to Connor that if Love had been a bloke with handfuls of drugs, bowling through life all mouthy and opinionated, then she\u2019d have been treated like some hero from a Kerouac novel. \u201cUndoubtedly.

At the airport, she wrote in her diary: \u201cI can play music and understand technology. I can stay in and resist the temptation to make the first move, or stay too long or worse get intense.

  "<p>The first two doctors to die of Covid-19 on the NHS frontline were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52152375\">born in Sudan</a>. In the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, there is a loan shark. Until last week, junior doctors with job offers in the UK represented a reliable income stream for him. The work visas they needed came with a host of conditions, but meeting those criteria counted for nothing unless they paid, upfront, an immigration health surcharge of \u00a3400 a year for every year of their work permit, duplicated for every member of their family if they had one.</p> <p>Being recent graduates, most applicants had only pennies to their name. So the loan shark thrived, demanding an interest payment in advance, before personally entering his credit card details into the online application form.</p> <p>His business may now be in trouble. On Thursday, the British government gave in to mounting pressure and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">exempted migrant NHS staff</a> from the surcharge. This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/a-timeline-of-the-pms-u-turn-on-the-nhs-surcharge-a-timeline-of-pms-u-turn-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">wasn\u2019t an easily won concession</a>. Cancelling the surcharge before the anger had reached its own backbenches could have been an early and obvious win. But that\u2019s not how this government, or its Home Office, works.</p> <p>The surcharge is (not was, as it is still paid by non-NHS migrants, many on low incomes and with few public advocates) not only outrageously costly, it is also immoral. Migrants pay taxes and national insurance contributions. Subjecting them to an additional charge to use an NHS they have already contributed to amounts to exploitation.</p> <p>The fact that the government will not offer an exemption for people on low incomes, or deviate from its demand to pay in one lump sum, is a familiar feature of Home Office fee design. The policy is to put immigrants on the spot and extract as much as possible from them. On the other side of these fees there are jobs, training opportunities, university offers, spouses, partners and other loved ones to join. If you\u2019re in the country already, the downside of failing to pay such fees renders them close to extortion. Refusing to stump up means having to take your life apart and leaving the country. What\u2019ll it be: your money or your life?</p> <p>I and many friends and family members have often had to make these kinds of decisions over the years. In the middle of a long, chaotic and insulting immigration experience you put your dignity, mental health and financial stability on the one hand; and the intricate, rich life you have built in this country on the other. The scales just about balance. This is what the government bets on.</p> <p>As a result, it has built an immigration system that is geared not towards what is fair, but what it can get away with. And that is a lot. If one looks back over the last decade, two policies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/01/perfect-storm-austerity-behind-130000-deaths-uk-ippr-report\">austerity</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">the hostile environment</a>, have defined the Conservative political agenda. The party not only managed to drive them through undiluted, it also spun these policies\u2019 failures, to achieve prosperity or a reduction in immigration numbers, as success.</p> <p>It is no surprise then that it took such a fight to convince the government to exempt NHS staff from the surcharge even as they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/foreign-nhs-workers-coronavirus-frontline-nhs-surcharge\">fighting a pandemic</a>. Its commitment to the policy was never about money: numbers suggests that NHS staff contributions only bring in a measly \u00a335m a year (not Boris Johnson\u2019s deliberately inflated number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/20/we-feel-insulted-migrant-health-workers-react-boris-johnson-refusal-to-scrap-nhs-surcharge\">almost a billion</a>).</p> <p>The Tory party\u2019s own MPs and peers condemned it. Politically, the surcharge put the government to the right of Ukip and at odds with the Daily Mail. But a habit forged over a decade is hard to quit overnight. The political software of nimble review and reform does not exist in the Home Office. In fact, it is inimical to the smooth running of the hostile environment, which is a complex policy infrastructure that is built for inflexibility. Combine that with this new government\u2019s rapid centralisation, fondness for unsubtle apparatchiks like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/priti-patel-says-sorry-if-people-feel-there-have-been-failings-over-ppe\">Priti Patel</a>, disdain for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/01/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-whitehall-democracy-civil-servants\">civil service</a>, plus a dash of incompetence, and you end up with an administration that responds to nothing but public shaming.</p> <p>Increasingly, the only way to get the Conservatives to ditch unethical policies is to provoke national outrage. The victims of the policies have to suffer, and then drag their pain and anger into the public realm and petition for mercy. Whether it is the suspension of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/windrush-institutional-racism-hostile-environment\">Windrush deportations</a>, free parking for NHS doctors, extending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/07/foreign-nationals-nhs-indefinite-leave-remain-coronavirus-covid-19\">indefinite leave to remain</a> to the families of all NHS staff, or this latest concession, the government only changed course when it became too embarrassing not to. There is no moral compass, no sense of responsibility over lives in its care, just a cynical cost-benefit analysis of which policies are worth the harassment in the media and at the dispatch box and which are not.</p> <p>But we get them to move. One win at a time. It does mean, though, that we can only focus on one injustice at a time. The NHS surcharge may have saved junior doctors from a loan shark in Khartoum. But with every victory a question hangs: what about the others trapped in the latticework of the government\u2019s meanness and incompetence, suffering in ways that will probably never come to light?</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p><strong><br></strong>Kyaw Thu* waited until night fell before taking his family to the bank of a river not far from their village. While millions across the world were told to remain at home to stay safe from the coronavirus pandemic, he and his neighbours were forced to flee.</p> <p>That night in March, he recalls, residents from Tin Ma village, in Rakhine state, clambered anxiously into boats, crossed the river, then trekked through foothills to seek refuge in the relative safety of a nearby town. No one switched on a torch or even lit a cigarette for fear of drawing the attention of Myanmar\u2019s army.</p> <p>It is less than three years since the Myanmar military\u2019s violent crackdown on <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/rohingya\">Rohingya</a> Muslim communities in Rakhine state, a campaign of violence that has since led to a genocide case in the UN\u2019s highest court.</p> <p>Now the army is once again <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25838&amp;LangID=E\">accused of committing war crimes</a> against its own people. The tactics are familiar, but the primary targets this time are Rakhine Buddhists such as Kyaw Thu, as well as Rohingya, Mro, Daignet and Chin communities.</p> <p>Despite sharing a faith with Myanmar\u2019s rulers, Rakhine Buddhists have long complained of persecution, and say the development of their state has been stifled by the central government. Repression has now, they say, escalated into violent atrocities.</p> <p>For more than a year, a long-simmering conflict has escalated between the military and the Arakan army, a rebel group drawn from Rakhine state\u2019s Buddhist majority, that says it is fighting for greater autonomy. </p> <p>Yanghee Lee, who recently stood down as the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said the military is increasingly targeting civilians, using tactics reminiscent of the 2017 assault against Rohingya that caused global outrage: homes have been burned, civilians detained and disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cI think the international community should be really scared of what might happen,\u201d said Lee, who urged the UN and its member states to act.</p> <p>Seven residents from Tin Ma - one of the villages allegedly targeted - told the Guardian the Myanmar army entered their village in February and March. Soldiers harassed locals and fired indiscriminately, according to the residents. Ostensibly they were seeking rebel fighters.</p> <p>A mother said the soldiers would interrogate residents about whether they had seen the Arakan army: \u201cI said: \u2018No, I have never seen the Arakan army\u2019, and they would say, \u2018Where is your husband?\u2019\u201d </p> <p>The troops would return several times, going door-to-door, demanding that families hand over anything they owned - from solar panels and batteries to chickens. Later, they say, homes were torched.</p> <p>Whenever the army came to the village, the mother would grab her son and take him to a hidden shelter to escape harassment or firing.</p> <p>\u201cHe cried, and I was afraid his cries would be heard by the soldiers,\u201d she said. On one occasion, the village was also hit in an aerial attack.</p> <p>On 16 March, according to multiple testimonies, soldiers began rounding up dozens of men. Aung Lay*, a resident, said he was tied, blindfolded and told that if he attempted to escape, he would be shot. When he was released he went to hide in the bushes, only to discover the body of another man who had been detained.</p> <p>Kyaw Thu said he lay almost entirely submerged in a river for hours as the roundups were happening, along with dozens of people who feared they would be taken. \u201c[Our] lips went black, we were trembling in the water. It was like hell,\u201d he said. He left the village the following day. Up to 10 people remain missing.</p> <p>After the residents fled, homes were allegedly torched. Two residents who returned to watch over the village said they witnessed soldiers deliberately burning homes on 22 and 23 March.</p> <p>Villagers who spoke to the Guardian did so on the condition of anonymity. It is not possible to verify their accounts: there is a virtual ban on foreign media in Rakhine state, local journalists face harassment, and the internet has been blocked in some areas for almost a year, hampering the documentation of abuses.</p> <p>However, satellite imagery provided by Planet Labs Inc and analysed by Human Rights Watch confirms about 140 buildings were affected by fire in Tin Ma, probably on the dates described.</p> <p>Further analysis confirms about 180 buildings were affected by fire in another village, Pyaing Taing, also in Kyauktaw township, also likely in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d233fc128eb58b89200da25e42d9b50b52eea0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d233fc128eb58b89200da25e42d9b50b52eea0a/0_0_4961_3508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite image recorded on May 14, 2020 showing approximately 140 buildings affected by fire in Tin Ma, Rakhine State that likely occurred between March 22 and 23, 2020.

  "<p>For more than a decade, Australia has faced a seemingly impossible choice: whether to strengthen ties with its closest ally, the United States, or with its largest trading partner, China.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 which has highlighted the dangers posed by both Donald Trump\u2019s nativism and Xi Jinping\u2019s authoritarianism \u2013 is forcing Australia to confront a new option: choose neither.</p> <p>Trump is not interested in leading the world out of this crisis. Unlike his predecessors, he does not try to exercise global influence by asserting control over international agencies; instead, convinced that such bodies undermine the US\u2019s authority, he tries to ruin them.</p> <p>This approach was on display last week, when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/global-report-trump-threatens-to-pull-out-of-who-over-failed-response-to-pandemic\">threatened to stop funding the World Health Organization </a>within 30 days if it does not agree to unspecified reforms.</p> <p>But the pandemic has also demonstrated the threat to global order posed by Xi\u2019s China, the world\u2019s other great power.</p> <p>The cover-up of the initial outbreak in Wuhan and the unreliability of information released by Beijing have demonstrated that it is not just China\u2019s residents \u2013 particularly its ethnic minorities \u2013 who will suffer the consequences of Xi\u2019s increasingly repressive, secretive rule.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/in-a-testy-post-covid-19-world-chinese-sanctions-of-australian-goods-may-be-closer-than-ever\">In a testy post-Covid-19 world, Chinese sanctions of Australian goods may be closer than ever | Richard McGregor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This leaves Australia in uncomfortable and unfamiliar territory. It has committed troops to each of the US\u2019s major conflicts since the second world war to prove its worth as a security ally, but Washington is adding to the instability that the alliance was designed to prevent.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s economy has become one of the most dependent on China in the developed world. Today, relying on these two great powers as sources of security and prosperity seems increasingly risky. Australia will frequently need to find new partners, or act alone.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the recent response by prime minister Scott Morrison and foreign minister Marise Payne to this predicament \u2013 their push for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19 \u2013 was a mishandled mess.</p> <p>It not only raises concerns about whether Canberra can competently deal with its emerging diplomatic challenge but \u2013 as Australia now faces a trade backlash from China \u2013 it also shows the potential costs of failure.</p> <p>The call for the inquiry was announced by Payne last month in an interview on ABC\u2019s Insiders in which she appeared to blame China and the World Health Organization \u2013 a position that seemed to echo the White House\u2019s increasingly strident rhetoric. But it quickly emerged that Canberra had not tried to rally support for the proposal.</p> <p>This left Australia as a lone voice on the international stage \u2013 a situation that unnecessarily exposed it to Beijing\u2019s fury.</p> <p>Australia, in the past three years, has prided itself on being the first country in the world to introduce comprehensive laws aimed at curbing Chinese foreign interference and was the first country to completely ban Huawei from participating in its 5G network. But this made it harder for Canberra to try to persuade China that it was not the target of an inquiry, and more likely that Beijing would react with venom.</p> <p>To gather backing for the inquiry, Morrison called Trump, who showed support, and European leaders, who were reluctant to proceed while they were in the grip of domestic Covid-19 outbreaks. Morrison and Payne made no apparent attempt to discuss the proposed inquiry with Beijing, but insisted that China must cooperate.</p> <p>Chinese officials and state media reacted furiously, and with typically churlish aggression. China\u2019s ambassador to Australia warned that Chinese consumers may boycott Australian wine and beef \u2013 and, several weeks later, China cut imports from four Australian abattoirs. It has since imposed 80% tariffs on Australian barley, and has reportedly moved to restrict imports of Australian coal.</p> <p>China did not link these moves to the inquiry. It said the beef ban was due to health and safety concerns, the coal restrictions were to support domestic suppliers, and the barley tariffs followed an investigation launched in November 2018 into claims Australia has been deliberately selling the barley cheaply. As is often the case with China, the exact reason for its decisions remain unclear.</p> <p>In the end, Australia dropped its proposal for an inquiry which would be conducted outside the WHO. Instead, it did what it should have done all along \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/australia-wins-international-support-for-independent-coronavirus-inquiry\">worked alongside like-minded nations to win broad support for an inquiry</a>.</p> <p>It backed a European Union resolution for an independent inquiry that will be conducted by the WHO\u2019s oversight committee, which is chaired by Dr Felicity Harvey, a visiting professor at Imperial College London. Unlike Australia, the EU was not subject to Chinese retribution.</p> <p>China eventually became a co-sponsor of the proposal, which was passed unanimously by the WHO\u2019s 194-member governing body. Notably, Xi, unlike Trump, accepted an invitation to appear before the body.</p> <p>Morrison and the cabinet were right to push for an inquiry. Of course, the world needs to understand this pandemic. And countries such as Australia \u2013 which has the world\u2019s 13th-largest economy - should be willing to lead the push for international action.</p> <p>But, in this new global environment of mistrust and disorder, Australia will need to change the way it operates. It will increasingly need to act without counting on US support, particularly as some of Trump\u2019s stances \u2013 especially his tilt towards protectionism \u2013 gain traction in Washington.</p> <p>It will need to take a more active role in bodies such as the WHO, especially as the US turns it back on such agencies and China tries to assume the mantle of leader. But Australia should allow China an opportunity to act in good faith, rather than provide Beijing with a justification for belligerence. And it will need to consult with other partners, which may be wary of moves that goad China.</p> <p>This is not beyond Australia\u2019s leaders or diplomats. But it will require the government to avoid taking positions that unnecessarily stoke US-China tensions or damage ties with Beijing.</p> <p>Nor should its messages be designed to suit domestic audiences, or dropped without warning in a Sunday morning interview.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jonathan Pearlman is editor of <a href=\"https://www.australianforeignaffairs.com/\">Australian Foreign Affairs</a><em> </em>and world editor of The Saturday Paper</p></li> </ul>"
