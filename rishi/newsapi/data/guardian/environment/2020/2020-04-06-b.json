It will decide whether or not we will rise again after Easter,\u201d Kurz said, referring to the resurrection of Jesus, the culmination of the Easter feast, which is widely celebrated in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.</p> \n  <p>From 1 May, all shops, shopping centres and hairdressers will be allowed to open.

They should be used by the whole of the country. Those who don\u2019t have a mobile phone will be required to wear a special key-ring style device, the chancellor said at the weekend.

It is being developed in conjunction with a European app that 130 researchers are developing, and will warn people if they might have had contact with infected persons. Its use is expected to be anonymous and voluntary, although surveys show a large number of Germans are prepared to use it if it leads to a relaxation of lockdown rules. The ultimate aim should be to have a single, Europe-wide tracking app. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIts use should be voluntary, but obviously with the hope that as many people as possible will use it,\u201d Steffen Seibert, spokesman for the German government said this afternoon. \u201cPeople who use it will be doing their significant bit to reduce the spread of the infection and helping measures to fight it.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T13:52:18.409Z\">at 2.52pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8b1a298f08c35a1d11ad59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T12:08:27.447Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Eugen Tomac, a Romanian MEP, has tabled a written question in the European parliament asking what measures the European commission intends to take to forestall the spread of Covid-19 among refugees in the Greek islands. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>Fears are growing that the conditions in which refugees are living on Europe\u2019s borders are ripe for the spread of pandemic disease.

As the EU\u2019s fight to contain the virus continues, nearly 42 000 asylum seekers are living in squalid conditions in hotspots on the Greek islands. This is likely to lead to an outbreak. Hence, can the Commission answer the following questions:</p> \n   <p>1. How does it intend to ensure the right to health in the refugee camps is respected?</p> \n   <p>2. What measures have been taken to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak within the overcrowded camps?</p> \n   <p>3.

A spokeswoman said the move was a precaution in case the prime minister needs ventilation.</p> <p>Johnson was admitted to hospital on Sunday, with officials saying the symptoms of coronavirus from which he has been suffering were persisting.</p> <h2>Known global cases pass 1.3 million</h2> <p>According to Johns Hopkins University, 1,337,749 people around the world are known to have been infected, while at least 73,917 have died. The scale of the outbreak is likely to be greater as some countries are suspected of underreporting their figures.

Now, however, the economic emergency will not be resolved until the health emergency is effectively addressed: the health emergency will not end simply by conquering the disease in one country alone, but by ensuring recovery from Covid-19 in all countries.\u201d</p> <p>The letter was signed by, among others, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and John Major, the former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon, financier George Soros and the nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz.</p> <p>The letter said that in addition to the $8bn of emergency health spending, developing countries would need $150bn to fight the twin medical and economic challenges.</p> <p>Both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/25/africa-leads-calls-for-debt-relief-in-face-of-coronavirus-crisis\">IMF and the World Bank</a> have been urging creditor countries to defer interest payments on bilateral poor-country debt this year, saving them $14bn, but the group of 165 leaders said the international community should go further and agree a more generous package, worth $44bn to Africa alone.</p> <p>The IMF and the World Bank will hold spring meetings by teleconference, with finance ministers discussing plans to beef up the financial resources of the two Washington-based organisations.</p> <p>The letter to the G20 said the IMF needed an additional $500-600bn in the form of special drawing rights: a form of international currency that can be used to increase the reserves of member states.

  "<p>Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s arrival as Labour leader is an important moment for British politics. He offers diligence and expertise, not bellowing and finger-pointing. In a crisis this seriousness will be an asset. Sir Keir has unified the party by retaining a tax-and-spend agenda. He also represents a break with the past. There is no resonant phrase, or signature policy, that one can decode to understand the incipient Starmer project. This makes it hard to define what Sir Keir stands for politically. But it is clear what he is not: a populist.</p> <p>Sir Keir\u2019s victory does signal a more competent and less sectarian approach. Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet has room for defeated rivals, with the leftwing Rebecca Long-Bailey getting education.

Making a welcome return to the frontline is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/ed-miliband-returns-to-labour-frontbench-in-keir-starmer-reshuffle\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband</a>, a former party leader and an articulate proponent of the green new deal, who will become shadow business, energy and industrial secretary.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s frontbench is powered by some <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/remainer-mps-tipped-for-jobs-in-keir-starmer-s-shadow-cabinet-1-6595076\" title=\"\">prominent members</a> of the People\u2019s Vote campaign.

Although the 2020 Labour leadership contest stretched out over three long months, the Covid-19 pandemic has meant that the hiatus did not give the Conservatives an opportunity to frame Labour as an irrelevance. The Tories have retained a substantial lead in <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1253972/Boris-Johnson-Tories-Labour-Party-support-Britain-Elects-poll\" title=\"\">recent opinion polls</a>. This advantage will probably evaporate as the sloppy response from government ministers sinks in.</p> <p>In an encouraging sign of his professionalism, Sir Keir attacked the government\u2019s shambolic <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-serious-mistakes-made-coronavirus-testing-2529667\" title=\"\">handling</a> of the crisis at the weekend, while offering constructive suggestions for ministers to set out an exit strategy from the lockdown. In the longer run, the Labour leader cannot let coronavirus define his opposition to the government. He will need to respond to the current crises of our age, which have been thrown into sharp relief by the Covid-19 outbreak. A decade of cuts has shredded the welfare safety net and left health and social care systems woefully under-resourced, while the fissuring of the workplace makes it difficult for governments to send help to workers with insecure employment. Sir Keir is right to say that the wealthy must pay a <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-tax-increase-rich-labour-leadership-tax-avoidance-amazon-1382706\" title=\"\">fair share</a> to rebuild a post-coronavirus society.</p> <p>Corbynism rose as a response to the living standards crisis, a concentration of corporate power and years of austerity. Sir Keir\u2019s project will have to define the question it is the answer to. There is no shortage of pressing issues beyond the pathogen: dealing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/05/gap-between-rich-and-poor-grows-alongside-rise-in-uks-total-wealth\" title=\"\">growing wealth inequality</a>; a climate emergency; how to bring a fractured United Kingdom back together.</p> <p>Sir Keir has remade the shadow cabinet. He will want to change the party. His ability to exude Blairite competence and Corbynite idealism will only take him so far. There are precious few clues as to the direction in which he will head. We live in an era when political ambiguity is subject to a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-manifesto-big-plans-dont-bear-real-scrutiny-g9cg7ncxx\" title=\"\">level of scrutiny</a> that can brutally punish those who deploy it ineffectually. Sir Keir\u2019s embrace of a programme to transform society and tame capitalism means that his party\u2019s supporters won\u2019t swallow timid policies. The next election is scheduled to be four years away. The country may be very different to the one we live in now. Sir Keir\u2019s job is to make sure that his party\u2019s progressive and radical policies inspire hope, not fear.</p>",
  "<p>Like pacesetters in a deadly long-distance race, Italy and Spain have for weeks charted new and frightening territory, as the coronavirus pandemic grips Europe. Citizens have watched in anguish, as <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/\" title=\"\">daily death tolls climbed close to a thousand</a> and hospitals were overwhelmed. At the weekend, nearly a month after Rome and Madrid imposed national lockdowns, the first glimmerings of a reward for an unprecedented period of collective self-restraint were visible. In Italy, Sunday\u2019s reported death toll of 525 was the smallest daily increase since 19 March, and the number of people requiring hospital treatment also fell. In Spain, the growth rate of the number of infections was the lowest since the pandemic began.</p> <p>The uplifting data appears to confirm the positive impact of effective physical distancing on the virus\u2019s spread. Italy\u2019s health minister, Roberto Speranza, is expected to extend the country\u2019s lockdown well beyond its current end date of 13 April, and the government will wait to see the downward trends maintained over a number of days. In Spain, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8e58c8a-de5e-44ac-84c4-dac767e6cfca\" title=\"\">has already extended the shutdown</a> until 26 April. But the welcome flattening of those dismal curves creates dilemmas and quandaries that are no less daunting for being the result of good news.</p> <p>As Spanish and Italian citizens desperately seek some respite and the spectre of the deepest global recession <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-03/jobs-destroyed-worldwide-as-coronavirus-sparks-recession?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">since the 1930s looms</a>, their politicians\u2019 thoughts are turning to how to manage a loosening of restrictions on people and business, while minimisingthe risk of triggering a second deadly wave.</p> <p>The task, as Mr Speranza says, is to work out a way \u201cto live with the virus\u201d until a vaccine is discovered. Mr S\u00e1nchez has indicated that a ban on all non-essential work will be lifted after Easter. Other European countries, including France and Austria, where some shops will reopen next week, have also begun to game-plan the second phase of the crisis. The modus vivendi will, if it is to work, involve continued physical distancing, much greater testing and contact tracing in the community, and a functioning antibody test to establish who has had and recovered from the disease. The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, has emphasised that any easing of the lockdown in France will be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fa5ae87-b3b6-4708-b9c5-58d2077b8d95\" title=\"\">fearsomely complex</a>\u201d and is not likely to happen \u201c<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200404-lifting-lockdown-france-looks-ahead-to-options-for-easing-coronavirus-restrictions\" title=\"\">in one move everywhere and for everyone</a>\u201d. The politics of easing lockdown will be as fraught and treacherous as imposing it in the first place.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/\" title=\"\">the death rate here continues to rise</a> steeply, ministers are, rightly, preoccupied with reinforcing one stark message: a rigorously observed lockdown for an extended period to come is the only way to save thousands of lives that would otherwise be lost. But as other countries begin to unveil looser measures, the pressure on the government to reveal its own eventual exit strategy will be intense. It must do the necessary groundwork now.</p> <p>The challenges will be multiple: in Germany, <a href=\"https://www.ifo.de/en/publikationen/2020/monograph-authorship/making-fight-against-coronavirus-pandemic-sustainable\" title=\"\">scientists have estimated</a> that the current level of 50,000 tests a day \u2013 compared with around 10,000 in Britain \u2013 would be insufficient to allow even a partial end to lockdown. A system of effective contact tracing will need to be devised. Certain sections of the population will need to be told that they must continue to stay at home. Particular types of <a href=\"https://www.ifo.de/en/publikationen/2020/monograph-authorship/making-fight-against-coronavirus-pandemic-sustainable\" title=\"\">businesses may need to be prioritised at the expense of others</a>. In March, the British government was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-uk-response-to-coronavirus-playing-catch-up\" title=\"\">badly behind the curve</a> when it came to moving to a form of lockdown. If it is to maintain the confidence and cooperation of the public in staying at home, it will soon need to offer a credible account of what comes next.</p>",
  "<p>Faced with a global coronavirus pandemic that is increasingly centered upon the US, Donald Trump has touted several drugs that he claims can help tackle the outbreak.</p> \n<p>In March, the US president used a press conference to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine, a common anti-malaria drug, to treat Covid-19, saying: \u201cI sure as hell think we ought to give it a try.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/can-chloroquine-really-help-treat-coronavirus-patients\">Chloroquine: Trump's misleading claims spark hoarding and overdoses</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He followed this with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241367239900778501\">tweet</a> that claimed the use of the drug in combination with azithromycin, an antibiotic, could be \u201cone of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u201d. On Sunday Trump again touted hydroxychloroquine, saying \u201cthere are some very strong, powerful signs\u201d of its potential as a Covid-19 therapy.</p> \n<p>Trump has been repeatedly contradicted by public health experts including his own top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, who has warned that there is only \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d that the drugs could be helpful.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e299a7f3-c36b-4565-aeb3-0f89c8c5cbf5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTXpRNIDpy0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Confronted with this disparity Trump, who has repeatedly made false and misleading assertions throughout the coronavirus crisis, responded by telling reporters that \u201cI\u2019m a smart guy\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve been right a lot\u201d. The Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity have been promoting hydroxychloroquine on their shows.</p> \n<p>Last week the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided hydroxychloroquine with an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. State officials in New York have said that about 4,000 seriously ill patients are now being treated with the drug.</p> \n<p>But with some Americans turning to unconventional, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/24/coronavirus-chloroquine-poisoning-death/\">potentially deadly</a>, treatments for coronavirus, medical experts have called for considered, accurate information to avoid exacerbating the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Last month an Arizona man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-cure-kills-man-after-trump-touts-chloroquine-phosphate\">died</a> and his wife was left in critical condition after the couple took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is related to the composition of the anti-malaria treatment promoted by Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,\u201d the woman told NBC, before advising: \u201cDon\u2019t take anything. Don\u2019t believe anything. Don\u2019t believe anything that the president says and his people \u2026 call your doctor.\u201d</p> \n<p>Here are the key things to know:</p> \n<h2><strong>What is hydroxychloroquine?</strong></h2> \n<p>Hydroxychloroquine, also known by its brand name, Plaquenil, is a drug used to treat malaria. It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.</p> \n<p>It is also readily available to Americans \u2013 already approved as a malaria and anti-inflammation treatment by the FDA \u2013 where it is an off-the-shelf drug with various low-cost generic versions. Despite the emergency use order, the FDA has not conducted clinical trials to fully ascertain whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19.</p> \n<h2>Why is Trump touting it?</h2> \n<p>Trump was influenced by a widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.</p> \n<p>However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, with Olivier V\u00e9ran, France\u2019s health minister, saying that it shouldn\u2019t be used by anyone with the exception of \u201cserious forms of hospitalization and on the collegial decision of doctors and under strict medical supervision\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>What does the evidence show?</strong></h2> \n<p>The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections from Sars-CoV-2, the virus behind Covid-19, by blocking it from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn\u2019t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhea.</p> \n<p>Regardless of these findings, any drug being used for a certain purpose before full clinical trials are completed is, by definition, untested and unproven. It\u2019s too early to say if hydroxychloroquine can have a major benefit or not.</p> \n<p>The European Medicines Agency, an agency of the EU, has said hydroxychloroquine should not be taken by coronavirus patients except for clinical trials or emergency use programs.</p> \n<h2>Are there any downsides to this drug being in demand?</h2> \n<p>Like many drugs, hydroxychloroquine comes with a number of potential side-effects. These include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, weight loss and mood changes.</p> \n<p>Worse, a sudden surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. Hydroxychloroquine is able to keep lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, in check but some people with the condition have complained they are now unable to find Plaquenil. Trump\u2019s pushing of the treatment has caused many Americans, whether they need it or not, to stock up on the drug.</p> \n<h2>What should people do instead?</h2> \n<p>The latest Chinese research suggests that using hydroxychloroquine is no better than more conventional coronavirus treatments, such as bed rest, antiviral drugs and oxygen inhalation. There are about 40 different research efforts around the world to find a vaccine, which may take a year or more, while scientists rummaging around in the existing medical cabinet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/19/prospects-treatment-coronavirus-drugs-vaccines\">have identified some other drugs</a> that may be repurposed to tackle Covid-19. But this work, too, will take time.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion?</h2> \n<p>There is no magic cure for this pandemic, no matter what Trump says.</p> \n<p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

The plan is for the competition to be held every year \u2013 except when the World Cup is being staged \u2013 but within the Premiership there is a feeling it should be every four years, that the Champions Cup should not be sacrificed and that the new tournament should be run by the clubs rather than World Rugby. </p> <p>The Bath chairman, Bruce Craig, said: \u201cThis project is a club competition, not an international tournament and must therefore be piloted by the clubs; it should not be placed under the aegis of World Rugby. Whatever happens in the coming months, club rugby must remain managed by the clubs, it is nonnegotiable.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday night, European Professional Club Rugby, the Champions Cup organiser, confirmed talks over a global tournament had taken place. In a statement it said: \u201cDiscussions have already taken place on an official level between EPCR and its shareholders regarding a global club tournament which could complement the Heineken Champions Cup and Challenge Cup and which could take place once every four years. Work on possible formats is ongoing with a collaborative approach and issues of player welfare to the fore.</p> <p>\u201cEPCR does not believe it appropriate to highlight such discussions while the public health crisis due to COVID-19 continues, and currently, the organisation\u2019s focus is on attempting to reschedule the knockout stages of the 2019/20 tournaments subject to government and local authority directives.\u201d</p> <p>According to one well-placed source World Rugby believe the competition is a way to better realign the international calendars in the north and south hemispheres.

She clarified that One World was not a fundraising telethon and would focus on entertainment and messages of solidarity, with philanthropists and businesses urged to donate to the Covid-19 solidarity response fund ahead of the event.</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s general director, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cWe may have to be apart physically for a little while, but we can still come together virtually to enjoy great music. The One World: Together at Home concert represents a powerful show of solidarity against a common threat.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 April 2020. Lady Gaga stated that philanthropists and businesses, not fans as an earlier version said, were being urged to donate to the organisation. This has been corrected.<br></p>",

But because they are so sensitive they pick up other sources too, including human activity, so road traffic, people walking past and nearby factories,\u201d said Brian Baptie, a seismologist at BGS in Edinburgh. \u201cAll these things generate vibrations and those propagate through the Earth.\u201d</p> \n<p>Human-induced vibrations, known in the trade as \u201ccultural noise\u201d, spread through the planet differently to tremors from earthquakes and tend to die away a few miles from their origins. But seismometers placed near urban centres still pick up plenty of noise that makes it harder for scientists to analyse the more valuable seismic data.</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s network of sensitive instruments picked up markedly fewer vibrations last week as the coronavirus lockdown took hold, the researchers found. \u201cWe had a look at the data from some of our seismic stations around the UK and we do see an effect,\u201d said Baptie. At some sensors, cultural noise is running at five decibels lower than normal, about a quarter down on usual readings. Similar falls have been spotted by Belgian seismologists based in Brussels.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69e1f072-d353-4bcb-a8d6-6cc8e2ebf165\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z8YfSMf7S6s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The BGS operates a national network of about 80 seismometers from Shetland to Jersey that provide a constant ear to the ground. The data are pored over by BGS scientists and fed into a global network that is used to monitor earthquakes anywhere on the planet. In contrast to low-frequency tremors, cultural noise vibrations are high-frequency waves, around one to 100Hz, that tend to travel through the surface layers of the Earth.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn theory, this reduction in noise means we should be able to detect more earthquakes in the UK, in Europe and all around the world,\u201d said Baptie. If so, it would shed light on the frequency of different magnitude earthquakes and, in the case of more distant tremors, how the seismic waves are affected by the Earth\u2019s structure and the characteristics of the shifting faults that unleash them.</p> \n<p>Researchers at the BGS now hope to check all their seismometers for the fall in human noise with the aim of producing a map that will reveal which areas of Britain have seen the most stark declines in the human hum. The hunt for smaller earthquakes may take longer than the lockdown holds, however. \u201cWe aren\u2019t in a particularly active region,\u201d said Baptie. \u201cSo we may not get anything in the short term.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global death toll passes 70,000</h2> <p>The number of known cases around the world nears 1.3 million as the global number confirmed to have died hits 70,798, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.

  "<p>The UN\u2019s chemical weapons watchdog is expected to release its first report explicitly blaming Bashar al-Assad for sarin and chlorine gas attacks on civilians in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a> as efforts to establish accountability for the use of chemical agents in the nine-year-old conflict gain momentum.</p> <p>Observers anticipate that public and classified versions of a report by a new unit at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/opcw\">Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</a> (OPCW) will be published on Wednesday, close to the anniversaries of a major chlorine attack on the then rebel-held Damascus suburb of Douma that killed at least 85 people in 2018 as well as a deadly sarin attack on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/the-dead-were-wherever-you-looked-inside-syrian-town-after-chemical-attack\">Khan Sheikhun</a> in 2017 which killed at least 89. The report is believed to focus on 2017 attacks on the village of al-Lataminah.</p> <p>The investigation is the outcome of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/27/opcw-granted-powers-to-identify-source-of-chemical-attacks-in-syria\">new powers granted to the OPCW</a> by a 2018 UN resolution specifically calling for the watchdog to \u201cput in place arrangements to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic by identifying and reporting on all information potentially relevant to the origin of those chemical weapons\u201d. Previously, OPCW fact-finding missions did not have the mandate to apportion blame in chemical weapons attacks.</p> <p>The resulting newly created investigation and identification team (IIT) at the OPCW was designed as a work-around to counter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a>, Syria\u2019s closest political ally. Moscow has repeatedly used international forums - and its veto as a permanent member of the UN security council - to block independent investigations into chemical weapons attacks allegedly launched by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad\">Assad</a> regime.</p> <p>The IIT report\u2019s expected findings could trigger new sanctions on Syrian officials and are likely to lead to renewed accusations from Moscow, Tehran and Damascus that the OPCW\u2019s work has been politicised by western nations. The charge that Russia permits, or covers up, the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons on Syrian civilians is one of the most bitter diplomatic flashpoints between Russia and the west.</p> <p>\u201cEven though the evidence of Assad\u2019s crimes against humanity is incontrovertible, independent fact finding missions have been massively undermined by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/syria-white-helmets-conspiracy-theories\">Russian-led disinformation campaigns</a>,\u201d said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, chemical weapons expert and director of Doctors Under Fire.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, the supposed whistleblower controversy at the OPCW last year, which the organisation comprehensively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/inquiry-strikes-blow-to-russian-denials-of-syria-chemical-attack\">rejected with an official inquiry</a>. Even though the criticism was found to be baseless it does not stop the conspiracy theorists.</p> <p>\u201cIf the rules-based global order had actually applied to Syria\u2019s war, then the creation of the IIT would not have been necessary. This [new measure] isn\u2019t perfect but it is a step forward.\u201d</p> <p>A new dataset and <a href=\"https://chemicalweapons.gppi.net/data-portal\">interactive mapping tool</a>, due to be released on Tuesday, gives the most comprehensive analysis of chemical weapons use in Syria to date.</p> <p>Researchers from the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin along with Syrian and international partners compiled 345 credibly substantiated or confirmed attacks across the country since 2011, building on what the institute described as years of painstaking research.</p> <p>Approximately 98% of the attacks were carried out by the Assad regime, usually dropped from the air, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Islamic State</a> are responsible for the rest, GPPI found. Around 90% of the documented attacks were carried out after the infamous \u201cred line\u201d chlorine attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta in 2013.</p> <p>According to the GPPI research, Assad\u2019s heavy use of improvised chlorine bombs, in particular, is a crucial part of the regime\u2019s military strategy: after conventional bombing drives civilians into underground tunnels and basements, chlorine gas, which is heavier than air, sinks into these last refuges, finally forcing people to flee their homes and towns.</p> <p>\u201cOur research shows what Syrians on the ground have known for years: that chemical weapons have become a completely normalised component of the Syrian regime arsenal used for years in full view of the international community with near impunity,\u201d said Tobias Schneider, a GPPI research fellow who worked on the new resource.</p> <p>\u201cSyria is commonly described as the \u2018best documented war in history\u2019. While that\u2019s true, it is hard to go beyond the individual incident to process and make sense of the vast body of data that the war has produced over the years. We hope this research will inform prosecutions for years to come. But this data has been available for years and could have been used to better inform policymaking that could have averted the worst of these horrors.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The boss of JP Morgan, Wall Street\u2019s biggest bank, has said the world faces a \u201cbad recession\u201d as he took a swipe at America\u2019s lack of preparedness for the pandemic.</p> <p>In his annual address, written a month after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/jp-morgan-chief-jamie-dimon-has-emergency-heart-surgery\">underwent emergency heart surgery</a>, Jamie Dimon said that at the very least a severe downturn was on its way coupled with financial pressures reminiscent of the banking crash more than a decade ago.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what the future will hold \u2013 but at a minimum, we assume that it will include a bad recession combined with some kind of financial stress similar to the global financial crisis of 2008.\u201d</p> <p>He said JP Morgan had not asked for any government support and would continue lending money, while offering greater forbearance for customers struggling to repay debts.

And Dimon appeared to criticise the Trump administration\u2019s lack of readiness for the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThere should have been a pandemic playbook,\u201d said Dimon.</p> <p>But he also pointed to much deeper, structural problems in US society that he said were contributing to the danger presented by coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, America has always had its flaws,\u201d said Dimon. \u201cThe current pandemic is only one example of the bad planning and management that have hurt our country.\u201d</p> <p>Dimon, whose cash-plus-stock pay package was worth $31.5m (\u00a325.6m) last year, highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/26/jamie-dimon-crocodile-tears-inequality\">worsening wealth inequality</a> as one of America\u2019s biggest problems, citing the fact that the share of wages for the bottom 30% of US citizens has been declining.</p> <p>The JP Morgan boss also lamented poor outcomes in education, a costly healthcare system that many people cannot access, the lack of a social safety net and a poor immigration policy.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to acknowledge these problems and the damage they have done if we are ever going to fix them,\u201d said Dimon, who returned to work this year after heart surgery.</p> <p>\u201cAs we have seen in past crises of this magnitude, there will come a time when we will look back and it will be clear how we \u2013 at all levels of society, government, business, healthcare systems, and civic and humanitarian organisations \u2013 could have been and will be better prepared to face emergencies of this scale.\u201d</p> <p>JP Morgan reported profits of $36.4bn last year and Dimon said the bank could survive and keep lending, even if its most pessimistic scenarios for the effect of the pandemic on the global economy came to pass.</p> <p>But its dividend could be suspended in the \u201cextremely adverse scenario\u201d in which the US economy shrinks by 35% in the second quarter and unemployment hits 14% by the end of the year.</p>",
  "<p>Almost three-quarters of new electricity generation capacity built in 2019 uses renewable energy, representing an all-time record. <a href=\"https://www.irena.org/publications/2020/Mar/Renewable-Capacity-Statistics-2020\">New data from the </a><a href=\"https://www.irena.org/publications/2020/Mar/Renewable-Capacity-Statistics-2020\">International Renewable Energy Agency</a> (Irena) shows solar, wind and other green technologies now provide more than one-third of the world\u2019s power, marking another record.</p> <p>Fossil fuel power plants are in decline in Europe and the US, with more decommissioned than built in 2019.

La Camera said: \u201cRenewable energy is a cost-effective source of new power that insulates power markets and consumers from volatility.\u201d Solar and wind power are now the <a href=\"https://smallcaps.com.au/wind-solar-energy-cheapest-power-two-thirds-world/\">cheapest form of electricity in two-thirds of the world</a>.</p> <p>The Irena data shows the increase in new renewable energy capacity slowed slightly in 2019 - from 179GW to 176GW \u2013 but that new fossil fuel power also fell. The total green energy installed to date around the world grew by 7.6%, with the UK\u2019s total rising 6.1%. The UK is now 11th in the world for installed renewables.</p> <p>New solar power provided 55% of the new capacity, most of which was installed in Asia, with China, India, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam leading the way. Other major increases were seen in the US, Australia, Spain, Germany and Ukraine.</p> <p>Wind power made up 34% of the total, with almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/worlds-wind-power-capacity-up-by-fifth-after-record-year\">half in China and significant additions in the US</a>. Global wind power capacity remains just ahead of solar, with 95% being onshore turbines.</p> <p>Other green technologies \u2013 hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal and marine energy \u2013 all grew modestly year-on-year.

  "<h2>Stillness and Speed, by Dennis Bergkamp</h2> <p>Dennis Bergkamp\u2019s book is different. Produced with the excellent Dutch football writer David Winner, the former Arsenal striker\u2019s memoir is all the richer for allowing Bergkamp to share his footballing philosophy instead of being a chronological journey through his life. But thanks to Winner\u2019s conversations with Bergkamp and the Dutchman\u2019s former teammates and managers, it also contains plenty of great stories. A top insight into the mind of a true artist. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <h2>The Great Derbies 1962-1988: Everton v Liverpool, by Brian Barwick and Gerald Sinstadt</h2> <p>This is an old-fashioned football book, full of evocative photographs, interviews and anecdotes rather than philosophical musing or tactical theory, but as its subject matter neatly encompasses my formative years and childhood passions I turn to it regularly and with pleasure. Everything that matters is in here, from Gordon West\u2019s handbag to Stan Boardman\u2019s frustration as a Liverpool A-teamer to Gary Lineker\u2019s lucky boots, with special mention of Clive Thomas of Treorchy. The underlying theme is Liverpool\u2019s gradual rise to supremacy, of course, but I can even forgive that. These were happy days. <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> <h2>The Club, by Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b5d52740fa4cf6eaf34bf43cb12f3722299886c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5d52740fa4cf6eaf34bf43cb12f3722299886c0/0_0_650_1000/650.jpg\" alt=\"The Club\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Written with the US audience in mind, this might be more of a recap for the peeled-eyeball obsessive. But it is an excellent recap, with wonderful access and forensic detail on the Premier League\u2019s rise to global alpha status. At a time when there is a chance to reset and possibly even \u2013 no, really \u2013 do things differently, it\u2019s useful to remember how finely poised many of the choices that got us here were. All told with an arch sense of humour. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p> <h2>The Miracle of Castel di Sangro, by Joe McGinniss</h2> <p>In 1996 Castel di Sangro, a team from an impoverished town of 5,000 inhabitants, sealed their spectacular rise from the amateur leagues to Serie B courtesy of a penalty save from a veteran substitute goalkeeper making his first appearance of the season. McGinniss, having become obsessed with the sport thanks to Roberto Baggio and the 1994 World Cup, immerses himself in the club and town for what comes next. Tragedy and scandal expose the late author to the cynical side of Italian football, but miracles ensure his love for the game and the country survive. A gripping tale, brilliantly told. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <h2>Extra Time, by Kevin Sampson</h2> <p>A Liverpool supporter\u2019s account of following the team during the 1997-98 season feels like something that should appeal only to, well, a Liverpool supporter, but this is a book that transcends tribalism. Partly because Sampson\u2019s stories, involving the likes of Jegsy Dodd and the Urban Dub Poet, are those of <em>all</em> match-going fans and partly because, as is the case with the author\u2019s work in general, they are told with great wit and warmth. <strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong></p> <h2>All Played Out, by Pete Davies</h2> <p>The best books transport you to another place and time, making it, and its inhabitants, seem real. All Played Out does precisely that, taking readers back to Italia 90 with access all areas. It tells the inside story of that watershed tournament thanks to the sometimes startling, and always very human, insights accumulated during the nine months of unparalleled access Davies was granted by Bobby Robson and his England players. Spiced by three-dimensional portrayals of journalists, fans and hooligans, it could not be written today. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <h2>Fifty-Six: The Story of the Bradford Fire, by Martin Fletcher</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5df71161e7d80066c9a68ca0dcb5efc7188c4fd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5df71161e7d80066c9a68ca0dcb5efc7188c4fd9/0_0_1316_2040/645.jpg\" alt=\"Fifty-six: the story of the Bradford fire\" width=\"645\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 1985, on the final day of the season, a 12-year-old Martin Fletcher went to watch Bradford City with his father, brother, grandfather and uncle but he would be the only one to leave alive as a fire engulfed the wooden main stand, killing 56 people. This is a stunningly brutal account of that horrific day and aftermath by a man still scarred and searching for answers. <strong>Suzanne Wrack</strong></p> <h2>The Boy on the Shed, by Paul Ferris</h2> <p>A book which begins as a stark social history of Northern Ireland during its most troubled sectarian times develops into a superb memoir. Ferris was a childhood superstar who left his native Lisburn and everything he knew to sign for Newcastle United. Ferris\u2019s experiences, in football and an incredible life beyond, are blissfully easy to relate to. Triumph, tragedy and everything in between are beautifully encapsulated here. <strong>Ewan Murray</strong></p> <h2>The Title, by Scott Murray</h2> <p>What better way to pass the time during the suspension of the Premier League than by catching up on all the top-flight title races that took place before English football got its glitzy makeover? There\u2019s very many a yarn to be celebrated, and Scott Murray \u2013 also of this parish \u2013 proves the perfect guide, breezing through more than a 100 years of heritage with customary style, deep knowledge and an infectious appreciation for the characters who shaped the \u201cepic saga\u201d of English football pre-1992. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <h2>The Ball is Round, by David Goldblatt</h2> <p>There are other histories of football but none that tackle it so well from a socio-economic perspective, and few that have the same global vision. This is a remarkable work of synthesis. Goldblatt\u2019s triumph is to take a wealth of theory and information from an extraordinary array of sources from across the world and construct from it a narrative that is both convincing and readable. <strong>Jonathan Wilson</strong></p>",

Do not read unless you have watched season three, episode four.</em></p> <p>Poor old William. Well, maybe just the old bit. The nastiest man in Westworld has fallen apart. Wracked by guilt, he is unable to distinguish hallucination from luxe furnishings and, most troubling of all, he has been outwitted by a host.</p> <p>Dolores has got the better of her long-time tormentor, by persuading him to take his company, Delos, off the stock market and turn it private. That means it can\u2019t be bought by nasty man Serac, but it also means that it is now in the control of a nasty robot who tends to see humanity (not without reason) as a blight that would be better off in the evolutionary bin. Dolores, while looking like Charlotte Hale, achieves this by declaring William insane and deposing him from the top of Delos. William is aghast, but it turns out that wandering around shouting: \u201cI know who the fuck I am!\u201d is not a particularly persuasive counterpoint.</p> <p>For regular readers, an apology follows. Last week you may have been given the impression that Dolores was a lovely robot woman who recognised good people for good people and was our only hope in the battle against the billionaire misanthrope Serac. I am happy to correct that observation, now being very much of the mind that Dolores is an imminent and absolute danger and, what\u2019s more, there are five of her.</p> <p>Yes, after all that speculation (what, a red herring in Westworld?!), it turns out that Dolores did not smuggle a series of hosts out of the park when she left Westworld at the end of the last season. Instead, she smuggled out four clones of herself, because if you want to do the job of conquering the world properly, you are better off doing it yourself. So, no Teddy, no Clementine, no leering dude with mutton chops (he is called Rebus, but he will always be Mutton Chops to me), no Ford. Just Dolores and a Bernard for cosmic balance.</p> <p>That is fine with me. This week\u2019s episode, while a bit glitchy when showing us around William\u2019s mind, was as straightforward as Westworld has been for a while \u2013 and that is a good thing. We now know the parameters of the conflict: Serac versus Dolores, with Bernard and Maeve (and surely Caleb, soon enough) in the middle. At stake: the future of humanity and a question over whether anyone can ever be free.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06e3aa27fc1010619403f8a84fb5f1e1e340bc0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06e3aa27fc1010619403f8a84fb5f1e1e340bc0c/0_0_6720_4480/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Serac (Vincent Cassel) in Westworld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man with a plan ...

This orgy is basically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/29/eyes-wide-shut-review-stanley-kubrick-tom-cruise-nicole-kidman\">Eyes Wide Shut</a> with added \u201cdigital psychopharma\u201d, which is basically drugs via a dongle. Liam is in attendance with some of his disgusting pals, but he has lost his appetite for delinquency. Why so? Because he has been confronted by his security chief, Malcolm Tucker \u2013 sorry, Martin \u2013 and mocked for his proclivities.</p> <p>Anyway, no matter, Liam can\u2019t partake in the orgy anyway, because he has had all his money stolen by Dolores. Which as a result leaves me confused as to why she wants to kidnap him, too. Maybe it is something to do with the Rehohohoboam. Anyway, it is all moot as Bernard, sexy orgy mask and all, turns up with Stubbs to pinch Liam first.</p> <p>Bernard wants Liam because he believes he is Dolores\u2019s plant and a secret host. He is not, however, as Bernard finds out when he tries to switch him off with a button. But with Malcolm/Martin having spotted Bernard from his eagle-eye view, Dolores is soon bearing down on our furrow-browed hero and Stubbs is forced to step in to fight her.</p> <p>I swear Stubbs wasn\u2019t nearly as spiky and sarky and, well, interesting in previous series, but as Dolores descends he has time to compliment her little black dress before the pair go at it. Yet despite his weight advantage, Bernard\u2019s minder is no match for Dolores; after exchanging a few quick blows, she throws him off a balcony.</p> <p>Bernard has escaped with Liam, but is soon tracked down by Malcolm/Martin, who also turns out to be Dolores. Get it? Got it?

Having been recruited to Team Serac two weeks ago, we see her enjoy a ginormous glass of sherry with the billionaire Frenchman at the beginning of this episode. He is explaining his hopes for humanity, which involve getting them to do what he thinks is right, but he then also offers an intriguing insight into what has been going on in the world at large while we have been watching Delos\u2019s \u201cmurder simulation theme parks\u201d (copyright Stubbs). When Serac was a boy growing up in Paris, he was witness to a massive bio-terror event that destroyed the city. Fortunately for Serac, he was gambolling in a field overlooking the city at the time (you know, that field), but millions of other people perished. Yes, it was a bit eerie to watch, wasn\u2019t it?</p> <p>So, anyway, a lot of the world is now uninhabitable, we are led to assume. And Serac wants to control the rest of it. You get the impression that Maeve loses her affection for the guy after he blows out the brains of an informer who had helped Dolores after her escape from Westworld. This guy\u2019s dying confession sets up a trail first to \u201cThe Mortician\u201d, then an underworld kingpin called Sato, who looks just like Hector\u2019s Shogun World double, Musashi. But the truth is that he is none other than \u2013 you got there before me, didn\u2019t you? \u2013 Dolores.</p> <p>Following this revelation, there is another fight, this time with swords. We learn that Sato\u2019s distillery isn\u2019t making whisky, but host milk. We see that Maeve is able to control electronics with her mind, which allows her to mess up a few goons with machine guns. Just as with Stubbs before, however, the Dolores double is too good. Sato deals Maeve a big sword to the tum and soon her red blood is pouring out over the white milk in a symbolic mixture of materials that makes you wonder, once more, why she doesn\u2019t bleed white in the first place.</p> <h2>Divergence and anomalies</h2> <ul> <li><p>Can anyone name the song being played by the string section during the orgy?

The group says the move \u201ccould potentially save the lives of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Iranians and, by helping to curb the virus\u2019s rapid spread across borders, the lives of its neighbours, Europeans, Americans and others\u201d.</p> \n<p>Iranians are facing \u201cone of their country\u2019s darkest times in living memory\u201d the group says. \u201cReaching across borders to save lives is imperative for our own security and must override political differences among governments,\u201d it adds.</p> \n<p>Signatories include the former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright, former US defence secretaries William Cohen and Chuck Hagel, former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency Hans Blix, former US treasury secretary Paul O\u2019Neill, the former US lead diplomat on the Iran deal, William Burns, and the former Nato secretary general George Robertson.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Centrist and progressive Democrats including Joe Biden have all called for a lifting of sanctions, but the statement \u2013 organised by the European Leadership Network and the Iran Project \u2013 is the most broad-based effort to engage the White House yet,proposing very specific, but effective steps that do not require a complete reversal of US policy towards Iran.</p> \n<p>The statement says: \u201cThough never intended to kill, US \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 through sanctions on Iran are compromising the performance of the Iranian healthcare system as Iran\u2019s outbreak moves into its second month.

  "<p><strong>Why are footballers\u2019 wages in the news?</strong></p> <p>Even in normal times the amount of money earned by top players is a hot topic. The average wage of a Premier League footballer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/23/premier-league-salaries-manchester-city-nba-barcelona\" title=\"\">reached \u00a33m</a> last season according to the Global Sports Salary Survey. This compares with the an average national wage of \u00a329,559. Footballers are heroes to many but they are also easily recognisable symbols of financial inequality.</p> <p>Since the coronavirus crisis began footballers\u2019 pay has become politicised. In part this is because some of the elite 20 clubs \u2013 currently Liverpool, Tottenham, Newcastle, Bournemouth and Norwich \u2013 have chosen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/04/liverpool-become-latest-premier-league-club-to-furlough-non-playing-staff\" title=\"\">furlough</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/04/liverpool-become-latest-premier-league-club-to-furlough-non-playing-staff\" title=\"\">non-playing staff</a> under the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme while continuing to pay their players in full.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/06/west-ham-manager-david-moyes-takes-voluntary-30-per-cent-pay-cut-coronavirus\">West Ham manager David Moyes takes voluntary 30% pay cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last Thursday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, complicated the matter when he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/03/matt-hancock-deflecting-blame-on-to-footballers-andros-townsend-crystal-palace-premier-league-pay-cuts\" title=\"\">players should \u201cplay their part\u201d</a> in the fight against the virus by taking a pay cut. \u201cGiven the sacrifices many people are making, the first thing Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution,\u201d Hancock said. This was interpreted by many to mean players should give some of their wages to support frontline staff in the NHS.</p> <p><strong>So have they taken a pay cut?</strong></p> <p>As a collective, they have not. The Premier League has asked players to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/03/premier-league-clubs-will-ask-players-to-take-30-per-cent-wage-drop-cuts-deferrals\" title=\"\">consider a temporary wage</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/03/premier-league-clubs-will-ask-players-to-take-30-per-cent-wage-drop-cuts-deferrals\" title=\"\">drop of 30%</a>. Negotiations between the league, its 20 clubs, representatives of the players and the players\u2019 union, the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, have yet to come to a conclusion after nearly a week.</p> <p>Individually there has been a lot of activity. Last Friday the Premier League announced it would give \u00a320m to the NHS and charitable causes. The Liverpool captain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/03/liverpool-jordan-henderson-sets-up-premier-league-coronavirus-fund-for-nhs\" title=\"\">Jordan Henderson, has led a drive</a> among players that is expected to make a similarly substantial donation to the health service. Footballers have been volunteering time and money to help stricken communities. In one prominent example, Marcus Rashford of Manchester United has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/30/marcus-rashford-manchester-children-coronavirus-crisis-united-injury\" title=\"\">fronted a campaign</a> for the charity FareShare, helping children unable to access free school meals. Such individual actions have not stopped the political pressure building. On Sunday the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, published an open letter calling for footballers and clubs to \u201csupport the National Effort [sic] in whatever way they can.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c52de716e7db09a579f7191fb6acdf4ffa6ae704\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c52de716e7db09a579f7191fb6acdf4ffa6ae704/0_130_3701_2220/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Manchester United\u2019s Marcus Rashford has fronted a campaign to help children unable to access free school meals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United\u2019s Marcus Rashford has fronted a campaign to help children unable to access free school meals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Oldham/BPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Why is a collective settlement proving so difficult?</strong></p> <p>Essentially the knot in the debate is two fold. First there is the meaning over what any pay cut would be for: to help the country during the crisis, or to balance the books of the clubs? Second there is mistrust between the PFA and clubs.</p> <p>The union is widely felt to have acted slowly and been too confrontational in discussions. It has released lengthy statements defending its interests and suggesting a wage cut would be counterproductive as it would cut the amount of tax players would pay to the state and, therefore, public services. Meanwhile there continues to be astonishment that prestigious and (before the crisis) profitable clubs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/27/liverpool-42m-pre-tax-profit-record-223m-spend-on-players-financial-year-2018-19\" title=\"\">such as Liverpool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2020/march/financial-results-year-end-30-june-2019/\" title=\"\">Tottenham</a> should look to ask the taxpayer to cover the wages of furloughed staff. Why, asks the union, should players take the hit for the greed of the clubs?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Can the impasse be resolved?</strong></p> <p>It will have to be. As political pressure \u2013 not to mention that on social media \u2013 continues to rise so does the damage to the reputation of the game. Football has become a target while so many other big businesses applying for government funds have not but the Premier League holds a special place in society. For a long time one of the UK\u2019s most valuable cultural exports, it is in danger of looking like a villain during this crisis.</p> <p>Player wages will have to come down and not just because the public will demand it. For all the unedifying behaviour by some clubs, the top of the game \u2013 never mind the lower leagues \u2013 faces a financial crisis if the suspended season does not resume. Broadcasters could ask for as much as \u00a3750m to be returned should games not be played. That figure, roughly, is what clubs might save should the players agree to drop their wages by a third.</p>",
  "<p>Lombardy is one of the richest and most productive regions in Italy and Bergamo is its beating heart. It is also my home town: the city where I spent my childhood and adolescence. The province\u2019s million inhabitants are characterised by a strong sense of belonging: to region and to family. They take pride too in a no-nonsense, practical approach to life and a powerful work ethic.</p> <p>Today, Bergamo holds the European record that no town wants: it is the place where the coronavirus pandemic has cast its darkest shadow. Bergamo is a lazaretto of pain, where the priority of hospital managers is to select only the patients they think will survive. Its undertakers are so overwhelmed they have to ask neighbouring communes to take their corpses for cremation.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s death toll from this pandemic passed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-4-april-6pm\">15,000 on 4 April</a>, although the number of actual deaths is probably higher. Bergamo, the most infected province in Italy, has had 9,712 confirmed cases and 2,245 deaths according to the official data. An <a href=\"https://www.ecodibergamo.it/stories/bergamo-citta/coronavirus-the-real-death-tool-4500-victims-in-one-month-in-the-province-of_1347414_11/\">investigation</a> by the Eco di Bergamo newspaper estimates that in Bergamo province alone the virus killed 4,500 people in March.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/italy-extends-lockdown-amid-signs-coronavirus-infection-rate-is-easing\">Italy records lowest coronavirus death toll for a week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rate of loss of life feels out of control to local people and defies all understanding. Forced confinement, physical distancing and care for the weakest seem futile. The virus seemed to defeat any effort, annihilate any commitment. Here, no one took to singing on balconies, to giving concerts online: the place is in perpetual mourning.</p> <p>But was the initial reluctance to shut down Bergamo\u2019s factories and thriving economy a factor in spreading the infection?</p> <p>To grasp that first reaction it helps to understand just how efficient and solid the economic and industrial fabric here has been for generations. The province has Italy\u2019s biggest concentration of the country\u2019s best-performing small and medium-sized enterprises, clustered mostly in the lower Bergamo region. But it is also home to big international companies such as Brembo, which makes automotive braking systems, and Kiko, the international cosmetics brand founded by Antonio Percassi, also president of the local football team, Atalanta. Some Bergamo success stories such as the drinks company San Pellegrino, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, have been absorbed by multinationals.</p> <p>The three Alpine valleys of the province have more farms than businesses. The small towns that make up these valleys have strong rural communities that maintain their traditions at parish level, but can feel closed in on themselves. Everyone knows everyone else, many elderly people still speak the dialect, and even teenagers stick close to home.</p> <p>The city of Bergamo by contrast could hardly be more open: it is directly linked to the main European capitals by Orio al Serio airport (also known as Milan/Bergamo), which is a hub for Ryanair and had nearly 14 million passengers in 2019. These frequent connections are an important source of tourism for the city. </p> <p>In 1913, the German-Swiss writer and intellectual Hermann Hesse visited Bergamo and observed: \u201cI was greeted by a modern railway station and a modern city \u2026 the evening stroll was crowded and the tramway crowded.\u201d Then he took the funicular to reach the upper town, the historical part of the city surrounded by Venetian walls, \u201cbelow me, the nightlife of the city was off \u2026 here I was in the middle of an ancient and dark city, swallowed up by a narrow and deserted alleyway, just as the shops were closing \u2026 it suddenly seemed to me that I was in southern Tuscany\u201d.</p> <p>Hesse immediately grasped the duality of Bergamo: modern and ancient, economically open to the world but closed in on its traditions. On the one hand, a strong social and cultural life linked by voluntary work through the Catholic church. On the other, a remarkable focus on productivity, work, the family and above all the family business.</p> <p>It is clear looking back that this rich and dynamic city struggled to come to a halt when the virus arrived. For the <em>Bergamaschi,</em> work and self-reliance have always been fundamental values. But faced with a health emergency, was a strong business ethic a tragic disadvantage?</p> <p>By 23 February, the virus had already infected Val Seriana, the Bergamo valley where two villages, Alzano Lombardo and Nembro, quickly became the ground zero of the epidemic in the region.</p> <p>Four days earlier, on 19 February, an <a href=\"https://talksport.com/football/687311/atalanta-valencia-champions-coronavirus-bergamo-mayor/\">Atalanta-Valencia Champions League football match</a> was attended by 45,000 fans in Milan, an event widely blamed for having accelerated the spread across the region.</p> <p>The contagion reached Codogno (a small town in Lodi province, 65km from Bergamo) two days after the game, and Codogno was immediately made a \u201cred zone\u201d, in other words quarantined with police checkpoints guarding entry and exit. By contrast, in Bergamo schools closed, but there was resistance to any sweeping stay-at-home measures until 8 March when all of Lombardy went into full lockdown.</p> <p>The Italian government had declared a nationwide health emergency on 31 January but Stefano Scaglia, the president of Confindustria Bergamo, which represents 1,200 businesses employing 80,000 people, offered reassurance. On 29 February, the organisation published a <a href=\"https://www.bergamonews.it/2020/02/29/confindustria-bergamo-ai-partners-internazionali-delle-imprese-orobiche-pronti-a-ripartire/356831/\">message in English </a>aimed at the region\u2019s international export partners, accompanied by the hashtag \u201c#Bergamoisrunning\u201d. Drawing on the Italian government\u2019s advice it said \u201cthe risk of infection is low\u201d and warned against \u201ca distorted perception\u201d created by the media.

  "<p><em><strong>So, is the </strong></em><em><strong>coronavirus bringing people together?</strong><br>Chantal, by email</em></p> <p>Roll on, ye olde blitz spirit! We were promised that innately British pluck, the kind that had housewives chatting among the remains of their bombed-out houses as the Queen stopped by to give them tea, would get Britain through this plague. It was supposed to get us through the ravages of Brexit. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Remember that</a>? Hilarious!) Yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">the global plague</a> superseded that, which is a bit like being mid-shark attack, only for you and the shark to be swallowed suddenly by a T rex.</p> <p>Anyway \u2013 the blitz! Even the Queen referenced the second world war in her Sunday night address to the nation, because of course she did. Alas, it turns out this famous blitz spirit may have been as much of a myth as the benefits of Brexit, with some of the most famous photos from the blitz, such as the milkman doing his rounds through ruined houses, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/myth-blitz-spirit-model-coronavirus\">having long been exposed as fakes</a>.</p> <p>As for the reports of wartime British solidarity, these too have been greatly exaggerated. For example, there were reports of middle-class families in the countryside worrying that housing evacuated working-class children would result in \u201c<a href=\"https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/3517/HessS_Vol1.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y\">the spoliation of decent homes and furniture</a> [or] the corruption of speech or moral standards of our own children\u201d. Yay, blitz spirit!</p> <p>Which brings us to Britain today. How is that famed blitz spirit holding up? Well, it seemed to me that, for the first week after the sort-of-kind-of-lockdown began, it was doing OK. Putting to one side the fear of death and the death of loved ones, there was a kind of national fascination that we were all going through such a collective event. Sporting successes are few and far between, so there was a novelty in all of us knowing where almost every person in the country was (in their sitting room) and that we were all experiencing the same emotions (anxiety to boredom and back again). And then, after a week, maybe even 10 days, things turned.</p> <p>The signs were always there, with the early bursts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/03/off-our-trolleys-what-stockpiling-in-the-coronavirus-crisis-reveals-about-us\">frantic stockpiling</a> and \u2013 perhaps more telling, in retrospect \u2013 the furious tutting over said stockpiling. Because it seems to me \u2013 from my admittedly limited vantage point of reading the internet, Zooming with friends and daily 15-minute outings with the dog \u2013 that what was once a collective experience has now broken down into factions, each one snarling at the other.</p> <p>There are those who insist that people need to stop going to the park and that a walk round the block should suffice for even the most hyperactive toddler. Then there are those who wonder how the other people have gone through life without ever meeting a toddler. There are the solo isolaters, bored and lonely. There are the stressed home-schooling parents, who would rip out their own hair for empty hours of solitude. There are the people with gardens who don\u2019t understand why so many people insist on going for walks. There are the people without gardens who desperately need some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/26/top-uk-scientist-urges-people-to-take-vitamin-d-supplements\">vitamin D</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/cornwall-fears-influx-of-out-of-towners-coronavirus-will-overwhelm-nhs-services\">There are the people who fearfully run off to their second homes</a> versus those who think these people are immoral and selfish; the achievers who believe now is the time for them to write their King Lear versus the sloths who think the achievers are show-offs who should chill and watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/14/brooklyn-nine-nine-fan-power-cancelled-nbc-fox\">Brooklyn </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/14/brooklyn-nine-nine-fan-power-cancelled-nbc-fox\">Nine-Nine</a>; and, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/30/joggers-v-walkers-the-battle-for-our-pathways-during-the-coronavirus-crisis\">walkers versus </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/30/joggers-v-walkers-the-battle-for-our-pathways-during-the-coronavirus-crisis\">joggers</a>, which is the new cyclists versus drivers.</p> <p>On top of everyone looking at others and thinking they all have it easier, as if they are somehow cheating physical distancing, there is the general collective tutting. The daily tutting photos on social media of crowded parks, taken by people who don\u2019t understand that they are, in fact, part of the crowd. As a Dutch advert put it in 2010: \u201cYou are not in traffic. You are traffic.\u201d Every time I hear shouts of laughter in the street outside my house, I see my neighbours rush to the window, determined to tut at some wrongdoers \u2013 and I see my neighbours doing this because I am doing it, too.</p> <p>We are not living through the blitz, but we are fighting something unseeable and completely terrifying. So, in the absence of a concrete enemy, we vent our anger and anxiety on one another. It is understandable, even if it is not very nice. No matter what anyone says, this experience is not the same for all of us: some of us live in houses, some in flats, some are drowning in toddlers, some are not. But we are all pretty scared. So, even if the material details between us remain as unequal and unfair as ever, on an emotional level, this is a helluva leveller. And that is something to remember.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cWe are asking hard questions like who might be facing bankruptcy in the short term, because that\u2019s the reality right now,\u201d Katherine Grainger says, in her role as the head of UK Sport, as she considers the financial devastation of the global coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the honest conversations we need to have. Some sports are at short-term risk while other major sports have much bigger budgets. But because they don\u2019t have money coming in from their partners and they are not hosting events they expected some of the big sports could also be under threat. It\u2019s across the board. People\u2019s jobs and the future of sporting bodies are at stake. We just don\u2019t want to see any of the sports going under.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/27/isaac-chamberlain-ive-been-here-before-in-a-very-dark-place\">Isaac Chamberlain: 'I\u2019ve been here before, in a very dark place'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Grainger, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/11/katherine-grainger-silver-britain-most-successful-female-olympian\" title=\"\">most decorated British female Olympian of all time</a>, is the kind of intelligent and calm leader needed in a crisis. As a rower she won a medal at each of the past five Olympic Games, with her gold at London 2012 being the high point. The 44-year-old is also a six-time world champion who earned a PhD in criminal law.</p> <p>She is as amiable as ever as we talk for more than an hour but, surveying the impact of Covid-19, Grainger does not conceal the severity of the situation. UK Sport is in the midst of obtaining a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/british-sports-bodies-fear-financial-ruin-because-of-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">comprehensive health check</a> on the finances of all its Olympic and Paralympic sports. Key information is still to be collected but the early indications worry Grainger as she concedes some sports are in danger. \u201cIf [the crisis] goes on for another six months there will be a handful of sports, three or four [which could go under]. If no other financial stability was guaranteed it would go up into the teens. We have talked to about 30 sports and I think about half would be in quite serious threat if this went on.\u201d</p> <p>Grainger is understandably reluctant to name the sports in potential jeopardy but says: \u201cWe have started talking to the government and they are sympathetic but as much as we will be fighting for sport to get reassurance [of government help] as early as possible we know there are very big decisions to be made in health, education, industry and the economy. The impact on these areas must be considered first and we\u2019re not saying sport should be ahead of any of these.\u201d</p> <p>Does Grainger envisage a situation where she may have to choose which sporting bodies are kept alive? \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will be in that position but there is a chance we will end up there if we can\u2019t get some financial certainty.\u201d</p> <p>The worst effects could well be mitigated by the \u00a3195m Sport England plans to inject into grassroots sport. Grainger also looks up on my laptop screen, as we are doing this interview remotely, and offers a familiar smile of encouragement. \u201cThe Olympics and Paralympics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-olympics-to-be-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">will be next summer</a> as long as this pandemic hasn\u2019t worsened. It would be an incredible opportunity for fit and healthy nations to come together again. We could have quite a celebration if the world\u2019s in a better place.</p> <p>\u201cJust think how it would feel if we could all come together again, watching something together, united in actual physical contact. With that in mind you feel Great Britain would want our teams to be as best prepared as possible but everyone is going to have some financial need over the next 12 months, in different areas, and rightly so.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b33d5ff8da0e7187feb1cbb73264579c53461695\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b33d5ff8da0e7187feb1cbb73264579c53461695/0_219_3600_2160/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins with their gold medals for the women\u2019s double sculls at the London 2012 Olympic Games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins with their gold medals for the women\u2019s double sculls at the London 2012 Olympic Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Has the crisis made her think even more deeply about moral questions as to how sport is funded \u2013 and how much money it deserves compared with health and education? \u201cIt has because we\u2019re suddenly in a very different world. We\u2019re always needing more money and we feel sport can spread inspiration across the nation but the pandemic has put everything on hold. It forces you to ask the right questions. Ultimately, what is important? What role should sport play in our lives?</p> <p>\u201cIn a global crisis we need to think how we will feel when we look back at this period in a year or 10 years\u2019 time. We will think: \u2018What part did we play?\u2019 Those of us who work in sport and love sport always believe in its inspiration. But when deaths are coming and people are losing jobs, sport has a deeper role. How can sport help communities rebuild? Sport still has its part to play but not in the way we expect in more ordinary times.\u201d</p> <p>Sport will almost certainly have to accept less money than it has been given in the past. The problem is complicated by the fact that the current four-year cycle for Olympic and Paralympic sport ends next March. How will sporting bodies fund their teams as they prepare for Tokyo that summer? \u201cSome money will be saved by not travelling and not competing but we\u2019re looking at a cycle when some sports will suffer big losses. We\u2019re looking at who\u2019s going to be at risk in the next few months and what is ultimately needed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve reassured everyone the money is in place until March and going right through next summer but we don\u2019t have any money for next summer yet so we\u2019re putting it to government as well. We could say it\u2019s as simple as needing a 12-month rollover, because we have a new Olympic year coming up, but do we accept a reduced three-year funding cycle for Paris in 2024?</p> <p>\u201cEach has different ramifications so a few scenarios are being worked on. We\u2019ve had a call with the sports minister and the people in the civil service, the DCMS [the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport], have been very supportive and understanding. We\u2019re confident they feel sport has to remain ambitious and our teams prepare properly. We just have to see whether that\u2019s feasible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/04/olympic-football-age-limit-raised-to-24-tokyo-games-postponement\">Olympic men's football age limit raised to 24 after Tokyo Games postponement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is an additional worry for Grainger because much of UK Sport\u2019s funding comes from the national lottery \u2013 and ticket sales had begun to dwindle long before coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s always a concern. Other lotteries have emerged and that\u2019s complicated things. The obvious prediction is that this is not going to be a good time for lottery sales. This will have a direct impact on sport. So we do not have an easy financial future.\u201d</p> <p>Grainger has been the chair of UK Sport for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/21/katherine-grainger-chair-uk-sport\" title=\"\">exactly three years this month</a> and feels confident she can negotiate the minefield as to which sports deserve funding when the next cycle begins. She acknowledges some sports \u2013 including badminton and wheelchair rugby \u2013 have cause to feel they have been harshly treated and suggests the crisis will demand an even more thoughtful approach.</p> <p>When she began the job, UK Sport was emerging from 10 years where the mantra of \u201cno compromise\u201d underpinned the belief that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/12/uk-sport-no-compromise-funding-olympics\" title=\"\">only medals counted</a>. A bullying culture pervaded some sports and the mental health of many athletes was affected. Grainger has encouraged a more balanced approach to elite sport but stresses the climate had already shifted in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cRio was our most successful Olympics and Paralympics but it didn\u2019t take long for athletes to say there was a human cost. When I came in UK Sport was already responding, so I can\u2019t take all the credit for changing the culture. As a former athlete I could say of course it\u2019s competitive high performance and it will always feel hard. That\u2019s not a bad thing but it should also feel safe and people should be able to speak out.</p> <p>\u201cWe had an environment where some people thought they could behave in any way as long as medals were being won. That\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s a lot better now but we shouldn\u2019t sit back because it\u2019s constantly evolving.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a5c6a8f312b90ed3fecf41a43b4088b85bf063f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a5c6a8f312b90ed3fecf41a43b4088b85bf063f/266_0_2592_1556/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Grainger and Victoria Thornley in action during the women\u2019s double sculls heats at Rio 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katherine Grainger and Victoria Thornley in action during the women\u2019s double sculls heats at Rio 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Robichon/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before Covid-19 Grainger\u2019s ambition had been evident in her belief it was conceivable GB could one day top the medals table at an Olympic Games. Was this a specific aim? \u201cNot necessarily. We had been asked about our biggest ambitions by the media. Could we ever become the best Olympic nation globally? We did a piece of work to see whether it was feasible to become No 1. The results were that it\u2019s possible but it would take a significant investment over three Olympic cycles.</p> <p>\u201cIt was useful to tell our government this was possible but some of the new Olympic sports haven\u2019t played to our strengths. So we\u2019re up against more than expected and it would be at least three Olympics away. It\u2019s a long-term thing but we were looking mainly for public feedback as to what they want from sport. They wanted more sports to be given the opportunity. The public like a broader range of sports to win medals. The key move would be to maximise the number of sports with medal potential.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and thebiggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such talk hardly matters now. Surely Grainger would settle for Britain slipping down from second in Rio to fifth or sixth place at Tokyo if money was spent in areas of society which need it most? \u201cThere\u2019s some comfort being in the top five. If we\u2019re anywhere in that top five we can take a lot of pride. I don\u2019t think people will remember where we finished after a while. They will remember the stories rather than the details and numbers.\u201d</p> <p>We discuss how sport can lift a national mood and the conversation lightens. \u201cI am ultimately a helpless optimist,\u201d Grainger says. \u201cThat helped me through a lot of worry and adversity when I was competing. So I am still excited about the future of UK Sport not only in terms of medals but in having a positive impact on society once we get out of this crisis. I see all the good sport can do. So we should remain ambitious. Sport still has an important role to play.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Together with cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes has become one of the world\u2019s four major non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and one of the only chronic diseases that continues to increase in prevalence.</p> <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes\" rel=\"nofollow\">422 million in 2014</a>, and in 2016 it caused 1.6 million deaths, making it the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death\" rel=\"nofollow\">seventh leading cause of death</a>.

Patients with type 1 diabetes can\u2019t produce insulin in the pancreas due to an auto-immune disease, while those with type 2, once called adult-onset \u2013 as it often develops in later life \u2013 no longer produce insulin because of issues such as excessive body weight and insufficient exercise. It\u2019s estimated that type 2 diabetes accounts for 90-95% of cases worldwide.</p> <p>The pharmaceutical industry is ramping up efforts to tackle diabetes through <a href=\"https://globalhealthprogress.org/?s=&amp;diseases=938,941,\" rel=\"nofollow\">Global Health Progress</a>, with more than 40 partnerships now researching new medicines, as well as new ways in which to diagnose and raise awareness of the disease.</p> <p>But what\u2019s important, says Vanessa Peberdy, head of NCD advocacy and policy at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), is that<strong> </strong>\u201cthe dialogue around diabetes treatment and care is not just confined to discussions on affordability and access to insulin. While this is clearly a critical issue, improving treatment and care requires a holistic approach that recognises the complexity of the condition.

They can struggle to complete their education, and find employment and marriage partners, and really do face a lot of social stigma.\u201d</p> <p>The charity supplies local health centres with insulin, as well as blood glucose meters and testing strips, which Klatman says are an equally important part of effectively treating diabetes.</p> <p>It\u2019s a point echoed by McGuire. \u201cSelf-care is essential to meet the daily demands of managing diabetes \u2013 therefore it is critical to take a people-centered approach to designing solutions,\u201d she says. \u201cCo-packaging of insulin, syringes, and glucose monitoring devices and strips together at an affordable price would go a long way to support people living with diabetes to safely administer insulin and monitor their glucose levels in low- and middle-income countries.\u201d</p> <p>Next year is the centenary of insulin\u2019s discovery, and ever since its first use the pharmaceutical industry has been developing new ways in which it can be delivered to patients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2edafb92bfc14f90cebbc7a5f72fa72ff3c5e243\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2edafb92bfc14f90cebbc7a5f72fa72ff3c5e243/0_0_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Active life of diabetics, woman hiking and checking glucose level with a remote sensor and mobile phone, sensor checkup glucose levels without blood.

Now researchers are exploring an oral treatment for type 2 diabetes that will mean patients no longer need to inject at all. A smart insulin patch is also being developed that delivers tailored amounts of insulin into the bloodstream, and a new generation of insulin pumps can now be connected wirelessly to a blood glucose meter or under-the-skin sensor to monitor and regulate insulin.<br><br>Research into the development of an artificial pancreas at the University of Cambridge is on-going, as is R&amp;D into cell therapy, when living cells are injected into patients to take over the function of the faulty ones.</p> <p>Sanofi, which along with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly make up the big three insulin manufacturers, has recently changed its approach to diabetes, shifting emphasis from new treatments to helping people to use existing medicines more effectively.</p> <p>Working with Biocorp, for instance, Sanofi is developing a new connected pen that automatically records dosage information through a mobile app. Its MyStar DoseCoach blood glucose meter uses a dose adjustment (titration) scheme to recommend daily doses of long-acting insulin, based on daily blood sugar measurements linked to any incidents of low blood sugar through the day.</p> <p>Looking at the economics of diabetes, Novo Nordisk\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.novonordisk.com/content/dam/Denmark/HQ/sustainablebusiness/performance-on-tbl/Acess%20to%20care/BoP/BoPevaluationbyUCL_2017.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Base of the Pyramid programme</a> in Kenya addresses the many barriers to diabetes care faced by people on low incomes. It takes on board issues such as poverty, geography and gender, as well as the limitations of national health systems. Cost of transport, having to miss a day\u2019s work and the need to buy equipment such as syringes are also flagged up.</p> <p>Through working in partnerships across the supply chain, one of its successes has been a 75% reduction in the price of insulin. But, explains Soraya Ramoul, Novo Nordisk\u2019s director of global access to care,<strong> </strong>the programme also showed that the price reduction in itself does not provide people with access to good care. \u201cDiabetes is a complex condition, which requires a systemic approach to ensure basic quality care and management,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cAffordability of insulin is just one of the necessary components, along with creating awareness in the communities, building capacity for care and medicine supply, educating patients, improving demand forecasting and reducing transportation costs for the patients.\u201d</p> <p>Klatman sees the growth of partnerships like this as crucial to providing the level of diabetes care that is needed in developing countries, and looks forward to the day when families \u201care able to access insulin and other supplies without being exposed to financial risk, and having to make really tough decisions to keep their kids alive\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>For many people who are homeless, or those struggling with insecure, unaffordable housing, the idea of a steady, rewarding job is little more than a pipe dream. Aside from the lack of suitable accommodation \u2013 without which it\u2019s hard to build foundations for the future \u2013 they may have to overcome additional issues, such as mental health problems. This can make employment opportunities more challenging.</p> <p>Gareth Jones, 37, from Blackburn, who experienced homelessness and has battled addiction, puts it succinctly: \u201cYou think no one will ever give you a chance because your past looks like you always mess up.\u201d</p> <p>To address this vicious cycle, an initiative by Shelter is helping homeless people turn their lives around with full-time employment. Getting Real Opportunities of Work (GROW) traineeships are 12- to 18-month paid placements that offer people with lived experience of homelessness and housing problems, as well as ex-offenders, and people with mental health or addiction problems, access to meaningful work, training and personal development opportunities.</p> <p>The scheme was launched in 2014 by Shelter\u2019s <a href=\"https://inspiringchangemanchester.shelter.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inspiring Change Manchester</a>, a National Lottery Community-funded programme. GROW aims to provide meaningful employment opportunities within a supportive environment that allows people to learn on the job and, importantly, use their own lived experience positively. The programme also ensures that \u201cexperts by experience\u201d help shape and are integral in developing Shelter\u2019s services, new initiatives and policy solutions.</p> <p>Jones is one of seven trainees currently employed by the <a href=\"https://blog.shelter.org.uk/2019/07/how-co-production-creates-opportunities-for-all/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GROW programme</a>. He suffered three spells of homelessness, including nine months sleeping rough in Amsterdam. A cannabis habit, which started at the age of 15, had escalated into addiction.</p> <p>\u201cI made stupid decisions,\u201d he says. \u201cI blew my wages on hedonistic pursuits and the lack of stability became worse and worse. Living the life I was, building my day around weed, I knew I was never going to get anywhere in life. Ultimately I had to admit it to myself and do something about it.\u201d</p> <p>Jones was eventually persuaded to return to Blackburn to live with his parents. He set about tackling his dependency and attempted to find a stable job. While he was looking for work at a jobcentre, he came across GROW.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/shelter-supporting-those-who-are-struggling/2020/apr/06/until-they-got-involved-i-was-beginning-to-think-this-was-the-end-of-me-how-shelter-changes-the-lives-of-those-in-need\">\u2018Until they got involved I was beginning to think this was the end of me\u2019: how Shelter changes the lives of those in need</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d like to help others going through the same thing I had, so I typed \u2018homelessness\u2019 into the job finder and among the results it generated was the GROW traineeship.\u201d He was offered an interview and it was clear from the start, he says, this was not the typical box-ticking process or a tokenistic placement. \u201cI\u2019ve had loads of interviews and lots of jobs, all of them manual but they were purely to make enough money to live and buy weed. This instantly looked different and useful.\u201d</p> <p>GROW applicants are carefully selected because a job offer entails a considerable commitment from everyone, particularly staff, as programme coordinator Darren de Vally, explains.</p> <p>\u201cThe process is very important. You\u2019re recruiting people with very complex personal histories so it\u2019s important they feel it\u2019s worthwhile applying in the first place. We make it simple, but we need to identify the right people who would really benefit from the traineeship in order to move forward.\u201d</p> <p>All interviews are conducted by a panel of three, which includes someone with lived experience. Anyone who doesn\u2019t receive an offer is given thorough feedback and encouragement to stay involved with Shelter in some way.</p> <p>Once an offer is made and a job assigned \u2013 for Jones this was a placement with Inspiring Change Manchester\u2019s Engagement team \u2013 a careful structure is put in place to ensure the applicant receives meaningful training and support throughout their employment. They\u2019re assigned a day-to-day line manager and a development officer responsible for wellbeing and development, who is someone with lived experience of their own.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very important that people are properly supported,\u201d says de Vally. \u201cWe make sure every trainee gets as much support as they require. It can be quite intensive sometimes, but we find the benefits far outweigh the effort, not just for them but for the people they support in turn and the expertise they bring to the organisation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0df9aa9a7d08682bb82b82799b3f2bd31ad94682\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0df9aa9a7d08682bb82b82799b3f2bd31ad94682/0_151_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SUPPORTING GROW trainee project Manchester June 2019 Gareth \u00a9 SHELTER Alexandra Smart 2019 34\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Jones (above) now works with Inspiring Change Manchester\u2019s Engagement team, helping people who are homeless off the street and into temporary accommodation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandra Smart/Shelter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jones has now been a GROW trainee for 10 months. His daily workload involves dealing with homeless referrals, helping people off the street into temporary accommodation, setting them up with benefits and addressing other challenges. Sometimes it\u2019s pressured \u2013 our first interview is cancelled because one of his clients is threatened with eviction and Jones has to access legal support and help him to find alternative accommodation as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>\u201cI never would have imagined getting into this line of work before, but I\u2019ve now got the confidence to liaise with other professionals,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand a lot about the law and how it relates to people leaving custody on probation, and the conditionalities of being released under licence. I can help people to access support with medical issues and I\u2019m capable of engaging with them about their drug issues. I can do outreach on the streets and people relate to me because I\u2019ve been there.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of my own recovery I can hardly go and encourage people to turn their back on substances if I\u2019m still doing it myself, it gives me some discipline to practise what I preach.\u201d</p> <p>The GROW programme\u2019s target is to help people like Jones into full-time employment but the trainees\u2019 experience also benefits Shelter because many trainees move on to further roles, in addition to helping to effect wider systems change.</p> <p>\u201cThe scheme has a huge impact on the individuals who go through it, but beyond that they go on to shape the way we deliver our services and campaigns going forward,\u201d says Lucy Flegg, Shelter\u2019s national involvement manager, of why the programme has begun to take on such importance. \u201cWe believe the best way to deliver our services is if we\u2019re led by people who have firsthand experience of the issues.\u201d</p> <p>The GROW programme is proving a success. To date, 56 people have been enrolled, seven are still with the programme and 44 have moved on to further employment. Others have gone into study or further training. The scheme has expanded to London and Sheffield and places will be offered in Plymouth and Lancashire in the next few months. Shelter is keen to roll out the GROW programme nationally but it requires significant investment.</p> <p>The programme has also been key to generating wider public and political engagement on the issues facing people who are homeless or in precarious accommodation. Notably, a traineeship with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority helped to shape some of the city\u2019s homelessness strategy, and a GROW trainee appeared with Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham for a number of public and media engagements, including BBC Breakfast.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tested model that has excellent outcomes and the scope for growth within our organisation and the wider homeless sector, especially in areas like housing policy development and research, is huge. However, we need to attract further funding,\u201d says Flegg.</p> <p>Those who go through the programme have no doubt about its value. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve made real progress,\u201d says Jones. \u201cI hope other professions would consider employing people with lived experience in their workforce. You can\u2019t afford to write off all those people out there. For me, the ability to tackle these issues daily is empowering. I get a real sense of mission accomplished when I go home at night now.\u201d<br><br><em><a href=\"https://blog.shelter.org.uk/2019/07/how-co-production-creates-opportunities-for-all/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Find out more about GROW here</a></em></p>",

But in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/sites/default/files/rpt_1810_watershutoffs-web2.pdf\">one in every 20 households</a> were disconnected by public water departments, leaving an estimated 15 million Americans without running water.</p> <h2>\u2018Communities most vulnerable to Covid-19 are most vulnerable to water shutoffs\u2019</h2> <p>The highest shutoffs rates were concentrated in southern and rural states including Louisiana, Arkansas, Florida and Oklahoma. Some of the hardest-hit towns and cities including New Orleans, Detroit, Milwaukee, Mecklenburg, Ada and Dekalb are now Covid-19 hot-spots, according to analysis by the Guardian.</p> <p>In New Orleans, which has the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#g-cases-by-county\">fourth highest rate of coronavirus infection per capita </a>in the country, only 300 households have so far been reconnected and the city does not know how many remain without running water.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a package of related factors \u2013 institutional racism, environmental injustice, and poverty \u2013 which means communities most vulnerable to Covid-19 are the same communities most vulnerable to water shutoffs,\u201d said Grant.</p> <p>So far, the moratoriums on shutoffs include 12 statewide orders, which apply to private and public water providers, issued by the governors of California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin.</p> <p>On Monday a coalition of community groups were set to call on New York governor Andrew Cuomo to issue a moratorium on price hikes, fines and shutoffs until 180 days after the end of the state of emergency.</p> <p>Currently, 8.5 million stateside New Yorkers still face the threat of disconnection if they fail to keep up with bills, while the number of households without running water is unknown. Shutoffs have been banned in New York City since before the pandemic, but in Buffalo for example, taps were turned off on 17,000 occasions between 2015 and March 2019. Buffalo has <a href=\"https://buffalonews.com/2020/03/19/erie-county-water-authority-wont-shut-off-water-for-nonpayment-during-pandemic/\">suspended shutoffs </a>but is not reconnecting those without running water.</p> <h2>\u2018Access to water is a poor person\u2019s issue\u2019</h2> <p>Meanwhile, there are signs of some political will to tackle the issue in Washington.</p> <p>The House version of the third rescue package included $1.5bn to assist low income households with water bills during the crisis, and a condition which required localities and utilities to suspend utility shutoffs in order to qualify for financial aid.</p> <p>But the clauses were left out of the final bill approved by the senate on 26 March.</p> <p>Instead, congressional Democrats want $12bn for water subsidies in the fourth rescue package, with grants for utilities conditional on shutoff moratoriums. <a href=\"https://www.nacwa.org/news-publications/press-release-details/2020/03/20/coronavirus-impacting-clean-water-agencies-local-utilities-and-ratepayers-need-assistance\">The National Association of Clean Water Agencies expects the pandemic to cost $12.5b</a><a href=\"https://www.nacwa.org/news-publications/press-release-details/2020/03/20/coronavirus-impacting-clean-water-agencies-local-utilities-and-ratepayers-need-assistance\">n in</a> lost revenue due to unpaid bills, debt forgiveness and restoring service.</p> <p>Last week, House speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled plans to propose $85bn for water projects in a subsequent forthcoming<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/491014-pelosi-scales-back-coronavirus-infrastructure-proposal\"> infrastructure bill to stimulate economic recovery</a>.</p> <p>Almost 28 million people could lose their jobs by May, according to forecasting firm Oxford Economics \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/03/us-jobs-report-march-unemployment-coronavirus\"> more than double the jobs cut during the 2007 to 2009 </a>recession and its aftermath.</p> <p>Congresswoman Lawrence said: \u201cAccess to water has not been a priority in this country because it\u2019s been a poor person\u2019s issue ... now it\u2019s a national concern and we have to transform our mindset.\u201d</p>",

He is currently in Pakistan with his family ahead of Ramadan, but he\u2019s leaning toward coming back to the US.</p> <p>\u201cThis was what we signed up for, right?\u201d Hussain said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a fire out there, firefighters can\u2019t sort of count themselves out.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not alone in his sense of duty right now, but he is among the few who have been given a path to action. There\u2019s a much larger army of medical students in the US impatiently awaiting their marching orders even as some of their schools bench them during the greatest fight of their young lives.</p> <p>\u201cI just feel like I\u2019m being sidelined at a time when the world needs help medically the most, and it\u2019s frustrating for me,\u201d said Haley Shumway, who attends the Rocky Vista University college of osteopathic medicine.</p> <p>Coronavirus has completely upended medical students\u2019 lives as learning goes virtual, schools restrict direct patient care to varying degrees and graduation ceremonies lose their pomp and circumstance. A student population accustomed to planning years in advance is being told to sit tight even as their country is in dire need of the skill sets and specialties they have been developing for years.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m in this limbo place, where I have training to help, but I\u2019m also being told to stay at home,\u201d said Kelly McDermott, who graduates from Eastern Virginia medical school this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8495f779454d5eb5874d3a2dc32eefb77afba99d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8495f779454d5eb5874d3a2dc32eefb77afba99d/0_0_6132_3826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Healthcare workers with the University of Nevada Las Vegas School of Medicine wait in personal protective equipment for patients at a drive-thru coronavirus testing site on 24 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Healthcare workers with the University of Nevada Las Vegas school of medicine wait in personal protective equipment for patients at a drive-thru coronavirus testing site on 24 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Locher/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adam Eddington, a student at Dartmouth\u2019s Geisel school of medicine, was working in pediatrics when he was pulled from patient care by his school. Even though Covid-19 hasn\u2019t affected children as much as other demographics, Eddington gets that it wouldn\u2019t be fair for him to progress normally in his training while so many of his peers can\u2019t. Still, he wrestled with his school\u2019s choice for a bit.</p> <p>\u201cI think all in all it was the right decision,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as I know, it\u2019s unprecedented, and it\u2019s gonna take a lot of work to make sure that we adapt and move forward to try to get all the experience and get all the qualifications that are necessary to make us really good physicians. But I have faith in the systems in place to try to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Many students learned that they would be temporarily removed from direct patient care a few weeks ago, around the same time that the<a href=\"https://www.aamc.org/system/files/2020-03/meded-March-30-Interim-Guidance-on-Medical-Students-Clinical-Participation_0.pdf\"> Association of American Medical</a> Colleges issued guidance on the subject.</p> <p>Alison Whelan, chief medical education officer for the AAMC, said her organization encouraged members to suspend clinical experiences because of personal protective equipment shortages, a lack of widely available, rapid testing and the need to limit contact between people as much as possible. She and her colleagues have since reiterated their guidance, unless there\u2019s a critical local need for healthcare workers.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of us understand that we aren\u2019t the most essential as medical students, \u2019cause we\u2019re learning. But at the same time, a lot of us wanted to be involved and wanted to learn how to handle situations like this in the future,\u201d said Sara Grant, a student at the Oakland University William Beaumont school of medicine.</p> <p>The suggestion doesn\u2019t mean students have to stop learning, Whelan said, or even that their rotations have to end. In practice, it\u2019s been handled in different ways, depending on the school.</p> <p>At Oakland, Grant said she and her classmates were participating in virtual lectures, working through interactive cases and physical exam videos, and doing other supplements to try to troubleshoot for what they were missing in-person. Similarly, Dartmouth moved almost entirely online, and Eddington said students like him suddenly had access to a series of non-clinical electives as well as swiftly organized Covid-19 ethics and microbiology courses.</p> <p>Shumway wasn\u2019t given guidance from Rocky Vista for a week and a half, beyond studying for exams. But eventually, the school sent an email asking students to fill support roles in and outside the hospital \u2013 everything from comforting overflow patients to triaging over the phone.</p> <p>At the University of California, San Francisco school of medicine, students were not categorically removed from patient care, except for known or suspected Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>John Davis,<a href=\"https://meded.ucsf.edu/md-program/current-students/student-services/advising-career-development/school-medicine-deans\"> associate dean for curriculum at the school</a>, called it an \u201ceducational imperative\u201d to give especially his most advanced learners the opportunity to watch people who are responding to the crisis in real time before they in turn assume some of those responsibilities.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, I do think that the students who are graduating now will graduate with additional skills and competencies that other cohorts might not have had, which is being able to respond to a pandemic,\u201d Davis said.</p> <p>Students who have had their clinical experiences put on pause aren\u2019t just twiddling their thumbs. Even before Shumway got more detailed direction from her school, she was scrounging up ways to use her medical knowledge outside of a patient care environment. After hearing a lot of dangerous rumors and pseudoscience circulating around the coronavirus pandemic, she decided to<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/401159990\"> make a podcast</a> that set the record straight.</p> <p>Vitamin C and essential oils can\u2019t cure Covid-19, she explained. Saunas and hot baths won\u2019t prevent infection, either. And swishing vinegar doesn\u2019t do much of anything to fight the disease, despite a meme her friend posted on Facebook claiming otherwise.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not comparing the common cold to this virus, but the common cold is also a virus. And has your mother ever asked you to go swallow some vinegar to get rid of your cold? No,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Other students are babysitting for physicians, donating blood, volunteering at food drives, rounding up personal protective equipment from local businesses, or even just providing accurate information to their networks as panic and fake news around the pandemic spreads.</p> <p>\u201cThose things are meaningful now, and they need to believe that,\u201d Whelan said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some are already readying themselves for the next time their country calls.</p> <p>\u201cLife is really, really short, and it should be spent wearing yourself out, trying to help people,\u201d Eddington said. \u201cAnd if that means that I get worn out trying to help people in the next pandemic, then that would be fine.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong>What is Covid-19 and what are the symptoms?</strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19\">Covid-19</a> is the illness caused by a novel member of the coronavirus family that has transferred from animals to humans. The most common symptoms are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell.</p> \n<p>About 80% of people experience a mild case and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people become seriously ill.</p> \n<p><strong>How do I know if I have coronavirus and what happens next?</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bde155c3-43e7-4929-8506-bb043a798a88\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2JsWf-2nN1Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>How do I protect myself and others from the coronavirus?</strong></p> \n<p>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds each time, and use hand sanitiser gel. Catch coughs and sneezes with a disposable tissue and bin the tissue. If you don\u2019t have a tissue available, cough and sneeze into the crook of your arm. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.</p> \n<p><strong>How should I self-isolate if I am showing symptoms?</strong></p> \n<p>Different countries have set different rules, but broadly speaking, if you live alone and develop a new continuous cough or a high temperature it is recommended to stay at home for seven days after symptoms began. If you live with others, everyone in the house must stay at home and not leave for 14 days. Studies show that people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-sufferers-symptom-free-for-five-days-on-average-study\">have the coronavirus without symptoms for five days on average</a>.</p> \n<p>The infection may spread from person to person in shared houses. If anyone else starts to show symptoms while already in isolation, they must stay at home for seven days from the moment their own symptoms start, regardless of where they are in the 14-day isolation period. <strong>Check with your local medical authorities for specific advice that may be applied in your area.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>What is social and physical distancing?</strong></p> \n<p>Many authorities are asking people to practise social and physical distancing. To reduce the spread of the virus, you should avoid meeting up with friends and family who don\u2019t live with you. If you need to see the doctor or other essential services, use the phone, internet or social media if possible. In some places, you can go out for a walk for exercise and to buy essentials, but stay two metres apart from others. <strong>Check with local authorities for specific rules that may be applied in your area.</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/shopping-tips-20200324-4-zip/giv-3902rCHOYPc81Nh7\" data-alt=\"Tips for safer shopping\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/shopping-tips-20200324-4-zip/giv-3902rCHOYPc81Nh7\">Tips for safer shopping</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>How do I care for someone suffering from Covid-19?</strong></p> \n<p>Keep the patient rested and comfortable in loose-fitting clothing, keep the room where they are well ventilated, and ensure they drink plenty of water. Over-the counter pain relief may be helpful \u2013 but paracetamol (Tylenol) is recommended rather than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil).</p> \n<p>To prevent the coronavirus spreading within the household, if possible keep the patient in their own separate room and using a separate bathroom. They should have separate cutlery, crockery, bedding and towels, and preferably wear a mask.

If you\u2019re showing symptoms of coronavirus or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. However, masks will probably make little difference if you\u2019re just walking around town, and are no guarantee of protection.

They found that it was still detectable on copper for up to four hours, on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours.

The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell\u2019s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process. The spikes latch on to human cells about four times more strongly than those on the related Sars coronavirus. This suggests that coronavirus particles inhaled through the nose or mouth have a high chance of attaching to cells in the upper respiratory tract, meaning relatively few are needed for an infection to gain a foothold.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/new-study-sheds-light-on-coronavirus-infection-mechanism\">Study sheds light on coronavirus infection mechanism</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>What happens to people\u2019s lungs when they get coronavirus?</strong></p> \n<p>The cough and fever is a result of the infection reaching the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside. The lining of the air passages become injured, causing inflammation. The inflammation can spread throughout the lungs, causing them to fill with liquid, making breathing difficult. The lungs are then unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, which can cause death.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-what-happens-to-peoples-lungs-if-they-get-covid-19\">What happens to people\u2019s lungs when they get coronavirus</a>?</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Where did the coronavirus originate?</strong></p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/first-covid-19-case-happened-in-november-china-government-records-show-report\">first recorded case of the coronavirus</a> is believed to have emerged in November 2019 in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. Many of those first affected had worked in or visited the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the city of 11 million people.</p> \n<p><strong>Have there been other coronaviruses?</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) were both caused by coronaviruses that made the leap from animals to humans. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750.</p> \n<p><strong>What is the mortality rate of the new coronavirus?</strong></p> \n<p>It is probably about or a bit less than 1%. The rate appears to be as high as 4% from globally confirmed case figures, but it is likely that many mild cases are going undetected. However a 1% mortality rate would still make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally. The death rate also increases significantly for people over 60.</p> \n<p><strong>Why is it a pandemic and what does that mean?</strong></p> \n<p>A pandemic is declared by WHO when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads in multiple countries simultaneously.

  "<p>Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is poised to declare a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures as early as Tuesday in an attempt to stem a sharp rise in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> cases in the capital and other major cities.</p> <p>The measure, to go into effect for about a month, will enable local authorities to urge people to stay at home except to shop for food, seek medical care, go to work if necessary, and take daily exercise.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope to declare a state of emergency as early as tomorrow after listening to the opinions of the advisory panel,\u201d Abe told reporters on Monday evening.</p> <p>\u201cWe are seeing rapid increases of new infections, particularly in urban areas such as Tokyo and Osaka.</p> <p>\u201cConsidering that medical institutions are facing a critical situation, I have received opinions that the government should prepare to declare a state of emergency.\u201d</p> <p>Abe\u2019s apparent reluctance to implement tougher measures earlier in the crisis had drawn criticism from the Japan Medical Association and Yuriko Koike, the governor of Tokyo, where confirmed cases have surged in the past week.</p> <p>Japan has avoided the large number of Covid-19 cases and deaths that have prompted lockdowns in other countries, but there is growing alarm over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/karaoke-shutdown-in-tokyo-amid-calls-for-covid-19-state-of-emergency-in-japan\">rise in infections in the capital</a>, particularly among young people.</p> <p>Tokyo reported a record 148 new cases on Sunday, with a further 83 on Monday taking its total to over 1,000, according to the public broadcaster NHK. The majority of confirmed cases over the weekend involved people aged below 50, with many in their 20s and 30s.</p> <p>More than 3,500 people have tested positive and 85 have died from the virus in Japan, NHK said. While the figures are low compared to the US, China and parts of Europe, officials are concerned that a surge in infections could place intolerable strain on the country\u2019s hospitals.</p> <p>The declaration will allow the governors of Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures to call on people to stay at home and businesses to close, but they will not have the legal authority to impose the kind of lockdowns seen in other countries, or to fine residents who ignore the request.</p> <p>\u201cIf you ask me if we can enforce a lockdown like France, the answer is no,\u201d Abe told MPs last week.</p> <p>He is also expected to unveil \u201cunprecedented\u201d stimulus measures in response to the \u201cbiggest crisis\u201d the global economy has faced since the second world war, according to a draft document.</p> <p>The 108 trillion yen (\u00a3800bn) package, which has yet to be finalised, would be much bigger than the country\u2019s response in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/commuted-sentence-covid-19-spares-the-japanese-salaryman-from-ritual-exhaustion\">Commuted sentence: Covid-19 spares the Japanese salaryman from ritual exhaustion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Koike has voiced concern over the high number of untraced cases and growing pressure on the city\u2019s hospitals, and supports a \u201csoft\u201d lockdown to protect the city\u2019s 14 million residents.</p> <p>Legal revisions passed last month gave Abe scope to declare a state of emergency if the coronavirus outbreak posed a \u201cgrave danger\u201d to public health and threatened serious damage to the world\u2019s third-biggest economy, which is now on the brink of recession.</p> <p>Officials are hoping peer pressure will encourage people to stay at home and to practise social distancing when they go out. Businesses that refuse to cooperate face being publicly named and shamed.</p> <p>In addition, local leaders will be able to requisition facilities to use as temporary medical centres and order the closure of schools and other gathering places such as theatres, music venues and stadiums. Most of the country\u2019s schools have been closed for more than a month following a request by Abe.</p> <p>His declaration is initially expected to target the greater Tokyo metropolitan area \u2013 with a population of more than 36 million \u2013 along with Osaka and five other areas.</p> <p>Under the declaration, hospitals will be able to transfer people with mild symptoms to specially designated hotels to free up medical facilities for more serious cases, local media reported.</p> <p>Abe has faced accusations that he and other officials started seriously addressing the outbreak only after it became inevitable that the Olympics, initially due to be held in Tokyo this summer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/30/tokyo-olympics-to-start-in-july-2021-after-coronavirus-rescheduling\">would have to be postponed</a>.</p> <p>Schools and many other public facilities have been closed for a month, and some companies are allowing employees to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/commuted-sentence-covid-19-spares-the-japanese-salaryman-from-ritual-exhaustion\">work from home</a>, but calls to avoid socialising at bars and restaurants have failed to resonate.</p> <p>Citing evidence of infection clusters in entertainment districts, Koike has urged residents to stay at home for the past two weekends and to avoid crowded places until 12 April.</p> <p>The message appeared to have got through this weekend, with several restaurant chains and shops, along with the capital\u2019s ubiquitous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2014/aug/20/japanese-pachinko-pinball-game-in-pictures\">pachinko</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/25/going-solo-japanese-businesses-target-customers-who-want-to-be-alone\">karaoke</a> parlours, closing their doors.

  "<p>THOUGH we can slow the spread of Covid-19, through confinement and other social distancing measures, and scientists are developing drugs to treat its symptoms, the only way to actually prevent people from catching Covid-19 is with a vaccine \u2013 and we don\u2019t yet have one of those.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5?utm_source=Nature+Briefing&amp;utm_campaign=5b9694b416-briefing-wk-20200409&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_c9dfd39373-5b9694b416-42033935\">Nearly 80</a> companies and academic institutions are racing to produce one, and of those, five are already testing their vaccine candidates in people. The first of these to enter human trials \u2013 one produced by Boston-based biotech company Moderna \u2013 did so on 16 March.</p> \n<p>This unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/when-will-we-have-a-coronavirus-vaccine\">Coronavirus vaccine: when will we have one?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But there is another reason for the head start. Though nobody could have predicted that the next infectious disease to threaten the globe would be caused by a coronavirus \u2013 flu is generally considered to pose the greatest pandemic risk \u2013 vaccinologists had hedged their bets by working on \u201cprototype\u201d pathogens. \u201cThe speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,\u201d says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Oslo-based nonprofit the <a href=\"https://cepi.net/\" title=\"\">Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations</a> (Cepi), which is leading efforts to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/heres-how-body-gains-immunity-coronavirus\">Here's how your body gains immunity to coronavirus | Zania Stamataki</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Coronaviruses have caused two other recent epidemics \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China in 2002-04, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In both cases, work began on vaccines that were later shelved when the outbreaks were contained. One company, Maryland-based Novavax, has now repurposed those vaccines for Sars-CoV-2, and says it has several candidates ready to enter human trials this spring. Moderna, meanwhile, built on earlier work on the Mers virus conducted at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland.</p> \n<p>SARS-CoV-2 shares between 80% and 90% of its genetic material with the virus that caused SARS \u2013 hence its name. Both consist of a strip of RNA enclosed in a fatty shell through which protrude many protein spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung \u2013 the same type of receptor in both cases \u2013 allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell\u2019s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process.</p> \n<p>All vaccines work according to the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of an injection and at a low dose, to prompt the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen. Antibodies are a kind of immune memory which, having been elicited once, can be quickly mobilised again if the person is exposed to the virus in its natural form.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Like most vaccinologists, I don\u2019t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Professor Annelies Wilder-Smith</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Traditionally, immunisation has been achieved using live, weakened forms of the virus, or part or whole of the virus once it has been inactivated by heat or chemicals. These methods have drawbacks. The live form can continue to evolve in the host, for example, potentially recapturing some of its virulence and making the recipient sick, while higher or repeat doses of the inactivated virus are required to achieve the necessary degree of protection. Some of the Covid-19 vaccine projects are using these tried-and-tested approaches, but others are using newer technology. One more recent strategy \u2013 the one that Novavax is taking, for example \u2013 constructs a \u201crecombinant\u201d vaccine. This involves extracting the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, which is the part of the virus most likely to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and pasting it into the genome of a bacterium or yeast \u2013 forcing these micro-organisms to churn out large quantities of the protein. Other approaches, that are even newer, bypass the protein and build vaccines from the genetic instruction itself. This is the case for Moderna and a German company, CureVac, both of which are building Covid-19 vaccines out of messenger RNA.</p> \n<p>Cepi\u2019s original portfolio of four funded Covid-19 vaccine projects was heavily skewed towards these more innovative technologies, but it has since added four others that take more tried-and-tested approaches \u2013 including a project at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/uk-drive-develop-coronavirus-vaccine-science\">University of Oxford</a> that uses a harmless, non-replicating virus to carry SARS-CoV-2 genetic material into the body\u2019s cells \u2013 and it will continue to add to that portfolio. \u201cOur experience with vaccine development is that you can\u2019t anticipate where you\u2019re going to stumble,\u201d says Hatchett, meaning that diversity is key. And the stage where any approach is most likely to stumble is clinical or human trials.</p> \n<p>Clinical trials, an essential precursor to regulatory approval, usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is, and the third does the same in several thousand people. But there\u2019s a high level of attrition as experimental vaccines pass through these phases. \u201cNot all horses that leave the starting gate will finish the race,\u201d says Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunisation programme for the Washington DC-based non-profit, the <a href=\"https://www.sabin.org/\">Sabin Vaccine Institute</a>.</p> \n<p>There are good reasons for that. Either the candidates are unsafe, or they\u2019re ineffective, or both. Screening out duds is essential, which is why clinical trials can\u2019t be skipped or hurried. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before. The annual flu vaccine, for example, is the product of a well-honed assembly line in which only one or a few modules have to be updated each year. In contrast, Sars-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen in humans, and many of the technologies being used to build vaccines are relatively untested too. No vaccine made from genetic material \u2013 RNA or DNA \u2013 has been approved to date, for example. So many of the Covid-19 vaccine candidates have to be treated as brand new vaccines, and as Gellin says: \u201cWhile there is a push to do things as fast as possible, it\u2019s really important not to take shortcuts.\u201d</p> \n<p>An illustration of that is a vaccine that was produced in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. In clinical trials, this vaccine was found to aggravate those symptoms in infants who went on to catch the virus. A similar effect was observed in animals given an early experimental Sars vaccine. It was later modified to eliminate that problem but, now that it has been repurposed for Sars-CoV-2, it will need to be put through especially stringent safety testing to rule out the risk of enhanced disease.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s for these reasons that taking a vaccine candidate all the way to regulatory approval typically takes a decade or more, and why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/coronavirus-trump-administration-brain-drain-impeding-response\" title=\"\">President Trump sowed confusion</a> when, at a meeting at the White House on 2 March, he pressed for a vaccine to be ready by the US elections in November \u2013 an impossible deadline. \u201cLike most vaccinologists, I don\u2019t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months,\u201d says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That\u2019s already extremely fast, and it assumes there will be no hitches.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, there is another potential problem. As soon as a vaccine is approved, it\u2019s going to be needed in vast quantities \u2013 and many of the organisations in the Covid-19 vaccine race simply don\u2019t have the necessary production capacity. Vaccine development is already a risky affair, in business terms, because so few candidates get anywhere near the clinic. Production facilities tend to be tailored to specific vaccines, and scaling these up when you don\u2019t yet know if your product will succeed is not commercially feasible. Cepi and similar organisations exist to shoulder some of the risk, keeping companies incentivised to develop much-needed vaccines. Cepi plans to invest in developing a Covid-19 vaccine and boosting manufacturing capacity in parallel, and last month it put out a <a href=\"https://cepi.net/news_cepi/2-billion-required-to-develop-a-vaccine-against-the-covid-19-virus/\">call for </a><a href=\"https://cepi.net/news_cepi/2-billion-required-to-develop-a-vaccine-against-the-covid-19-virus/\">$2</a><a href=\"https://cepi.net/news_cepi/2-billion-required-to-develop-a-vaccine-against-the-covid-19-virus/\">bn</a> to allow it to do so.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bbdedea8-3745-42f9-a4fe-eb53a8598b4f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1zHDqywPrnc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Once a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved, a further set of challenges will present itself. \u201cGetting a vaccine that\u2019s proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to what\u2019s needed for a global immunisation programme,\u201d says global health expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/the-worst-case-scenario-for-coronavirus-dr-jonathan-quick-q-and-a-laura-spinney\" title=\"\">Jonathan Quick of Duke University</a> in North Carolina, author of <a href=\"https://www.endofepidemics.com/author/\" title=\"\">The End of Epidemics</a> (2018). \u201cVirus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.\u201d</p> \n<p>The problem is making sure the vaccine gets to all those who need it. This is a challenge even within countries, and some have worked out guidelines. In the scenario of a flu pandemic, for example, the UK would prioritise vaccinating healthcare and social care workers, along with those considered at highest medical risk \u2013 including children and pregnant women \u2013 with the overall goal of keeping sickness and death ra tes as low as possible. But in a pandemic, countries also have to compete with each other for medicines.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/lockdowns-cant-end-until-covid-19-vaccine-found-study-says\">Lockdowns can't end until Covid-19 vaccine found, study says</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Because pandemics tend to hit hardest those countries that have the most fragile and underfunded healthcare systems, there is an inherent imbalance between need and purchasing power when it comes to vaccines. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, for example, vaccine supplies were snapped up by nations that could afford them, leaving poorer ones short. But you could also imagine a scenario where, say, India \u2013 a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world \u2013 not unreasonably decides to use its vaccine production to protect its own 1.3 billion-strong population first, before exporting any.</p> \n<p>Outside of pandemics, the WHO brings governments, charitable foundations and vaccine-makers together to agree an equitable global distribution strategy, and organisations like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have come up with innovative funding mechanisms to raise money on the markets for ensuring supply to poorer countries. But each pandemic is different, and no country is bound by any arrangement the WHO proposes \u2013 leaving many unknowns. As Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, points out: \u201cThe question is, what will happen in a situation where you\u2019ve got national emergencies going on?\u201d</p> \n<p>This question is being debated, but it will be a while before we see how it plays out. \u201c[This pandemic] will probably have peaked and declined before a vaccine is available,\u201d says Wilder-Smith. A vaccine could still save many lives, especially if the virus becomes endemic or perennially circulating \u2013 like flu \u2013 and there are further, possibly seasonal, outbreaks. But until then, our best hope is to slow the spread of the disease as far as possible. So to repeat the sage advice: stay home, wash your hands.</p>",

four weeks after the person with the last known infection has recovered, the curve will shoot back up.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the exit strategy,\u201d said Prof Mikhail Prokopenko, a

in overzealous rules and ones that give very mixed messages or have little biological plausibility. Not only will this cause unwarranted and increased social, mental and economic harm, we run the bigger risk that a substantial part of our society in a few months\u2019 time (our winter) might increasingly rebel against many restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cI hope NSW and Victoria can be persuaded to relax on their overzealous restrictions so recently and unnecessarily put in place.\u201d</p> <h2>UK prime minister in hospital</h2> <p>Globally, there have been 69,498 deaths from Covid-19 (at the time of publishing), and more than 1.25m confirmed infections.

  "<p>Few people had Trolls World Tour near the top of their list of Important Movies of 2020, but so it has come to pass. If it wasn\u2019t for that meddling coronavirus, we would all be gearing up for the new Bond movie right now; instead, we have a sequel to a painfully bright 2016 kids\u2019 animation. But Trolls World Tour really matters. For starters, it is the first Hollywood movie intended for cinema release that is instead going straight to streaming. So it\u2019s a test case. Will housebound punters be prepared to stump up \u00a316 ($20) to watch a new release online?</p> <p>If Trolls World Tour goes down badly, it is a signal to Hollywood that there\u2019s very little money to be made from new releases until the pandemic is over. If it is a success, it could be even worse. The studio system depends on box-office receipts generated during the \u201ctheatrical window\u201d: the period when new movies are only available at cinemas. If people become used to getting new releases direct to their homes, they might never go back. Once broken, the theatrical window might never get fixed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08AExF6dETA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/08AExF6dETA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Trolls World Tour could also represent another revolution. The great Hollywood shutdown means live-action movies have ground to a halt. Hollywood animation studios have also shut, but the work continues remotely. In fact, it is theoretically possible to make a movie like Trolls World Tour without anyone actually meeting face to face. So again, there might be no going back. Cumbersome productions such as Bond could be the dinosaurs in this dystopian scenario, primed for a mass extinction, with animations like Trolls better adapted for survival, like small mammals or cockroaches.</p> <p>If this is a revolution, Trolls World Tour is a pretty weird vehicle for it. According to the plot, the garishly hued trolls live in tribes according to musical genres: pop, funk, classical, and so on. But like a junior Infinity War, the \u201chard rock\u201d trolls are trying to take over the world by uniting the \u201csix strings\u201d and turning everyone into \u201crock zombies\u201d. Leaving aside the conservative \u201crock is evil\u201d message, the set-up allows for a bewildering array of voice cameos: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ozzyosbourne\">Ozzy Osbourne</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/georgeclinton\">George Clinton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gwenstefani\">Gwen Stefani</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kelly-clarkson\">Kelly Clarkson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/13/anderson-paak-people-are-like-damn-how-are-you-not-on-crack-cocaine-right-now\">Anderson .Paak</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mary-j-blige\">Mary J Blige</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/10/icona-pop-stockholm-review\">Icona Pop</a>, K-pop outfit Red Velvet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/11/anthony-ramos-actor-hamilton-a-star-is-born\">Anthony Ramos</a>, even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jamie-dornan\">Jamie Dornan</a> as a \u201csmooth jazz troll\u201d.</p> <p>Nobody has seen it yet, but I\u2019m willing to bet it concludes with the tribes settling their differences and coming together as one beautiful rainbow nation in an uplifting group singalong written by Max Martin. That could be just the message of unity the world needs right now. Alternatively, the lowest-common-denominator global jukebox of saccharine sentiment might just tip you over the edge.

  "<p>The London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) has appointed the American conductor Karina Canellakis as its principal guest conductor from September.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/21/first-night-of-the-proms-review-karina-canellakis\">Canellakis</a>, 38, began her career as a violinist, performing as soloist, chamber and orchestral musician. She played for two years with the Berlin Philharmonic as a member of its Academy Orchestra, then spent several years with the Chicago Symphony. She has also appeared as a guest leader of orchestras including the Bergen Philharmonic. She began conducting professionally in 2013 and made her European debut in 2015.</p> <p>Canellakis burst on to the British orchestral scene last summer when she conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/21/first-night-of-the-proms-review-karina-canellakis\">for the opening night of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/21/first-night-of-the-proms-review-karina-canellakis\">the Proms</a>. But her relationship with the London Philharmonic Orchestra began the previous autumn when she made her debut with them at the Royal Festival Hall. The spark was immediate, she says.</p> <p>\u201cWe musically fell in love with each other. Our temperaments are perfectly matched,\u201d she says. \u201cThe LPO can literally play anything, and they can do it so quickly that the amount of rehearsal time they need to get to the absolute highest level is so small that I was amazed and impressed.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>We can create something really special in all the different corners of the repertoire I want to explore together.\u201d</p> <p>Canellakis grew up in a musical family in New York, her mother a pianist and her father a conductor, and she took conducting classes on the side while majoring in violin studies. \u201cI had always loved it and was fascinated by scores,\u201d she says. \u201cIt never occurred to me that this was not something for a girl to do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f29e855106f81d227d5f0272066206b58cad4953\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f29e855106f81d227d5f0272066206b58cad4953/0_125_1920_1152/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Canellakis conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the 2019 Proms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canellakis conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the 2019 Proms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a violinist, she always yearned to see the full orchestral picture. \u201cI felt slightly frustrated by only being able to see the violin line. Each break I\u2019d look at the score, dying to know the details of the other instruments and why it sounded that way, why I got goosebumps at certain moments, and how you can physically translate that to a large group of people with your hands and your face without making a sound. It\u2019s an amazing feat of human communication.\u201d</p> <p>Simon Rattle spotted the young violinist\u2019s interest in conducting when she was part of the Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s orchestra academy from 2005-07, and encouraged her to develop her talent. \u201cMoving away from the violin was terrifying because I love playing and I had a great life as a violinist,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I felt this fire inside of me that if I didn\u2019t give conducting a shot I would regret it.</p> <p>After two years in the Juilliard School\u2019s conducting programme, in 2016 she won the prestigious Georg Solti conducting award. Her rise to the top of the profession has been rapid by any standards. Last month Canellakis made her debut with the London Symphony Orchestra, and she has appeared as a guest with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the symphony orchestras of San Francisco and Minnesota, and the Munich Philharmonic.</p> <p>\u201cMy role models were the inspiring people I played under: Boulez. Rattle. Haitink \u2026 and my teachers \u2026 Alan Gilbert and Fabio Luisi,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been at the receiving end of comments about my gender. I\u2019m part of a generation who doesn\u2019t need to worry about it. I have only ever thought about conductors in terms of what they brought to the sound.\u201d</p> <p>The era of the dictator conductor \u2013 the \u201cmaestro\u201d \u2013 is long gone, she says. \u201cThe role of a conductor is much more collegial and collaborative than it used to be. You want to make music with the orchestra, not impose your concept of a piece on it.\u201d</p> <p>She concedes that the shift from player to podium was a leap. \u201cYou have to adjust your sense of identity and learn that you are the boss,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is your responsibility how this rehearsal goes \u2013 which means everything from the atmosphere, the way you speak to people, how efficient you are with the rehearsal time. You need to be able to assess very quickly what needs work and what you can leave for the next day.\u201d</p> <p>In a period of global lockdown, live music seems a more precious asset than ever. \u201cThis crisis can allow many of us a moment to reflect on what we are truly grateful for,\u201d says Canellakis. \u201cI feel hope and inspiration when I think about going back to rehearsing and performing with my colleagues, coupled with fear and sadness because it\u2019s become painfully clear that music is my life and my life is music \u2013 without being able to share that sacred, magical world with colleagues and audiences, my daily existence loses its most essential core.\u201d</p> <p>Canellakis is scheduled to conduct four Royal Festival Hall concerts with the LPO in the 2020/21 season. Her <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/120820-2012-absolute-jest-2020\">first concert with them, on 3 October</a>, will pair Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No 8 with John Adams\u2019s concerto for string quartet, Absolute Jest.</p>",
  "<p>When Olfert Landt first heard about a novel virus ravaging parts of China, he sprung into action, and by the 10 January, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/a-berlin-biotech-company-got-a-head-start-on-coronavirus-tests?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=businessweek&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-businessweek&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic\">according to Bloomberg</a>, the microbiologist, working with researchers at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital, had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-testing-how-some-countries-germany-south-korea-got-ahead-of-the-rest\">developed a viable test for the disease</a>. </p> <p>TIB Molbiol Syntheselabor GmbH, the small company Landt leads, had produced more than 4 million tests by 12<sup> </sup>March. It\u2019s the kind of story that has fuelled claims that Germany\u2019s strong biotech industry has provided the country with a unique advantage in combating the coronavirus. Donald Trump retweeted the Bloomberg story about Landt. The UK\u2019s health minister, Matt Hancock, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-matt-hancock-sets-goal-of-100000-tests-per-day-by-end-of-april-video\">held his first press conference</a> on Thursday after recovering from coronavirus himself, didn\u2019t mention Landt, but he was quick to point to the strength of the German pharmaceutical industry as the primary reason for the country\u2019s aggressive testing regime and low death rate: \u201cMy German counterpart, for instance,\u201d Hancock said, \u201ccould call upon 100 test labs ready and waiting when the crisis stuck, thanks in large part to Roche, one of the biggest diagnostic companies in the world.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to understand why the UK, in particular, is feeling defensive: while Germany has tested nearly a million samples for Covid-19, the UK, <a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/facts-and-figures/global-pharmaceutical-market/shares-of-the-global-pharmaceutical-markets/\">according to data</a> from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, has tested just 152,979 people for the Corona virus according to the Department of Health and Social Care has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1246791324231176193\">tested just 195,524 people</a> up until yesterday morning.</p> <p>But Hancock\u2019s attempt to attribute Germany\u2019s success to a strong biotech sector rings false. The four million tests produced by Landt\u2019s company have been distributed throughout the world. Indeed, the biochemist told <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/de/corona-tests-maschinen-auf-hochtouren/a-52853100\">Deutsche Welle</a> that he would like to start delivering tests to Russia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Iran \u2013 countries that are currently under embargo. </p> <p>For all its might in the industry, Germany\u2019s output is dwarfed by the scale of the US pharmaceutical industry: Germany <a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/facts-and-figures/global-pharmaceutical-market/shares-of-the-global-pharmaceutical-markets/\">captured </a><a href=\"https://www.abpi.org.uk/facts-and-figures/global-pharmaceutical-market/shares-of-the-global-pharmaceutical-markets/\">4.01% of global pharmaceutical sales in 2016</a>, whereas the US controlled 44.45% of the market in the same year, and the UK captured 2.35%. Indeed, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoffmann-La_Roche\">Hoffmann-La Roche</a>, the company to which Hancock seems to have attributed the strength of the German testing infrastructure, is Swiss, not German.</p> <p>Hancock\u2019s errors disguise inconvenient truths about the German situation. Though Roche has developed tests and manufactures equipment, it is laboratories at universities, hospitals and government agencies that have taken the lead in testing for Covid-19 in Germany. Private laboratories have played a crucial role in Germany\u2019s testing regime, but big business has not; according to statistics compiled by <a href=\"https://www.alm-ev.de/files/site-files/03%20Downloads/08%20Praesentationen/2019/190123%20ALM-Labore-in-Deutschland.pdf\">Akkredierte Labore in der Medizin</a>, a trade group for the medical diagnostics industry, the six largest private providers of Covid-19 tests together account for 36% of the laboratories currently testing in Germany. Indeed, the distributed nature of the German response can be seen in the rapid increase in the number of facilities doing testing. Between 2 and 8 March, 43 laboratories conducted 36,067 tests. Last week, 97 laboratories conducted 313,957 tests.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t an accident that, unlike the UK, Germany has had such success in engaging a wide network of laboratories to conduct Covid-19 testing. The country\u2019s federal system has long assigned the national government to a coordinating role, and regional autonomy over large parts of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-uks-testing-failure-much-to-learn-from-germany\">healthcare system</a> may have helped to create more resilient systems, better able to coordinate the work of different laboratories.</p> <p>Even as the country\u2019s more distributed healthcare system has helped to spread the burden of testing more evenly, a strong bureaucratic state has stepped in to help coordinate testing, containment and treatment efforts. In Bavaria, teachers and other furloughed state employees have been <a href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/coronavirus-bayern-hotline-lehrer-beamte-gesundheitsamt-1.4864668\">reassigned to service</a> at the health departments, where they help to coordinate the logistics of the response.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/1918-flu-pandemic-coronavirus-drug-trials-scientists-treatments-evidence\">What the 1918 flu pandemic can teach us about coronavirus drug trials | Laura Spinney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the success of Germany\u2019s response to the pandemic so far, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/de/epidemiologe-kurth-corona-zahlen-sind-nicht-vergleichbar/a-52972246\">many</a> <a href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/gesundheit/coronavirus-zahlen-statistik-1.4864439\">voices</a> in the country have called for caution. The virus seems to have gained a foothold relatively late here, which has allowed for a more coordinated response than would have been possible in Italy or China. Even so, and despite aggressive testing, it is still entirely possible that the number of cases will spike, overwhelming the healthcare system and leading to much higher mortality.</p> <p>Still, if current trends continue, Germany will have shown itself to be uniquely capable among western nations of dealing with a global pandemic. The huge number of tests and its low mortality rate can be attributed to a number of different factors \u2013 <strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/20/dissecting-germanys-low-coronavirus-death-rate.html\">relative youth of many people</a> infected by the virus and <a href=\"https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/coronavirus-in-europa-letalitaet-in-deutschland-30-mal-niedriger-als-in-italien-wie-ist-das-moeglich/25626678.html\">potential underreporting especially</a><strong> </strong>\u2013<strong> </strong>but the country\u2019s proximity to a major Swiss biotech firm is very low among them indeed. If Hancock insists on reducing the success of the German response to a single factor, he would do far better to look at continued investment into the country\u2019s health system. </p> <p>Germany has more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_hospital_beds\">hospital beds per person</a> than anywhere else in Europe \u2013 8.1 per 1000 inhabitants, compared with 3.2 in Italy, 2.8 in the US, and 2.6 in the UK. These hospitals host some of the testing facilities that have enabled Germany to respond to the crisis so aggressively. For now, they also have the capacity to treat patients from <a href=\"https://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/111286/Deutsche-Krankenhaeuser-nehmen-COVID-19-Patienten-aus-Italien-und-Frankreich-auf\">France and Italy</a> while other healthcare systems collapse under the strain of the pandemic.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Kuras is a writer and translator based in Berlin</p>",

But in the broader landscape of history, it would be an anomaly if we <em>weren\u2019t </em>playing music in this way.</p> \n<p>From as early as <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612314000260\">ancient Egypt, Greece and the Babylonians</a>, music has been a reliable tool for spiritual healing and social bonding for thousands of years amid disease. When plague struck Sparta in the 7th century BC, city leaders petitioned the poet Thaletus to sing hymns, and Terpander, another noted ancient Greek poet, was called up during a plague in Lesbos. Even Pythagoras, the creator of every schoolchild\u2019s favourite theorem, used music as a therapeutic device, playing the lyre to calm drunken hooligans.</p> \n<p>In medieval Italy, music went far beyond singing from windows, too. Before knowledge of contagion was widespread, the medieval \u201cplague procession\u201d was a recurrent sight on Europe\u2019s streets. Entire towns marched, sang and prayed under icons of local saints, with call-and-response litanies designed to encourage participation. <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/plague-and-music-in-the-renaissance/0DEA8D7F400E840730E861FC65E29E09\">Remi Chiu</a>, a musicologist at Loyola University, finds a parallel in these processions with the \u201c<em><a href=\"https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/wuhan-coronavirus-response-wuhan-jiayou.html\">Wuhan jiayou</a></em><a href=\"https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/wuhan-coronavirus-response-wuhan-jiayou.html\">!</a>\u201d \u2013 or \u2018Stay strong, Wuhan!\u201d \u2013 chants that took off in January in the Chinese city where the pandemic began and likewise with the appearance of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/italians-sing-patriotic-songs-from-their-balconies-during-coronavirus-lockdown\"> local patriotic songs</a> on Italian balconies.</p> \n<p>Chiu says music\u2019s ability to overcome our egos is a \u201cvery powerful\u201d tool in a quarantine. \u201cWhen you\u2019re making music, you\u2019re submitting yourself \u2013 your mind, your body \u2013 to its regulation. And when you\u2019re making music communally, or even dancing or doing the Macarena with your neighbours, you\u2019re simultaneously contributing and submitting yourself to the larger goal of the group.\u201d Technology can extend this communality \u2013 through a tweet or Facebook post, what would have become a column inch or a forgotten memory can inspire global solidarity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"11454181-399d-4496-9032-4fbd93f65f1f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k7bobc-vRbQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Religion is playing a far less tangible role today than it did in medieval Italy. While the importance of religion varies from country to country and city to city, that Lewis Capaldi appears at all in our musical response is a significant development. Religion can be a very strong social glue in localised groups, but non-religious music may encounter fewer obstacles in our collective identity politics: if you like <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9338354/musicians-perform-celine-dion-my-heart-will-go-on-balconies-spain-video\">C\u00e9line Dion</a>, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Catholic, Jewish, Protestant or Jedi.</p> \n<p>Plus, even in the climate of medieval Europe, religious fanatics were known to take things too far. The \u201c<em>flagellants</em>\u201d found the source of disease in their own sinfulness, and responded in kind through vivid displays of violent masochism. With music again as a driving pulse, <em>flagellants</em> would whip their backs with chains and ropes for hours on end, and to the singular horror of most who saw them.</p> \n<p>Social bonds aren\u2019t the beginning and end of music, either. In our response to the coronavirus, balcony concerts have been just one of a range of musical tools we\u2019ve deployed. <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9335531/coronavirus-quarantine-music-events-online-streams\">Virtual gigs</a>, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/23/rappers-coronavirus-cardi-b-dj-imarkkeyz\">pandemic pop</a>\u201d and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/bono-coronavirus-song-italy-let-your-love-be-known\">corona-themed Bono</a> single have so far appeared, but music\u2019s role can be considerably more basic. So long as we use any kind of music to restore balance and reduce our suffering, we\u2019ll be walking in the footsteps of our forebears.</p> \n<p>Viewing our minds and bodies as intrinsically connected, medicine since the time of ancient Greece has claimed that maintaining a positive state of mind can offer the conjoining effect of treating physical disease. During the Renaissance, patients were encouraged to compose and study art, joke and laugh with their friends, and also to play music, because the resulting energy would flow favourably to their \u201chumours\u201d: ethereal substances believed to form the building blocks of our constitutions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9932b259f521c78c098a350804601a45a96bb727\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9932b259f521c78c098a350804601a45a96bb727/0_0_3261_2769/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Music does not care for melancholy\u2019 \u2026 14th century composer Guillaume de Machaut never referenced the Black Death which ravaged France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"849\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Music does not care for melancholy\u2019 \u2026 14th-century poet-composer Guillaume de Machaut never referenced the Black Death, which ravaged France.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Images Group via Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Indeed, when plague approached England, it\u2019s no coincidence that Henry VIII chose his organ player as one of the five men he quarantined with; Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron, now a classic of historical fiction, describes a circle of Italian aristocrats who retreat from a mainland plague for days of sex, music and drinking. And as Dr Chris Macklin, a former professor of musicology at Mercer University and an authority on plague music, notes in a blog post, the 14th-century composer Guillaume de Machaut was deeply troubled by the Black Death but none of his music referenced it. Why? \u201cMusic is a science which asks that one laugh, and sing, and dance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt does not care for melancholy, nor for the man who is melancholy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Talk of \u201chumours\u201d may seem fanciful now, of course. But this is no reason to do away with the music. \u201cMusic is proving to be a true antidote to fear, just as Renaissance doctors claimed,\u201d says Chiu. For patients with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22161383/\">schizophrenia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16623646/\">cancer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16623646/\">multiple sclerosis</a> and others \u2013 and even those on <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4567402/\">ventilators</a> \u2013 music therapy can significantly reduce in anxiety, depression and sometimes the underlying symptoms of disease.</p> \n<p>Macklin writes that \u201cmusic was not a luxury in times of epidemic uncertainty \u2013 it was a necessity\u201d. Now that we\u2019re equipped with technology, science and a global identity, music may be more valuable \u2013 and more necessary \u2013 than ever.</p>",

The US has more than 337,000 confirmed cases and more than 9,600 deaths, and the UK has more than 48,000 cases and 4,943 deaths.</p> <h2>Boris Johnson admitted to hospital for coronavirus tests</h2> <p>The British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-live-news-cases-approach-12m-as-trump-tells-americans-to-expect-a-lot-of-death?page=with:block-5e8a3c808f080bdb9f534b21#block-5e8a3c808f080bdb9f534b21\">prime minister has been admitted to hospital</a> with coronavirus after suffering persistent symptoms for 10 days. Downing Street insists it was just a precautionary measure and it is understood Johnson remains in charge of the government.</p> <h2><strong>Japan expected to declare a state of emergency</strong></h2> <p>Prime minister Shinzo Abe is expected to declare a state of emergency that could go into effect as early as Tuesday. Under a law revised in March, the prime minister can declare a state of emergency if the disease poses a \u201cgrave danger\u201d to lives and if its rapid spread could have a huge impact on the economy. More than 3,500 people have tested positive and 85 have died from the new coronavirus in Japan, according to public broadcaster NHK and there a fears there could be a sudden surge in cases in Tokyo, which has recorded 1,000 infections.</p> <h2><strong>Fewer than 50 new cases in South Korea</strong></h2> <p>For the first time since 29 February the country reported fewer than 50 new coronavirus cases. The country, which is one of the first to be hit by the global outbreak, has responded with aggressive measures to combat the outbreak, including extensive testing. For the last month, South Korea has been reporting around 100 new coronavirus cases per day.</p> <h2><strong>US government orders 29m doses of hydroxychloroquine</strong></h2> <p>Donald Trump announced that the US had ordered large quantities of the drug, which is used to treat malaria and for which testing for its use to treat coronavirus is still under way. The drug has potentially harmful side effects. Personal protective gear is also being airlifted to US affected states, including millions of masks, gloves, and sterile gowns. Health officials in the US have warned the nation faces it\u2019s \u201chardest and saddest week\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>A tiger at a New York zoo has tested positive for the coronavirus</strong></h2> <p>In the first known case of Covid-19 in an animal in the US, a tiger at New York City\u2019s Bronx Zoo has tested positive, a zoo spokesman told Reuters on Sunday.

  "<p>House sales in the UK will collapse this year as the coronavirus pandemic puts the property market into deep freeze. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/houseprices\">prices</a> will fall by only 3% and will rebound next year, according to global consultancy Knight Frank.</p> <p>In the first reassessment of the property market by one of the major forecasters, Knight Frank said the number of house sales in the UK would plummet from 1,175,000 last year to just 734,000 this year.</p> <p>Many of the \u201clost\u201d sales will not be carried forward to next year, spelling disaster for estate agents and other firms in the property chain \u2013 from valuers to removals companies \u2013 that rely on transactions for their business.</p> <p>But the consultancy is not predicting a collapse in house prices, which were starting to revive in the early part of 2020 before coronavirus took hold.</p> <p>It forecast that mainstream UK house prices would fall 3% in 2020, but then bounce back by 5% in 2021. Behind the Knight Frank forecasts is an assumption that the British economy will shrink by 4% in 2020 before growing by 4.5% next year as the pandemic recedes.</p> <p>Liam Bailey, the global head of research at Knight Frank, said: \u201cThe housing market was in a strong position in January and February. A sharp uptick in sales and price growth was seen across the UK, with even the prime central London market seeing a reversal of a five-year-long price decline.</p> <p>\u201cWe [now] have to expect weaker economic activity in the first half of 2020, the dislocation in the jobs market and weakened consumer sentiment will impact on prices \u2013 however, the relatively finite timespan of the crisis means declines will be limited.\u201d</p> <p>The agency only forecasts rents for prime central London, and it expected them to be flat in 2020, then rising 3% next year.</p> <p>Nationwide building society issued its monthly house price index at the end of last week, showing a more than \u00a33,000 surge in the average price of a home in Britain in March, the fastest pace for two years. But it stressed the figures did not take into account the lockdown in the market since then, and that \u201chousing market activity is now grinding to a halt\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Estate agents say their businesses have all but collapsed. Lucy Pendleton of agents James Pendleton said: \u201cEven before an outright housing market freeze was declared, we had been forced to furlough more than half of our staff. Last week the number of sales being agreed was down 84.2% annually, exchanges were down 66.6%, the volume of offers had fallen 70% and viewings had ceased altogether.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that commentators talked of Brexit uncertainty putting transactions on ice, but that feels like ancient history now. Covid-19 has brought brutal new meaning to a frozen market.</p> <p>Pendleton is pinning its hopes on a vigorous bounceback next year: \u201cThe housing market will come roaring back to life as soon as the lockdown ends, aided by interest rates that are significantly lower than when it began.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>After seven months of waiting, Ahmed* had everything ready for his younger brother. Finally, 18-year-old Wahid was due to arrive from the Greek island of Samos under family reunion laws.</p> <p>But on 19 March, as Covid-19 took hold across Europe, the Greek authorities called to tell him the transfer had been cancelled because of the growing restrictions on flights. Greece had suspended direct flights to the UK but indirect routes are still available.</p> <p>The UN refugee agency told the Guardian that most European countries have suspended transfers. According to charity Safe Passage, Greek authorities have stopped 52 family reunion transfers to the UK alone. The charity say they are concerned that the numbers of cancelled reunions could stretch into the hundreds.</p> <p>\u201cIt was so disappointing,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cWe had everything planned, I had rented a room for him here, he was so excited to finally be joining me.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office has said it is the responsibility of the sending country to organise the transfer. In a statement, the Home Office said: \u201cThe Home Office is continuing to process Dublin cases, including children, as far as the current restrictions in place across Europe permit.<strong> </strong>Once accepted, the arrangements to complete a transfer are the responsibility of the sending state. We continue to receive transfers, including of children, into the UK under the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dublin-iii-regulation\">Dublin III </a>regulation and remain committed to meeting our obligations.\u201d</p> <p>But lawyers and Safe Passage say the Home Office does have an obligation to help make the transfers happen.</p> <p>Anastasia Solopova, at Wilson Solicitors, is working to help a 15-year-old Kuwaiti boy stranded in Samos despite having permission to join his refugee brother in the UK. \u201cThere are obligations on both the UK and the state in which the child is located to ensure that<em> </em>the transfer takes place as quickly as possible\u201d, she said. \u201cImportantly, the Home Office must have the child\u2019s best interests as a primary consideration in all procedures under the Dublin regulation.</p> <p>\u201cThe Home Office must act urgently while indirect flights are still available. We have asked the Home Office co-operate with the Greek authorities to transfer my client to the UK. Otherwise my client, an unaccompanied and extremely vulnerable child, may be stranded in the dangerous conditions of the Samos reception identification centre for months on end.\u201d</p> <p>The process of family reunion is a lengthy one, taking up to a year to arrange, while minors waiting for transfer often live in uncertain and difficult conditions.</p> <p>The Guardian also spoke to Ibrahim, originally from Afghanistan, who spent months going through the family reunion process. He is worried his brother won\u2019t be protected from Covid-19 in France, where he has no support.</p> <p>\u201cWe went through a long process to prove he is my brother,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally, after 10 months, on 6 March we were told he can come. Now nobody can travel. We lost all our family, our mum, sister, brother and he is just 15. He has no friends or family in France so day by day all I think about is my brother and he worries the same.\u201d</p> <p>Safe Passage director Beth Gardiner-Smith said the Home Office needs to take a proactive role in bringing the young people to be safe with their families.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe all appreciate that the government is under enormous pressure but we are asking for some creative thinking.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/18/ngos-raise-alarm-as-coronavirus-strips-support-from-eu-refugees\">NGOs raise alarm as coronavirus strips support from EU refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe Home Office could include these young people in their plans to use charter flights to rescue British people who are stranded in Europe. In 2015 when the jungle camp in Calais was demolished, the UK government took matters into their own hands. There was a situation where 1,000 children were going to be dispersed and rather than wait for French action they decided to be proactive and bring the children to the UK.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for UNHCR told the Guardian that family reunion transfers should continue. \u201cWhile Dublin transfers are suspended by most if not all EU countries, UNHCR is advocating to maintain transfers for family reunion purposes especially for unaccompanied children in view of their particular vulnerability.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmed said: \u201cI am prepared to pay for Wahid\u2019s flight, but the Greek authorities say I can\u2019t do that. I need the UK Home Office to help me make this happen.\u201d</p> <p>He is terrified that his brother will end up on the streets during a strict lockdown.\u201cI have been paying for a room for him but the landlord says he can only stay in his place until 12 April. Refugees on Samos don\u2019t even have tents, he will have to go and sleep in the wood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how long this lockdown will last and I don\u2019t know if airports will close tomorrow or next week.

  "<p>The government has been accused of missing an opportunity after it failed to deploy 5,000 contact tracing experts employed by councils to help limit the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>Environmental health workers in local government have wide experience in contact tracing, a process used to prevent infections spreading and routinely carried out in outbreaks such as of norovirus, salmonella or legionnaires\u2019 disease. But a spokesperson for Public Health England (PHE), which leads on significant outbreaks, said the organisation did not call upon environmental health workers to carry out contact tracing for coronavirus, instead using its own local health protection teams.</p> <p>According to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health the UK has, at a conservative estimate, 5,000 environmental health officers working in local councils nationwide.</p> <p>The institute\u2019s Northern Ireland director, Gary McFarlane, said government health bodies \u201cabsolutely should be drawing on the skills set of EHOs [environmental health officers] and if they aren\u2019t, it\u2019s a missed opportunity\u201d. He said: \u201cThere is significant capacity that is sitting there for this kind of work to be done.\u201d</p> <p>PHE\u2019s contact tracing response team was boosted to just under 300 staff, deemed adequate for the containment phase of handling the Covid-19 virus up to mid-March. In that time the team, working around the clock, traced 3,500 people and supported the 3% of contacts found to be infected to self-isolate. Tracing was scaled back when the UK moved to the delay phase of tackling coronavirus in mid-March. It is now carried out in limited form, mainly for vulnerable communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/recruit-volunteer-army-to-trace-coronavirus-contacts-now-urge-top-scientists\">Recruit volunteer army to trace Covid-19 contacts now, urge top scientists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An environmental health worker for a council in Scotland, who does not want to be named, said: \u201cIf councils had been given the go-ahead from the start, they could have put plans in place and now have a much flatter curve.\u201d Another, with decades of experience, said he was \u201cstruggling to figure out\u201d why this was not the case.</p> <p>One environmental health worker for a north-western council said his team were expecting a call at the start of the coronavirus outbreak. He said: \u201cWe are pretty good at infection control and contact tracing, it\u2019s part of the job. We thought we\u2019d be asked and were shelving other work.\u201d</p> <p>Environmental health workers have recently been tasked with ensuring the public stick to social distancing rules. They have also been monitoring takeaways and food deliveries. Environment health departments have, like other areas of local government, suffered austerity cuts since 2010.</p> <p>Contact tracing involves getting in touch with everyone an infected person might have seen and asking them to self-isolate in an effort to contain the virus.</p> <p>The government decision to all but abandon contact tracing is not consistent with WHO guidelines, which urge a test-and-trace approach. At a WHO media briefing on Covid-19 in March, director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \u201cTracing every contact must be the backbone of the response in every country.\u201d</p> <p>The approach has been carried out in other countries, including Ireland, Germany, South Korea and Singapore. In Germany, thousands of contact tracers are still working \u2013 with more being recruited \u2013 in part clearing a backlog of infections that occurred before the nation\u2019s shutdown measures, according to Dr Philipp Zanger , head of the Institute of Hygiene, Infection Control and Prevention at the Rhineland-Palatinate agency for consumer and public protection.</p> <p>Contact tracing is also used to prepare to tackle any outbreaks when the lockdown is eased, since \u201conce we let ourselves out again, we will see more transmission again,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The UK government approach is understood to be that once virus infection numbers have tipped, manual contact tracing is unworkable, while social distancing and self-isolation measures reproduce much of its effect.</p> <p>But Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London, said giving up on it was a mistake. \u201cYou still need to do it,\u201d he said, highlighting regions where infection numbers were relatively small. \u201cIn low-intensity areas you could ramp up your testing \u2026 use all your people to jump on it.\u201d</p> <p>Environmental health officers say that as well as helping to slow the spread of a virus, tracing could provide information on how it spreads and, if successful in containing outbreaks in specific areas, could help direct healthcare resources.</p> <p>The UK, US and Germany are developing smartphone apps to help trace coronavirus infections to ease national lockdowns. Versions of this technology have been used in South Korea and Singapore. Initial reports suggest the UK app would operate on a voluntary basis, while there are privacy concerns around the security of health and location data provided.</p> <p>A PHE spokesperson said that contact tracing was no longer useful because \u201cwith such a level of sustained community transmission there is limited value in doing so\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>Russia is holding rehearsals for its Victory Day parade, scheduled for 9 May despite the coronavirus crisis, as the Kremlin resists cancelling a patriotic holiday with major political significance.</p> \n<p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is supposed to host France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders at a military parade to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war. The event is a significant historical landmark for Russia and a coveted photo opportunity to claim Putin\u2019s re-emergence from political isolation in the west.</p> \n<p>But with 12 million Muscovites confined to their apartments and a global pandemic ushering in a period of self-isolation, preparations for the parade have raised concerns in Russia.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>A leaked video has shown up to 15,000 soldiers lined up on a parade grounds outside Moscow, where Russia\u2019s defence ministry has confirmed that it is holding rehearsals for the event, most recently on 1 April.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow many people are there, 15,000?

A major business forum in St Petersburg scheduled for June has also been cancelled.</p> \n<p>Victory Day is the most important public event remaining in Russia\u2019s calendar. Western leaders have snubbed the parade since 2014, following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Moscow\u2019s alleged meddling in the US presidential elections and the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 have made relations even chillier.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Still, the Kremlin has sought to leverage the memory of the second world war to bring foreign leaders back to Moscow.

The Russian business newspaper RBC has said the Kremlin is quietly considering either holding the parade without spectators or postponing the event until August.</p> \n<p>This 9 May marks the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, elevated under Putin to the country\u2019s most important holiday.

  "<p>\u201cThe whole of consumerism is based on us wanting the next thing rather than the present thing we already have,\u201d Matt Haig laments in the book, Notes on a Nervous Planet. \u201cThis is an almost perfect recipe for unhappiness. We aren\u2019t encouraged to live in the present, we\u2019re trained to live somewhere else \u2013 the future.\u201d</p> <p>This immediately made me think of footy. I\u2019ve been doing that a bit late. Maybe it\u2019s the arrival of my first child on the cusp of the current season; probably it\u2019s the absence of it since round one. I find myself daydreaming about what the game means to me now compared to other times in my life, not least my earliest years, where every memory is in brown and gold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-shutdown-has-left-a-hollowness-in-the-life-of-this-afl-fan\">Coronavirus shutdown has left a hollowness in the life of this AFL fan | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps it was also because Haig\u2019s broader point relates to the way technology has accelerated life over the last two decades in ways incomparable to any other 20 years. From my vantage point \u2013 as nothing more than a fan \u2013 this felt analogous to our game. Never has top-level footy expanded this quickly. But, glib as it is to ask, is bigger necessarily better?</p> <p>It feels opportunistic to cite this global crisis as a time to navel-gaze, but given the all-encompassing nature of the men\u2019s AFL as it is today, it might be the best opportunity we will get. That\u2019s not said to diminish the terrible spectre of job losses inside the game, either. Rather, this can be seen as a chance for footy to take a step back from the relentless day-to-day to take stock and consider what matters most when the post-pandemic world adjusts into a new normal.</p> <p>For better or worse, we can be fairly sure that what will continue on the same path is the two-and-a-half hours between the sirens. Whether you fell into the evolution or revolution camp when the rules were being stress-tested a couple of seasons ago, the reality is coaches are blessed with supreme athletes capable of mastering a high-pressure and miserly game. We may all adore the high-scoring football played in generations past, but it\u2019s not returning.</p> <p>But one area where we might be able to row back a bit \u2013 not all the way back to the boatshed, but in the direction simpler times \u2013 is where games are played. Nothing quite summed up what Gerard Whateley foreshadowed as the \u201cquirky and wonderful\u201d season that might be possible towards the end of 2020 more than reports that suburban venues could be called upon to host games if the MCG is out of action due to Twenty20 World Cup commitments.</p> <p>The politics of stadiums (or grounds, as we used to call them) is a complicated business \u2013 there is no disputing that. But if there is a desire at headquarters for the game to regain a bit of the intimacy that served it so well for a century, it might just be the right time to give this another, closer look in the years to come. Specifically Princes Park, the last ground of its kind to host a men\u2019s game in 2005.</p> <p>Reimagining how it might fit in again is not a new idea but is one that has case has been quietly bolstered in recent years as the spiritual home of the AFLW; it was packed to its 25,000 capacity for the opening game of the league in 2017. A year earlier, when Carlton\u2019s men hosted Essendon in a pre-season kickabout, it was equally full. Back then, I wrote of the smiles of those in attendance, overjoyed to be back amongst the distinctive palm trees. It didn\u2019t feel like sepia-filtered melancholy as much as it did a piece of the game\u2019s soul reawakening.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bf6767dce9b23cd8c7cbc19dc58d0db0f458e91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bf6767dce9b23cd8c7cbc19dc58d0db0f458e91/0_4_3977_2389/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The opening game of the AFLW at Princes Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The AFLW\u2019s first game was a lockout at Princes Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Trafford/AFL Media/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After 1,277 VFL/AFL games since the very first season in 1897, Princes Park was eventually rationalised (to use league jargon), like every other suburban ground before it, primarily because of the bigger bucks elsewhere. There were other reasons too, which included how tough it was to get to. A positive legacy of the Docklands, though, is that the rhythms of attending games have changed now anyway \u2013 nobody drives anymore. And, conveniently, the Melbourne Metro railway station at Parkville is scheduled to open its doors in 2026.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/31/pause-due-to-covid-19-gives-afl-a-chance-to-build-a-more-agile-and-inclusive-game\">Pause due to Covid-19 gives AFL a chance to build a more agile and inclusive game | Rana Hussein</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, a facelift is required to make this happen on a permanent basis \u2013 a major one to bring it up to the standards now expected. But for proof of inspiration there, look no further than Kardinia Park. Indeed, the league have shown a canny knack for acquiring government support for projects such as these. Besides, this wouldn\u2019t be about starting from scratch.<br><br>Upon completion, Princes Park would need to be an asset for all Melbourne clubs to enjoy in much the same way as VFL Park was from 1970 until 1990, rather than Carlton\u2019s cash cow as it was when Hawthorn, Fitzroy and the Bulldogs were tenants at various times. Of course, the Blues would live there \u2013 it\u2019s their home \u2013 but on the weekend it would be a ground where any Melbourne clubs could choose to fixture games as appropriate for a smaller capacity.</p> <p>To that end, it\u2019s worth remembering that for over a decade, the case has been made for a boutique, third venue to complement the MCG and the Docklands. Yes, the latter is now owned by the league so the punitive contracts for tenant clubs aren\u2019t as troublesome as they once were, but attendance data reinforces that Princes Park is big enough to for this role. And, especially when full, it still looks fantastic on television.<br><br>Just last year, 14 of the 43 games at Docklands were played in front of fewer than 25,000 fans with four of those involving two local clubs. Two more Vic v Vic clashes were short of 30,000, which is what Princes Park would hold if a new stand were erected where the Robert Heatley Stand once was. A further three fixtures below that mark were hosted at the MCG. </p> <p>By taking a selection of these lower-drawing games to Princes Park, the rich history of the game can be drawn upon to allow another generation to experience the magic of suburban footy in a modern light. This isn\u2019t everything but it would mean plenty to loyalists. Sure, we\u2019ll keep paying our money regardless \u2013 we\u2019re clients for life \u2013 but footy has always been about more than that. Here\u2019s a way for administrators to show they understand this as well. Above all, returning the AFL to one of its former cathedrals would restore the sense that football belongs to the suburbs as well as the city, and that Princes Park can be reclaimed as a home not just for Carlton, but for football.</p> <p>Typically of his Watcher columns in The Age more than three decades ago, Garrie Hutchinson said it best: \u201cIn all the talk about the deprivations the football public is supposed to suffer when thousands can\u2019t get into a game at Victoria Park or Princes Park, you\u2019d think that football had merely become a way to raise the maximum amount of money. It hasn\u2019t quite degenerated that far yet.\u201d Let\u2019s hope it never does.</p>",

Not how to do something as twee as \u201cflourish\u201d during one of the toughest times in her life, but how to just keep putting one foot in front of the other. As we collectively feel the world as we know it shifting under our feet, from worrying about the mortality of our parents, and ourselves, to losing jobs it did not occur to us two months ago could be lost, there are a lot of us who need to hear how to simply make it through the day.</p> <p>\u201cIf someone said to me when I got diagnosed, \u2018Just go and sit under a tree and do some breathing\u2019 \u2013 you know, we don\u2019t do violence anymore, but you would want to punch them in that face. [This book] is really not meant to be that idea,\u201d she says over the phone (face-to-face interviews are not considered essential work).</p> <p>Baird mentions the Stockdale paradox, based on the experience of an American soldier who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for years and who survived it not by convincing himself it would be over soon, but by facing the reality of how terrible it was. Baird says you should be aware of the \u201ccrappy and brutal\u201d situation you find yourself in.</p> <p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t lose the faith that ultimately you will prevail, and that ultimately we will come out of it.

And to get through it, you\u2019ve got to work out what makes you strong and tap into that.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone has their own thing,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor me it was pockets of calm and stillness, and prayer or meditation, and getting into the ocean. It doesn\u2019t mean the days aren\u2019t dark. It doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t times where you totally despair and struggle to even have a grain of hope.

Spain has recorded 130,759 confirmed cases, according to the health ministry. </p> \n  <p>The latest data suggests the growth in the number of infections has slowed to around 5% \u2013 the smallest increase seen since officials began tracking the outbreak. The actual number of cases in the country, however, is likely higher after hard-hit regions such as Madrid and Catalonia instructed people with mild symptoms to self-isolate rather than seek testing,</p> \n  <p>While officials urged caution in interpreting the data, they noted the figures hint at a downward trend, with fewer hospitalisations and a drop in patients needing critical care. \u201cThe sense that we\u2019re getting from the regions is that the pressure is easing,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sierra of Spain\u2019s health emergency centre. \u201cIt\u2019s what we expected after three weeks of distancing measures.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Hans Kluge of the World Health Organization echoed her cautious tone. \u201cCareful optimism as a result of bold measures, innovative approaches and courageous decisions,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hans_kluge/status/1246732106946023430\">he wrote on Twitter</a> after wrapping up a mission to Spain. </p> \n  <p>He added that he had been deeply impressed by the heroism of the country\u2019s frontline workers and the solidarity among Spain\u2019s residents.</p> \n  <p> The impact of the virus has been widespread across the country, which not a single Spanish region spared. As the number of cases continues its steady climb upwards, a handful of municipalities have cut themselves off from the rest of Spain \u2013 and the world \u2013 in hopes of keeping the virus out.</p> \n  <p>Among the most fervent is the southern Spanish municipality of Zahara de la Sierra. Home to some 1,400 people and perched high on a mountain, local officials have used chains and fences to block off all but one of the five access roads to the white village.</p> \n  <p> Police keep constant watch over the one road that remains open, stopping every vehicle that passes to ensure they have the necessary authorisation to enter the town. </p> \n  <p>Those that are allowed through are sprayed with disinfectant before they can proceed up to the fortress town. \u201cFortunately, we don\u2019t have one (coronavirus) case in this municipality, nor anyone in quarantine,\u201d mayor Santiago Galv\u00e1n told Europa Press. </p> \n  <p> Nearby, the village of Setenil de las Bodegas has also sprang into action.
