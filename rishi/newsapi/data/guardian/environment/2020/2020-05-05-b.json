In the past month, at least two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/twin-sisters-one-a-nurse-in-southampton-two-of-the-latest-to-die-from-coronavirus\">pairs</a> of <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8201467/Twin-sisters-66-die-coronavirus-four-days-other.html\">twins</a> have died in Britain and two pairs of brothers, all within hours or days of each other. But do the deaths point to genetic factors that make some more likely than others to succumb to the disease?</p> \n  <p>Most scientists believe that genes play a role in how people respond to infections. A person\u2019s genetic makeup may influence the receptors that the coronavirus uses to invade human cells. How resilient the person is to the infection, their general health, and how the immune system reacts will also have some genetic component.</p> \n  <p>A team led by Prof Tim Spector, head of twin research and genetic epidemiology at King\u2019s College London, has reported that Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/study-of-twins-reveals-genetic-effect-on-covid-19-symptoms\">symptoms appear to be 50% genetic</a>. </p> \n  <p>But Spector said more work is needed to understand which genes are involved and what difference they make to the course of the disease. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if there are genes linked to the receptors or genes linked to how the infection presents,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese deaths alert people to the fact that this could be genetic, but when people live together they share an environment as well,\u201d Spector said. The upshot is that twins who live together are more likely to have similar lifestyles and behaviours, from diet and exercise habits to how quickly they seek medical care. Twins are not generally less healthy than the wider population. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/genetics-in-focus-after-coronavirus-deaths-of-siblings-and-twins\">Genetics in focus after coronavirus deaths of siblings and twins</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb159848f083e60eea309f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:19:11.765Z\">1.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The mayor of <strong>The Hague</strong> has issued a statement ordering police to break up a demonstration by around 200 people who had gathered to protest against measures ordered by the government to slow the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. </p> \n  <p>Police said in a statement that they were \u201cdetaining demonstrators that ignore the mayor\u2019s order\u201d. <span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Local press agency ANP said dozens had been detained.</span></p> \n  <p>The Dutch government has banned public gatherings since mid-March, with people required to stand at least 1.5 metres apart in public spaces.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:54:17.226Z\">at 1.54pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb1584b8f083e60eea309f2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-05T12:17:05.083Z\">1.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Overcrowded, unhygienic prisons in <strong>Latin America</strong> and the spread of the coronavirus both in regional prisons and in the <strong>US</strong> are a source of \u201cmajor concern\u201d, the UN rights office (OHCHR) has said. </p> \n  <p>In some cases, fear of infection has led to riots, killing dozens of inmates in <strong>Venezuela, Peru and Colombia</strong> in recent weeks. </p> \n  <p>OHCHR called for prompt, independent investigations into these incidents. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIn many countries of Latin America, you have really serious overcrowding,\u201d OHCHR spokesman <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Rupert Colville</strong> told a Geneva briefing, referring to the trend as \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chronic problem across the continent and in some cases it can be deadly,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>In some places, overcapacity levels are as high as 500%, a UN official said, adding that new detentions due to violations of Covid-19 measures in places like Peru have exacerbated this.</p> \n  <p>The UN has already voiced concern over hundreds of thousands of people arrested or detained for quarantine violations. </p> \n  <p>Asked about the situation in US jails, he said that thousands of cases of infections in prisons were a \u201cmajor concern\u201d, naming specifically <strong>New York and Chicago</strong>.

The total number of cases stands at 3,582,469. Experts worry the available data is underplaying the true impact of the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins researchers put the known death toll at 251,510.</li> \n   <li><strong>Hong Kong economy suffers deepest contraction. </strong>Hong Kong\u2019s economy, already damaged by months of protest before the coronavirus outbreak, has recorded its worst decline on record.The region\u2019s GDP shrunk 8.9% year-on-year in the first quarter, the deepest contraction since records began in 1974, and the fourth consecutive quarter to drop. Chief executive Carrie Lam noted it was worse than that experienced during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.</li> \n   <li><strong>Five Eyes network contradicts theory Covid-19 leaked from lab.</strong>There is no current evidence to suggest that coronavirus leaked from a Chinese research laboratory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/five-eyes-network-contradicts-theory-covid-19-leaked-from-lab\">intelligence sources have told the Guardian</a>, contradicting recent White House claims that there is growing proof this is how the pandemic began.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>WHO says has no proof from US on \u2018speculative\u2019 Wuhan lab claims. </strong>The World Health Organization said Monday that Washington had provided no evidence to support \u201cspeculative\u201d claims by US president Donald Trump and Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, that the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab, AFP reports.</li> \n   <li><strong>Fauci says there is no scientific evidence virus came from Chinese laboratory. </strong>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the foremost US expert on infections diseases and a key member of Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, said in an interview with National Geographic that there is <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/05/anthony-fauci-no-scientific-evidence-the-coronavirus-was-made-in-a-chinese-lab-cvd/\">no scientific basis</a> for the theory that coronavirus was man-made in a Chinese laboratory, or escaped from a laboratory after being brought in from the wild.</li> \n   <li><strong>Chinese state media on Monday denounced Mike Pompeo as \u201cinsane</strong>\u201d. Pompeo has also joined Trump in attacking the World Health Organization, which said Monday it had no evidence that the virus came out of a laboratory.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was also asked about the lab theory. </strong>Morrison said there had been no change to the Australian position on the theory, which is that no possibilities could be ruled out, but the most likely origin of the virus is a wildlife wet market. He reiterated calls for a \u201ctransparent\u201d review into the outbreak and the World Health Organization\u2019s response to the outbreak. </li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand records no new cases for second day in a row,</strong> as the government considers whether to further relax the country\u2019s lockdown restrictions. Monday was the first time since before New Zealand\u2019s national shutdown began on 25 March that there were no new cases of the virus diagnosed. </li> \n   <li><strong>Australia and New Zealand confirm plans for \u201csafe travel zone\u201d. </strong>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have officially confirmed plans for a \u201csafe travel zone\u201d between the two countries.

Italy and Spain each said they would provide more than \u20ac100m.</li> \n   <li><strong>Austrian unemployment at all-time high. </strong>The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the number of unemployed Austrians to historically high levels, with a year-on-year rise of almost 60%.</li> \n   <li><strong>Carnival to resume cruises in August. </strong>Carnival Cruise Line has announced plans to resume operations at the beginning of August despite dozens of deaths on cruise ships during the Covid-19 pandemic and investigations into the industry\u2019s possible role in spreading the disease around the globe.</li> \n   <li><strong>Plane carrying aid supplies crashes in Somalia. </strong>The accident, involving an African Express Airways plane<strong>, </strong>killed seven people on board, a security official said.</li> \n   <li><strong>US supreme court</strong><strong> hears arguments by teleconference for first time</strong>.

But all that seems like a practice run for 2020.</p> <p>In February data began emerging from northern Italy, the first place in Europe to feel the force of the novel coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in November.</p> <p>\u201cThis virus is probably the one that concerns me the most, of everything I\u2019ve worked on,\u201d Ferguson said in an early TV interview mid-February, when ministers were still focused on how they would implement Brexit.</p> <p>On 16 March, about a month after the earlier interview, Ferguson delivered a 20-page paper to Johnson which transformed the UK\u2019s strategy and has been credited with saving tens of thousands of lives.</p> <p>He told ministers that more than 500,000 people could die if the government continued with its stated strategy of allowing the disease to spread.</p> <p>Eight days later, the government scrapped the strategy in favour of suppressing the virus with a lockdown to save lives and protect the NHS.</p> <p>Ferguson\u2019s work has gone on to form the strategies pursued by the White House, in the US, and the governments of France and Germany, according to reports.</p> <p>He is dedicated to his profession, according to his colleague Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology based at Oxford University most of the time, as well as at Imperial. She said: \u201cHe works harder than anyone I have ever met. He is simultaneously attending very large numbers of meetings while running the group from an organisational point of view and doing programming himself. Any one of those things could take somebody their full time.</p> <p>\u201cOne of his friends said he should slow down \u2013 this is a marathon not a sprint. He said he is going to do the marathon at sprint speed. It is not just work ethic, it is also energy. He seems to be able to keep going. He must sleep a bit, but I think not much.\u201d</p> <p>Ferguson was one of a number of people at the highest levels of government to contract the virus. On 17 March, he took part in a 5pm press conference at No 10 Downing Street, greeting senior members of Johnson\u2019s cabinet before delivering a speech and leaving.</p> <p>The next morning he woke with a dry cough and tested positive for Covid-19. In the days that followed, the prime minister, his chief adviser Dominic Cummings, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, also reported symptoms of the virus.</p> <p>In a statement on Tuesday, Ferguson expressed his regret for ignoring the government\u2019s guidance.</p> <p>\u201cI acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms. I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Those regrets could echo around Whitehall as ministers and senior civil servants rue the loss of an expert who transformed government policy.</p>",
  "<p>Would Alaska\u2019s Mount Denali \u2013 the highest peak in the US \u2013 be as tall if it was situated on the equator instead? Might the Himalayas be even taller if an ice age took hold? Every mountain range is sculpted by rain and wind, but some mountain belts are also sliced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/glaciers\">glaciers</a>, producing the classic horn-shaped peaks, knife-edge ridges and amphitheatre-like valleys, known as \u201ccirques\u201d. A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X20301394\">new study</a> shows that by lightening the load, glacial erosion helps to create higher mountains than might otherwise be expected.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=22746&amp;L=1\">J\u00f6rg Robl</a>, from the University of Salzburg in Austria, and colleagues analysed 16,000 of the world\u2019s highest mountains, comparing their overall height, their steepness and the thickness of the underlying crust supporting them. They found that some of the steepest mountains are found at the highest latitudes, where glacial sculpting predominates. And because glaciers create such \u201cskinny\u201d mountains, they show that the underlying crust (like icebergs, mountains have extensive crustal roots) does not need to be as thick as it would for a non-glacial peak.</p> <p>Which suggests that all things being equal, Denali wouldn\u2019t be as tall if it had popped up in Mexico instead of Alaska. Meanwhile, the Himalayas might have a few 9,000-metre peaks in an ice-house world \u2026</p>",

This covers all people who have died and tested positive for coronavirus. It does not include people who will have died from coronavirus without a test being carried out. As this chart from <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\">the respected Worldometer website </a>shows, today\u2019s total means the headline UK figure has overtaken Italy\u2019s and is now the highest in Europe.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a7e6a780fb9d4c94b5211e5dd256d56b1d1b1c3\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a7e6a780fb9d4c94b5211e5dd256d56b1d1b1c3/0_0_954_1072/890.jpg\" alt=\"Global death figures\" width=\"890\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global death figures</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Worldometer</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But when it was put to Raab that the UK now has the worst record in Europe, he did not accept that. He replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In terms of the comparison you\u2019re suggesting ... I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get a real verdict on how well countries have done until the pandemic is over and particularly until we\u2019ve got comprehensive international data on all cause of mortality.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Raab also suggested that one reason why the UK might be looking so bad was because of the efficiency of the Office for National Statistics. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We now publish data that includes all deaths in all settings and not all countries do that so I\u2019m not sure that the international comparison works unless you reliably know that all countries are measuring in the same way.</p> \n   <p>And it also depends on how good frankly, countries are at gathering their statistics, and our own Office for National Statistics is widely acknowledged as a world leader.</p> \n   <p>I don\u2019t think you can make the international comparisons you\u2019re suggesting at this stage, at least I don\u2019t think you can make them reliably.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab said it would not be safe to re-open all schools in England. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At least to date the evidence has been that we wouldn\u2019t be able to open up all schools without a very real risk that the R rate - the transmission rate - would rise at such a level that we would risk a second spike.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He was speaking in response to a question about whether the UK government agreed with the assessment of the Scottish government, which in <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/advice-and-guidance/2020/05/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making-further-information/documents/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making-further-information/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making-further-information/govscot%3Adocument/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making-further-information.pdf\">a paper published today (pdf)</a> said schools in Scotland could not fully re-open for the foreseeable future. The Scottish document said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Full re-opening [of schools] would cause a resurgence in the virus such that hospital capacity in Scotland would be overwhelmed in less than two months ...</p> \n   <p>We are considering a phased approach to returning pupils to school, when it is safe to do so. We do not consider it likely that schools will reopen fully in the foreseeable future. Indeed, we are not yet certain that they can re-open at all in the near future.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab said cyber criminals, aided by hostile states, were trying to take advantage of the coronavirus crisis.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have clear evidence now that these criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations which are responding to the Covid-19 pandemic which I have to say makes them particularly dangerous and venal at this time.</p> \n   <p>Our teams have identified campaigns targeting healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, research organisations and various different arms of local government.</p> \n   <p>There are various objectives and motivations that lie behind these attacks from fraud on one hand to espionage but they tend to be designed to steal bulk personal data, intellectual property and wider information that supports those aims and they\u2019re with other state actors.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He confirmed that, for the third day in a row, the number of coronavirus tests carried out fell below the 100,000 target set for the end of April.</strong> He said 84,806 tests were carried out on Monday.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said ministers are looking at sports being played behind closed doors in the second phase of the coronavirus response.</strong> Asked about the Premier League possibly returning in mid-June, he replied: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it would lift the spirits of the nation.

This will also allow an opportunity to gather epidemiological evidence about the impact of easing the restriction and be used to provide evidence to the public about the impact of that restriction. To maintain public trust and support it will be important to have acceptable and equitable criteria for selecting which activities can be resumed.

  "<h2>Broadcast</h2> <p>Football is by far the most important sport on TV. If you\u2019re going to spend money on rights it\u2019s got to be on football and it\u2019s got to be the Premier League first, then the Champions League. Before the crisis hit, however, you were getting to a position where broadcasters were beginning to lose money on football. In the UK, Premier League rights had gone so high that BT and Sky Sports were looking to control their costs.</p> <p>The next round of Premier League rights were therefore expected to go down a bit, as they had in the previous round. But a collapse was not being expected. Demand was still there from customers and broadcasters would still pay out for these rights.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/04/efl-football-is-a-trillion-dollar-industry-it-cant-die-darragh-macanthony-peterborough\">Hard choices in the EFL: 'Football is a trillion-dollar industry. It can't die'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At this moment it\u2019s hard to see that things have massively changed. Yet while we\u2019d like to all think things will be back to normal soon, there\u2019s no guarantee. Pubs and clubs, which are a reasonably serious part of the economics, are not going to bounce back for many months. Sky has stopped taking money from these customers while there\u2019s no sport to show and I imagine this will continue. Residential consumers have also been given a fairly easy online pause mechanism; following the logic that if you get people to pause they will come back, but if you cancel you will have to chase them.</p> <p>So expect some bounce-back. To some extent there\u2019s a protection to pay-TV and particularly sports. In Europe, during difficult economic times, sports is what we go back to. But that\u2019s not necessarily the case outside Europe and outside your domestic league within Europe. If pay-TV companies are struggling around the world, non-domestic rights is what they\u2019re going to cut first. A consumer-led recession could also impact on the economics at BT and Sky.</p> <p>There is another aspect to the economics, however. Big Premier League clubs have fairly diversified income. They get a bunch from broadcasting, a bunch from commercial sponsorship and a bunch from matchday. It\u2019s not far off a third of their total revenues each. A club at the bottom end of the Premier League, meanwhile, typically has a much smaller stadium and much less commercial activity. They are more dependent on broadcast income but also less dependent on overseas commercial deals. In the aftermath of Covid-19, this might have the effect of evening the playing field a little bit.</p> <p><em>James Barford, director of telecoms, Enders Analysis.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2950b4c514c89d976a208045d55d8e92eaa81e3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2950b4c514c89d976a208045d55d8e92eaa81e3b/0_0_4421_2948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sky Sports\u2019 Kelly Cates and Gary Neville find some shelter at St Mary\u2019s Stadium.

If we went into lockdown on one side of the us/them divide then some of those divisions seem to have been blurred, if not removed, with clubs and journalists treating each other with far more compassion and respect. It would be great to imagine we\u2019ll all remember just how understanding we\u2019ve been with each other and take that as a new starting point.</p> <p><em>James Cooper, Sky Sports News correspondent.</em></p> <h2>Sponsorship</h2> <p>The full implications of the coronavirus pandemic for sponsorship are starting to emerge and resolving some of the likely issues could be crucial for some clubs\u2019 hopes of surviving. There are two sides to any contract: football clubs not delivering their obligations in terms of not being able to promote sponsored products because they aren\u2019t playing matches and also for the sponsors not being linked to the football club. There is a potential breach of contract from the club\u2019s point of view but equally they may have relatively watertight contracts and feel that if they are not being paid then there are problems at the other end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/05/efl-chief-parachute-payments-evil-eradicated-football\">EFL chief says parachute payments are 'an evil that must be eradicated'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether that means sponsors may ask for some of the money back, much will depend on what each club is committed to do. A lot of the time it involves players travelling to the sponsor and having photos taken in their kit and things of that nature. That element of the contact can\u2019t be fulfilled so sponsors may be asking for their money back or they may be physically unable to pay. We saw that with West Ham\u2019s sleeve sponsor finance firm Basset &amp; Gold [which went into administration in April].</p> <p>The Premier League clubs aren\u2019t out of the woods given their significant wage bills. But lower down the pyramid in Leagues One and Two where clubs rely more on income from match days, they are really hurting at present. The nature of the sponsors at that level also tends to be different; they aren\u2019t global companies like Chevrolet at Manchester United for example or betting companies like you see in the top two divisions. If you are being sponsored by a local business then that business itself is likely to be suffering as a result of the pandemic and therefore will not be able to pay its next instalment.<br><em>Kieran Maguire, senior teacher at the University of Liverpool\u2019s Management School and specialist in football finance.

The Premier League attracts demand for corporate packages from around the world and this market will take a lot longer to recover as there is likely to be a restriction on overseas travel and a reluctance from certain nationalities to come to the UK as we appear to be a hot spot for the virus within Europe. While Eventmasters services are offered on a match-by-match basis, as is the case with other major suppliers, we are contracted with clubs on a seasonal basis and we\u2019ll need to consider our level of commitment to them due to the uncertainty regarding a return.

The grand final will be played on 25 October, with State of Origin to be played in the weeks after that, although no concrete date has been set yet.</p> <p>The Warriors were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/02/warriors-given-green-light-to-enter-australia-and-train-for-nrl-season-starting-on-28-may\">granted a travel exemption</a> to ensure all 16 teams will contest the remainder of the season. The team flew in from New Zealand on Sunday and will be in quarantine for 14 days in Tamworth before moving to the Central Coast, where they hope to play the rest of the season.</p> <p>Details of how the remaining 18 rounds will look have not yet been finalised. A revised broadcast deal with partners Foxtel and Channel Nine has not been reached yet, but details of player payments for the revised competition have been agreed \u2013 an 80% cut for the rest of the season.</p> <h2>Australian rules football</h2> <p><strong>Planned restart: end of June</strong></p> <p>Now that travel restrictions have eased, the majority of clubs are beginning to recall players from interstate breaks, although no official restart date has been announced. There is hope that training might resume next week, in accordance with the government\u2019s phased return to sport plan.</p> <p>Details of what shape any resumed season will take have not yet been finalised, but there is increasing optimism it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/04/afl-almost-past-controversial-hub-idea-as-covid-19-cases-decline-says-sport-minister\">will not involve large-scale quarantine hubs</a>. The idea of players leaving their families for a long period \u2013 up to 20 weeks \u2013 was largely ill-received but the sports minister Richard Colback this week said the AFL has \u201calmost moved past that model now\u201d.</p> <p>A more traditional home-and-away fixture is expected to be able to be completed, with the season suspended after just one round was played before the coronavirus outbreak took hold. A resumption date in June for a modified season is hoped for.</p> <h2>Rugby union</h2> <p><strong>Planned restart: July</strong></p> <p>Rugby Australia has submitted a return to play document to the federal government, but the code is not expected to resume until July. The document, worked on by RA\u2019s return-to-play committee, includes guidelines and details on biosecurity issues and medical provisions around training.</p> <p>It is unlikely RA will make any return-to-play announcement until next week, with the players expected to have three to four weeks training together before contesting any matches. Super Rugby was suspended in mid-March after seven rounds after Australia and New Zealand introduced isolation policies due to concern over the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Sanzaar has acknowledged any return to play by its teams this year would have a strong domestic focus, given possible travel, border and government restrictions. RA\u2019s preferred format is a domestic round-robin home-and-away tournament including the four Super Rugby teams and possibly Western Force.</p> <p>It is believed they would seek to avoid any hub scenario pending government restrictions and the ability to travel interstate.</p> <h2>Football</h2> <p><strong>Planned restart: August</strong></p> <p>A-League clubs are preparing for a competition restart in August with Wellington Phoenix to base themselves in New South Wales for a two-week quarantine period. Football Federation Australia is yet to officially detail the league\u2019s resumption, but clubs are preparing for a July training phase ahead of an August return to games.</p> <p>The league was suspended on 24 March with five rounds, plus finals, remaining. All games are likely to be played in Sydney at venues without spectators. An extra hurdle to potentially overcome lies in which stadiums to use, given the NRL is likely to run concurrently at cross-code venues such as Kogarah and Bankwest Stadium.</p> <h2>Netball</h2> <p><strong>Planned restart: unknown</strong></p> <p>The 2020 season was supposed to start the beginning of May and details on what any revised campaign might look like are at this stage sparse. But Super Netball has been working through scenario planning and is \u201copen-minded to possible season models\u201d, according to CEO Chris Symington.</p> <p>The organisation will be in a position to make an announcement by the end of May, while a decision on whether the Quad Series and Constellation Cup can be held as scheduled in September and October \u2013 featuring Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and England \u2013 will be made in the coming weeks.</p> <h2>Cricket</h2> <p><strong>Planned restart: unknown</strong></p> <p>Any official decisions on how the summer of cricket will look have yet to be made, but all eyes will be on how the coronavirus affects India, who are due in Australia late this year, and in turn any international travel ban that may impact the team\u2019s ability to tour.</p> <p>Depending on how efforts to contain the outbreak go locally, the major domestic competitions, including the Sheffield Shield, Big Bash League and Women\u2019s Big Bash League, may yet begin as scheduled.</p> <p>The men\u2019s national team end their annual leave period on 18 May and while the June tour of Bangladesh has already been cancelled, the ECB is reportedly hopeful of getting Justin Langer\u2019s side to tour England in September. But the safety of players in a nation that has been severely hit by the coronavirus would have to be guaranteed if that were to go ahead.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>With Australian Associated Press</em></p></li> </ul>",

The airline flies mostly to holiday destinations, including St Lucia, Barnados and Orlando, from Gatwick.</p> <p>Alongside the job cuts, subject to consultation, Virgin will significantly restructure its operations. It will immediately retire its seven 747 jumbo jets, and move Gatwick flights to London Heathrow, while retaining its base in Manchester.</p> <p>Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cTo safeguard our future and emerge a sustainably profitable business, now is the time for further action to reduce our costs, preserve cash and to protect as many jobs as possible. It is crucial that we return to profitability in 2021.</p> <p>\u201cAfter 9/11 and the global financial crisis we took similar painful measures, but fortunately many members of our team were back flying with us within a couple of years.</p> <p>\u201cDepending on how long the pandemic lasts and the period of time our planes are grounded for, hopefully the same will happen this time.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Transport has been approached for comment.</p>",
  "<p>Critical care staff are using the power of nature and the joy of being outdoors to help Covid-19 patients recover from the virus.</p> <p>As part of a pioneering project at Derriford hospital in Plymouth, Devon, some coronavirus patients are being wheeled out into a \u201csecret garden\u201d even when they are still being ventilated.</p> <p>Intensive care unit staff believe the feeling of the sunshine, wind \u2013 and even rain \u2013 on patients\u2019 faces can help their recovery.</p> <p>Other hospitals have followed the lead of Derriford, which opened its garden at the end of 2018. The Royal Derby hospital has set up a similar \u201csecret garden\u201d near its ICU, while a new critical care centre at King\u2019s College hospital in south London is planning to include a roof garden for its patients.</p> <p>Derriford\u2019s secret garden was the idea of Kate Tantam, a specialist sister in intensive care.</p> <p>She said: \u201cOne of the things that is really important is the humanisation of intensive care. Intensive care is a very hard place to be. You don\u2019t have much control, you\u2019re in an unfamiliar environment and drugs can affect your level of consciousness.</p> <p>\u201cThe garden is part of the humanisation process. We take patients outside, even if they are ventilated, so they can feel fresh air. There\u2019s a power in the sunlight and fresh air and rain. Some patients like to be out in the drizzle.\u201d</p> <p>As patients recover, pets are allowed into the garden and the occasional can of beer is even permitted for some. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving patients their future back,\u201d said Tantam. \u201cWe try to show people what their future can be like. Patients often say: \u2018I finally know where I am and what time of day it is \u2013 I feel alive and am coming back to myself.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The explorer Robin Hanbury-Tenison described the glorious moment when he was wheeled out into the garden at Derriford and awoke for the first time after almost dying of Covid-19.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e74ba3badace98d4f8a42b092fe497df4aaa223a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e74ba3badace98d4f8a42b092fe497df4aaa223a/0_161_306_184/306.jpg\" alt=\"Robin Hanbury-Tenison with Derriford hospital staff in the \u2018secret garden\u2019.\" width=\"306\" height=\"184\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robin Hanbury-Tenison with Derriford hospital staff in the \u2018secret garden\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Derriford hospital</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hanbury-Tenison, 83, believes the sunshine on his face and his proximity to a scent-rich flowerbed in the hospital courtyard helped stir him from his delirium and precipitated his recovery.</p> <p>\u201cI was in a pretty bad way,\u201d he told the Guardian from his home on Bodmin Moor, Cornwall. \u201cI was heavily sedated. I was suffering from delirium and all sorts of things, completely out of it.\u201d</p> <p>The Derriford secret garden is a modest, paved space with a raised flower bed and some pots. But Hanbury-Tenison said it made all the difference.</p> <p>\u201cThey wheeled me out in a great big bed, with tubes going out in all directions, just to a flowerbed with a shaft of sunlight coming down into the courtyard,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a glorious moment when I woke up and was aware that I was back. I was surrounded by nurses looking like space invaders but chatting away. It was lovely.\u201d</p> <p>Hanbury-Tenison, who had no underlying health conditions, was taken ill shortly after returning from a skiing trip in early March and spent several weeks in an induced coma. He described Covid-19 as a \u201cnasty business\u201d and said he had very nearly \u201cdropped out\u201d a couple of times.</p> <p>Later, as his recovery continued, he took part in basketball and skittles games with other Covid-19 patients in the garden. He said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t forget the healing power of nature. I think hospitals should have secret gardens.

The courtyard is just around the corner and patients can see their beds from the garden.\u201d</p> <p>At King\u2019s in London, the hospital is planning to create a roof garden to help critically ill patients who have side-effects, such as delirium.</p> <p>Dr Tom Best, a consultant in critical care at King\u2019s, said: \u201cSome of our most unwell patients spend weeks or even months in critical care. We know from feedback that a significant number of patients suffer from delirium as they drift in and out of consciousness, which can be very frightening and can delay recovery. During these prolonged hospital stays it\u2019s vital that we care for the mind as well as the body.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far.

However, he warned it was still too early to declare victory.</p> \n<p>\u201cSimply because we have found an antibody which neutralises a virus in a group of cells in a lab Petri dish doesn\u2019t mean that we can expect the same response in patients, nor expect to see a positive change in a patient\u2019s clinical condition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is certainly a very promising discovery, coming from a robust scientific approach, and should be viewed as a reason for optimism.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Israel, the defence minister, Naftali Bennett, claimed researchers had made a \u201csignificant breakthrough\u201d.</p> \n<p>The state-run Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) had created antibodies that could defeat the coronavirus inside humans, he said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Researchers were already moving to patent the antibodies, and the IIBR was looking to mass-produce it, the statement said.</p> \n<p>The defence ministry later said in a separate statement that scientists that the IIBR believed the normal process of tests and regulatory approvals could be shortened to \u201cseveral months\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Both the Israeli and Dutch studies use monoclonal antibodies, which are lab-created proteins that resemble naturally occurring antibodies that make up the immune system.

  "<p>A mayor who lives in a country mansion with extensive gardens has been criticised for refusing to reopen parks in one of Britain\u2019s most deprived towns.</p> <p>Andy Preston, a hedge-fund millionaire who was elected as independent mayor for Middlesbrough last year, has ignored government advice to reopen three of the town\u2019s parks, despite receiving a letter from a minister, who is also a local MP, imploring all local authorities to do so.</p> <p>\u201cFor many people, especially families with children and those who live in homes without a garden, access to public parks is a lifeline,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/880824/Letter_from_Simon_Clarke_re_public_spaces_and_cemeteries.pdf\">wrote Simon Clarke</a>, a local government minister and the Tory MP for Middlesbrough South and Cleveland, in a letter to all councils.</p> <p>But Preston said he had taken the decision because Middlesbrough had been one of the worst affected places in the UK for coronavirus, and it was a \u201ctiny sacrifice\u201d to keep people safe and stop them \u201cloitering\u201d.</p> <p>So far, 582 people in Middlesbrough have tested positive for Covid-19. Of those, 368 had been admitted to the local James Cook university hospital by the end of last week, according to Mark Adams, Middlesbrough\u2019s director of public health. As of last Thursday, 139 local people had died from coronavirus, including 100 in hospital, 36 in care homes, one at home and one in a hospice.</p> <p>On Monday afternoon police were called to break up <a href=\"https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/fines-dished-out-second-police-18200117\">a barbeque and bingo party</a> on the Barmbles Farm estate in the TS3 postcode area of Middlesbrough, which Preston said had the highest infection rate.</p> <p>\u201cWe realised very early on that because we have significantly poor health on average our population is definitely more vulnerable,\u201d said Preston. \u201cBecause we have a dense population we felt we were more likely to see a rapid spreading of the virus. But also because we have lots of open spaces scattered across the town which people can still access, we felt closing three parks was a tiny sacrifice to make in return for improved public safety and quite probably saving lives.\u201d</p> <p>The decision has been criticised by Andy McDonald, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough. He said it was unfair on the poorest people and accused Preston of living in \u201ccloud cuckoo land\u201d after the mayor suggested various beauty spots were still open which would be inaccessible to those without a car.</p> <p>McDonald noted that Preston \u201cenjoys the vast acres of a stately home\u201d adding: \u201cI think a number of our parks could fit within [those grounds]. He can enjoy that but people living in small terraced houses, in multiple occupation, they can\u2019t get their lungs breathing in a pleasant environment. We know that is problematic in terms of people\u2019s mental health and for people with disabilities who depend on the parks as their outlet.\u201d</p> <p>Preston disputed this, saying despite being wealthy he was determined to fight for the rights and needs of the poorest. \u201cI spend lots of time with people who live in back-to-back houses. I have a nice big house, which I enjoy. But what\u2019s crystal clear is that I don\u2019t pretend my life is like other people\u2019s. But I do everything I can to understand their lives and represent them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty disgusting thing for [McDonald] to say \u2026 It is literally Andy McDonald and Labour supporters who live in nice gardens with big gardens who are making a fuss about opening the parks. Blue-collar people who need access to green spaces are happy to use some of the many alternatives.\u201d</p> <p>Preston said it was easy for residents to get to other places to exercise \u2013 a point dismissed by McDonald as \u201cutter rubbish\u201d. McDonald said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a car or have limited mobility it is not viable for you. He\u2019s just living in cloud cuckoo land.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke said he had asked councils to \u201ctake all practical steps so that these vital facilities can remain open for the public to use in a safe manner consistent with social distancing guidelines\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Clarke said: \u201cThe minister is clear that these parks should be open.\u201d</p> <p>Stewart Park, one of the three parks Preston has refused to reopen, is in Clarke\u2019s constituency. Albert Park, in the town centre, and Thorntree Park, situated in <a href=\"https://www.middlesbrough.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Ward-Profile-Brambles_and_Thorntree_2015.pdf\">a deprived part of east Middlesbrough</a>, are also shut.</p> <p>Preston said he would decide when to reopen the parks, not the government. \u201cWhen I feel that people are distancing correctly, when I feel people who will behave well won\u2019t be put at risk by people who behave badly, that\u2019s when I will reopen them.\u201d</p>",

In a population of 11 million, just 2,620 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed to date.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c5e87526-c173-4601-b17f-c93c61e18555\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1nTqaG49Tzw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cLike countries in central and eastern Europe, Greece had a very real sense of the fragility of its health system,\u201d said George Pagoulatos, a political economist who heads the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy. \u201cThat incited the government to take urgent measures earlier than other west European governments which felt a greater sense of complacency about their systems\u2019 ability to handle the crisis.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/east_west_deaths-zip/giv-3902asGXkthG3wEn\" data-alt=\"Europe map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/east_west_deaths-zip/giv-3902asGXkthG3wEn\">Europe map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>There is hope that the response will help Greece regain international prestige after years of battling negative headlines as the eurozone\u2019s perceived black sheep. Both Greece and the Czech Republic have been included in a network of seven nations with successful coronavirus responses convened by the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sebastiankurz/status/1253602361488048128?s=19\">to share</a> best practices.</p> \n<p>In central Europe, some feel the region is not getting enough credit for its lower numbers, and chalk it down to a patronising attitude towards the \u201cnew\u201d EU countries from \u201cold\u201d western Europe.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt comes on the heels of 30 years of lecturing. Whenever you read anything on Eastern Europe, it\u2019s something bad. Look at us, we are great, and you guys are awful. And then you have a major crisis where people die, and the lecturers are in total disarray and the lectured ones do better. Shouldn\u2019t there be more reflection on why?\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/branko-milanovic\">Branko Milanovi\u0107</a>, a Serbian-American economist specialising in global income inequalities.</p> \n<p>Stanley said that while he thought talk in some circles about a \u201ccolonial mentality\u201d from the western half of Europe towards the rest of the continent is overblown, there is a \u201csoft bigotry of low expectations\u201d present in much media coverage and attitudes towards the region.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t used to looking to central and eastern Europe for positive examples,\u201d said a government official in one country of the region. \u201cPartly that\u2019s due to stereotypes, but partly, unfortunately, it\u2019s of our own making. The way our Hungarian friends used the crisis to impose restrictions is hard to justify, and often the region gets lumped together.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has used the crisis to push through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">much-criticised legislation</a> that allows him to rule by decree indefinitely, while Poland\u2019s government plans to hold a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/polish-government-still-planning-to-hold-presidential-election\">controversial presidential election</a> by postal vote this weekend.</p> \n<p>Veronica Anghel, a Romanian political scientist currently at Stanford University, said some countries in the region \u201care being given more credit than they should\u201d for their responses.</p> \n<p>\u201cTiming of lockdown is a blunt instrument, and a bad measure for authorities\u2019 success,\u201d said Anghel. She praised the response of some countries, including Czech Republic and Slovakia, both of which have comparatively well-funded healthcare systems. \u201cBut Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria are on the edge; any increase in cases will tip the system over,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Officials across the region are aware that the possibility of a new surge of infections is always present. For this reason, many countries are contemplating easing their lockdowns but keeping strict border controls to keep out foreign visitors or, at minimum, quarantine all new arrivals.</p>",
  "<p>Last Wednesday, aerial photographs captured a snaking queue, 4km long, of thousands of hungry residents from shantytowns outside Pretoria in South Africa awaiting food packages from a charity organisation. There was a chilling resonance with the images of 27 April 1994, 26 years ago, when citizens lined up to vote for the first time, and put Nelson Mandela into power.</p> <p>Today\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has vowed to find a balance between saving \u201clives <em>and</em> livelihoods\u201d in his government\u2019s response to Covid-19. And he has done well so far with the former. South Africa has been justly lauded for acting quickly to flatten the curve, delaying the pandemic\u2019s exponential trajectory with one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns, now in week six, so that it could screen people in hotspots and prepare its ill-equipped health system to manage the load.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There have been nearly 120,000 arrests for non-compliance, and at least two people have been murdered by security forces</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But in a country that now faces unemployment shooting up to <a href=\"https://ewn.co.za/2020/05/04/sa-s-unemployment-rate-could-possibly-reach-40-due-to-covid-19-mogajane\">more than 40%</a>, according to the government\u2019s own estimates, Ramaphosa\u2019s balance is increasingly hard to strike. And the rigid and unexplained way the government began this week\u2019s easing of the lockdown has brought its admirable reliance on science, and sense of empathy, up against its own political baggage. This has caused a perhaps inevitable fraying of common purpose in this fractious country.</p> <p>Although the curve has been flattened \u2013 only 6,336 confirmed infections by the end of last week, and 133 deaths, in a population of 58 million people \u2013 a wave of infections at some point this year is almost inevitable. All the state can do is delay it. Given that, does it make sense to keep schools and the economy largely shut, and to deny certain freedoms too? The restrictions include a strict nightly curfew, limited and illogical exercise hours, and a total ban on alcohol and tobacco sales.</p> <p>As a direct result of the alcohol ban, and the closure of the ubiquitous shebeens, the trauma wards of the major hospitals are largely empty: in South Africa, many injuries are a result of drinking, from fights to road injuries. The tobacco ban is harder to justify, and the industry has declared a legal challenge. Sin taxes are high, and the finance minister, Tito Mboweni, has <a href=\"[https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2020-04-30-tito-mboweni-reveals-he-does-not-support-ban-on-alcohol-and-cigarette-sales/\">complained publicly</a> about the bans: he is losing \u00a370m a month at a time he can ill-afford it, given the \u00a35bn he has to find in the state coffers as part of a projected <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-21-ramaphosa-announces-r500-billion-covid-19-package-for-south-africa/\">\u00a317</a><a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-21-ramaphosa-announces-r500-billion-covid-19-package-for-south-africa/\">b</a><a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-21-ramaphosa-announces-r500-billion-covid-19-package-for-south-africa/\">n bailout</a>.</p> <p>Ramaphosa has a background in both the trade union movement and the corporate world, and he ran the negotiations that brought about democracy in South Africa. He has used the pandemic to accelerate his ideology of \u201csocial compacting\u201d \u2013 bringing government, business, civil society and labour together \u2013 and has been astonishingly successful at getting big business to pitch into the bailout. He has presented the lockdown restrictions to his compatriots with a kind of mournful compassion, apologising for the tough decisions he has had to make.</p> <p>But this trust is being rapidly eroded by the actions of some of his ministers. The police minister, Bheki Cele, in particular, has brought a martial swagger to the table, threatening harsh retribution for contravening lockdown regulations. It is not surprising the UN Commission for Human Rights has explicitly called South Africa out for using <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-04-30-lockdown-curfew-overkill/\">undue force in the lockdown</a>; there have been nearly 120,000 arrests for non-compliance, and at least two people have been murdered by security forces. </p> <p>The minister responsible for managing the state of disaster, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, lectured the country last week in a castigating tone. Dlamini-Zuma is the ex-wife of the former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/zuma\">Jacob Zuma</a>, and narrowly lost the ANC leadership battle to Ramaphosa in 2017, in which she was widely believed to be a stalking horse for Zuma and his cronies.</p> <p>Dlamini-Zuma <a href=\"https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2020-05-04-john-steenhuisen-shades-nkosazana-dlamini-zuma-over-cigarette-ban/\">champions the tobacco ban</a> (as health minister, she banned public smoking in 2001), and journalists and opposition parties have alleged she has connections to tobacco smugglers. Both Dlamini-Zuma and the alleged tobacco smugglers have denied any wrongdoing. Such claims notwithstanding, she represents the old-school vanguardism of the African National Congress leadership.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2020/may/01/africas-heavy-handed-lockdown-policing-must-not-become-the-new-normal-coronavirus\">Africa's heavy-handed lockdown policing must not become the new normal | Karen Allen and Anton du Plessis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many in the party came to power in 1994 with Soviet-style ideas of state control, but were unable to put them into practice because of the globalisation of free-market economics, the negotiated settlement, and the kind of liberal multiparty democracy that fostered a vibrant civil society. The compromises that the movement\u2019s leaders have had to make have left, in many of them, a profound sense of disappointment, one borne out by the reality of South Africa today. It is the world\u2019s most unequal society, and \u2013 particularly given the expectations of 1994 \u2013 one of its most disaffected. And, to be fair to Cele, South Africa is not Sweden. Due first to apartheid and then to the corruption of the state, South Africans are not known for respecting the law.</p> <p>Into this reality sailed the Covid-19 pandemic. For Ramaphosa, and the reformers in the party, it has presented an opportunity to implement a more collaborative approach to government. But for Dlamini-Zuma and others, it offers an unprecedented opportunity to take control. Already, young South Africans feel alienated from the party\u2019s paternalistic leadership: in the 2018 general election, only 20% of eligible first-time voters even registered to vote.</p> <p>Ramaphosa himself has noted that there can be no business as usual in the post-Covid-19 world. What this means, exactly, remains to be seen: here, as everywhere. What is at stake now in South Africa is far more than a power struggle within the ruling party, now fought on the battleground of the pandemic. Rather, it is the nature of trust itself, at a time when this is most necessary. Without such trust, based on the mutual respect between citizens and their elected leaders, rather than a government\u2019s command of its subjects, South Africa\u2019s fragile contract will disintegrate.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Gevisser\u2019s next book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-pink-line-9781788165143.html\">The Pink Line: The World\u2019s Queer Frontiers</a>, will be published in July.</p>",
  "<p>The Rugby Football Union\u2019s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has warned it would be a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d if the Six Nations is hit next year by coronavirus, admitting the organisation would need a government bailout if England do not play again until next summer.</p> <p>Sweeney revealed the union is facing losses of at least \u00a3100m if England\u2019s autumn internationals are played behind closed doors \u2013 the figure rises to \u00a3122m if they are cancelled. Speaking to the digital, culture, media and sport committee, he conceded that if the Six Nations next year is similarly affected \u201cwe would have to come to the government for support\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/05/mapping-the-future-what-a-global-rugby-season-should-and-shouldnt-look-like\">What a global rugby season should and shouldn't look like in the future | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bleak financial outlook for the RFU comes after World Rugby issued guidelines warning that no competitive rugby should take place <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/04/world-rugby-guidelines-advise-behind-closed-doors-tests-until-vaccine-found\" title=\"\">until governments allow gatherings of 250 people</a>. The guidance also suggests that elite rugby matches are likely to take place behind closed doors, or in front of radically reduced crowds, until a coronavirus vaccine is freely available, which could take up to 18 months.</p> <p>Sweeney said that even if England\u2019s autumn fixtures go ahead as planned the RFU stands to lose \u00a347m. In all likelihood, however, the union \u2013 which has already placed 60% of its staff on furlough \u2013 is facing a far greater hit with Sweeney conceding rugby union may be one of the \u201clast cabs off the rank\u201d because of its high-impact nature.</p> <p>\u201cIf this was to be prolonged and go through into the next summer and the Six Nations games were impacted, then there would be a catastrophic impact on rugby union in England,\u201d Sweeney said, adding that it could take up to six years for the RFU to recover financially from the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>\u201cTwickenham is a major asset for us. Compared to the southern hemisphere, most of those unions don\u2019t own their own stadiums. We tend to own stadiums in the northern hemisphere. When you own a stadium it is a major cost, but you can generate a tremendous amount of revenue from that. Hence the importance of the autumn internationals taking place in November. If we get into a situation where we\u2019re talking about Six Nations matches in February and March next year impacted there\u2019s a limit to what we can do independently \u2013 we would have to come to government for support.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sweeney, however, continues to plan for the autumn fixtures to go ahead, along with England\u2019s postponed Six Nations match against Italy.

Instead of a pollster, though, he\u2019ll be using the poll function on Instagram Stories \u2013 each weekday from 11 May an image of a famous couple will appear and viewers will be able to vote for one of two pithy phrases written by Vezzoli. For example, a photograph of Miss Piggy and Kermit will offer the audience the choice between \u201cnon-binary couple\u201d and \u201ca love supreme\u201d; an image of James Dean and Marlon Brando gives you the options \u201cSlave &amp; Master\u201d or \u201cHair &amp; Make Up\u201d. It\u2019s not all pop culture \u2013 some couples are taken from paintings by Caravaggio or Toulouse-Lautrec.</p> <p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s one picture of Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret,\u201d says Vezzoli. \u201cThey\u2019re both looking at something that we don\u2019t see in such a different way. Under the Queen the word says \u2018finding\u2019 and under her sister I put \u2018looking\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The project is, he says, about the complexity of relationships, as well as acting as a cultural barometer: \u201cIt will be interesting to measure how many people react to each image \u2013 have they forgotten certain icons that maybe in the art world we think are totally recognisable but are no longer relevant to a younger generation?\u201d</p> <p>Each week\u2019s results will be posted on Saturdays, and on Sunday Vezzoli has invited an array of cultural critics, historians and artists to comment on them, from <a href=\"https://robbreport.com/lifestyle/news/can-klaus-biesenbach-fix-the-la-moca-2848295/\">Klaus Biesenbach</a>, the director of Moca in Los Angeles, to \u201cthe most important ancient art historian in Italy\u201d <a href=\"https://italianacademy.columbia.edu/fellow-observatory/salvatore-settis\">Salvatore Settis</a>. I wonder how these critics will be expected to make sense of the poll\u2019s results, given they seem rather open to interpretation \u2013 but that, Vezzoli says, is the whole point. \u201cI have no idea what will happen!\u201d he laughs. \u201cThe beauty of the project is that these people have total freedom to make their own interpretation of other people\u2019s interpretations. Everything is up for critical grabs.

It can be flashy, gleefully shallow, a little daft \u2013 but dig deeper and it contains political undertones. In 2009 he filmed Natalie Portman and Michelle Williams wrestling over a perfume bottle in an advert for a fake fragrance called Greed \u2013 all quite silly, yet clearly a satire on the Berlusconi era too.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qORAiaP0C3s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qORAiaP0C3s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Greed \u2013 video by Francesco Vezzoli</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This work is no different, says Vezzoli. \u201cThere\u2019s an image of Ronald Reagan dancing with Imelda Marcos where they\u2019re both dressed in white satin,\u201d he says. \u201cSo of course if you figure out who they are you start asking \u2013 why is the president of the United States dancing with the wife of a dictator?

When this is over people may end up bingeing on comfort food rather than nouvelle cuisine. But then hopefully, after that, there will be an explosion of something completely new.</p> <p>\u201cThe world has seen tragedies like this before but never within a hyper-technological environment,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe have no idea how this will impact on our brains. I haven\u2019t left my apartment for so long that it has generated in me new emotions that I\u2019ve never dealt with before. It\u2019s unfathomable.

  "<p>Tens of thousands of migrants are trapped in dangerous conditions at frontiers, mines, ports and in transit camps across Africa after states shut their borders in an attempt to stem the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Some have been abandoned by smugglers unable to take them further on their journeys to Europe or elsewhere. Others were returning home or moving across the continent in search of work when frontiers were closed in March.</p> \n<p>They include large numbers of Chadian students stranded in Cameroon, about 1,800 Nigerien workers stuck in remote goldmining areas in Burkina Faso, and more than 1,000 migrants from Mali and Senegal trapped in Mauritania.</p> \n<p>In east Africa, about 2,300 migrants are stranded in Djibouti after being abandoned by traffickers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/29/people-traffickers-fire-at-refugees-forcing-them-into-sea-off-yemen-coast\">Most were hoping to cross the Red Sea to Yemen</a> and then reach Saudi Arabia and the Arabian peninsula, mainly in search of work.</p> \n<p>The migrants are among the marginalised communities who are most vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many are women and children.</p> \n<p>Africa has more than 46,000 reported cases of the disease and 1,800 deaths. However, the numbers are believed to be a fraction of the real toll so far, highlighting a recent warning from the World Health Organization that the continent of 1.3 billion people could become the next centre of the global outbreak.<br><br>Mohamed Ali Nageye, a 29-year-old Somali migrant, said he had been stuck in Djibouti since February. \u201cWe waited for the traffickers but they said nobody can travel because of coronavirus. I am very worried that I cannot continue my journey and also I cannot return to Somalia now because Covid-19 is also bad there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Abdulfatah Hassan Gedi, 25, said he and the other migrants in Djibouti were caught between \u201ca rock and a hard place\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government is harsh on the migrants, we can\u2019t work and it\u2019s very expensive here now \u2026 But worse is if we contract the virus here. We don\u2019t have anybody to support us.

On the northern borders of Niger, migrants are forced to use remote paths in the desert, travelling in small groups to avoid detection, to cross from Niger into Libya or Algeria.</p> \n<p>The combination of increased risk and demands for bigger bribes from corrupt border guards have pushed transportation fees for the trip across the Red Sea to US$1,000 (\u00a3800), up from US$500 before the pandemic, while the fee to cross the desert frontier from Niger into Libya has gone from about $80 to as much as $300.</p> \n<p>Large groups of migrants often find themselves abandoned in perilous situations. In late March, 256 migrants from across west Africa <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/niger/iom-steps-response-migrants-stranded-niger-amidst-covid-19-lockdown\">were left by smugglers in the desert at the border with Libya</a>, a day\u2019s walk from the nearest settlement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9ba2c61a7360abe17770be64adb90a633eb2291\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9ba2c61a7360abe17770be64adb90a633eb2291/68_0_1012_607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Migrants who were dumped in the desert near the Libyan border.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Migrants who were dumped in the desert near the Libyan border.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: International Organization for Migration</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Along with hundreds forcibly expelled from Algeria between mid-march and mid-April, they are now stranded in transit centres and across Niger.

  "<p>Though it\u2019s too early to judge how successful different countries have been in managing this pandemic, it\u2019s hard to escape the view that the UK has failed in several respects. The government muddled its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/uk-covid-19-strategy-questions-unanswered-coronavirus-outbreak\">initial epidemic control strategy</a> and was slow to roll out testing and contact tracing. Shortages in PPE may have contributed to the tragic deaths of frontline health workers. And measures to shield the vulnerable in care and residential homes have been inadequate.</p> <p>These failings aren\u2019t just the result of recent decisions \u2013 in England they\u2019re also symptoms of structural weaknesses in the health system, many of which can be traced back to the 2012 Health and Social Care Act. In October 2011, nearly 400 public health experts signed <a href=\"https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Fnews%2F8804619%2FNearly-400-public-health-experts-warn-Lords-to-reject-NHS-reforms.html&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cd701e0825c964e3f901e08d7f01d4b34%7C569df091b01340e386eebd9cb9e25814%7C0%7C0%7C637241880941487960&amp;sdata=OR208V3VIzV%2Bh4886jS0%2FGtzmvZf2tmGs%2B1cyJl3ukA%3D&amp;reserved=0\">an open letter</a> asking members of the House of Lords to reject these reforms, the brainchild of the former health secretary Andrew Lansley, warning they would \u201cundermine the ability of the health system to respond effectively to communicable disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies\u201d.</p> <p>The reforms were so extensive that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/01/bbc-coverage-nhs-bill\">David Nicholson, the former chief executive of the NHS, described them as \u201cvisible from space</a>\u201d. They abolished primary care trusts (PCTs) and created new clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). The Health Protection Agency, whose functions included protecting the public from infectious disease epidemics, was replaced with Public Health England (PHE). Where the Health Protection Agency was closely linked to the NHS, PHE was closer to Whitehall and the government.</p> <p>This shift was significant. PHE has remained conspicuously quiet during the pandemic, and it has fallen to independent public health experts to point out the errors of the government\u2019s approach. Having worked for government, I know how difficult it is to promote rational and evidence-based public health policy. But this is why public health officials must be given the independence to speak for the public and their health, rather than for the interests of government and Whitehall.</p> <p>Behind the 2012 act was a deep commitment to promoting market competition and expanding the role of private companies in the health system. The Lansley reforms reshaped the NHS as a loose, fragmented collection of public and private enterprises that would compete for funding. We can\u2019t know yet for certain how these changes have affected our response to Covid-19, but there are signs that the public health experts who cautioned against the reforms in 2011 were correct.</p> <p>By pushing the NHS further away from being a coherent, unified and integrated system, the 2012 reforms produced disorganisation and instability. The drive towards commodifying healthcare and enforcing market competition has weakened the NHS by diverting funds to pay for the administrative costs of running a market in a sector that is particularly prone to <a href=\"https://www.lwbooks.co.uk/sites/default/files/s64_02leys.pdf\">market failures</a>. Logistical planning is far more difficult in a competitive system that is designed to respond to short-term market signals. That the government had to recently ban NHS trusts from <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/coronavirus/government-bans-trusts-from-major-ppe-deals-to-stop-them-competing-for-scarce-equipment/7027554.article\">competing against each other</a> to procure ventilators and PPE, thus depleting the national supply, is an example of how illogical market forces are in the face of a pandemic.</p> <p>By increasing the role of the private sector, the government also shrank the public sector\u2019s share of the healthcare market. The number of NHS hospital beds <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/nhs-hospital-bed-numbers\">fell by 5%</a> between 2012 and 2019. Inevitably, the government has rented private hospital beds for Covid-19 patients <a href=\"https://chpi.org.uk/blog/who-benefits-from-the-nhss-bailout-of-private-hospitals/\">at great cost</a>. But it gives no indication that the public sector\u2019s share of healthcare won\u2019t continue to shrink. It has recently contracted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/hospitals-sound-alarm-over-privately-run-test-centre-in-surrey\">Deloitte to run Covid-19 testing centres</a> and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-tests-contact-tracing-serco-g4s-private-firm-a9497371.html\">Serco to run its contact tracing programme</a>, indicating a blind commitment to profit-making businesses rather than to a public health system working in the public interest.</p> <p>The government has long argued that <a href=\"https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.lse.ac.uk%2Fpoliticsandpolicy%2Fnhs-spending-on-the-independent-sector%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Ca2f3f7317ff040bb96d108d7f033919f%7C569df091b01340e386eebd9cb9e25814%7C0%7C1%7C637241976591528108&amp;sdata=wWwQISMxjVz07Ac0ifiVmVuWmyxkBAMaEIFjVndYQrs%3D&amp;reserved=0\">privatising</a> some areas of the public sector delivers greater efficiency. But an estimated <a href=\"https://chpi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CHPI-PluggingTheLeaks-Nov19-FINAL.pdf\">\u00a31.5bn</a> leaks out of the care home industry every year to private companies and financiers. Money lost on ruinous PFI contracts is similarly eye-watering. From 2010 to 2015, companies that ran PFI contracts to build and run NHS hospitals and other facilities made<a href=\"https://chpi.org.uk/papers/reports/pfi-profiting-from-infirmaries/\"> pre-tax profits of \u00a3831m</a>. Over the next five years, almost \u00a31bn of taxpayer funds (\u00a3973m) will go to PFI companies in the form of pre-tax profits \u2013 equivalent to 22% of the additional amount of money <a href=\"http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/news/political-news/government-long-term-plan-to-increase-primary-care-funding-by-45bn/20038047.article\">(\u00a34.5bn) that the government has pledged</a> to the NHS over this period.</p> <p>The belief that NHS organisations should be managed like businesses shifted power from health professionals to finance managers and accountants, and led to changes in management culture. Tensions within healthcare organisations have been a source of difficulty for managers and healthcare professionals alike. Recent cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/02/nhs-whistleblowing-protection-tribunal-junior-doctors\">clinicians being disciplined and punished</a> for raising questions about clinical safety have raised alarm bells. Were concerns about the lack of PPE treated similarly?</p> <p>The 2012 act was aimed at opening up opportunities for private finance to extract profits from the health and social care sector. But it was also driven by a sincere belief that market competition would improve productivity, efficiency and innovation in the NHS. Yet the health and social care workers and local government staff who have often risked their own lives on the frontline of this pandemic haven\u2019t been motivated by market forces, but by the values of professional duty, public service, solidarity and compassion. Almost overnight, Covid-19 overturned the orthodoxies of market competition that have hindered effective care.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has cast light on many aspects of society \u2013 including the way that we fund, organise and manage our health systems. Now, more than ever, the government must agree to a review of the Health and Social Care Act. We need new legislation that restores the NHS to a properly managed public service that works in the public interest, driven by cooperation, compassion and professional ethics.</p> <p>\u2022 David McCoy is a professor of global public health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London</p> <p><br></p>",

We face a \u00a3200m shortfall at the end of September and we need a rescue but we can\u2019t just go from bailout to bailout.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a complete reset and we need to look at the redistribution of revenues. Parachute payments are an evil that needs to be eradicated.</p> <p>\u201cWe have six clubs in the Championship receiving parachute payments which means on average they get \u00a340m per club; the other 18 get \u00a34.5m each. So they\u2019re then struggling to try to keep up. Lower down [in Leagues One and Two] solidarity money is welcome but becomes very small. I don\u2019t like to call it a bailout, I call it a restructuring and a rethinking, but it\u2019s overdue and it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Regarding wages, Parry said: \u201cSalary caps and cost control are absolutely essential and there is a lot of debate about that. We\u2019re not talking about reimposing the maximum wage. We would not be capping at an individual level, we would be capping the total amount that individual clubs could pay \u2013 we are talking about capping the budget.\u201d</p> <p>Parry said that resuming this season behind closed doors would be of limited economic value to EFL clubs. \u201cIt\u2019s finely balanced but probably almost neutral and for a lot of clubs it would cost to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main argument for a resumption would be for reasons of sporting integrity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/20/efl-to-consider-keeping-transfer-window-open-to-help-struggling-clubs\">EFL to consider keeping transfer window open to help struggling clubs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added that relegation from and promotion to the Premier League should take place in full. \u201cWe expect three Championship clubs to be promoted \u2013 the Premier League are aware of our position on that.

A spokesperson said: \u201cParachute payments give newly promoted clubs the confidence to invest in their squads to be competitive in the Premier League. They are also a vital mechanism to give relegated clubs financial support while adjusting to significantly lower revenues and having a higher cost base related to their playing squads.</p> <p>\u201cThe EFL Championship is a highly competitive league with attendances, viewing figures and revenues the envy of second-tier leagues around the world. We see no evidence that parachute payments distort performance at that level and are an essential part of this highly competitive environment.</p> <p>\u201cWe also provide solidarity payments to every other EFL Club, payments without parallel elsewhere in leagues around the world.\u201d</p>",

In 2017 and 2018 Nasa satellites spotted fires on this land, and in 2015 and 2019 De Souza was fined more than \u00a3500,000 for destroying hundreds of acres within it by environment officials who photographed cattle branded with his initials: JF.</p> <p>De Souza has appealed the fines, none of which have been paid. He told officials that he needed pasture and denied that one patch of destroyed forest was his. He claimed his family had owned land here for 30 years, arguing that he had cleared only a minimal area he needed to work, and requested one fine be annulled because he was unable to pay it.</p> <p>Souza did not respond to messages sent to his phone.</p> <p>But to understand how Jair Ferreira de Souza is able to claim ownership of land within a federally protected forest, we need to step back into the Amazon\u2019s chaotic and rapacious history of colonisation.</p> <h2>The landgrabbers</h2> <p>The military dictatorship that ruled Brazil until 1985 \u2013 often lauded by Bolsonaro - encouraged migration and built highways to force development into the Amazon region, but failed to impose a functioning property system. Instead, it <a href=\"http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0103-40142005000200005\">sold</a> off chunks of forest \u2013 then largely government owned \u2013 to private investors. It also handed out lots to migrants who had been encouraged to move there from the poorer north-east.</p> <p>Much of this land was sold on later, often in deals involving unscrupulous notaries in a range of scams that continue until today, aided by the remoteness and lawlessness of the Amazon region. Adding to the disorder, under Brazilian law, improving land you are on can strengthen an eventual ownership claim. And Amazon farmers often argue that previous governments had encouraged them to move to the region, only to plonk a reserve on top of them years later even if they actually squatted the land afterwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba82f083a3b0566503f71683b39a6c156a8ed96b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba82f083a3b0566503f71683b39a6c156a8ed96b/0_0_4200_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cattle grazing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cattle grazing on a ranch inside the Jamanxim Forest protected reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo\u00e3o Laet/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s confusing, as long it\u2019s undetermined who owns what, the guys with the lawyers, the guys with the guns and the influence always win,\u201d said Jeremy Campbell, an associate professor of anthropology at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, who specialises in Amazon land conflicts.</p> <p>Landgrabbers \u2013 nicknamed <em>grileiros</em>, or crickets, after the tested ruse of leaving fake land titles in drawers full of the insects whose secretions turn them yellow and convincingly old-looking \u2013 proliferate in the Amazon.</p> <p>Having some sort of document is key to eventually legitimising stolen land. These days farmers register their own land online \u2013 as was done for de Souza \u2013 but often there is more than one claimant for the same area. In Par\u00e1, there are around three times as many land titles as there is land, state prosecutor Jane Souza said in an interview. In December, Bolsonaro signed a <a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2019-2022/2019/Mpv/mpv910.htm\">measure</a> allowing <em>grileiros</em> to claim up to 2,500 hectares (6,177 acres) of land squatted before 2018 under certain conditions, such as no environmental fines or embargoes. This needs to be approved by Congress.</p> <p>The Jamanxim national forest reserve we were in was created in 2006 to slow rampant deforestation. Farms in the reserve were supposed to be repossessed by the government, but that never happened. Commercial agriculture is not permitted there but many local people have never accepted its reserve status.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1324a26647473e784d8d0a937a8a097cc9c44800\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1324a26647473e784d8d0a937a8a097cc9c44800/0_0_4200_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paulo de Tarso Moreira Oliveira\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr. Paulo de Tarso Moreira Oliveira, Federal Prosecutor of Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo\u00e3o Laet/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paulo Moreira, a federal prosecutor in Par\u00e1, explained in an interview that protected areas like Jamanxim are attractive to speculators who buy illegally cleared land cheaply to sell on, or deforest it themselves, betting it will be regularised in the future and increase in value. \u201cCrime compensates \u2013 and that makes it attractive,\u201d Moreira said.</p> <p>We spoke to residents of Novo Progresso who clearly saw themselves as hard-working pioneers in a hostile wilderness. \u201cWood, gold prospecting and now cattle made this town,\u201d Jadir Rosa told us.

They want to work legally.\u201d Fires were lit to clear land for pasture that is then turned into agricultural land, he explained. \u201cYou get an area of dense forest and deforest it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to burn this wood.\u201d</p> <p>Environmentalists describe a similar deforestation process. First, landgrabbers and loggers remove the most valuable trees, leaving some cover to make it harder for satellites to spot the damage. The remaining trees are then felled, left to dry and burned \u2013 hence the fires. Later grass is sown, and cattle put on the deforested land to consolidate possession.</p> <p>This is \u201cthe classic cycle we have seen in recent years\u201d, said Greenpeace Brazil\u2019s senior forest campaigner, Adriana Charoux. If the farmer feels confident enough about his ownership of the land, the next stage is soya, she added.</p> <p>Soya production is growing in the Novo Progresso area, Menezes said, taking pride in the region\u2019s improving productivity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/02/revealed-amazon-deforestation-driven-global-greed-meat-brazil\">Revealed: rampant deforestation of Amazon driven by global greed for meat</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The firefighters saving the forest</h2> <p>It was striking to see how farming had eaten into the forest on both sides of the BR-163.

A satellite image from 2005, when the reserve was created, found no deforestation in the embargoed areas. In 2017, Nasa satellites found fires around the same area.

In the case of one company, Marfrig, \u201cindirect suppliers\u201d provide more than half of its cattle supplied from the Amazon.</p> <p>Research by Holly Gibbs, a professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin who monitors Amazon cattle supply chains, has found that from 2017\u20132019 there were at least a hundred properties in the Jamanxim forest raising cattle \u2013 68 of them indirect suppliers.

  "<p>Amid the steady stream of stories on the lives lost to coronavirus are cases that stand out as remarkable. In the past month, at least two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/twin-sisters-one-a-nurse-in-southampton-two-of-the-latest-to-die-from-coronavirus\">pairs</a> of <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8201467/Twin-sisters-66-die-coronavirus-four-days-other.html\">twins</a> have died in Britain and two pairs of brothers, all within hours or days of each other. But do the deaths point to genetic factors that make some more likely than others to succumb to the disease?</p> <p>Most scientists believe that genes play a role in how people respond to infections. A person\u2019s genetic makeup may influence the receptors that the coronavirus uses to invade human cells. How resilient the person is to the infection, their general health, and how the immune system reacts will also have some genetic component.</p> <p>A team led by Prof Tim Spector, head of twin research and genetic epidemiology at King\u2019s College London, has reported that Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/study-of-twins-reveals-genetic-effect-on-covid-19-symptoms\">symptoms appear to be 50% genetic</a>. But Spector said more work is needed to understand which genes are involved and what difference they make to the course of the disease. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if there are genes linked to the receptors or genes linked to how the infection presents,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Identical twins Katy and Emma Davis, aged 37, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/twin-sisters-one-a-nurse-in-southampton-two-of-the-latest-to-die-from-coronavirus\">died at Southampton </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/twin-sisters-one-a-nurse-in-southampton-two-of-the-latest-to-die-from-coronavirus\">general </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/twin-sisters-one-a-nurse-in-southampton-two-of-the-latest-to-die-from-coronavirus\">hospital</a> last month. The sisters, who lived together, had underlying health problems and had been ill for some time before they contracted the virus. Another pair of twins, Eleanor Andrews and her sister Eileen, aged 66, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8201467/Twin-sisters-66-die-coronavirus-four-days-other.html\">died earlier this month</a>. They too lived together and had underlying health conditions.</p> <p>Two brothers from Newport, Ghulam Abbas, 59, and Raza Abbas, 54, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/south-wales-brothers-died-within-hours-of-each-other-of-covid-19\">died within hours of each other</a> at Royal Gwent hospital. Another pair of brothers from Luton, Olume Ivowi, 46, and Isi Ivowi, 38, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/luton-brothers-die-of-coronavirus-within-a-week-of-each-other\">died within days of each other</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThese deaths alert people to the fact that this could be genetic, but when people live together they share an environment as well,\u201d Spector said. The upshot is that twins who live together are more likely to have similar lifestyles and behaviours, from diet and exercise habits to how quickly they seek medical care. Twins are not generally less healthy than the wider population.</p> <p>Twin deaths made headlines long before the coronavirus struck. When Julian and Adrian Riester died on the same day in Florida in 2011, a cousin of the twin Franciscan monks said it was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1394008/92-year-old-twin-brother-friars-Julian-Adrian-Riester-die-hours-apart.html\">confirmation that God favoured them</a>\u201d. But Spector sees the hand of cold statistics at work. \u201cWhen you look formally at this, you see that twins rarely die at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are billions of people on the planet. One in 70 is a twin and one in 200 is an identical twin.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Marcus Munafo, professor of biological psychiatry at Bristol University, said reports of twin deaths must be interpreted with caution. Twin deaths are unusual, which makes them newsworthy, but coverage can distort our perceptions. \u201cSalience bias refers to the fact that we tend to focus on information that stands out more, even if it\u2019s not particularly relevant. So we need to be careful not to read too much into events that might stand out for reasons that are not actually related to the issue we\u2019re interested in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen twins or siblings tragically die with Covid-19 that captures our attention, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s any particular reason to think twins or siblings are at greater risk.\u201d</p>",

But nobody wants to go down a legal route and it should just be sorted out politically.\u201d</p> \n<p>The MEPs further complain in their letter about the Home Office\u2019s announcement last month that a resolution centre responsible for processing EU settlement applications would \u201cno longer answer inbound telephone calls, and the postal route for submitting identity evidence is currently suspended, thus delaying the applications\u201d.</p> \n<p>EU nationals have until June next year to successfully apply for settled or pre-settled status in order to be able to stay and work in the country.</p> \n<p>The MEPs write: \u201cWe, as elected representatives of EU member states, wouldn\u2019t accept that British nationals would be discriminated against in the EU in the current situation. Similarly, European citizens living in the UK shouldn\u2019t be unduly deprived of their rights.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: \u201cThe government is protecting the rights of EU citizens resident in the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cBy applying to the EU settlement scheme, EU citizens living in the UK will be able to work, study and access benefits and services in the UK on at least the same basis as they do now.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhether someone has pre-settled status or settled status, this means they have been accepted through the scheme and have secured their rights in UK law.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Case study</h2> \n<h2>\u201cWe have no idea how we are going to survive financially\u201d</h2> \n<p>Udo, a self-employed IT consultant who asked for his real name not to be used, moved to the UK with his wife and child last year from Cyprus.</p> \n<p>The family has pre-settled status but have been unable to claim universal credit.

There is a big uncertainty of not knowing when I will be going back to work as a self-employed or finding a way to pivot my job to generate income.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the meantime, I have to pay rent, bills and buy food for my family.\u201d</p> \n<p>Udo\u2019s wife is pregnant with their second child, due in mid-May.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThis is supposed to be a very exciting time for our family.

  "<p>In a pre-season friendly in the penultimate week of April in South Korea, two Incheon United players picked up water bottles, went to drink, stopped, laughed and then swapped.

That day, however, saw the country record 909 coronavirus cases, its highest number.

All 1,100 staff and players were tested last week and within six hours, all came back negative, with the K-League picking up the tab.</p> <p>There is no concern about football taking resources away from other sectors. Such is South Korea\u2019s capacity it has been exporting tests around the world. Aggressive and extensive testing and tracing have helped it limit the number of deaths to 252 and on 15 April, 66% of a 44 million electorate voted in national elections without any apparent ill-effect.</p> <p>There is no complacency, however. The 12-team league has already reduced the number of games this season from 38 to 27 and the campaign will be count as long as 22 fixtures are completed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1d9ab1e27ea6719eb67305d3853ba324c7f89164\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d9ab1e27ea6719eb67305d3853ba324c7f89164/0_235_3168_4614/687.jpg\" alt=\"Players of Incheon United and Suwon FC keep their distance from one another ahead of their K League practice match.\" width=\"687\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Players of Incheon United and Suwon FC keep their distance from one another ahead of their K League practice match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Newscom/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe virus has calmed down but it hasn\u2019t completely ended,\u201d the president says. \u201cIf a case of the virus is confirmed in a team during the season, then their fixtures, as well as their opponents, will be suspended for at least two weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Other leagues have been in touch. \u201cVarious national football associations have asked questions about the K-League\u2019s step-by-step response process and how to operate in the current situation. We are more than happy to cooperate and share the manual.\u201d</p> <p>The manual helps map out the process but there will be differences on matchday. There are no fans but that should change sooner rather than later and, like at the Asian Champions League games in February, fans will be wearing masks and have their temperatures taken before entering the stadium.</p> <p>Post-match interviews will take place on the pitch, not in a cramped stadium corridor, with reporters staying two metres away. There will be no shaking of hands and coaches are exploring ways to get their instructions across while wearing masks.</p> <p>\u201cExcessive spitting or blowing of the nose is prohibited and players should refrain from close conversations,\u201d says the K-League communication officer, Woo Cheoung-sik. \u201cDuring the game, players who habitually spit or talk closely will be warned.\u201d Sanctions for those who spit and talk repeatedly and/or deliberately will be decided by the league.</p> <p>There has been some pushback on this.

because they received letters about it that are dated before the decision but<strong> </strong>which borrowers said<strong> </strong>they only received after it had already happened.</p> <p>The

Noonan dismissed any link between ME Bank\u2019s move and early super withdrawals allowed under the government\u2019s coronavirus support package that <a

  "<p>There is a word that Des Buckingham, during almost six years working in New Zealand, has used as a mantra to live by. In the Maori language, <em>Mana</em> represents a spiritual essence that almost defies translation but in everyday use it broadly applies thus: a way of holding oneself through dignity, respect, humanity and authority.</p> <p>It has been invaluable over the past five days because Buckingham is navigating one of the biggest disappointments of a young coaching career that, since he moved to the other side of the world after leaving Oxford United in 2014, had rarely let up.</p> <p>When his New Zealand Under-23 side qualified for the Olympic Games last October he expected to be leading them to Tokyo 2020 nine months later. The Covid-19 crisis put that on hold and then the dream was snatched away completely: last Thursday NZ Football confirmed it would not extend his contract beyond August \u2013 effectively making him redundant now \u2013 and that a restructuring would see the senior coach, Danny Hay, take the team to Tokyo next year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/05/shorter-games-under-consideration-for-footballs-return-says-pfa-chief-gordon-taylor-not-45-minutes-each-way\">Shorter games under consideration for football's return, says PFA chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou just have to reflect on a really enjoyable and successful time with some really memorable and historic moments,\u201d Buckingham says. \u201cThe decision\u2019s not going to change. My staff and I have never been ones to shout from the rooftops, whether things are going well or not.\u201d</p> <p>The hurt is still raw but he has only good words to offer about his former employers, even though plenty in his orbit have expressed their views strongly. Speculation over his future had rumbled to the extent that last month a group of 24 players wrote to NZ Football requesting Buckingham and his <em>Whanau</em> (family) be kept together. It was not heeded and last week\u2019s news is understood to have gone down particularly poorly among a squad whose fortunes he had turned around.</p> <p>That comes as little surprise on examining Buckingham\u2019s record. He first came to global attention when New Zealand performed superbly at last year\u2019s Under-20 World Cup in Poland, edged out on penalties by Colombia in the last 16 but equalling the country\u2019s best run at a Fifa event. They did it in style, bucking the image of Kiwi footballers as honest-but-dull grafters with a slick, often scintillating, attacking approach.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the tournament we were a team that, across the last decade, was always outpassed, outshot and outscored,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d won two games in 10 years. So we wanted to agree on a way of playing and showcase exactly what New Zealand players could do on the world stage. I said to them: \u2018Let\u2019s go there with belief and play the way we think we can, even if we lose all three games.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Buckingham put together a document that looked to fuse his playing philosophy with other attributes \u2013\u201ca never-say-die attitude, a humbleness, no egos, a really open people who are receptive to new ideas and putting others first\u201d \u2013 he perceived in a New Zealand player. His side lost once in open play during the tournament, Uruguay winning what was essentially a dead rubber. Honduras were beaten 5-0 and a Norway team featuring Erling Braut Haaland were defeated 2-0.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79c9b227e358e446bcf0181aeb8d4fcc687e9e74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79c9b227e358e446bcf0181aeb8d4fcc687e9e74/0_101_4061_2436/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarpreet Singh, pictured here during a Bayern Munich training session in April, was part of the New Zealand side at the Under-20 World Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarpreet Singh, pictured during a Bayern Munich training session in April, was part of the New Zealand side at the Under-20 World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastian Widmann/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Bayern Munich midfielder Sarpreet Singh was influential and so was Liberato Cacace, a 19-year-old left-back with explosive attacking potential tipped for a move to Europe. The shootout against Colombia was, in Buckingham\u2019s words, \u201cdevastating\u201d because they felt so close to a push for the latter stages. But the point had been made: Kiwi footballers could get it down and play with the best.</p> <p>\u201cWe absolutely flipped it on its head,\u201d he says. \u201cThe playing style was totally different. We were outpassing teams, outshooting them, and reduced opportunities on our goal by a third. Some of the football we played was a pleasure to watch.\u201d</p> <p>He had been combining the under-20s role with the seniors\u2019 assistant manager position but was then tasked with overseeing the Olympic qualification, which was earned via New Zealand\u2019s first football gold medal at a Pacific Games. In a less troubled world that would have been the springboard to his proudest moment yet but joy can still be found in a journey he had never foreseen.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit of a jump but if I hadn\u2019t taken it I\u2019d have always looked back and wondered,\u201d he says of the 12,000-mile journey from Oxford to Wellington. \u201cI can\u2019t describe why, but it felt right.\u201d</p> <p>He had spent a decade with his local club, starting as an academy coach after his ambitions as a goalkeeper in the youth team fizzled out and becoming part of Chris Wilder\u2019s first-team staff at the age of 29. Wilder and the long-serving Mickey Lewis were towering influences; much earlier Brendan Rodgers had been one, too, during a spell playing for Reading\u2019s youth setup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c49134041a333ee387899bc25ca6b3dfc6b5e2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c49134041a333ee387899bc25ca6b3dfc6b5e2e/0_47_2404_1443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Des Buckingham has no regrets over moving to New Zealand. \u2018If I hadn\u2019t taken it I\u2019d have always looked back and wondered.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Des Buckingham has no regrets over moving to New Zealand: \u2018If I hadn\u2019t taken it I\u2019d have always looked back and wondered.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TF-Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So a move to Wellington Phoenix, the only New Zealand club to play in the Australian A-League, took him far from any comfort zone. \u201cMy last game at Oxford was a 12,000 sellout at the Kassam and Dave Kitson had just risen to score the winner,\u201d he says. \u201cI arrived in New Zealand and the first game I went to watch was played to a capacity of 450. Getting on a plane for a few hours to every away game took some adjustment too. But it didn\u2019t take long and the football was of a good standard.\u201d</p> <p>Buckingham was recruited as Phoenix\u2019s assistant but ended up becoming the youngest head coach in A-League history, taking over for six months in early 2017 and steering them away from the bottom of the table. A brief return to England ensued with Stoke\u2019s Under-23s \u2013 he worked under Mark Hughes and Paul Lambert \u2013 but then NZ Football came calling with the under-20 position.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many experiences you get like that in a lifetime,\u201d he says. Once the frustration and, perhaps more pertinently, the country\u2019s lockdown have eased he will look to supplement them, although it will be a wrench to leave.</p> <p>In theory he could take off all by himself: Buckingham received a trial flight with an instructor for his 30<sup>th</sup> birthday five years ago and one thing led to another. Six theory exams and innumerable hours later he emerged with a pilot\u2019s licence for craft of 24 seats or below; his father visited recently and turned a shade or two of green as Buckingham flew him over the breathtaking Marlborough Sounds coastline.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As hobbies go it takes some beating but he hopes a new challenge in football will be consuming him soon.

He replied that the data would not be stored overseas.</p> \n  <p>McKim noted the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (Cloud) Act allowed for law enforcement agencies to seek access to data from US-based tech companies regardless of whether it was stored in America or on foreign soil.</p> \n  <p>Pezzullo said: \u201cWe\u2019re very confident ... in the negotiations generally that were undertaken with the US Department of Justice before Covid ever came on the scene, that there would be no clash of laws, that our laws would prevail, as would American laws in relation to data stored in America.</p> \n  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6511\">bill is currently before the Australian parliament</a> to allow for agreements with like-minded foreign governments \u201cfor reciprocal cross-border access to communications data\u201d.

  "<p>Rare is the NFL draft that provokes second guessing about a kicker. But this year\u2019s edition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/24/nfl-virtual-draft-television-abc-espn\">was no ordinary draft</a> (see: 19, Covid.) And Justin Rohrwasser is no ordinary kicker.</p> <p>When the New England Patriots selected Rohrwasser in the fifth round to replace the legendary Stephen Gostkowski, it was a shock, especially as the 23-year-old hadn\u2019t been considered an exceptional talent in college. ESPN host Trey Wingo was even forced to admit on live TV that the Worldwide Leader in Sports had no highlights of Rohrwasser\u2019s career.</p> <p>And even if there had been any B-roll of a weather-beaten Rohrwasser blasting three-pointers against Rice or Western Kentucky, none of those images could eclipse the more striking one on his left forearm \u2013 of the Roman numeral III ringed in 13 stars. To the untrained eye, the tattoo would seem little more than a marker of youth. To the keener observer, it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/25/justin-rohrwasser-new-england-patriots-kicker-tattoo-three-percenters-nfl-draft\">the unmistakable brand of the Three Percenters</a> \u2013 a far-right paramilitary group that champions gun ownership and resists federal involvement in local matters. Formed in reaction to the 2008 election of Barack Obama, some members of the group took up arms and served as sentries for white supremacist protesters at the 2017 domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, that resulted in 28 injuries and one death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/06/nick-bosa-donald-trump-san-francisco-49ers-nfl-draft\">If athletes like Nick Bosa support Trump they should at least be honest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rohrwasser, who can be clearly seen exercising his right to bare arms in official team photos, has played the na\u00eff. He told reporters that draft night was the first time he\u2019d heard about the significance of his tattoo, which he says he mistook for a US military symbol. He pledged to ink over it, then promised to laser it off entirely, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/28/justin-rohrwasser-tattoo-new-england-patriots-three-percenters\">all the while apologizing to friends and family</a> whom he\u2019d put in the \u201ccompromising position\u201d of having to defend the indefensible.</p> <p>Those attempts at damage control might have sailed through the uprights if he hadn\u2019t followed and \u201cliked\u201d so much far-right social media content. Or recommended books from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/07/how-dangerous-is-jordan-b-peterson-the-rightwing-professor-who-hit-a-hornets-nest\">Jordan Peterson</a> and other radical traditionalists. Or previously bragged about tattooing himself with a sewing needle. Or completely ignored the much bigger tattoo just under his Three Percenters dog whistle that reads \u201cLiberty or Death\u201d. That\u2019s the cry that was last heard by the anti-government protesters who\u2019d sooner drive down to the local statehouse with their guns and exhaust in a policeman\u2019s face than let something as trifling as global pandemic deny them the right to a haircut and a mani-pedi. Michigan governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">Gretchen Whitmer said the demonstrations</a> at her state capitol \u2013 which, among other things, featured armed militia men waving Dixie flags and nooses \u2013 brought back memories of \u201csome of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country.\u201d</p> <p>So profound is the remorse in Rohrwasser\u2019s heart that he apparently spent a portion of what should have been the happiest day of his life crying in his car, according to an anecdote his high-school coach <a href=\"https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/05/04/patriots-kicker-justin-rohrwasser-broke-down-crying-tattoo-controversy/\">shared with the Boston Globe</a>. And, shoot, you had to feel for him. Pro football makes it so easy to summon the sympathy. When white players like Rohrwasser get whistled for their supremacist taunts, somehow, they\u2019re the ones who are forgiven. It was true when Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins used a racial epithet to refer to black and Hispanic teammates. (<a href=\"https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/kerry-collins-used-the-n-word-at-training-camp-while-drunk-with-carolina-teammates-in-1997-a-year-later-he-was-gone-to-new-orleans-01dxggp6jweh\">He blamed it on the alcohol</a>.) It was true when Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper was caught on tape threatening to jump a security barrier at a Kenny Chesney concert and <a href=\"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1723166-riley-cooper-caught-on-tape-saying-racial-slur-at-concert\">\u201cfight every nigger here.\u201d</a> (He blamed it on the alcohol, too.) And it was true when Richie Incognito <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/04/richie-incognito-leave-miami-what-next-dolphins\">bullied his teammate Jonathan Martin</a> \u2013 \u201ca half-nigger piece of shit,\u201d in Incognito\u2019s estimation \u2013 out of the NFL. While Incognito resumed a career to which he\u2019s felt very much entitled, Martin has spent the five years wrestling with his mental health. Collins, Cooper and Incognito all carried on their careers in the NFL, as will Rohrwasser. You could argue that everyone deserves a second chance. Protest about the racism inherent in the US though, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/24/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout-teams-response-interest\">you may well find your football career is over</a>.

We get an ESPN box on Clemson wideout Tee Higgins that ends <a href=\"https://www.cincyjungle.com/2020/4/28/21238980/bengals-espn-tee-higgins-mother-clemson-tigers-football\">with a bullet point</a> about his mom fighting drug addiction for 16 years. We get another bullet in the box on Colorado receiver Laviska Shenault Jr about his mother surviving West Nile virus. We get yet another bullet in the box on Alabama cornerback Trevon Diggs about his father dying of heart failure. It\u2019s enough to make you wonder where the bullet point about all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/25/nick-bosa-nfl-draft-san-francisco-49ers-colin-kaepernick\">racist and homophobic posts Nick Bosa had liked</a> (and subsequently deleted) before he was taken second overall in last year\u2019s draft.</p> <p>For a shop run by Jimmy Pitaro \u2013 the politically averse ESPN president who has promised, on more than a few occasions, to deliver content that sticks to sports \u2013 these digressions are quite far afield indeed. What\u2019s more, every year his network seems to come into the draft with an endless supply of these backstories. (Maybe someday one of the 12,000 draft analysts in ESPN\u2019s employ will find the courage to weigh in.) It\u2019s almost as if there is a stubborn social construct in America that makes it virtually impossible for black athletes to escape the traumatic beats in their humble beginnings. </p> <p>If ever there was a team owner in the league who might appreciate the irony at work here, it\u2019s the Patriots\u2019 Robert Kraft. Here, after all, is a man who not only works with Meek Mill and Jay-Z on criminal justice reform, but also gives liberally to Blue Lives causes, supports the troops and first responders<strong> </strong>and counts our law-and-order president among his closest friends. How does a guy like Kraft wind up drafting a guy like Rohrwasser? Easy. His team had a need, and his coach saw something. With a bit of laser removal and a few clutch kicks, likely, Rohrwasser will soon reduce the breathless stories about his rightward leanings to a \u201cWest Nile\u201d-sized poverty porn bullet. The most people will remember is that he was called out for his extremist affiliations, he wept. As long as Rohrwasser plays the victim, he can never lose.</p>",

Older, poorly maintained stoves pollute even more including risks from carbon monoxide.</p> <p>Even small increases in short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide can increase asthma risks for children. One analysis found that children in homes with gas stoves have a 42% higher chance of having asthma symptoms. Another in Australia attributed 12.3% of all childhood asthma burden to gas stoves.</p> <p>Nitrogen dioxide also makes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease worse and may be linked to heart problems, diabetes and cancer.</p> <p>Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause a headache, nausea, a rapid heartbeat, cardiac arrest and death.</p> <p>The best solution, according to the report, is to change to electric stoves. But individuals with gas stoves can also open windows, cook on their back burners, use an exhaust hood, run an air purifier with a HEPA filter and install a carbon monoxide detector.</p> <p>Indoor air pollution hits poor Americans and people of color worse because they are often also exposed to lead, mercury, highways and industrial plants, said Dr Robert Gould, a California pathologist and board member for Physicians for Social Responsibility who peer-reviewed the report.</p> <p>\u201cWe just need to make these investments,\u201d Gould said. \u201cThis fits into an overall plan we would have to protect, particularly, our vulnerable populations.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019m living with 48 roommates in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.

At one point, I was willing to take a partitioned-off section of a living room someone was renting as a bedroom for $1,500. No dice: the tenants decided to \u201cmove in another direction\u201d in terms of a roommate.</p> <p>When I found <a href=\"https://starcity.com/\">Starcity</a> \u2013 a tech-enabled real estate company that\u2019s part of a new generation of co-living spaces \u2013 it was, by all measures, an improvement to my living situation.

Beds and kitchen appliances are new. Showers don\u2019t inexplicably scald or give me frostbite. Laundry, soap and internet fees are included in rent. My room is my own space. The flexible lease was a major selling point and the price was right, too.</p> <p>My apartment in Oakland rents for $1,250 a month \u2013 about $600 less than the median rent for a studio in Oakland and about $1,000 less than a typical one-bedroom.</p> <p>This is how, at the age of 38, I effectively returned to my freshman year of college. I made a new group of pals and began to settle in. Then came the coronavirus.</p> <h2><strong>Is it possible to protect yourself?</strong></h2> <p>In spite of the pandemic, new residents continue to move into Starcity. But I\u2019ve also seen a good number of residents leaving with packed bags \u2013 some for good, others planning to wait out the worst of the pandemic with friends or family.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, one woman sent me a message asking if I had any intel on penalties for breaking the lease.

One Starcity staff member tested positive for Covid-19, he said, but so far there have been no known outbreaks in Starcity communities.</p> <p>In a co-living environment, refrigerator handles, faucets and elevator buttons are all common touch-points. Even a trip to the kitchen to fetch a cup of coffee could put you in close proximity to your neighbors.</p> <p>So is it actually possible to protect yourself from an outbreak in a place like Starcity?</p> <p>Paula Cannon, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at University of Southern California\u2019s Keck School of Medicine, agrees that co-living certainly isn\u2019t ideal during a pandemic but says there are ways to minimize risk.</p> <p>\u201cIf I was living there as a virologist, I would be your very annoying neighbor sticking leaflets under people\u2019s doors that say \u2018here\u2019s what Starcity is doing\u2019 and \u2018here\u2019s what we can do as neighbors\u2019,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Cannon suggests, for example, creating a schedule for the kitchen, so residents can space out meal times and reduce exposure to others. Cleaning and disinfecting the kitchen before and after each use would help. So would making your bedroom your castle and keeping to it as much as possible.</p> <p>That, she says, requires residents to buy into a shared contract and agree to do their part to protect themselves and their neighbors.</p> <p>Health guidance aside, sheltering in place at Starcity hasn\u2019t always been convenient. Under lockdown, mail and packages to our building have stopped.</p> <p>Dishotsky explains that receiving packages has been a challenge across Starcity communities, partly because they repurpose underused hotels or commercial spaces that lack places to store packages.</p> <p>Weekdays see my neighbors waiting by its front door for deliveries for hours on end. Many packages have been rerouted, delayed, or stopped altogether.

His father, a Stanford professor, rented out rooms to students, rooting his son in co-living early on.</p> <p>After a decade in commercial real estate, Dishotsky said he wanted to create something to help meet the Bay Area\u2019s most pressing need: a healthy stock of affordable housing options.</p> <p>\u201cI saw a way to make a dent in the housing supply and keep it affordable so a city doesn\u2019t push out its restaurant servers, postal workers, journalists \u2013 the ones who make up the backbone and underlying culture of our cities,\u201d Dishotsky explains.</p> <p>Over the years, Starcity has been featured in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/technology/dorm-living-grown-ups-san-francisco.html\">New York Times</a>, <a href=\"https://www.curbed.com/2018/3/8/17097154/affordable-housing-coliving-starcity-common-sro\">SF Curbed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/06/cohousing-san-jose-room-for-rent-starcity-coliving-housing/590731/\">CityLab</a>, with stories exploring the degree to which a concept that once seemed absurd \u2013 a group of adults living together like college students \u2013 could be an answer to the lack of affordable housing.</p> <p>It\u2019s also been subject to skepticism. In 2016 a local news outlet described Starcity as taking <a href=\"https://missionlocal.org/2017/08/sf-mission-residential-hotels-renovated-for-wealthier-tenants/\">advantage of a loophole </a>in city regulations that allows developers to buy single-room occupancy hotels, or SROs, flip them, then raise rents from, say, $450 to $2,100 a month at one San Francisco location.</p> <p>\u201cThat was before we understood the full impact of converting SROs,\u201d Dishotsky says of the criticism, adding that Starcity allowed previous residents at that address to continue to rent at the prices they paid before the building was renovated.</p> <p>Since then, Dishotsky has been outspoken on the issue of displacement, writing <a href=\"https://www.sfexaminer.com/opinion/development-without-displacing-s-f-s-low-income-sro-residents/\">in 2018 op-ed </a>that he refuses to purchase or manage buildings that previously served low-income residents and calling on other developers to do the same.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dafec44af426d3c202b308a0b5750fa28b9e44df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dafec44af426d3c202b308a0b5750fa28b9e44df/0_0_2048_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bedroom at Starcity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starcity feels a lot like a college dorm for grown-ups.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Starcity</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dishotsky believes Starcity\u2019s model is resilient enough to outlast the pandemic, even as companies like WeWork, which offers shared office spaces,<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-wework-layout-changes-bd9185da-0395-4ed6-81ba-e8a0b9498357.html\"> looks to scale back</a> communal areas moving forward.</p> <p>He sees co-living as a model of the future \u2013 one that will one day be embraced not just by single adults<a href=\"https://blog.starcity.com/starcity-master-plan\"> but whole families</a> attracted to communal living and shared childcare.</p> <p>As CEO, Dishotsky\u2019s optimism isn\u2019t surprising. But Cannon, as a virologist, backs him up.</p> <p>\u201cI would be wary of attributing too much to how much coronavirus will change society. We have<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dmxvn/what-will-we-remember-from-the-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic\"> very short memories</a>. Once we get a vaccine, and we will, people will re-emerge and things will go, mostly, back to normal,\u201d Cannon says.</p> <p>The silver lining, Cannon said, could be getting residents to embrace the social contract of taking precautions to look out for their neighbors\u2019 health as well as their own.</p> <p>\u201cThese things build trust and a sense of community,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the underlying human experiences that will ultimately get us through this moment.\u201d</p> <p>As for me, I don\u2019t plan to stay at Starcity forever. The lockdown will eventually pass and one day I might even find a place to settle down. Until then, I\u2019m leaning into the moment \u2013 even if that looks a lot like it did when I was when I was 19 years old.<br></p>",
  "<p>The UK car market ground to a halt in April, with new vehicle sales plunging by 97% to the lowest level since the end of the second world war because of the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p> Just 4,321 new cars were registered last month, after car showrooms were banned from staying open as part of attempts to limit the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>It compared with 161,064 sales in the same month last year, and was the weakest since 1946 when the UK was emerging from war and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/century/1940-1949/Story/0,,105118,00.html\">resources were still rationed</a>, highlighting the historic extent to which pandemic restrictions have hit the economy.</p> <p>The lockdown began on 23 March. Sales for that month fell by 44% compared with 2019, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/06/car-plant-shutdowns-may-cost-auto-industry-more-than-100bn-covid-19\">biggest fall since the financial crisis</a>, before the almost total freeze in April. The majority of the cars sold in April were to fleet buyers who already had them on order, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) which produced the figures.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/25/2020-set-to-be-year-of-the-electric-car-say-industry-analysts\">Electric car sales </a>offered one small bright spot for the industry, with sales down by just 9.7%, meaning 32% of all sales were of battery electric cars with zero exhaust emissions of carbon dioxide \u2013 the highest share on record. Tesla, whose Model 3 was the bestselling car in April, is much less reliant on showroom sales. Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Jaguar I-Pace, an electric SUV, was the second bestselling car.</p> <p>The UK car market was already being squeezed before the pandemic, with confusion over fuel types following emissions-cheating scandals that prompted a consumer and political backlash against diesel cars. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/05/july-car-sales-britain-fall-diesel-brexit\">Brexit uncertainty also held sales back </a>in recent months.</p> <p>Carmakers also face the prospect of pressure from their financing subsidiaries, whose lending has been used in the vast majority of car purchases in recent years. Lenders have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/fears-of-crisis-in-uk-car-finance-market-as-owners-seek-payments-help\">more borrowers asking for for</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/fears-of-crisis-in-uk-car-finance-market-as-owners-seek-payments-help\">bearance </a>as the economy worsens, suggesting some people may have to give up their vehicles before paying for them in full.</p> <p>The government is considering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/boris-johnson-promises-comprehensive-plan-for-reopening-businesses\">how to ease the pandemic lockdown </a>without allowing the disease to spread again, but there are concerns that even a gradual easing of restrictions will do little to spur car sales once more, amid surging unemployment. The SMMT\u2019s latest forecast for 2020 suggests there will be 1.68m new car registrations, the worst year for sales since 1992, when the population was smaller.</p> <p>The industry lobby group said reigniting demand would be key to saving jobs in UK sales and manufacturing. Production <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-car-production-plunged-in-march-to-lowest-level-since-2009\">plunged in March to its lowest level since 2009</a>, and the SMMT\u2019s figures are expected to show a similar freeze in April. All large UK factories have also been closed during the lockdown, although some started to gradually reopen on Monday.</p> <p>Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said, \u201cWith the UK\u2019s showrooms closed for the whole of April, the market\u2019s worst performance in living memory is hardly surprising. These figures, however, still make for exceptionally grim reading, not least for the hundreds of thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on the sector.</p> <p>\u201cA strong new car market supports a healthy economy and as Britain starts to plan for recovery, we need car retail to be in the vanguard. Safely restarting this most critical sector and revitalising what will, inevitably, be subdued demand will be key to unlocking manufacturing and accelerating the UK\u2019s economic regeneration.\u201d</p> <p>Volkswagen\u2019s procurement boss said reduced volumes had made components more expensive, further adding to financial pressures for manufacturers which are running production lines at lower speeds to allow physical distancing by factory workers.</p> <p>\u201cIf we continue to see lower volumes, parts will be more expensive,\u201d Stefan Sommer told the Financial Times.</p>",
  "<p>Music writer Pete Paphides\u2019 recent memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/05/broken-greek-pete-paphides-review\">Broken Greek</a>, contains a vivid description of its seven-year-old author encountering the Stranglers for the first time, during a 1977 Top of the Pops appearance. \u201cThey landed in the living room while I was totally unsupervised,\u201d he writes, \u201cand scared the shit [out] of me. By now I would have seen images of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/from-the-archive-1976-the-birth-of-punk-sex-pistols\">punk rockers</a> \u2026 but they looked like circus entertainers compared to [the Stranglers]. They looked too old to be punk. They looked like the sort of people you pass in the street and your mother puts her arm round you, stares at the pavement and doubles her walking speed \u2026 The point at which it all got too much was when the camera cut to Dave Greenfield \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/04/stranglers-keyboardist-dave-greenfield-dies-after-contracting-covid-19\">who has died</a> from Covid-19 aged 71 \u2013 jabbing his keyboard while looking straight ahead with what seemed, beyond doubt, to be the eyes of a murderer, an effect somehow compounded by the army-surplus boiler suit he had decided to wear. Just like that, my list of phobias had got a little longer: worms, biting into mushrooms, insects, the fibreglass King Kong which stood next to a ring road in Birmingham city centre and, now, Dave Greenfield from the Stranglers.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s funny writing, but it\u2019s also very incisive about the Stranglers: in real life Greenfield was, by all accounts, the band\u2019s most approachable and charming member, but otherwise Paphides has it spot-on. The Stranglers complained relentlessly about not being accepted by the punk cognoscenti, but what did they expect? They didn\u2019t look like punks, particularly Greenfield, who defiantly sported that least punk of facial accoutrements, a moustache. They were old, at least by the standards of the day, old enough to have the kind of musical pasts it was wise to keep your mouth shut about in the scorched-earth environment created by the Sex Pistols: Hugh Cornwell had played bass in a band with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/30/richard-thompson-at-70-on-love-loss-and-being-a-muslim-in-trump-us\">Richard Thompson</a>, later of Fairport Convention; Greenfield had been in a prog rock band called Rusty Butler.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9bb8a1f62b77fb53a5cb314c02dc6ec243a2719c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bb8a1f62b77fb53a5cb314c02dc6ec243a2719c/0_0_3508_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Complex \u2026 Dave Greenfield.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Complex \u2026 Dave Greenfield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Dickson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Worse, Greenfield declined to keep his mouth shut about his past, at least metaphorically speaking. He played keyboards, sometimes several at once: nothing compared to the banks of equipment behind which Rick Wakeman plied his trade, but far more than most punk bands would countenance. Sometimes his playing recalled the reedy organ sounds found on 60s garage rock singles by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F_and_the_Mysterians\">? and the Mysterians</a> or the Standells, which was just about acceptable under punk rules. More often, he played exactly like someone who\u2019d been in a prog rock band, decorating songs with complex arpeggios, which absolutely wasn\u2019t. Moreover, his playing was the Stranglers\u2019 signature sound: with the greatest of respect to Hugh Cornwell\u2019s gruff vocals, or Jean-Jacques Burnel\u2019s fluid bass playing, when you think of the Stranglers\u2019 most famous songs \u2013 from Peaches and No More Heroes to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ynd2A91cXA\">Waltzinblack</a> and Golden Brown \u2013 you think first of Greenfield\u2019s keyboards.</p> <p>His contributions were the solitary aspect of the Stranglers\u2019 music you might describe as beautiful. Everything else about them was as relentlessly, wilfully nasty as their song titles suggested: Ugly, Tits, Bring on the Nubiles, Nice N\u2019 Sleazy, Peasant in the Big Shitty, Down in the Sewer and \u2013 oh God \u2013 I Feel Like a Wog. If it makes for profoundly uncomfortable listening now \u2013 \u201cproblematic\u201d barely begins to cover the lyrical content \u2013 their music had a remarkable power, a sense of unceasing, misanthropic hostility. But they sounded less like a punk band than a band that predated punk, that sprang out of that weird, liminal period immediately prior to 1976, where the bleakness of mid-70s Britain had seeped into rock\u2019s fringes \u2013 the tougher end of the pub-rock scene, the more thuggish bits of late-period glam \u2013 but not yet become codified into series of musical diktats. Which is precisely what they were: they had formed in 1974 as the Guildford Stranglers, Greenfield joining a year later.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYkqLm9cM3Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WYkqLm9cM3Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>It meant that the Stranglers were always regarded with suspicion by the music press \u2013 a state of affairs not helped much by the band\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/12/stranglers-40-years-fights-drugs-ufos\">propensity for violence</a> \u2013 but it also meant that the Stranglers weren\u2019t constrained by punk. Grimly powerful as their debut album Rattus Norvegicus and its follow-up No More Heroes were, there\u2019s a compelling argument that the band really hit their stride on 1978\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5pwx/\">Black and White</a>, by which time Greenfield\u2019s keyboard playing had become more expansive and experimental. It\u2019s never really hailed as such, but Black and White has a claim to be the first post-punk album: the taut dance rhythms, jagged guitars and synthesiser tones of Enough Time and Threatened, the attempt to meld dub reggae with Captain Beefheart on In the Shadows, the claustrophobic racket of Curfew and the stabbing, angular, curiously homoerotic Death and Night and Blood (Yukio) were all adventurous explorations beyond stripped-down rock\u2019n\u2019roll.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"11b072c69dbc48ff11d625f37d8eafa3c330fa8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b072c69dbc48ff11d625f37d8eafa3c330fa8e/0_0_3280_4928/666.jpg\" alt=\"Dave Greenfield in 2014.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dave Greenfield in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Nixon/Future/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the best of their subsequent singles, Greenfield seemed ever-more integral: their extraordinary cover of Walk On By \u2013 on which the Stranglers somehow contrived to turn Dionne Warwick\u2019s exquisite original into six minutes of brooding, barely contained aggression \u2013 was dominated by his organ playing; his rolling piano underpinned Don\u2019t Bring Harry, an authentically chilling song about heroin; on 1979\u2019s fantastic Duchess, his arpeggios are no longer a striking embellishment, but appeared to have consumed the band\u2019s sound entirely. And then there was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-GUjA67mdc\">Golden Brown</a>, which seemed astonishing at the time \u2013 a Stranglers single that got played on Radio 2! \u2013 and seems more astonishing still in retrospect: a harpsichord-led song about heroin in a strange time signature that went to No 2 in the charts. The lyrics were frontman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HughCornwell/status/1257349295742779392\">Hugh Cornwell</a>\u2019s, but it was Greenfield\u2019s show: he wrote the music with drummer Jet Black, his performance is the song\u2019s heart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/02/the-stranglers-how-we-made-european-female\">The Stranglers: how we made European Female</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They were adaptable enough to keep having hits long after most of their peers had split up or faded away, but a certain sense of diminishing returns eventually set in: by the time of 1990\u2019s 10, they sounded perilously close to being Another Rock Band, not an accusation even their loudest detractors could have pinned on the authors of No More Heroes or the deranged concept album The Gospel According to the Meninblack.</p> <p>Yet the Stranglers proved to be weirdly unstoppable \u2013 neither the departure of Cornwell nor the retirement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/12/stranglers-40-years-fights-drugs-ufos\">Jet Black</a>, aged 78, really dented their live following. That might have been the flipside of the Stranglers\u2019 lack of critical acclaim or latterday reappraisal, and the kind of refusal to play by the era\u2019s rules that Greenfield seemed to embody: never fashionable to start off with, they weren\u2019t subject to fashion\u2019s vagaries, instead building a huge, devoted cult following born out of being outsiders.</p>",

they vote no, in which case S\u00e1nchez will have to rely on the backing of smaller parties to swell the 155 votes of the coalition government.</p> <p>The government has hit back at its critics, accusing Casado of acting irresponsibly during a global emergency, and pointing out that the PP rules the Madrid region, the area hardest hit by the virus.</p> <p>The Madrid regional president, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, apologised last week after the <a

  "<p>The human cost of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate crisis</a> will hit harder, wider and sooner than previously believed, according to a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1910114117\">study</a> that shows a billion people will either be displaced or forced to endure insufferable heat for every additional 1C rise in the global temperature.</p> <p>In a worst-case scenario of accelerating emissions, areas currently home to a third of the world\u2019s population will be as hot as the hottest parts of the Sahara within 50 years, the paper warns. Even in the most optimistic outlook, 1.2 billion people will fall outside the comfortable \u201cclimate niche\u201d in which humans have thrived for at least 6,000 years.</p> <p>The authors of the study said they were \u201cfloored\u201d and \u201cblown away\u201d by the findings because they had not expected our species to be so vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers are flabbergasting. I literally did a double take when I first saw them, \u201d Tim Lenton, of Exeter University, said. \u201cI\u2019ve previously studied climate tipping points, which are usually considered apocalyptic. But this hit home harder. This puts the threat in very human terms.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There will be more change in the next 50 years than in the past 6,000 years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead of looking at climate change as a problem of physics or economics, the paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examines how it affects the human habitat.</p> <p>The vast majority of humanity has always lived in regions where the average annual temperatures are around 6C (43F) to 28C (82F), which is ideal for human health and food production. But this sweet spot is shifting and shrinking as a result of manmade global heating, which drops more people into what the authors describe as \u201cnear unliveable\u201d extremes.</p> <p>Humanity is particularly sensitive because we are concentrated on land \u2013 which is warming faster than the oceans \u2013 and because most future population growth will be in already hot regions of Africa and Asia. As a result of these demographic factors, the average human will experience a temperature increase of 7.5C when global temperatures reach 3C, which is forecast towards the end of this century.</p> <p>At that level, about 30% of the world\u2019s population would live in extreme heat \u2013 defined as an average temperature of 29C (84F). These conditions are extremely rare outside the most scorched parts of the Sahara, but with global heating of 3C they are projected to envelop 1.2 billion people in India, 485 million in Nigeria and more than 100 million in each of Pakistan, Indonesia and Sudan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-04T08:24:17/embed.html\" data-alt=\"extreme heat graphic \u2013\u00a0revised\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-04T08:24:17/embed.html\">extreme heat graphic \u2013\u00a0revised</a> </figure>  <p>This would add enormously to migration pressures and pose challenges to food production systems.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is fair to say that average temperatures over 29C are unliveable. You\u2019d have to move or adapt. But there are limits to adaptation. If you have enough money and energy, you can use air conditioning and fly in food and then you might be OK. But that is not the case for most people,\u201d said one of the lead authors of the study, Prof Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University.</p> <p>An ecologist by training, Scheffer said the study started as a thought-experiment. He had previously studied the climate distribution of rainforests and savanna and wondered what the result would be if he applied the same methodology to humans. \u201cWe know that most creatures\u2019 habitats are limited by temperature. For example, penguins are only found in cold water and corals only in warm water. But we did not expect humans to be so sensitive. We think of ourselves as very adaptable because we use clothes, heating and air conditioning. But, in fact, the vast majority of people live \u2013 and have always lived \u2013 inside a climate niche that is now moving as never before.\u201d</p> <p>We were blown away by the magnitude,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be more change in the next 50 years than in the past 6,000 years.\u201d</p> <p>The authors said their findings should spur policymakers to accelerate emission cuts and work together to cope with migration because each degree of warming that can be avoided will save a billion people from falling out of humanity\u2019s climate niche.</p> <p>\u201cClearly we will need a global approach to safeguard our children against the potentially enormous social tensions the projected change could invoke,\u201d another of the authors, Xu Chi of Nanjing University, said.</p>",

He told Sky News that such issues were \u201cunder discussion\u201d between trade unions and the business department but stopped short of setting out how those employers who disobey the rules would be punished.</p> \n<p>The government has been worried that people may be too concerned about coronavirus to want to leave the lockdown, while trade unions warned on Monday that many could refuse to go back to work or stage walk-outs if they felt unsafe.</p> \n<p>Starmer argued that national standards would give \u201ca degree of confidence\u201d, telling ITV\u2019s GMB: \u201cThe point that trade unions have raised is safety at work and there was a consultation document the government put out last weekend which was pretty vague, and it needs strengthening.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7bb26bfc-05df-4557-a9be-5e1c95185a79\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In April the UK government set out these five tests it said had to be met before they would consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>The NHS has sufficient capacity to provide critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK</li>\n     <li>A sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from Coronavirus</li>\n     <li>Reliable data to show that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board</li>\n     <li>Operational challenges including testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) are in hand with supply able to meet future demand</li>\n     <li>Confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why one of the principles I\u2019ve set out today is a national safety standard.

It\u2019s that degree of reassurance.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starmer also raised concerns about the emphasis that Hancock is placing on getting people to download an app to help trace the contacts of those confirmed as infected with coronavirus. The mission to test, track and trace those with coronavirus is part of the plan for new outbreaks of coronavirus to be suppressed, as the UK exits the lockdown.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am a bit concerned that a similar app in Singapore only had a 20% take up rate,\u201d Starmer told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to have more manual tracing as well.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government launched a pilot scheme on Monday to trial the app in the Isle of Wight, where people are being urged to download it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82beeb58-e861-4575-90dd-2b879d1a3a65\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic</a>&nbsp;like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hancock said the app was \u201ca very, very positive step in terms of us all being able to get some of our liberty back\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cBy having the test, track and test in place we can release more of the social distancing measures and, as I said, the more people who download it ... the more effective it will be and the more we can control the spread of the virus, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to do this.\u201d</p> \n<p>The app has been criticised by some campaigners for jeopardising people\u2019s privacy. Amnesty International has raised concerns that \u201cthe government may be planning to route private data through a central database, opening the door to pervasive state surveillance and privacy infringement, with potentially discriminatory effects\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, Hancock dismissed that charge as \u201ccompletely wrong.\u201d Asked why, he said: \u201cFirstly because the data is stored on your phone until you need to get in contact with the NHS in order to get a test and secondly because the purposes of this are purely and simply to control the spread of the virus, which is really important.</p> \n<p>\u201cThirdly because we\u2019ve all had to give up significant infringements on our liberty, for instance with the social distancing measures and the lockdown, and we want to release those, and this approach will help us to release them ...

In the 2017 register, a virus symbol sits in the top right-hand corner of a diagram of likelihood versus consequences. The UK\u2019s strategy for <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf\">managing a pandemic</a>, meanwhile, was first published in 2011. But by 2014, government attention had turned away from pandemic preparation and back to counter-terrorism planning. And by 2016, planners in the UK were fully engaged in confronting the supply-chain disaster that would be Brexit, struggling to figure out how, for example, to <a href=\"https://gcrmag.com/profile/view/coffee-after-brexit\">boost the UK\u2019s coffee supply</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/100000-tests-results-coronavirus-self-isolation\">The 100,000 tests plan misses the point. It's how the results are used that matters | Paul Hunter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Britain is experienced in planning for pandemics \u2013 so where is the emergency management of coronavirus? What we know so far about committees such as the scientific advisory group for emergencies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/google-executive-took-part-in-sage-meeting-coronavirus-tech-firm-confirms\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/google-executive-took-part-in-sage-meeting-coronavirus-tech-firm-confirms\">age</a>) is that they appear to include no independent advisers on emergency planning and management. Expertise in medicine, virology, epidemiology, statistics and global health are all represented. So are behavioural sciences and psychology. Yet there seems to be a prevailing sense that the coronavirus crisis is primarily a medical and epidemiological problem \u2013 and that other aspects are mere fallout.</p> <p>This is not exactly true. Modelling the transmission of the virus, researching a vaccine and procuring antiviral therapies are of course vitally important. But there is more to the coronavirus crisis than flattening its curve. The measures to contain the virus are relatively simple \u2013 physical distancing, testing, tracing and isolation \u2013 but they are laden with consequences, both for society and for individuals. Anticipating these effects and finding ways to mitigate them are the keystone of emergency planning.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis is complicated by the fact we are living in a highly interconnected world, where one event can have a ripple effect across the networks on which we all depend. Halting international travel, for example, has left food producers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/farmers-across-europe-bank-on-improvised-armies-of-pickers-to-save-harvest\">without </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/farmers-across-europe-bank-on-improvised-armies-of-pickers-to-save-harvest\">seasonal migrant</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/farmers-across-europe-bank-on-improvised-armies-of-pickers-to-save-harvest\"> workers</a> to harvest crops. But the arrival of seasonal workers from abroad in the future could lead to a second spike of infections, particularly if they live in close proximity to one another. The issue of a second spike has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/asian-countries-face-possible-second-wave-of-coronavirus-infections\">proved an issue in Singapore</a>, previously lauded for its response to the virus. These are among the types of issues that emergency planners need to consider.</p> <p>Early attempts to deal with the crisis in the UK involved minimising its significance to the public and frantically improvising in a vain attempt to catch up with the spread of the virus. If plans existed, there was an abyss between the decisions mandated by the government and the reality of how they played out on the ground. This underlines the fact that emergency planning must be a live effort. Reality does not stand still \u2013 so neither must the plans for dealing with an emergency. Planners should be able to foresee urgent needs and prioritise them, providing enough personal protective equipment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-care-home-crisis-culpable-neglect\">to the care homes that have become hotspots for the virus</a>, for example, and knowing in advance how to source such equipment in adequate quantities.</p> <p>Numerous academics have presented fairly detailed scenarios for an influenza pandemic since 2008, which covered many of the social, economic and public health consequences that we are now experiencing. But we still don\u2019t have a clear idea about the recovery process, and what actions the government should take to help society and the economy to recover. Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now\">we can look back to the 1918-1920 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now\">flu pandemic</a> for an idea of how long this recovery process might take \u2013 and the challenges that this period will present \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to apply this knowledge to the current crisis when so much has changed.</p> <p>Emergency planning isn\u2019t rocket science, but it\u2019s distinctly challenging on many levels, involving intellectual, scientific and practical decisions. Wherever an event can be foreseen, the plans should be based on a range of scenarios. Planning scenarios aren\u2019t predictions of the future but rather systematic explorations of hypothetical situations, answering the question: \u201cWhat if\u2026?\u201d</p> <p>When disasters strike there should be three elements to the response: plans, procedures and improvisation. We can imagine the planner as an orchestral conductor, directing the members of the orchestra to play their sheet music. It\u2019s the conductor\u2019s job to ensure the musicians play in harmony, and although improvisation can\u2019t be eliminated, it should be reduced to a bare minimum. Emergency planners will be needed to identify and meet the novel challenges that coronavirus presents \u2013 both now and in the future. Never have they been needed more on critical advisory committees.</p> <p>\u2022 David Alexander is professor of risk and disaster reduction at University<br>College London and vice-president of the Institute of Civil Protection and<br>Emergency Management</p>",

Beaumont is among the most solid and clubbable of rugby men and wants nothing less than the best for his sport. The problem is that \u201csteady as she goes\u201d is not the ideal mantra for the cliff edge upon which rugby teeters.</p> <p>Beaumont\u2019s piece of paper is also far from blank. No the Six Nations won\u2019t be budging from its February\u2011March slot, and no there won\u2019t be any big push for gate revenue sharing with poorer southern hemisphere nations. If it stays that way there is no real possibility of a brave new world, merely an extension of the fudging and back-scratching with which rugby remains associated. The clubs will be invited to stay in their box \u2013 or rebel \u2013 and international players will continue to be pulled between two demanding masters to ensure the show stays on the road.

In those days weekly long\u2011haul air travel was a given, player wellbeing was less of a priority and the term \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d was someone else\u2019s problem. Listening to some of the proposals suggesting England should go and play successive rat\u2011a\u2011tat Tests in Japan, South Africa and Argentina in October makes you wonder whether anyone has looked at an atlas lately. Even Bear Grylls would struggle with that itinerary and he doesn\u2019t have to do any scrummaging.</p> <p>No, rugby has to begin by remembering what makes it such a great sport. Its fixture planners need to stop jumping about like grasshoppers on acid and work out what really matters. Personally, the first piece in the jigsaw, apart from the World Cup, would be the British &amp; Irish Lions which offers pretty much everything to which the game should be aspiring: camaraderie, adventure, colour, romance, mass interest and rarity value. Lock it in on a four-yearly basis but with Asia and/or the Americas hosting it once every 16 years and proper preparation time guaranteed. Make it a tour, not a business trip, and the charm will be real and enduring.</p> <p>When should it happen? There is logic \u2013 as long as the club and European competitions are involved in the debate \u2013 in combining the existing July and November international windows between late September and early November when World Cup tournaments are already staged. Which means that, two years in every four, there is a chance to do something meaningful which, hopefully, makes some money.</p> <p>Let\u2019s call it the Lomu Shield: a big name for a big idea. Held biennially in either the northern or southern hemisphere, it would involve three pools of four \u2013 with seedings based on finishing positions from the previous spring\u2019s Six Nations and Rugby Championship \u2013 with the three pool winners and the best runner\u2011up advancing to the semi-finals and a grand final at a pre-arranged venue. The other eight sides would compete for places five to 12, with the bottom\u2011placed side playing off against the top emerging nation side from their own hemisphere (Japan, for the purposes of this argument, would be aligned with the south).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/03/rfu-failing-to-make-most-of-talented-youngsters-academy-rugby-union\">Lost youth: RFU face questions with up to 20% of academy talent at risk | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not quite the proposed Nations League, then, and not quite a pale World Cup imitation, either. There would be an element of relegation jeopardy but the whole thing would be marketable in every region. Buy into it and the rest of the pieces start falling into shape. If the Six Nations were to happen in April and early May would that really be so terrible? Away supporters would still travel, it would be played in better weather on firmer surfaces and showcase the sport at its finest. It would also intersect with the Rugby Championship down south, with the latter reaching a climax a fortnight or so later. No point having too much of a good thing and clashing with the Six Nations finale.</p> <p>All of which means less disruption to the north\u2019s domestic competitions which, Six Nations aside, would be handed a clear run from mid\u2011November to July.</p> <p>A 24-team two\u2011division British &amp; Irish League, a revitalised European Champions Cup, a world club championship? Arguing over the precise details is less important than everyone pulling together for the common good and prioritising a clear, manageable structured season for the players.</p> <p>There would also be more room for women\u2019s rugby, the grassroots game and sevens. The women\u2019s Six Nations in September and October? Sevens as a summer sport? The current Championship and National League One reinvented as a heartland tournament that grips the national imagination? What about Wales or England touring Georgia, Russia and Romania in a Lions year, or New Zealand\u2019s up-and-comers playing midweek club tour matches in the UK and France?

But the news moves on.</p> <p>This time the coronavirus epidemic touches everyone, as all can see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\">who is harmed most</a>. This time, double the death rate for the low-paid, their coffins soon piling up twice as fast in Blackpool or Middlesbrough as in the richest parts of the country, may deliver a shock on the political Richter scale rarely registered before.</p> <p>Years of research show the social gradient of death is not a poverty cliff-edge but that it runs in a straight line from bottom to top: on the graph people get gradually healthier as they get richer. The grim reaper may wave a coronavirus scythe at the Prince of Wales, the prime minister or Tom Hanks, but death prefers the more fertile territory of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/01/covid-19-coronavirus-newham-london-uk-worst-affected-area\">Newham</a>, <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/midlands-health-trust-most-covid-18115295\">Birmingham</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/north-west-overtakes-london-for-number-of-covid-19-hospital-cases-coronavirus\">Liverpool</a>.</p> <p>Professor Michael Marmot, director of University College London\u2019s Institute of Health Equity, drew the seminal social graph of sickness and early death in 1978. He chose Whitehall, where employees are neatly socially graded 1-7, from messengers to top ranks, none destitute, all in secure work. He found a fourfold health difference from bottom to top \u2013 and it applied to all major causes of death. Social differences, such as smoking and weight gain, accounted for only a third of the death-rate difference.</p> <p>Wider surveys since have found the same, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/13/the-spirit-level\">The Spirit Level</a> by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, and Anne Case and Angus Deaton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f2ed9b6-582e-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc\">Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism</a>. What kills is inequality itself. Beyond the struggle to get by, it\u2019s the stigma of disrespect, the lack of choice or agency. Disempowerment makes people ill and die young.</p> <p>Marmot\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/austerity-blamed-for-life-expectancy-stalling-for-first-time-in-century\">report in February</a> measured the steep deterioration in health inequality in England since 2010: the rise in child poverty, insecure work, food banks, worsened living conditions \u201cwith insufficient money to lead a healthy life\u201d, and the loss of children\u2019s centres. \u201cAusterity,\u201d he warned, \u201cwill cast a long shadow over the lives of the children born and growing up under its effects.\u201d</p> <p>Is he surprised that Covid-19 is not a leveller, but has double the death rate in deprived districts? \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what I expected,\u201d he told me this week. \u201cMost diseases follow the social gradient. The poor are most likely to suffer hypertension, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/\">COPD</a> [a lung condition], obesity \u2013 all carrying a greater risk of fatal infection. The poor are older biologically, ageing faster.\u201d</p> <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson, embarrassed by the dramatic reversal of longevity, pledged in the 2019 Tory manifesto to give us an added <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/tory-conservative-manifesto-health-nhs-social-care-spending-funding\">five years</a> of healthy life by 2035. But the cold Covid-19 facts reveal just how far over the rainbow that is. It would require a U-turn in policies \u2013 not just to restore pre-2010 rates of progress but to accelerate them greatly. Marmot\u2019s report expects the opposite: \u201cHealthy life expectancy will improve more slowly, not faster.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/adding-years-to-life-and-life-to-years-our-plan-to-increase-healthy-longevity\">acknowledged the problem</a>, but not the true cause or necessary remedies, in a revealing speech in February to the all-party group on longevity. \u201cA man born in Blackpool can expect only 53 years of healthy life, while a man born in Buckingham gets 68. That\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said. He used the \u201clevelling up\u201d mantra \u2013 aspiring to good jobs, warm homes, better air quality and more cycling. \u201cBut the rest is down to genetics, the environment, and the lifestyle choices we make.\u201d That\u2019s the old story: it\u2019s not money, not inequality, not lack of agency, but that the poor make bad choices. Will the Covid-19 rollcall of death change that perception?</p> <p>Hancock promises to \u201cimprove access to healthcare\u201d, as if NHS failings were the cause of early death. But of all aspects of society, the NHS is the most equal feature in our lives. Intensive care units are packed with the low-paid: they are the sickest. Intensive-care baby cots for premature neonates are most used by disadvantaged families. Unlike the rest of society, only the NHS treats everyone according to need. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so loved.</p> <p>But that\u2019s dealing with the symptoms, not the cause. Inequality is responsible for the longevity decline, and this government has no chance of reversing it without radically transforming life chances. Five more years of healthy life? We must hold the government\u2019s feet to the fire on that promise. The virus has shone a light on the facts of British life and death.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

There\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d</p> <h2>Back from the brink</h2> <p>Ever since a young military officer named Oscar von Beringe discovered mountain gorillas (then promptly shot two of them) in 1902, these magnificent mammals have endured persecution. Disease, hunting and habitat destruction have blighted their two populations, split between Bwindi in Uganda and the Virunga range of extinct volcanoes that straddle DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. </p> <p>It was in 1979 that conservation groups first started collaborating to protect the dwindling population, founding the Mountain Gorilla Project to run tourism and education initiatives to change local attitudes. But gorilla numbers continued to drop, whether they were dying in traps intended for antelope, or being killed in retaliation for raiding crops. Grisly trinkets made from their hands and heads were sold in tourist markets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b68945e0eb5be603f311e02f4868d02c70ed730f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68945e0eb5be603f311e02f4868d02c70ed730f/0_0_5282_3521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mountain gorilla from the Mukiza family rests with an infant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mountain gorilla from the Mukiza family rests with an infant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Losh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The legendary primatologist Dian Fossey began using uncompromising methods to pull these critically-endangered creatures back from the brink, from repelling herders by spray-painting cattle to directly confronting poachers, many of whom were impoverished locals with few options.</p> <p>In 1985, a few weeks before her 54th birthday, Fossey was murdered in Rwanda. Her killers were never found. Shortly before her murder, Fossey had said she feared there would be no mountain gorillas left within 15 years.</p> <p>But a census one year after her death revealed the opposite; numbers were increasing. \u201cThere was a glimmer of success,\u201d says Behm Masozera, the IGCP\u2019s director. \u201cIn order to sustain that success, a more cohesive programme was built around it.\u201d</p> <p>This resulted in the International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP) \u2013 a coalition of nonprofits comprising Conservation International, Fauna &amp; Flora International and WWF that was more formalised than the Mountain Gorilla Project, with a remit across DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. This long-term alliance, argues one member, should be replicated elsewhere. \u201cThis is entirely the way we need to be working,\u201d says Cath Lawson, regional conservation manager for Africa at WWF-UK, \u201cto have that transformational change for wildlife like mountain gorillas to thrive.\u201d</p> <p>In 2003, despite DRC\u2019s protracted conflict and the earlier horrors of the Rwandan genocide, sustained efforts had increased Virunga\u2019s population to 380. An additional 320 in the cloud forests of Bwindi brought the total population to 700 individuals. The upward trajectory continued, propelled by 2015\u2019s intergovernmental treaty. Snares, fashioned from ropes or wires that cut deep into gorilla flesh, began to disappear.</p> <p>In November 2018, the subspecies was upgraded from critically endangered to endangered, having surpassed 1,000 individuals. By the end of 2019, the number of known mountain gorillas reached 1,063. But there is no room for complacency. \u201cYes, this demonstrates what we can achieve,\u201d says Lawson. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a done deal.\u201d</p> <p>Ecotourism has played a central role in this conservation triumph, alongside a scheme that splits the revenue with nearby communities, adapting earlier divisive models of \u201cfortress conservation\u201d into something more inclusive and equitable.</p> <p>Undeniably, though, coercive methods to protect wildlife have devastated traditional life for Batwa \u201cpygmies\u201d, a forest-dependent indigenous minority who were evicted in their thousands from Bwindi and other Ugandan parks as protection activities ramped up in the early 1990s and continue to suffer today.</p> <p>Yet other local communities hail the Bwindi project \u2013 and its pragmatic fusion of wealth creation with environmentalism \u2013 as a genuine gain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"983d69b0d52b6baa61885f28d04c9225af1d6e48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/983d69b0d52b6baa61885f28d04c9225af1d6e48/0_0_5344_3563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tina Katushabe, left, sits with women supported by the Change A Life Bwindi charity as they weave colourful baskets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tina Katushabe, left, sits with women supported by the Change A Life Bwindi charity as they weave colourful baskets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Losh</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.changealifebwindi.org/\">Change A Life Bwindi</a> charity trains former poachers in beekeeping, mothers in basket weaving, and teenage girls unable to afford school in tailoring.

But the Covid-19 crisis has forced government and citizens to act in ways that would have been unimaginable only two months ago.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a newfound respect for people who keep society running that requires us to think again about the true worth of key workers,\u201d says Tomsett. \u201cSchool staff are currently providing them with childcare so that they can save lives.

There might be a decade ahead of us which sees teachers become better trained, be better treated and better respected than we have ever seen. I certainly hope so.\u201d</p>",

The situation is especially precarious for the millions of domestic workers without formal papers, including more than 2 million <em>diaristas </em>(daily workers), whose average wage of 120 reais (\u00a317) a day may sustain their whole family.</p> <p>Brazil has more domestic workers than any any other country \u2013 over 7 million. Maids have steadily gained rights in recent years, and in 2018 the country ratified the International Labour Organization <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_616549/lang--en/index.htm\">convention on domestic workers</a>. But legal loopholes have left many working without the formal status that protects them. Prejudices towards maids are laid bare on sites like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aminhaempregada\">A Minha Empregada</a>, which retweets insults and criticism made by those they work for.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our bodies are affected daily by this racist society</p> <footer> <cite>Juliana Fran\u00e7a</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The national union of domestic workers (<a href=\"https://fenatrad.org.br/\">Fenetrad</a>) has stressed the danger many are now facing. \u201cDomestic workers are among those most exposed to the risks of contracting Covid-19. They use public transport, are in regular contact with others \u2026 and don\u2019t have the option of working from home, especially daily maids.</p> <p>\u201cThey earn on average less than the minimum wage and only around 30% have a formal contract, leaving them more exposed to abuse and violation of their rights.\u201d</p> <p>Underpinning this vulnerability, says Fran\u00e7a, is racism. \u201cWe have a history of almost four centuries of slavery in this country. That means that in 2020, we live in a society that is structurally racist. You are going to say to me: \u2018But I didn\u2019t enslave anyone\u2019, but you benefit from the privileges inherited through this context of slavery. Just as our bodies \u2013 black and from the periphery \u2013 are affected daily by this racist society.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f85f41d68a32d2f29710c8f982de6070278a713b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f85f41d68a32d2f29710c8f982de6070278a713b/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thiago Firmino and other volunteers spray disinfectant in an alley to help contain the spread of coronavirus in the Santa Marta slum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Friday, 10 April 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers in Rio\u2019s Santa Marta favela have been working to sanitise the streets.

  "<p>I\u2019m a man of simple pleasures. One of the ways I keep myself amused is chuckling at financial forecasts.

Is that realistic? What should we be planning for?</p> <p>In our dreams, everything returns to near-normal. Suppose the virus naturally dies down in a month or two, or some other miracle happens, and universities can reopen. There will be a scramble to match applicants to places, and lots of details to fudge, such as what to do about candidates from overseas who have not been able to take English language tests.

Universities will struggle to work out what social distancing means in practice.</p> <p>One scenario being considered is that all courses will have to be offered by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/03/forget-freshers-week-universities-prepare-to-teach-new-first-years-online\">mixture of in-class and online materials</a>. Perhaps lectures are delivered by video, and students come to campus only for small group interaction. Or maybe everything must go online, at least for a time, with students remaining at home. Such contingency planning is already taking place, just in case.</p> <p>Online education works better in some academic areas than others. Classroom-based subjects could perhaps be partly replicated, but lab or studio work presents greater challenges, to use the sector\u2019s preferred euphemism.</p> <p>And so, the crunch. If universities cannot open as normal, at least in part, students could very reasonably decide to defer their places until the following year, assuming things have settled down by then, and take a gap year. But not so fast \u2026</p> <p>It should not be taken for granted that universities are in a position to accept mass deferrals. Even in ordinary years it is not always possible, as highly competitive courses don\u2019t want to tie up too many places for the subsequent cohort. Students could be told that they must reapply, and take their chances against the next year\u2019s applicants. Nothing yet is certain, but universities will have hard, and bitterly unpopular, decisions to make.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/31/covid-19-is-our-best-chance-to-change-universities-for-good\">Covid-19 is our best chance to change universities for good | Steven Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If students do defer, they are hardly going to be looking at a cornucopia of alternative possibilities. Interrail? Volunteer overseas? Intern? Work in a bar? If these were available, then probably the universities would be up and running too. In the worst case, a gap year will be a year of lying on a bed, looking at a screen. If so, a screen containing the contents of the first year of a degree programme could seem newly attractive. Many applicants, not wanting to put their lives on hold, may prefer to get on with it.</p> <p>But there is no room for complacency. Students who do opt for a virtual first year may balk at the expense of a traditional university, which will be making up online learning on the fly. They may well prefer to use an institution such as the Open University, which has decades of experience of distance learning. And why stay virtually in the UK? A global abundance of cheaper, even free, material is out there.</p> <p>Where does all this leave us? As the government is just <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/04/government-refuses-multi-billion-pound-bailout-for-universities\">beginning to acknowledge</a>, it\u2019s going to a bumpy ride, both for students and universities.

Others include expanding broadband so more people can work from home.</p> <p>\u201cTackling climate change has the answer to our economic problems,\u201d Prof Hepburn told the Guardian. In their stimulus packages after the 2008 financial crisis, governments largely failed to capitalise on the carbon-cutting potential of their spending, partly because there was a lack of \u201cshovel-ready\u201d initiatives.</p> <p>This time, countries already have commitments to cut emissions under the Paris agreement, so there is a framework to require them to take account of carbon, as well as better awareness of the economic benefits of renewable energy, electric vehicles and other clean technology. \u201cI think there is a better chance this time of a green recovery,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The findings of the study, published in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy, provide academic backing to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">calls for a \u201cgreen recovery\u201d that have been made by leading experts</a> amid the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>The study also supports calls for any bailouts for fossil fuel companies or heavy emitting sectors, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">airlines</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/carmakers-accused-of-using-covid-19-weaken-environmental-laws\">car manufacturing</a>, to have conditions attached that would require the companies to reduce their climate impact.</p> <p>Brian O\u2019Callaghan, also of the Smith School and co-author of the paper, said governments should act quickly. \u201cFollowing large-scale government spending, there is often a hesitancy on the part of the public to spend more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe natural inclination might be to take an easy pathway.

The centre, which researches health inequalities, has identified at least three suspected coronavirus deaths in hostels since March, with a third of hostels reporting suspected coronavirus cases.</p> <p>There are an estimated <a href=\"https://www.crisis.org.uk/about-us/the-crisis-blog/the-numbers-game-understanding-the-true-scale-of-rough-sleeping/\">11,000</a> rough sleepers in England.

Forthcoming UCL modelling indicates that more than one-third of the hostel and street homeless population could get Covid-19 without intensive infection controls. This could lead to 4,000 hospital admissions and 364 deaths by August.</p> <p>\u201cHostels are as risky as care homes and prisons,\u201d says epidemiologist<strong> </strong>Andrew Hayward, director of UCL Collaborative Centre for Inclusion Health. \u201cThere are lots of people with chronic diseases sharing toilets, showers and communal spaces. They provide the perfect conditions for coronavirus outbreaks.\u201d</p> <p>Another patient at the hotel fell ill while living in a crowded hostel in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, west London. \u201cI tried to self-isolate in my room because I\u2019ve had pneumonia,\u201d says Luke Donnelly, 39. \u201cBut I had to run the gauntlet to get my dinner every day by queuing up at a hotplate with 30 or 40 people. There were also probably about six or seven residents on my landing using the same toilet. It was a recipe for disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Still, London has managed to avoid the far larger and deadly outbreaks seen in US cities, such as <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/27-york-city-homeless-hundreds-cases-died-covid/story?id=70139748\">New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/san-francisco-homeless-coronavirus-msc-shelter\">San Francisco</a>. Testing by UCL\u2019s outreach team suggests only 3-5% of rough sleepers in London are now carrying the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s a very low rate of asymptomatic carriage in our homeless population, particularly when you compare it to the American numbers,\u201d says Story. So far, the three UCLH outreach teams have tested nearly 500 rough sleepers, of whom 29 had the virus. From this week, they will be ramping up their testing capacity to over 100 people a day. One of the teams is led by John Gibbons, a former heroin user and hostel resident. Gibbons has referrals coming in constantly. \u201cWe go and immediately test any suspected cases.

Other UK cities with high number of rough sleepers such as Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle do not have equivalent medically run isolation facilities for homeless people and few appear to be carrying out targeted testing. Instead, rough sleepers with Covid-19 symptoms are having to self-isolate as best they can in homeless hostels or in hotels. </p> <p>The lack of a nationwide Covid care network makes Hayward nervous about future waves of the virus. UCL\u2019s modelling estimates that a second wave could lead to 22,000 homeless people getting the virus. \u201cI\u2019m really concerned we could see further outbreaks in hostels throughout the UK when the lockdown is eased and the transmission starts to pick up again in the wider community.\u201d </p> <p>A Ministry of Housing spokesman says: \u201cOver 90% of rough sleepers known to councils at the beginning of this crisis have now been made offers of safe accommodation \u2013 ensuring some of the most vulnerable in society are protected from the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the hotel, Story is watching six convalescing Covid-19 patients reading donated books on the other side of the hotel car park.

  "<p>Long before Covid-19, there were always bad things in the press about Italy: corruption, mafia, bureaucracy. But, whenever I went, life seemed to work out even so. People may be poor but they still sit in the sun, drink and chat; music and culture are a birthright; the right seems in the ascendant but on the ground it feels blessed with far-seeing idealists \u2013 it has almost four times as much land under organic cultivation as the UK, for example. For now, my remedy to the withdrawal symptoms I feel is to visit via the written word. Many writers have set books in Italy \u2013 I was sorry to leave out Martin Amis\u2019s The Pregnant Widow (Calabria), and Ali Smith\u2019s How to be Both (Ferrara) \u2013 but here are my top 10 <em>romanze italiane.</em></p> <h2>The Other End of the Line by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/06/andrea-camilleri-montalbano-life-in-writing\">Andrea Camilleri</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"409d3fa12c9f466159d0376f3f0558d58e2b66f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/409d3fa12c9f466159d0376f3f0558d58e2b66f7/0_0_374_600/312.jpg\" alt=\"The Other End of the Line cover\" width=\"312\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I can\u2019t leave out my beloved Sicily, and of course that has to mean Inspector Montalbano. The stories are known to many in the UK from the TV adaptations, with their soaring aerial shots of Ragusa and other delectable spots in the island\u2019s south-east, so why not spend longer in that southern sunshine with one of Andrea Camilleri\u2019s books? An eccentric cast of characters keep things light-hearted, and there\u2019s joy also in the detective\u2019s food obsession: you can almost taste the red wine and fried arancini. But this is Sicily, so darkness lurks: mafia, people trafficking, drugs, racism. It\u2019s hard to pick one novel but this one, dealing with a boatful of refugees, has the distinction of having angered rightwing leader Matteo Salvini with its pro-migrant message.</p> <h2>My Brilliant Friend by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/elena-ferrante\">Elena Ferrante</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1168f2aa752383b71b0f4b76e3569bc7eb0eda33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1168f2aa752383b71b0f4b76e3569bc7eb0eda33/1872_0_934_1500/623.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of My Brilliant Friend by Elena Ferrante\" width=\"623\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/nov/07/elena-ferrante-naples-footsteps-my-brilliant-friend-photo-essay\">Elena Ferrante's Naples \u2013 a photo essay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s been done on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/27/my-brilliant-friend-review-national-theatre-london-elena-ferrante\">stage</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/19/my-brilliant-friend-review-elena-ferrante-neapolitan-novel\">TV</a>, but Elena Ferrante\u2019s tale (the first in her Neapolitan tetralogy) of poverty, <em>amici </em>and mafiosi in 20th-century Naples is still best savoured in book form (though I appear to be alone in finding Anne Goldstein\u2019s translation clunky). Readers might picture Len\u00f9 and Lila growing up amid narrow streets picturesquely hung with laundry, but in fact the book\u2019s unnamed \u201cneighbourhood\u201d is not the historic centre but Rione Luzzatti, a blocky Fascist-era suburb beyond the main railway station. From here, readers follow the heroines as they mount expeditions through the tunnel and along the <em>stradone</em> to the central Mercato district, wealthy Vomero and, fatefully, the beaches of beautiful Ischia.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/05/call-me-by-your-name-book\">Call Me by Your Name by Andr\u00e9 Aciman</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4dfc3a2c8fe58a07703eec1f8fbefed85dbfcea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4dfc3a2c8fe58a07703eec1f8fbefed85dbfcea/161_5_3421_2053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from the 2017 movie adaptation of Call Me by Your Name.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from the 2017 movie adaptation of Call Me by Your Name.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/call-me-by-your-name\">2017 Oscar-winning film by Luca Guadagnino</a> is a reasonably accurate rendering of this tender coming-of-age novel, but to keep costs down, the director filmed in locations close to his Lombardy home \u2013 and deprived fans of some gorgeous views. The book is set on the coast near the French border \u2013 and the shimmering Ligurian Sea is almost a character in its own right. You feel the sting of hot gravel on bare legs as the young protagonists (Elio and Oliver) cycle to sun-drenched sandy coves, the shock of an ice-cold drink in a shady garden. An important setting is \u201cMonet\u2019s Berm\u201d \u2013 a secluded cliff ledge claimed by Elio to be the spot from which the impressionist painted his View of Bordighera (the postcard poignantly hanging in Oliver\u2019s study decades later).</p> <h2>A Room with a View by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/emforster\">E</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/emforster\">M Forster</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d6095964e03744144502f904a88dd601f1edf0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d6095964e03744144502f904a88dd601f1edf0d/0_0_2545_1777/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 1985 adaptation of A Room with a View.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1985 film of A Room with a View.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Goldcrest Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Forster\u2019s 1908 novel captures the joy of escaping chilly Blighty for exuberant Italy. Ing\u00e9nue Lucy Honeychurch\u2019s experiences in Florence are (speeding Fiats and noisy Vespas apart) little-changed: the impressive Duomo with its shadowy interior, the banks of the Arno where she strolls with George Emerson. And the views are at their most glorious from hillside Fiesole, where Lucy falls on to a terrace covered with violets and into the arms of her husband to be. After a second half set mostly in Surrey, the book happily whisks us back to Florence, where a honeymooning Lucy gazes out of Pension Bertolini\u2019s window \u2013 at a certain view.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview15\">The Birth of Venus by Sarah Dunant</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d8082923d4a660d3e8f2a6c2c70229605587bae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8082923d4a660d3e8f2a6c2c70229605587bae8/0_0_318_500/318.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of The Birth of Venus, Sarah Dunant\" width=\"318\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Head further back to the Florence of the Medicis with this absorbing story of spirited Alessandra making her way in a city becoming \u201clocked down\u201d by the zeal of fundamentalist cleric Girolamo<strong> </strong>Savonarola. Dunant details the rivalries, politics and drama inside the family palazzo \u2013 in a newly wealthy neighbourhood east of the Duomo whose inhabitants can run to \u201ctorches in great iron baskets to light latecomers home\u201d. But in the pursuit of love and art, the heroine, unusually for a young woman, also gets to roam the city in all its splendour, cruelty, summer heat and \u2026 plague.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/31/fromthearchives.ernesthemingway\">A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"af9785e731193b7f3762ff9e2962b50455a1ce1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af9785e731193b7f3762ff9e2962b50455a1ce1a/0_36_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canale Grande, Trieste.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canale Grande, Trieste.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julien Fromentin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trieste had barely appeared on Britons\u2019 city-break radar before this millennium, but I lived there for a time as a student, and was delighted to find this novel mostly set in the limestone hills north of the city. The dramatic first-world-war tale of the love between an American ambulance driver and a British nurse takes us from Friuli to hospital in Milan, back to the front and on to an action-movie escape via the currents of the Tagliamento River near Udine, before an emotional finale in Switzerland.

Small Italian medieval castle on the shores of the Mediterranean to be let furnished for the month of April.\u201d The women tempted to shrug off wet and dreary Britain are older than Lucy Honeychurch, and struggling. \u201cIt would really be being unselfish to go away and be happy for a little,\u201d says one, \u201cbecause we would come back so much nicer.\u201d Be carried along by the sensual descriptions of the castle, gardens and olive groves leading down to the sea: \u201cThe sun blazed on scarlet geraniums, bushes of them, and nasturtiums in great heaps, and marigolds so brilliant that they seemed to be burning \u2026 all outdoing each other in bright, fierce colour.\u201d</p> <h2>The Name of the Rose by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/umbertoeco\">Umberto Eco</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"938a28880b74c23da5df47fad8cab8622c375156\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/938a28880b74c23da5df47fad8cab8622c375156/0_5_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Sacra di San Michele, Piedmont, Italy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sacra di San Michele.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019ve driven from Turin towards the western Alps, you may have spotted an imposing mountaintop complex, the Sacra di San Michele. This was the Benedictine monastery that inspired Umberto Eco\u2019s first novel (published in 1980 and later filmed with Sean Connery and Christian Slater), though for me it also brings to mind famous Pomposa abbey near Ferrara and a hundred other medieval piles. The bestselling writer and academic brilliantly conveys carvings and frescoes through the way they blow the mind of young novice Adso. This mix of history and mystery is a readable way in to Eco\u2019s writings on love, learning and the search for meaning, while also evoking the ancient worlds and dramatic scenery that Italy does so well.</p> <h2>Acqua Alta by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/donna-leon-interview-commissario-brunetti-earthly-remains\">Donna Leon</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"27e5811a90bb0c35e754c3b962abfef9721c3910\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27e5811a90bb0c35e754c3b962abfef9721c3910/0_0_845_1280/660.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Acqua Alta by Donna Leon.\" width=\"660\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With bodies discovered in canals, piazzas and even La Fenice opera house, the Venice of Commissario Guido Brunetti has, a bit like Inspector Morse\u2019s Oxford, an astonishingly high rate of intriguing murders. Donna Leon\u2019s 29 detective novels are all set in, or near, the city she lived in for decades and have a passionate fan base everywhere except Italy (they have never been translated into Italian). Lovers of La Serenissima at its less-touristy will like this story that unfolds in grim February weather, with <em>acqua alta </em>(floods) in the city (as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/13/waves-in-st-marks-square-as-venice-flooded-highest-tide-in-50-years\">happened last autumn</a>).

We were not going to get a magic wand, a cure, a different-coloured pill to try next time.</p> <p>Now, my husband, Dan, was back at work and, for reasons I can\u2019t really explain, I had decided to take myself shopping rather than go home after the appointment. I stood staring down the flat, grey frontages of Topshop and NikeTown and willed my feet to unstick themselves from the pavement.</p> <p>I ended up wandering the beauty hall of one of London\u2019s more famous department stores. I let myself be persuaded to try a new facial, which uses \u201cmedical-grade lasers\u201d to evaporate pollution and dead skin cells from pores to \u201crejuvenate\u201d and \u201ctransform\u201d your complexion. Upstairs in the treatment room, the form I was handed asked if I\u2019d had any surgery in the past year. I wrote in tight, cramped letters that six months ago I had an operation to remove the remains of a pregnancy, under general anaesthetic. When I handed the clipboard back to the beautician, she didn\u2019t mention it. I wished that she would.</p> <p>As I lay back and felt the hot ping of the laser dotting across my forehead, I thought how ridiculous this all was; that this laser-facial is something humans have figured out how to do. How has someone, somewhere, in a lab or the boardroom of a cosmetics conglomerate, conceived of this \u2013 a solution to a problem that barely exists \u2013 and yet no one can tell me why I can\u2019t carry a baby?</p> <p>There is no doctor who can reverse a miscarriage. Generally, according to medical literature, once one starts, it cannot be prevented. When I read these words for the first time, three years ago, after Googling \u201cbleeding in early pregnancy\u201d, a few days before what should have been our 12-week scan, I felt cheated. Cheated, because when you\u2019re pregnant you are bombarded with instructions that are supposed to prevent this very thing. No soft cheese for you. No drinking, either. Don\u2019t smoke, limit your caffeine intake, no cleaning out the cat\u2019s litter tray. I had assumed, naively, that this meant we knew how to prevent miscarriage these days, that we understood why it happened and what caused it; that it could be avoided if you followed the rules.</p> <p>You learn very quickly that the truth is more complicated. After a miscarriage, no medic asks you how much coffee you drank or if you accidentally ate any under-cooked meat. Instead you find that miscarriage is judged to be largely unavoidable. An estimated one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage, with the majority occurring before the 12-week mark. Seventy-one per cent of people who lose a pregnancy aren\u2019t given a reason, <a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/our-organisation/about-us/charity-news/tell-me-why-tommys-campaign\" title=\"\">according to</a> a 2019 survey by the baby charity Tommy\u2019s. You are told \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 that it\u2019s \u201cjust bad luck\u201d, \u201cjust one of those things\u201d, \u201cjust nature\u2019s way\u201d.</p> <p><em>Just, just, just</em>. A fatalistic shrug of a word. But this is not the whole story. \u201cThere is this myth out there that every miscarriage that occurs is because there\u2019s some profound problem with the pregnancy, that there\u2019s nothing that can be done,\u201d says Arri Coomarasamy, a professor of gynaecology and reproductive medicine, and director of the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://bwc.nhs.uk/tommys\" title=\"\">National Centre for Miscarriage Research</a>, which was set up by Tommy\u2019s in 2016. \u201cScience is trying to unpick that myth.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, the roots of this myth run deep. It\u2019s an idea reinforced by the social convention that you shouldn\u2019t reveal a pregnancy until after 12 weeks, once the highest risk of miscarriage has passed. It goes unchallenged thanks to age-old squeamishness and shame around women\u2019s bodies, and our collective ineloquence on matters of grief. The bloody, untimely end of a pregnancy sits at the centre of a perfect Venn diagram of things that make us uncomfortable: sex, death and periods.</p> <p>An impression persists that, while unfortunate, miscarriages are soon forgotten once another baby arrives \u2013 that you\u2019ll get there eventually. It\u2019s true that the majority of people who have a miscarriage will go on to have a successful pregnancy when they next conceive (about 80%, one <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20649205_Influence_of_past_reproductive_performance_on_risk_of_spontaneous_abortion%20/\" title=\"\">study</a> carried out in the 1980s found). Even among couples who have had three miscarriages in a row, for more than half, the next pregnancy will be successful. Accordingly, the prevailing logic seems to be that not only is miscarriage something that cannot be fixed \u2013 it doesn\u2019t <em>need</em> to be fixed. There is little research or funding for trials, and only glancing attention from the healthcare system. What is not being heard, in all this, is that miscarriage matters.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There is a magical feeling that comes on after a miscarriage, I have found. A semi-delusional state that lasts for days, sometimes weeks, afterwards. After each one of mine (and there have been four now), I\u2019ve caught myself believing I am still pregnant, despite all evidence to the contrary \u2013 the trips to A&amp;E, the blood, the still ultrasounds, the forms labelled \u201csensitive disposal of pregnancy remains\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dae44c5c3b838b7de94eecdb30dcf50e37bec05e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dae44c5c3b838b7de94eecdb30dcf50e37bec05e/0_0_733_1773/413.png\" alt=\"bubbles spot illustration\" width=\"413\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It starts in the mornings. For a moment, stuck somewhere between sleeping and waking, I won\u2019t have remembered, and, briefly, I\u2019m still happy. Pregnant. When the phone rings, for a split second I\u2019ll imagine it is the hospital calling to tell me there has been a mistake. A mix-up. They\u2019ve got the results: I am, in fact, still pregnant. Or my husband will say, casually, over dinner, \u201cOh do you want to hear some good news?\u201d and I\u2019ll think: he\u2019s going to tell me I\u2019m pregnant.</p> <p>It is the shock, I remind myself, the trauma: it leads to disbelief. Like feeling that the loved one who has died is about to walk through the front door any minute and sit in their favourite chair. This inability to accept reality seems logical to me \u2013 inevitable, even \u2013 when there is no explanation for what has happened. The brain wants to solve problems, to make meaning.</p> <p>There are very few specialist miscarriage clinics in the UK. Some people end up being seen by a general gynaecologist or sent to a fertility clinic. Generally, doctors will only agree to look for a possible cause of miscarriages once you have had three in a row. Even after investigations, which in NHS centres tend to look for structural problems with the womb and for blood-clotting disorders, around half of people will <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4229790/\" title=\"\">never be given a reason</a> for their losses. There aren\u2019t even official guidelines on preventing miscarriage \u2013 only on its diagnosis and \u201cmanagement\u201d.</p> <p>With no answers to your questions \u2013 why did it happen? Will it happen again? \u2013 you are cut adrift in a sea of recommendations from women on Mumsnet, private doctors, people offering fertility supplements, herbalists and nutritionists, and from cult best-sellers that promise to tell you how to improve the quality of your eggs. It\u2019s been more than 40 years since embryologist Jean Purdy watched as a single-cell embryo in a petri dish divided into two, then four, then eight cells that would become the world\u2019s first IVF baby. Humans have worked out how to intervene in order to create life in a lab, but not how to sustain it in the earliest weeks inside the body. The stage between conception and an ongoing pregnancy, visible on an ultrasound scan (at around six weeks) is sometimes referred to as the \u201cblack box\u201d of human development.</p> <p>According to Prof Nick Macklon, medical director of the London Women\u2019s Clinic and an expert in miscarriage and early pregnancy, the reason there\u2019s been so little progress is that we\u2019ve been asking the wrong questions. \u201cWe use the term \u2018recurrent miscarriage\u2019 as if it were a medical diagnosis, yet there isn\u2019t one single medical cause,\u201d he said. Some women may have a blood-clotting disorder; for others, a contributing factor could be thyroid dysfunction. Many women who miscarry appear not to have an underlying health condition at all; instead, their bodies seem to be less able to discern what is and isn\u2019t a viable embryo. Yet studies of possible preventative treatments tend to recruit their subjects as if all recurrent miscarriages have the same cause.</p> <p>This, in Macklon\u2019s view, is likely to explain why several large, quality trials of possible treatments to reduce the chance of miscarriage, such as heparin (a blood thinner) and aspirin, as well as the hormone progesterone, have failed to show any clear benefit, and have subsequently been dismissed by the medical community. Some of these treatments may in fact work for some women, but, Macklon says, \u201cbecause of the way the study is designed, it comes out as not working overall\u201d.</p> <p>A related problem lies in the mistaken assumption that most (if not all) miscarriages happen because the pregnancy was doomed to fail. In half of all miscarriages, the embryo will have a serious chromosomal abnormality that means it could never survive, but the other half are believed to be healthy embryos. Prof Siobhan Quenby, a consultant obstetrician at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, heads up a specialist clinic into recurrent miscarriage, one of four centres that form Tommy\u2019s National Centre for Miscarriage Research. The key question, she believes, is establishing whether someone is repeatedly losing chromosomally normal or abnormal pregnancies. \u201cEveryone from their third miscarriage onwards should have their miscarriage tissue tested genetically,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Yet access to genetic testing is patchy. Not all NHS hospitals can do this kind of testing on site. If someone miscarries at home, the onus is on them to collect a clean sample of the tissue and take it to their hospital within 24 hours. This may not be something they can do \u2013 or even know about.</p> <p>Quenby is a celebrity in the world of recurrent miscarriage patients. Her name often crops up in the \u201cmiracle baby\u201d stories that make the papers, with headlines <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-48615134\" title=\"\">such as</a> \u201cBaby joy for couple who lost 13 babies to miscarriages\u201d. Her particular area of interest is how the lining of the womb behaves in early pregnancy \u2013 and how it might contribute to miscarriage. She is one of the authors of <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/recurrent_miscarriage_diabetes/\" title=\"\">a study</a> published in January 2020, which found that a repurposed diabetes drug, sitagliptin, could reduce the risk of miscarriage by boosting the number of stem cells in the womb lining. These cells are responsible for renewing the lining and reducing inflammation. \u201cIt\u2019s still only a small pilot trial, but it is fantastically exciting,\u201d Quenby told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in a long time that there\u2019s been a potential new drug treatment.\u201d</p> <p>Quenby is convinced it\u2019s not so much the treatment options that are lacking, but the will to try them. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of \u2018we can\u2019t do anything\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are tons of things we can try now.\u201d Still, as a miscarriage patient, you run up against the dilemma that recurrent miscarriage is not a diagnosis in itself, so the difficulty is in establishing which treatment is most appropriate to you. Even with the help of the most motivated of doctors, there is going to be a degree of trial and error.</p> <p>Many people will be told, as we were, that the best treatment is no treatment \u2013 simply try again. This is what we did, only to miscarry for a fourth time. We were under the supervision of the recurrent-miscarriage clinic, yet even after that fourth loss, the prescription remained the same: just keep trying.</p> <p>It took us a year before we felt ready to roll the dice again. Shortly after I started researching this piece, in November, I found out I was pregnant for the fifth time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6f77c21ea9fcb1f564070526a2eab1c98a81b93d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f77c21ea9fcb1f564070526a2eab1c98a81b93d/0_0_5884_3510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of pregnant woman and male partner with scene around them falling apart\" width=\"1000\" height=\"597\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>To be pregnant again after previous miscarriages is to live at the fork of two alternative lives. You try to think as little as possible about what\u2019s going on inside your body, while, of course, thinking about it all the time. Alive or dead? Baby or miscarriage? In every possible scenario, you plan for the two outcomes. To a certain extent, you are forced to buy into both possibilities simultaneously. You cannot truly believe it will work out, but you have to proceed as though you are pregnant anyway, until a scan proves otherwise. Alive <em>and</em> dead. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s foetus.</p> <p>You treat yourself as your own walking research study: a sample of one. Perhaps you take a different brand of prenatal vitamin. Or you do different exercise. You do no exercise at all. You drink less caffeine. You drink no caffeine at all. You are more careful. You are <em>less</em> careful, because you\u2019ve been unimpeachably careful before and look where it got you. Mostly, though, you just wait.</p> <p>Why hasn\u2019t miscarriage medicine moved faster or farther? Why isn\u2019t there more certainty about what works and what doesn\u2019t? The first <a href=\"http://www.sites.hps.cam.ac.uk/visibleembryos/s2.html\" title=\"\">detailed depictions</a> of a human embryo\u2019s development, from three weeks to four months, were produced by the German anatomist Samuel Thomas Soemmerring in 1799, and the images are remarkably similar to graphics used in week-by-week pregnancy apps today. Yet a precise <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987368/\" title=\"\">schema of measurements</a> to date the stages of early pregnancy \u2013 between seven and 16 weeks \u2013 wasn\u2019t established in modern clinical practice until 1973, with the advent of ultrasound imaging. We had put a man on the moon before we could routinely see, in real time, what was happening inside a woman\u2019s womb.</p> <p>Pregnancy research, in general, is underfunded. A recent <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/uk-pregnancy-research-needs.html\" title=\"\">research review</a>, published in January 2020, found that for every \u00a31 spent on pregnancy care in the NHS, less than 1p is spent on pregnancy research. \u201cCompared to other areas \u2013 such as infertility \u2013 miscarriage has certainly lagged behind,\u201d said Arri Coomarasamy, who sees patients in both fields.</p> <p>\u201cMiscarriage gets a bad deal,\u201d agreed Hassan Shehata, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, who runs the Centre for Reproductive Immunology and Pregnancy, in Epsom, Surrey. \u201cFor a start, there is no specialist training,\u201d he said. When you train as a gynaecologist, you can specialise in sub-fields such as infertility and IVF, but there is no specific speciality in miscarriage, he explained.</p> <p>There are also practical difficulties to conducting studies. \u201cPregnancy is difficult to research as, by its nature, studying it might disrupt it,\u201d Nick Macklon told me. This means you\u2019re often left with retrospective population data (easily skewed by multiple factors), or studying donated embryo or foetal tissue (tightly restricted for ethical reasons \u2013 and prohibited altogether by \u201cpersonhood\u201d laws in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/state-mandated-mourning-for-aborted-fetuses/482688/\" title=\"\">some parts of the US</a>, which insist on burial or cremation of all pregnancy tissue).</p> <p>Even when human trials of treatments are feasible, there is the challenge of persuading women who are desperate to avoid another miscarriage to sign up to a study in which they might be given the placebo. As Ippokratis Sarris, a consultant in reproductive medicine and director of King\u2019s Fertility, a private fertility clinic in London, put it: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to do a proper trial \u2013 people want to take something they think might work. How do you tell them they can\u2019t have it until there is good evidence?\u201d</p> <p>Now that I was pregnant again, there was one treatment I was desperate to try. Progesterone has long been the great hope of miscarriage research. This \u201cpro-gestation\u201d hormone is produced in higher quantities during pregnancy by a woman\u2019s ovaries (and, later on, by the placenta). It is essential throughout pregnancy and helps prepare the womb lining, although scientists don\u2019t yet understand the precise mechanisms by which it does this. In May 2019, a large, multi-centre trial of progesterone, given in early pregnancy \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.tommys.org/our-organisation/about-us/charity-news/prism-trial-bleeding-early-pregnancy-and-miscarriage\" title=\"\">Prism trial</a> \u2013 found that for women with a history of recurrent miscarriage who had started bleeding during their next pregnancy, taking progesterone made a significant difference to the live birth rate, compared with a placebo.</p> <p>I was prepared to argue the toss for progesterone with my doctors this time around. I knew the new evidence didn\u2019t perfectly fit our circumstances. I wasn\u2019t bleeding in this pregnancy, for one thing. To my surprise, the female doctor we saw at the clinic for our first appointment, in the first month of this pregnancy, agreed to prescribe it without so much as a raised eyebrow. It was not the first time I have asked about some speculative treatment, but it was the first time the clinic had agreed.</p> <p>As Dan and I joined the queue at the hospital pharmacy, tucked away in a grimy building in Paddington, I felt I was holding on to something bigger than the printed prescription in my hand. For the first time, we had something, after being told that there was nothing.</p> <p>Then less than a week later, at eight weeks pregnant, I started to bleed.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There are therapies for miscarriage that have been available privately for well over a decade, yet are no closer to becoming mainstream medicine or available on the NHS. Where questions remain over the evidence, private clinics can go ahead and offer treatment anyway \u2013 something the NHS cannot do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fcc91ee5bf45687b88855b33b87d5444e2b16943\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcc91ee5bf45687b88855b33b87d5444e2b16943/0_0_669_1982/338.png\" alt=\"bubbles spot illustration\" width=\"338\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One therapy available at a handful of private clinics \u2013 lymphocyte immunisation therapy (LIT), in which a woman is given a transfusion of white blood cells from their male partner before she becomes pregnant \u2013 has been banned in the US, outside of a research setting. Such treatments belong to a field known as reproductive immunology, and stem from work in the 80s and 90s by an American obstetrician, Alan Beer, who once summed up his theory in the following way: \u201cEffectively, women become serial killers of their own babies.\u201d</p> <p>The idea is that miscarriage can be caused by a hyper-vigilant immune system that misrecognises the symptoms of pregnancy as a threat. In these cases, treatment may involve suppressing the immune system using steroids or intralipids (essentially an emulsion of soybean oil and egg yolk, given intravenously, sometimes referred to as the \u201cmayonnaise\u201d or \u201cegg-yolk\u201d drip). Clinics charge up to \u00a350,000 for such treatments. However, all but one of the experts I spoke to expressed scepticism about their effectiveness.</p> <p>Funding high-quality trials is particularly difficult when it comes to treatments that target the immune system, because, according to Quenby, in the past there has been a tendency to over-hype the results.</p> <p>Quenby believes our understanding of miscarriage would improve if we considered it as a public health issue, as we do stillbirth and neonatal deaths. Both of these are more common where there are high levels of social deprivation, and it\u2019s likely the same is true of miscarriage rates, too. Though, currently, hospital trusts are not required to report the rate in their area.</p> <p>But like periods, female pain, the menopause and conditions such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/endometriosis\" title=\"\">endometriosis</a>, which also want for good research and understanding, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that miscarriage suffers from a lack of knowledge and interest because it happens to female bodies. What\u2019s more, the underlying assumption tends to be that miscarriage is always down to something a woman\u2019s body is or isn\u2019t doing.</p> <p>In 2019, researchers at Imperial College London <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/189690/recurrent-miscarriage-linked-faulty-sperm/\" title=\"\">found that</a> partners of women who have had three or more miscarriages tend to have higher levels of damage to their sperm\u2019s DNA. The trial was small, comparing the sperm of 50 men whose partners had had miscarriages with 60 men whose partners had not. The results will need to be replicated. And before any possible treatments can be trialled, researchers need to establish what causes such DNA damage.</p> <p>Still, Quenby said, \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re even looking at it is really important.\u201d Traditionally, men and their contribution to the pregnancy have been largely left out of the picture. In the past three years, while I have been scanned and probed and pricked for multiple phials of blood, aside from completing a form outlining his basic medical history when we were referred to the recurrent-miscarriage clinic, Dan has not been required to so much as cough and say \u201cah\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When I discovered I was bleeding, I did a desperate search online for answers. I decided I was either having my fifth miscarriage \u2013 or, just possibly, the intermittent, brownish spotting was a side effect of the progesterone. I knew I should phone the recurrent miscarriage clinic, or my GP, or try to get an appointment for a scan at my nearest early pregnancy unit. But I couldn\u2019t bear to. I was not ready to talk practicalities just yet, and there was no one at the clinic to call for the sake of talking. Besides, we were due to go back for a scan the following week.</p> <p>In the following days, the bleeding didn\u2019t stop, but it didn\u2019t get worse, either. Even so, I couldn\u2019t shake the thought that, at eight weeks pregnant, this was the exact same point I had miscarried the last three times. Dan and I made our contingencies. It was early December, and we were due to move house in a few days, and we discussed how we would fit surgery around the move, if it turned out to be bad news. I bought sanitary pads and wine. We pretended we were sanguine. We pretended we knew how we would cope. \u201cWe\u2019re pros now,\u201d we joked. I barely slept the night before the appointment.</p> <p>On 4 December, my mum came with us to the hospital and managed to keep up a steady patter about her cycling, her knitting and the roadworks on the A14 while we waited. I knew she wanted to distract me. But the only words my brain had space for were the ones I was convinced I was about to hear for a fifth time: I\u2019m so sorry there is no heartbeat. I\u2019m so sorry there is no heartbeat.</p> <p>When we were finally called in for the scan, I explained to the sonographer that I was anxious. That I\u2019d been bleeding. I tried not to look at the print on the wall of the room \u2013 the same room we were in last time \u2013 of a red heart, printed in swirly faux-brushstrokes. I tried not to think what I thought last time: how fucking inappropriate that is. A heart, for when there is no heartbeat.</p> <p>I lay down on the bed and unbuttoned my jeans. Dan held my hand. I was braced for the words: <em>So sorry. So sorry.</em> Except they didn\u2019t come. The sonographer was telling us that everything looked fine. She turned the screen towards us, and she was pointing out the flickering heartbeat. She was telling us that I was measuring in at nine weeks and one day. The baby was<em> </em>moving. And I was crying.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Did I dare to believe that the progesterone was actually working? The possibility loomed in my mind that our miscarriages really had been \u201cjust\u201d bad luck all along. At least one of our losses was down to a chromosomal abnormality known as a triploidy: essentially an extra set of chromosomes. One cause of this is an egg being fertilised by two sperm at once \u2013 as random and unavoidable as that.</p> <p>About two weeks after it started, the bleeding waned and our clinic suggested it was time we transferred to our local hospital for antenatal care and the 12-week dating scan. (This is normally the first scan people have on the NHS, at the end of the first trimester, and it\u2019s used to check the foetus\u2019s health and estimate the due date.) On the one hand, this felt like an achievement \u2013 we had never made it this far before \u2013 but on the other, it meant leaving the relative security of the specialist clinic, where everyone understands why you don\u2019t want to think further ahead than the next appointment.</p> <p>Feeling like fledglings pushed from the nest, we had to brave the official NHS booking-in appointment, which involved giving our medical histories to the local midwifery team and some routine screening tests. We have done this twice before, during previous pregnancies, when we knew and worried less. Two days after the second one, I bled out the tiny embryo on our bed at home. I hadn\u2019t dared make this particular appointment since.</p> <p>We got our all-important appointment for the dating scan, a little over two weeks away \u2013 delayed slightly by the Christmas break. Time passed twitchily. We congratulated ourselves for not miscarrying on Christmas Eve, on Christmas Day, on Boxing Day.</p> <p>On 30 December, six hours before the scan, I read a note from the hospital that said you have to pay \u00a35 for a copy of the scan photo. Fleetingly, I debated getting some cash out, but decided this would be jinxing things. At the hospital, I squeaked my name to the receptionist. We were early. This may have been our 12-week scan, but it had taken us 48 weeks of pregnancy to get here. I really wasn\u2019t sure if I could wait another 20 minutes.</p> <p>I had my spiel prepared for the sonographer \u2013 \u201ca bit anxious\u201d \u2026 \u201cfour miscarriages\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d she said, as I lay down. There was the briefest of pauses. \u201cOK, here\u2019s your baby.\u201d</p> <p>Whereas in previous pregnancies there had only been cavernous blackness on the ultrasound monitor, now there was wobbling movement; the grey outline of a head and a tiny, round tummy \u2013 a waving, wondrous sea creature emerging from the dark.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re a wriggler,\u201d the sonographer told us, smiling. I gripped Dan\u2019s hand and we watched as the baby \u2013 I will try to call it a baby from now on \u2013 somersaulted for us. For the first time, we left an antenatal unit with a scan photo and stepped out into entirely new territory.</p> <p>On 14 March, we hit 24 weeks, which is deemed the point of \u201cviability\u201d \u2013 that is, when a foetus is theoretically capable of surviving outside the womb. Whatever was going to happen to us from now on, it would not be classified as a miscarriage. Keeping this baby alive would no longer be down to my body alone. Should anything happen, doctors would have to at least try to intervene. These were not comforting thoughts exactly, but they were something.</p> <p>Ten days later, the whole of the UK went into coronavirus lockdown. The weekend we had quietly celebrated reaching viability also turned out to be the last weekend I would see anyone but my husband or a healthcare professional for a long time.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The initial days of confinement were softened by activity and preparation: batch-cooking, arranging deliveries, cancelling plans. I comforted myself by reading the official Covid-19 guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists over and over: \u201cThere is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of miscarriage \u2026 Pregnant women are still no more likely to contract coronavirus than the general population.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly, though, as I watched the number of reported cases and deaths rise, marooned on the sofa at home, fear seeped under the door. Not a day has gone by, since finding out I was pregnant again, that I have not worried that my baby might die. But now, during a global pandemic, those nebulous anxieties hardened into something nameable. The shadow on the nursery wall had taken a solid shape.</p> <p>I woke up one night in the first week of lockdown feeling hot, my throat tight. This is it, I thought \u2013 I\u2019ve caught it<em>.</em> I had barely been outside for a fortnight, though I did get my hair cut a few days before lockdown was declared. And so the taunt went round and around in my head, as I stared at the ceiling unable to sleep: your baby could die, and all for the sake of your split ends. In the rational light of day (and feeling fine), I concluded it had probably been heartburn.</p> <p>The world shrank. I baked bread and planted herbs. I silenced notifications and deleted social media accounts from my phone. I tracked my daily steps and counted my baby\u2019s kicks using an app. Mixed in with the fear and stress of uncertainty, there was also a guilty kind of sadness for the things I would not get to do \u2013 things I had dreamed of for so long: a \u201clast\u201d holiday as a couple, showing off my bump in my first maternity dress, meeting new \u201cmum friends\u201d for coffee.</p> <p>People phoned to ask how we were coping, but it felt selfish to admit to such small sadnesses, when there were bigger worries: for my brother, who had to postpone his wedding; for my cousin, who is a nurse; for our four grandmothers, who all live alone. Then there were the worries of people I don\u2019t know, but who could so easily have been us: those who have had their fertility treatment cancelled, or who will be told they have miscarried during scan appointments they have had to attend alone, in order to protect other patients and NHS staff. At the time of writing, hospitals were being advised not to offer extra scans in early pregnancy, even for people with a history of miscarriages.</p> <p>On 17 April, week four of lockdown, I attended an appointment for a 28-week routine growth scan by myself, while Dan, following the new rules, waited in the car. A security guard at the door checked my name off a list. The sonographer and midwife I saw wore masks and visors, while the doctor conducted my appointment from the opposite end of the consulting room. I projected my voice, like a bad stage actor: \u201cNo, no family history of diabetes\u201d, and so on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/24/88-days-trapped-in-bed-to-save-a-pregnancy-bed-rest\">\u2018Reality shrivels. This is your life now\u2019: 88 days trapped in bed to save a pregnancy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On some days, it has felt as though the pandemic has brought my experience of pregnancy closer to the curve of normality. For so long, I had felt as if I was only playing at pregnancy, like a small girl with a cushion up her jumper. I couldn\u2019t trust that I would get to do things other pregnant women take for granted. But then, suddenly, no one else was going to antenatal classes, throwing baby showers or browsing department stores for the perfect pram either.</p> <p>The temptation, when you get to where we are now, still pregnant after so many losses \u2013 and in the shadow of loss on a global scale \u2013 is to start talking about miracles. But I don\u2019t believe in miracle babies any more. I believe we should be able to put our faith in the evidence, in knowledge of how our bodies work \u2013 or don\u2019t work. That waiting and hoping isn\u2019t enough. Even so, as I sit here, in my fifth pregnancy, in the third trimester, wearing my very first pair of maternity jeans, feeling our baby kick inside me, it is hard not to consider it a wonder that any of us gets to be here at all.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <p><strong>Confirmed global death toll exceeds 250,000</strong></p> <p>According to research by both the Reuters news agency and <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, at least a quarter of a million people are now known to have died as a result of the pandemic. The total number of cases stands at 3,582,469. Experts worry the available data is underplaying the true impact of the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins researchers put the known death toll at 251,510.</p> <p><strong>Five Eyes network, WHO and Anthony Fauci contradict Covid-19 lab leak theory</strong></p> <p>There is no current evidence to suggest that coronavirus leaked from a Chinese research laboratory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/five-eyes-network-contradicts-theory-covid-19-leaked-from-lab\">intelligence sources told the Guardian</a>, contradicting recent White House claims that there is growing proof that this is how the pandemic began. The World Health Organization said on Monday that Washington <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/who-says-it-has-no-evidence-to-support-speculative-covid-19-lab-theory-pushed-by-us\">had provided no evidence to support what it called the \u201cspeculative\u201d claims</a>. Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading US expert on infections diseases, and a key member of Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, said in an interview with National Geographic that there was no scientific basis for the theory. Chinese state media, meanwhile, denounced Mike Pompeo as \u201cinsane\u201d, after he claimed on Sunday that there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d it came from a Chinese lab.</p> <p><strong>Hong Kong economy suffers deepest contraction</strong></p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s economy, already damaged by months of protest before the coronavirus outbreak, has recorded its worst decline on record. The region\u2019s GDP shrank 8.9% year-on-year in the first quarter, the deepest contraction since records began in 1974, and the fourth consecutive quarter to drop. Chief executive Carrie Lam noted it was worse than that experienced during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.</p> <p><strong>New Zealand records no new cases for second day in a row</strong></p> <p>New Zealand has had a second straight day of no new cases of Covid-19 cases recorded on Tuesday, as the government considers whether to further relax the country\u2019s lockdown restrictions. Monday was the first time since before New Zealand\u2019s national shutdown began on 25 March that there were no new cases of the virus diagnosed. The PM, Jacinda Ardern, joined Australia\u2019s national cabinet today. The two countries<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/05/jacinda-ardern-outlines-requirements-for-trans-tasman-travel-bubble-with-australia-video\"> have mooted a travel \u201cbubble\u201d between them.</a></p> <p><strong>Germany looks to ease restrictions <br><br></strong>Germany\u2019s state premiers will agree on further measures to ease restrictions during a telephone call with the chancellor Angela Merkel<strong> </strong>on Wednesday, Reuters reports, citing two people familiar with the preparations. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 685 to 163,860, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Tuesday. The reported death toll rose by 139 to 6,831, the tally showed. Germany\u2019s cases might be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/german-covid-19-cases-may-be-10-times-higher-than-official-figures\">more than ten times higher those confirmed</a>, researchers say.</p> <p><strong>One million Australians out of work</strong></p> <p>Over the period mid-March to mid-April, one million Australians lost their jobs, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Nearly a third of Australians (31%) reported that their household finances had worsened due to Covid-19. More than one in four Australians aged 18 years and over (28%) reported receiving the first one-off $750 economic support payment from the government. Compared with the <em>2017-18 National Health Survey </em>almost twice as many adults reported experiencing feelings associated with anxiety, such as nervousness or restlessness, at least some of the time.</p>",
