Confirmed infections are nearing 3.4 million, with 6,378,239 so dar.</li> <li><strong>Brazil deaths passed 30,000. </strong>A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic. The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths.</li> <li><strong>Australia\u2019s economy is in recession. </strong>Australian treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has confirmed Australia is now in a recession as the economy reels from the coronavirus pandemic. His confirmation came after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/jun/03/coronavirus-australia-latest-updates-unions-employers-industrial-relations-jobs-covid-19-nsw-queensland-victoria-travel-borders-restrictions-live-news?page=with:block-5ed6fdaa8f087122eca54777#block-5ed6fdaa8f087122eca54777\">economy shrank by 0.3% in the March quarter</a>, on the back of the bushfires, drought and coronavirus pandemic. Asked whether the country was now in recession, he said: \u201cWell, the answer to that is \u2018yes\u2019. And that is on the basis of the advice that I have from the Treasury department about where the June quarter is expected to be.\u201d</li> <li><strong>New Zealand saw its 12th consecutive day with no new cases. </strong>New Zealand has reported a 12th straight day of no new cases of Covid-19, as the government considers abandoning as early as next week all remaining restrictions on the country except stringent border controls. Just one person in New Zealand is still recovering from the illness, health officials said on Wednesday. They are not in hospital. There have been fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases of the virus in the country, with 22 deaths.</li> <li><strong>French anti-racism protesters defied a coronavirus gathering ban. </strong>Clashes broke out between police and protesters in Paris on Tuesday after around 20,000 people defied a ban to rally over the 2016 death of a black man in police custody, galvanised by US demonstrations against racism and deadly police violence. <br></li> <li><strong>China\u2019s service sector is bouncing back. </strong>China\u2019s huge service sector has bounced back to growth for the first time since January in a sign that the world\u2019s second largest economy is recovering strongly from strict coronavirus-induced containment measures. Although employment and overseas demand remains weak in the economy, the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 55.0 in May from 44.4 in April, hitting the highest level since late 2010. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. </li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/yemen-faces-macabre-tragedy-as-aid-funding-falls-short-by-1bn\">Yemen aid funding falls short by US$1bn</a>. </strong>Yemen remains on the brink of \u201ca macabre tragedy\u201d, the UN has warned after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/saudi-arabia-to-co-host-un-fundraising-summit-for-yemen\">a humanitarian fundraising summit</a> raised only $1.35bn for this year, around $1bn short of the target and only half the sum raised at the equivalent pledging conference last year. Dr Abdullah al-Rabiah, the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia, which co-hosted the virtual summit, put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen\u2019s five-year civil war.</li> <li><strong>Hopes were raised of the possible availability of a vaccine.</strong> A senior US army researcher said it was reasonable to expect that some sort of vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year.</li> <li><strong>France\u2019s death toll rose by more than a 100 in a 24-hour period for the first time in 13 days.</strong> It came as the country enacts a new easing of lockdown measures.</li> <li><strong>Iran confirmed its second highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period </strong>since its outbreak began, with the health ministry saying 3,117 people tested positive. The number of new daily infections in Iran has now returned to levels previously seen at the peak of its outbreak in late March.</li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s travel warning for Europe will be lifted on Wednesday, </strong>its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced. The worldwide travel warning still applies. But, for the countries of the EU and associated states, the warning will be replaced by travel advice that will give travellers detailed information about the situation in each state.</li> <li><strong> </strong><strong>The UK\u2019s official death toll passed 50,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics</strong>. The total differs from the government\u2019s daily counts, which only include deaths in hospitals and care homes where the person had tested positive.</li> <li><strong>The UK statistics watchdog criticised the government\u2019s testing data. </strong>Whitehall\u2019s use of testing data <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97#block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97\">appears to be aimed more at making it look like a lot is being done</a> than actually painting a clear picture, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock.</li> <li><strong>A Wuhan doctor who worked with the whistleblower Li Wenliang died of the virus last week</strong>, Chinese state media reported.

According to researchers from Johns Hopkins University, 6,340,811 people are known to have been infected, while 378,359 are known to have died since the outbreak began.<br></li> <li><strong>Brazil deaths pass 30,000. </strong>A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic. The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths.</li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/yemen-faces-macabre-tragedy-as-aid-funding-falls-short-by-1bn\">Yemen aid funding falls short by US$1bn</a>. </strong>Yemen remains on the brink of \u201ca macabre tragedy\u201d, the UN has warned after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/saudi-arabia-to-co-host-un-fundraising-summit-for-yemen\">a humanitarian fundraising summit</a> raised only $1.35bn for this year, around $1bn short of the target and only half the sum raised at the equivalent pledging conference last year. Dr Abdullah al-Rabiah, the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia, which co-hosted the virtual summit, put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen\u2019s five-year civil war. </li> <li><strong>Hopes were raised of the possible availability of a vaccine.</strong> A senior US army researcher said it was reasonable to expect that some sort of vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year.</li> <li><strong>France\u2019s death toll rose by more than a 100 in a 24-hour period for the first time in 13 days.</strong> It came as the country enacts a new easing of lockdown measures.</li> <li><strong>Iran confirmed its second highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period since its outbreak began</strong>, with the health ministry saying 3,117 people tested positive. The number of new daily infections in Iran has now returned to levels previously seen at the peak of its outbreak in late March.</li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s travel warning for Europe will be lifted on Wednesday, its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced</strong>. The worldwide travel warning still applies. But, for the countries of the EU and associated states, the warning will be replaced by travel advice that will give travellers detailed information about the situation in each state.</li> <li><strong>The pandemic is exposing \u201cendemic inequalities\u201d that must be addressed, according to the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet</strong>, who highlighted the protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd and data showing the crisis has had a worse impact on ethnic minority groups.</li> <li><strong>The UK\u2019s official death toll passed 50,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics</strong>. The total differs from the government\u2019s daily counts, which only include deaths in hospitals and care homes where the person had tested positive.</li> <li><strong>The UK statistics watchdog criticised the government\u2019s testing data. </strong>Whitehall\u2019s use of testing data <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97#block-5ed61f598f087122eca53e97\">appears to be aimed more at making it look like a lot is being done</a> than actually painting a clear picture, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock.</li> <li><strong>A Wuhan doctor who worked with the whistleblower Li Wenliang died of the virus last week</strong>, Chinese state media reported.

The Gates foundation will unveil its contribution at the summit due to be attended by over 30 heads of state.</p> <p>The money is designed to immunise an additional 300 million children and prevent as many as 7m deaths, according to&nbsp;Dr Seth Berkley, Gavi\u2019s CEO .&nbsp;He said: \u201cOne of the targets is to focus on the 10% of children still not being immunised, two-thirds of whom are below the poverty line, often in conflict zones or urban slums.\u201d</p> <p>It is the second time the UK has chaired the five-year Gavi fundraiser, but it has required the prime minister to spend valuable time on the phone to fellow world leaders to stump up the cash.&nbsp;</p> <p>Global health became a victim to the US-China battle after Donald Trump pulled out of the World Health Organization, and was then accused of trying to gain exclusive access to a coronavirus vaccine being developed by the German&nbsp;CureVac company.</p> <p>The summit will try to progress plans for an as yet undiscovered coronavirus vaccine to be distributed equitably, and not just to the western powers that funded the research. Many leaders have called for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vaccine\u201d, but the mechanism to achieve this, and prevent so-called vaccine nationalism, needs developing, Berkley said.</p> <p>One of Gavi\u2019s founding principles is to organise predictable large-scale demand for vaccines to ensure private pharmaceutical companies manufacture the drugs at the volume and the price poorer countries can afford.&nbsp;</p> <p>The summit will see the launch of a so-called advanced market commitments (AMC), a procurement fund by which a signal can be sent to industry to scale up for a coronavirus vaccine.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Berkley said: \u201cThis all started out in Wuhan and within three months 180 countries were infected. Nobody is safe until everyone is safe. So if we have reservoirs of this virus it will affect the safety of the whole world, so we need to think about this globally. At a time of historic economic hardship and geopolitical strain the world is coming together here to show a collective willingness to build health security.</p> <p>\u201cThe estimate is this pandemic is going to cost the world $9tn , and we are asking about billions of dollars, so it is a lot, but in the wider context it is a rounding error.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe world needs to cooperate on coronavirus vaccine since if every high income country backed a single vaccine on its own, they are taking a risky&nbsp;bet. The a priori chance of any vaccine succeeding is about 5%.\u201d </p> <p>Bill Gates told the BBC that pharmaceutical companies were co-operating with Gavi to ensure the production of a selected vaccine was expanded in record time by agreeing their factories will manufacture one even if the selected vaccine chosen for production was not their own. The higher the volume of vaccine production, the less conflict was likely about its allocation, he argued.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have only one factory and it is only making 300m doses a year then the scramble for that would be very difficult and you have many criteria for distribution, including who has funded the work and where the epidemic is the worst,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIf you can get 10 of those factories and get 3bn doses a year then it is nowhere near so difficult and you might be limited instead by the logistics of getting it out.</p> <p>\u201cThese companies are doing this to help the world not because they think they can profiteer on a vaccine. They know that this is a public good to get out there. This is the pharma industry at its absolute best.\u201d</p> <p>The precise size of a fund to procure the vaccine for poorer countries may be as high as $10bn, but will depend on the vaccine including if is a single shot vaccine.</p> <p>Gates also said he was troubled by some of \u201cthis crazy stuff\u201d alleging his involvement was part of a conspiracy for world domination by inserting microchips in people. He said as much as 80% of the population would need to take a vaccine, and if people have heard it is a plot the epidemic would continue.</p> <p>\u201cI am kind of surprised that some of this is focused on me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just giving money away. We are writing cheques to the pharmaceutical companies. We happen to we have a lot of the smart pharma expertise in our foundation and we are considered as a fair broker between governments and the companies to help pick the best approach.\u201d<br><br>An AMC was first launched in 2007, and used against pneumococcal diseases. In return for a guaranteed price of pneumococcal vaccines once developed, the companies entered into binding commitments on production and distribution.</p> <p>In the last year alone, a total of 161 million doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has been procured through the AMC. Gavi projections indicated that the use of PCV will prevent over 700,000 future deaths from pneumococcal diseases among children in Gavi-supported countries over the next decade.</p> <p>So far, Gavi has helped to immunize over 760 million children and has prevented more than 13 million deaths, helping to halve child mortality in 73 developing countries. It also plays a key role in improving global health security by supporting health systems as well as funding global stockpiles of vaccines to fight Ebola, cholera, meningitis, and yellow fever.</p> <p>Research published last week by the Gavi showed that coronavirus had diverted health workers so that the routine vaccine programme was being blown off course. The disruptive effect of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the normal vaccine programme led to twice as many dying from measles as Ebola.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 June 2020 to correct the figure the UK has pledged to \u00a31.65bn, not $1.65bn, and the number of children who will benefit to 300 million from 3 million. A reference to a vaccine for HIV/Aids was also removed.</p>",

  "<p>Unrest has swept across the United States since George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed in custody of Minneapolis police. Since then, protests have swelled in dozens of towns and cities across the country.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Tens of thousands of people have been standing shoulder to shoulder as they protest against the killing of George Floyd, after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes despite his cries that he could not breathe.</p> \n<p>But the public health emergency that engulfed the nation \u2013 Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes Covid-19 - has not disappeared. Here are this week\u2019s main developments on Covid-19, as American wrestles with civil unrest.</p> \n<h2><strong>Where are cases of coronavirus increasing?</strong></h2> \n<p>More cases are being detected in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage#states\">number of southern states</a>, including Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. But cases are not increasing <em>only</em> in southern states. Alaska, Montana and California have also seen cases increase. In total, 17 states are seeing increases.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These increases reflect infections that may have taken place weeks ago. The novel coronavirus has a long incubation period, and people may not get tested until they feel ill.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>Where are cases of coronavirus decreasing?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>Broadly speaking, the states which had the worst outbreaks this spring and the most severe stay-at-home orders are bending the curve downward. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Washington DC and seven other states are all seeing reductions in cases.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Mass protests began in Minnesota last week over the killing of Floyd on 25 May, but it may take weeks for increases in case to show up in testing data, because of the virus\u2019s long incubation period. It is also unclear <a href=\"https://health.ebsco.com/blog/article/covid-19-ten-things-you-need-to-know\">whether temperature</a> could play a role in limiting the spread of this disease now that summer is approaching.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bc6cc0e7-dfa4-4552-bba5-4c7247ed87f0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GbsJFgRupWo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>When will we get a vaccine?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>First, there is still no guarantee we will get a vaccine.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s never a guarantee, ever, that you\u2019re going to get an effective vaccine,\u201d said Dr Anthony Fauci, the United State\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Fauci made the comments Tuesday, in a podcast of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-3ICY-N4\">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Even if there is a vaccine, Fauci said, questions remain about how long it would provide immunity. That said, scientists are bullish on the prospects of finding an effective vaccine.</p> \n<p>More results are expected in the late fall from a promising candidate being developed by the American biotech company Moderna, and manufacturing capacity is already being ramped up.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Producers will begin making doses of the vaccine before clinical trials are ready. That way, up to 100m doses could be ready within weeks of vaccine approval, not months.&nbsp;More data is expected on Moderna\u2019s vaccine in the late fall.</p> \n<p>If a vaccine is proven safe and effective during that time frame, it would shatter the world record for fastest vaccine development. Currently, the fastest vaccine to ever be developed was for mumps, a disease which causes swelling of the glands and in rare cases more severe complications for adults.&nbsp;That took four years.</p> \n<h2><strong>Have scientists found new treatments?</strong></h2> \n<p>There is still no drug proven to shorten the duration or severity of symptoms of Covid-19, although studies are underway for a variety of potential treatments.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the United States, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/remdesivir-the-antiviral-drug-is-being-touted-as-a-possible-coronavirus-treatment-but-will-it-work\">antiviral medication called remdesivir</a> has shown promise early results, and the NIAID is continuing to study the drug for effectiveness. Gilead, which owns the drug\u2019s patent, has released thousands of doses to US hospitals for doctors to treat patients under emergency provisions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After being promoted by Donald Trump, one of the most talked about drugs to treat Covid-19 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/28/questions-raised-over-hydroxychloroquine-study-which-caused-who-to-halt-trials-for-covid-19\">hydroxychloroquine</a>. Early lab studies indicated the drug <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-scientific-studies-research\">might be effective</a> against coronavirus, but drugs can act very differently in the complex environment of the human body. There is still no proof hydroxychloroquine is effective in treatment of Covid-19, and several studies have had negative results.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Discussion of the drug is likely to continue. A large study of more than 96,000 people, which resulted in the World Health Organization stopping its hydroxychloroquine trials, has come under scrutiny from scientists around the world. Scientists are demanding the source of the data from the study, which a Guardian investigation revealed came from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine\">tiny, little-known American company</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>When will life go back to \u2018</strong><strong>normal</strong><strong>\u2019?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>\u201cNormal\u201d depends on many, many things.

  "<p>The Falkland Islands may lie at roughly the equivalent latitude as London \u2013 about 52 degrees from the equator \u2013 but the climate of this South Atlantic archipelago is more like Shetland than south-east England.</p> <p>That\u2019s because the Falklands are in the southern hemisphere, and so do not enjoy the warming influence of the Gulf Stream, which hugely ameliorates the climate of our northernmost archipelago.</p> <p>Temperatures in the islands\u2019 capital, Stanley, average around 9C in January, and just 2C in July. This very low variation is largely down to the influence of the surrounding ocean, which cools the land during the austral summer but warms it in winter. Snow can fall in almost every month, and rainfall is regular but fairly light, with a total of about 600mm (24 inches) a year.</p> <p>But the most noticeable aspect of the Falklands climate is the almost constant wind. The islands are just south of the area known as the Roaring Forties: an area dominated by a series of air currents flowing south from the equator towards the south pole, which are exacerbated by a lack of any large landmasses which might slow down the wind speed.</p> <p>The wind is also the reason why \u2013 apart from introduced conifers planted around the farms and other settlements as windbreaks \u2013 there are virtually no trees on the island.</p>",

  "<p>Priti Patel faces mounting calls to publish the scientific advice behind the 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals to the UK, after the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser declined to fully endorse such a blanket policy.</p> \n<p>Speaking at the regular No 10 press conference, Sir Patrick Vallance said the advice from the Sage advisory committee was that quarantines worked best when infection rates inside a country had dropped, but also when applied to countries with high rates of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The quarantine plan, unveiled by the home secretary in the Commons to a sometimes hostile reception from Conservative MPs, does not distinguish between countries of varying infection rates, with the only exceptions being for certain professions, such as freight drivers.</p> \n<p>Asked about the issue at the press conference, Vallance stressed the decision was ultimately one for ministers. \u201cThe Sage advice from the experts in this area is that the measures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low, and they\u2019re most effective when they\u2019re applied to countries from higher rates,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He added: \u201cAnd the judgment of that time is, of course, not something for us, it\u2019s something for politicians to make.

If such a barrier was required, why was it not introduced earlier in the outbreak?\u201d</p> \n<p>Patel told MPs that Sage would publish advice in due course, while advice from within the&nbsp;Home Office&nbsp;would be provided to the home affairs select committee.</p> \n<p>May expressed her concerns earlier, during an urgent question on the aviation industry, sought by Huw Merriman, the Conservative MP who chairs the transport select committee.</p> \n<p>\u201cInternational air travel is necessary for trade,\u201d the former prime minister said. \u201cWithout it there is no global Britain. So instead of bringing in measures to close Britain off from the rest of the world, why is the government not taking a lead in developing an international aviation health screening standard, to save jobs and ensure that Britain is open for business?\u201d</p> \n<p>Discontent among Conservatives has also been fuelled by being unable to answer questions from constituents about whether they might be able to go abroad this summer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>International air travel is necessary for trade.

Denmark said on Friday it would not consider opening its border to travel to or from the UK until 31 August at the earliest.</p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said:&nbsp;\u201cGiven&nbsp;the vast majority of people have already complied with pandemic measures, we expect those entering the UK will do the right thing and abide these measures \u2013 that means filling out their contact locator form before they reach the border.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cIf a passenger refuses to complete the form - for example if they have not provided an address - they could be fined or forced to return home.</p> \n<p>\u201cBorder Force will undertake checks at the border, Public Health England will contact people at random to ensure they are self-isolating and anyone failing to comply may face enforcement action, including a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice or a unlimited fine.\u201d</p>",

Obviously in normal circumstances the Guardian is never wrong, but on the basis of what happened at PMQs today it is not clear that anything much has changed. At PMQs Starmer has consistently presented himself as the most reasonable person at the dispatch box (more on that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a#block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a\">here</a>, including why it worked for another opposition leader) and today he won the \u201ctalking sense\u201d competition quite comfortably.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t as if the questions were, on their own, especially memorable. But Starmer does tend to specialise in loaded questions to which there is no safe or easy answer (\u201cwhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d questions, as I think they are known at the bar), and Johnson has yet to develop any plausible response mechanism. At their last PMQs he tried responding with promises (the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test and trace system). We had a flash of that from Johnson at PMQs later, when he pledged to ensure all test results are turned around with 24 hours by the end of the month (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/03/uk-coronavirus-live-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-lockdown-easing-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates-news?page=with:block-5ed786cd8f084df971c8edc7#block-5ed786cd8f084df971c8edc7\"> 12.19pm </a>\u2013 there may well be some clarification of quite what this involves at the lobby briefing later) but mostly, in his exchanges with Starmer, Johnson resorted to criticising the opposition leader for \u2013 well, opposing the government. He accused Starmer of launching \u201cendless attacks on public trust and confidence\u201d and of \u201ccasting aspersions\u201d on the good character of people working on test and trace (some of whom are spending much of their time watching Netflix because they don\u2019t have enough to do, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52904433\">if BBC News is to be believed)</a>.</p> <p>This is a lame form of parliamentary defence at the best times.

And it suggests that 21% of people say they are following lockdown rules less strictly than before - with a third of those saying that\u2019s at least partly because of Dominic Cummings.</p> <p>Here is the chart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668/0_0_1868_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling on lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling on lockdown</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouGov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As <strong>Chris Curtis</strong> explains in <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/articles-reports/2020/06/03/one-five-have-started-breaking-lockdown-rules-more\">a commentary for the YouGov website</a>, Cummings\u2019 excursion to Barnard Castle is not the only factor that might explain why people are taking the lockdown rules less seriously. Curtis says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those advising the government had always suggested that people would become less observant of the rules as time goes on, which was one of the reasons for delaying lockdown in the first place.</p> <p>We have also seen an increase in the proportion of the public who think the situation is getting better, from 58% to 76% in two weeks, which might also be making some less cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another factor might be ambiguity in the wording. The polling was carried out on Thursday last week and, when people were asked what they had done in the past week, 21% said they had followed the lockdown rules less strictly than previously. When the same question was asked at the end of April, only 5% gave that answer. But by Thursday last week the lockdown rules were less strict than they had been anyway and so some of those 21% may just be people transitioning from obeying the old rules to the new ones.</p> <p>Still, any evidence that people are taking socially distancing less seriously should be worrying. The documents released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies repeatedly stress that easing the lockdown is only safe if people continue to comply with restrictions like the two-metre rule. For example, this is what\u2019s Sage\u2019s scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling (SPI-M-O) said in <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888759/S0313_SAGE33_Consensus_for_SPI-M_on_transition_strategies.pdf\">a consensus view (pdf)</a> dated 4 May.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Behavioural changes in the levels of adherence rates are critically important, likely more so than the exact policies implemented, in determining whether the reproduction number remains below 1.

  "<p>The president of one of the UK\u2019s biggest motoring organisations has called on the government to introduce a \u201croad miles\u201d pricing system for drivers.</p> <p>Edmund King called for \u201cmore radical thinking\u201d from metropolitan and city leaders, saying the changes forced on the public by the crisis offered a huge opportunity to change the UK\u2019s transport systems and behaviours and encourage more people to walk and cycle.</p> <p>Speaking at a virtual conference organised by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, King said a car miles \u2013 or road miles \u2013 system could allow drivers to have the first 3,000 miles free, after which they would have to pay per journey. Those in rural areas would get an extra 1,000 miles free.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes you think about the trip and if you have a cleaner greener vehicle you can pay less \u2026 We need some radical thinking and perhaps now the time is right for the Treasury and others to address these bigger issues that politically they have been quite wary of addressing before.\u201d</p> <p>King highlighted evidence from the AA\u2019s own research that showed its members&nbsp;were ready to change their behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cTransport patterns won\u2019t be the same in life after lockdown, according to drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cHalf say they will walk more; four in 10 vow to drive less; a quarter will work from home more and one fifth will cycle more.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of a&nbsp;per-mile charging scheme based on the environmental impact of vehicle journeys has gained traction in recent years.

Longstanding incentive structures that have had perverse effects on our planetary environment and nature herself must be reinvented</p></li> <li><p>Systems and pathways must be redesigned to advance net zero transitions globally. Carbon pricing can provide a critical pathway to a sustainable market.</p></li> <li><p>Science, technology and innovation need re-invigorating. Humanity is on the verge of catalytic breakthroughs that will alter our view of what it possible and profitable in the framework of a sustainable future.</p></li> <li><p>Investment must be rebalanced.

  "<p>Some scientific papers stop the world in its tracks. In the middle of a raging pandemic, a study in the world\u2019s leading global health journal that seemed to prove President Trump wrong to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">laud the drug hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19</a> was always going to have a massive impact. It did. When the paper flagged a higher risk of death on the drug, trials were stopped all over the world, including one by the World Health Organization.</p> \n<p>Now it\u2019s in danger of unravelling.</p> \n<p>The data on more than 96,000 patients from 671 hospitals worldwide is under the microscope. Errors have already been confirmed. A Guardian investigation has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine\">revealed major issues with the small US company Surgisphere</a> that owned the database. Two major journals \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext\">the Lancet</a>, which published the hydroxychloroquine paper, and the New England Journal of Medicine, which ran an earlier paper from the same authors with data from Surgisphere acquitting blood pressure drugs of any adverse effect in Covid-19 \u2013 have issued an Expression of Concern. That\u2019s a formal statement that something is not right, but short of a retraction. Depending on what the audit says, a retraction may follow.</p> \n<p>This is difficult territory for the journals, who will doubtless be criticised if it turns out the published material was seriously flawed. </p> \n<p>But it\u2019s easy to see why they would consider this an important paper to publish. In the middle of a pandemic, with answers to potential treatments desperately needed, a US president is inciting people to take drugs that could potentially be dangerous and are suddenly in short supply, even for people who need them for another condition \u2013 lupus. Countries are scrabbling to buy up stocks in hope of saving lives.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, dozens of papers on hydroxychloroquine and its older version, chloroquine, are being published online in what is called pre-print form, which means without the peer review that major journals habitually carry out.</p> \n<p>Peer-review is seen as a safeguard against error and fraud. Journals send out draft studies to a number of experts in the particular field \u2013 perhaps three or four leading experts who will mull over the contents, methods and plausibility of the findings, make criticisms and give the thumbs-up or down to publication, which the editor does not have to accept.</p> \n<p>The study by Prof Mandeep Mehra of Harvard and the Brigham and Women\u2019s hospital in the US on hydroxychloroquine and the original anti-malarial chloroquine went through a form of peer-review that was more rapid than usual because of the pandemic. </p> \n<p>Nobody appears to have spotted the error that the Lancet has since corrected concerning the numbers of patients in Australia \u2013 who turned out to be in Asia. That may be because they were overworked and rushing, as scientists now are, but it may also be because they didn\u2019t see the database. </p> \n<p>But that is normal. The database belongs to Surgisphere. The company\u2019s role in the study was to provide the data from the hospitals on how patients fared on the drugs or without the drugs. That was why Sapan Desai, CEO of Surgisphere, was second author. The authors of a paper are responsible for the accuracy of the data they use. Where they have obtained it from a company, they would normally make some spot checks to be certain that what they have been given to analyse is reliable.</p> \n<p>Prof Mehra and the other co-authors who are not part of Surgisphere, dismayed by the criticism, have urgently set up an independent review of the data \u2013 how and where it was collected as well as its accuracy \u2013 from an external audit company in Bethesda. Their report is expected by the end of the week. Mehra said he never expected his observational study to be the last word on these drugs and stressed that they used the data they could lay their hands on because the matter was urgent. </p> \n<p>\u201cI have routinely underscored the importance and value of randomized, clinical trials and articulated that such trials will be necessary before any conclusions can be reached,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cUntil findings from such studies are available, given the urgency of the situation, using the available dataset was an intermediary step. I eagerly await word from the independent audits, the results of which will inform any further action.\u201d</p> \n<p>There are lessons here. One is that peer-review is a flawed process, as scientists will all tell you. It is a safety net, but it depends on many things, including the time reviewers have to spend on a study. And they see the draft paper, not the data it is based on. So it is hardly surprising that it was not the selected experts who spotted mistakes, but scientists from around the world who realised the numbers of patients in some of the hospitals could not be right.</p> \n<p>But most importantly, observational studies have serious weaknesses and should never deliver the final verdict on drug treatments. This was a very big observational study, which could show trends, but there is always a danger it was not comparing like with like. The patients given hydroxychloroquine in India may not have been treated in the same way as those given it in France. The gold standard is the randomised controlled trial, set up purposefully to answer the question. The Recovery trial, with more than 11,000 patients enrolled in every acute hospital in the UK, is the biggest such trial in the world. It is testing seven treatments including hydroxychloroquine. By July, we should have a genuine answer \u2013 not one that merely muddies the waters.</p>",

  "<p>During his four months in post, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has shown a commendable willingness to jettison old orthodoxies regarding state intervention in the economy. The job retention scheme, introduced as Britain locked down in late March, made the government the employer of last resort of an estimated 8.4 million workers at a cost of \u00a314bn a month. The intention is that this financial burden will gradually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/29/rishi-sunak-confirms-coronavirus-furlough-scheme-to-be-gradually-withdrawn\" title=\"\">be shared with employers</a> over the next months, with business picking up the tab. But Tory MPs who hope this will signal a gradual retreat of the state from the economic frontline will be sorely disappointed. For the foreseeable future, the pertinent issue in any job-preserving UK recovery will not be whether the government is involved, but how.</p> <p>As part of a proposed scheme known as Project Birch, Mr Sunak is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d1dd8ff-c978-44c0-8e60-f50de8e8e641\" title=\"\">reportedly</a> planning to bail out strategically important British companies, whose failure would have a disproportionately harmful impact on the economy. In pre-Covid-19 times, this kind of thinking might have been roundly condemned by free marketeers as a form of \u201cpicking winners\u201d. But as Rolls-Royce announces <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-52752836\" title=\"\">more than 1,500 job losses</a> in Derby, and Jaguar Land Rover, which employs 38,000 people in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/23/jaguar-land-rover-in-talks-over-1bn-plus-state-loan\" title=\"\">seeks</a> a \u00a31bn-plus emergency state loan, it is clear that if British manufacturing is to survive this crisis, a new economic settlement may be necessary. Make UK, an industry group which represents 20,000 British companies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/01/uk-manufacturing-leaders-call-for-emergency-bailout\" title=\"\">warned this week</a> that without direct government support, huge numbers of businesses will fall off a cliff edge once the furlough scheme is removed.</p> <p>In the midst of the sharpest downturn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/13/what-does-the-biggest-economic-slump-in-300-years-mean-for-britain\" title=\"\">for 300 years</a>, the case for Project Birch is overwhelming. As the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has pointed out, firms such as Jaguar Land Rover in Coventry are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/01/uk-manufacturing-leaders-call-for-emergency-bailout\" title=\"\">vital anchors</a> of local economies. But if Tata, its owner, is eventually to be helped out by the taxpayer, it is fair for the state to require something in return. The Treasury is apparently weighing up the merits of taking equity in stricken companies, just as the German government has <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/aviation/news/lufthansa-board-gives-green-light-to-e9bn-bailout/\" title=\"\">done</a> with Lufthansa, in which it now owns a 20% stake.</p> <p>For a Tory chancellor, this would be a bold move. But taking an equity stake \u2013 or at least preserving that as an option \u2013 would carry distinct advantages, compared with simply handing huge loans to the private sector. Instead of functioning as a giant ATM, the government would be able to better pursue its green objectives in industries such as aviation and car manufacturing. It could also follow the example of the Lufthansa deal by building in protections against hostile takeovers affecting vulnerable communities. Economic security, a new priority in an age of possible pandemics, would be enhanced.</p> <p>For far too long, the idea that governments should actively pursue strategic economic objectives became deeply unfashionable in Britain. The damaging social consequences of the withdrawal of the state played a part in the political upheavals of recent years. But traditional public/private arguments have an almost antique quality in the current context. Post-pandemic, the government will be a protagonist in any recovery. It should use that role, and the leverage it affords, to help shape the post-Covid-19 economy in the wider public interest.</p>",

  "<p>Nissan says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/03/nissan-sunderland-plant-at-risk-if-uk-leaves-eu-without-deal-brexit\">its car plant in Sunderland will be at risk</a> if it has to pay tariffs on vehicles exported from the UK to the EU. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has told banks they need to prepare <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/03/bank-of-england-no-deal-brexit-plans-britain-deadline\">for the possibility that there will be no deal</a>. It is something of an understatement to say that the talks between London and Brussels are not going well.</p> <p>Whether things are as bad as they look remains to be seen. Threadneedle Street has repeatedly told banks they should prepare for all outcomes, including no deal. It would be a bit rum \u2013 and a much bigger story \u2013 if Bailey\u2019s message was \u201cdon\u2019t worry, everything\u2019s going to be all right\u201d.</p> <p>Trade talks tend to have their own rhythm. The two sides start by taking up positions that are miles apart and in the initial stages of talks insist their demands are non-negotiable. Insults fly about, the talks break down acrimoniously, both sides take it in turns to walk away from the table. Eventually, as the deadline approaches, the mood becomes more constructive. Red lines are crossed; compromises are made; a deal is struck.</p> <p>Will that time-honoured pattern be followed this time? The bad news is that time is running out yet the UK and the EU sides are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/29/june-brexit-summit-on-cards-talks-heading-for-deadlock\">still dug in to entrenched positions</a>. Both accuse the other of seeking to cherry-pick. Trade deals tend to take years not months to negotiate, yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 </a>has meant governments across Europe have had other things on their mind. The mood music is not good.</p> <p>Conversely, the economic devastation caused by the pandemic ought to be motivation enough for a deal. Nissan does not want a 10% tariff slapped on its exports, but the same applies to Germany\u2019s automotive sector, which is deeply pessimistic about the future according to the latest survey from the Ifo thinktank.</p> <p>The crunch will come later this month when Boris Johnson meets Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission. One possible way out of the impasse, suggested by Kallum Pickering of Commerzbank, would be for the UK to remain in the single market for goods for an extended period so that an \u201cambitious\u201d free-trade agreement can be negotiated, while securing an orderly exit for other sector such as services and finance.&nbsp; Pickering says both sides could probably sell that as a win. Well, maybe. Both sides will need to make concessions first, though.</p> <h2>Darling\u2019s view may yet come back into vogue</h2> <p>The three former chancellors who gave evidence to the Treasury committee all had a view about whether the current crisis would be better or worse than the one that almost did for the banks in 2008. Worse, said Alistair Darling, who was actually in charge at the time. Better, said his successor George Osborne, taking hope from the bounce back from previous pandemics. Too early to say, said Philip Hammond, who was at the Treasury this time last year.</p> <p>There is no doubt which of the three wise men is currently most in sync with the mood of the world\u2019s equity markets. Share prices have hit their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2020/jun/03/global-stocks-and-oil-hit-3-month-highs-on-strong-china-services-and-recovery-hopes-business-live\">highest levels in three months </a>as investors increasingly take the view that the impact of Covid-19 will be severe but relatively short lived.</p> <p>No piece of bad news seems to shake this optimism. In the past few days, the cold war between Washington and Beijing has intensified, the number of American citizens filing jobless claims has surpassed 40 million, and there have widespread protests across the US over the horrific death of George Floyd, yet stock markets have continued to rise.</p> <p>Bad economic news has continued to roll in, but markets have taken comfort from the fact that mostly it has been less appalling than expected. Sentiment can change quickly, however, and while Darling\u2019s view is not fashionable it may come back into vogue. As he pointed out to MPs, he took a lot of stick for pointing out in 2008 that the crisis brewing then was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/30/alistairdarling.economy\">potentially the worst since the Great Depression</a>. But he was right.</p> <h2>Death knell for Davos?</h2> <p>Is this the beginning of the end for Davos? The World Economic Forum, the body that holds its annual talkfest in the Swiss Alps says next year\u2019s event will be part in-person and part virtual. Doubtless the billionaires will still be out in force to discuss the WEF\u2019s theme, despite the risk that they might catch something nasty. But here\u2019s a prediction: there will be fewer private jets parked at Zurich airport come January.</p>",
  "<p>The hotel chain Travelodge is preparing to launch insolvency proceedings in the form of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), in an attempt to cut its rent by about 40% over the next 18 months and save 10,000 jobs.</p> <p>The company has been locked in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/boots-and-matalan-join-list-of-firms-targeted-over-unpaid-rents-since-coronavirus-lockdown\">battle with its landlords</a> since the end of March when it refused to pay rent for the second quarter of the year.

They are offering four and a half months rent-free followed by a 20% reduction from July to December.</p> <p>\u201cWe are being asked to forfeit a huge amount of income.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/china-accuses-uk-of-gross-interference-over-hong-kong-citizenship-offer\">Boris Johnson\u2019s promise</a> to give millions of Hong Kong citizens a path to UK citizenship is a remarkable offer from a government that has spent four years wrestling with Brexit so as to end the free movement of people from Europe. </p> <p>For one door to be slammed shut only for another to be opened so wide is striking, especially since the policy\u2019s popularity among the Conservative membership or pro-Brexit voters has yet to be tested. Recent polling by the Cabinet Office unearthed widespread ignorance about China.</p> <p>The argument in government circles is that Brexit was never about halting migration, but about sovereignty and the right for the UK to control its own migration policy, including by selecting those with the skills most needed in the UK.</p> <p>It can be argued that the quartet at the top of the Tories are the archetypal beneficiaries of migration. The family of the home secretary, Priti Patel, fled Uganda. The father of the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, came to the UK from Czechoslovakia aged six in 1938, following the Munich agreement, which gave parts of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany. The grandparents of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, arrived in the 60s from east Africa. Even the prime minister, Boris Johnson, a product of Eton and Oxford, has both Turkish and American ancestors. They are not quite citizens of nowhere, the phrase used insultingly by Theresa May, the former prime minister, but all four have backgrounds that make them alive to the benefits of political asylum.</p> <p>There is also a streak of guilt that runs through the Conservative party about its treatment of Hong Kong citizens, and an admission that, under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, the great cold warrior, it placed the people of Hong Kong into the hands of the Chinese Communist party in 1994.</p> <p>After the handover, Hong Kong citizens ended up with a jerry-built halfway house. They could hold a British national overseas passport, providing them consular assistance and protection through UK diplomatic posts, but they would not have the automatic right to live or work in the UK. Those born after 1997 would have no rights.</p> <p>In his memoirs, the last governor of Hong Kong, Lord Patten, wrote: \u201cEven in the 1990s many Conservatives and much of the British media resisted any idea we should be moderately generous in the award of citizenship to some of those who lived in Hong Kong (often serving directly the colonial power) and deserved a guarantee if necessary they could look to Britain for a home after 1997. <em>Civis Romanus </em><em>sum</em> was not to be translated into a modern British obligation. Australia, Canada, both of course Commonwealth countries, were much more generous over the granting of citizenship to Hong Kong residents. They were a lot more maternal than the so-called \u2018mother country\u2019.</p> <p>Thatcher took some political flak at the time. In 1989, Paddy Ashdown, the Mandarin-speaking leader of the newly merged Social and Liberal Democrats, defined his new party in the wake of Tiananmen Square by campaigning for Hong Kong citizens to be given the right of abode. </p> <p>So how has Ashdown\u2019s liberal view become the political consensus? There were, after all, influential migrants at the top of the May and David Cameron governments. Cameron, a Sinophile, confined himself to urging China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on a state visit to the UK in 2015 to allowing Hongkongers to choose their own leader without Beijing\u2019s prior vetting.</p> <p>Cameron had seen what had happened to Angela Merkel when she opened the door to Syrian refugees in 2015, and was not going there with Hong Kong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42908e3bd72685f128da63269d1d0b1fbeb3d5c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42908e3bd72685f128da63269d1d0b1fbeb3d5c8/0_91_2984_1790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cameron and Xi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron drinking with Xi Jinping at a pub near Chequers during the 2015 state visit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, individual cabinet members have played their part in the change of mind, but bigger trends forced Johnson into a choice. With protests growing ever more violent in Hong Kong and elections producing pro-democracy legislatures, the possibility that China would wreak revenge and end the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement had to be countenanced. A cross-government contingency planning group was set up in September.</p> <p>The contingency group was formed amid a broader rethink in the Conservative party about China. By last summer an influential group of Tory MPs, including Iain Duncan Smith, Damian Green and Tom Tugendhat, came to the conclusion that the rise of China under Xi was a threat to the west and needed to be resisted. Global Britain, a foggy concept for many years, came to be defined as a commitment to openness, democracy and a rules-based order. Hong Kong serendipitously became the rallying point for this foreign policy. China\u2019s handling of coronavirus, and the controversy over Huawei, has further embedded this process.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/it-is-much-worse-veterans-of-hong-kongs-2003-protests-fear-new-china-law\">'It is much worse': veterans of Hong Kong's 2003 protests fear new law</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK has few levers apart from moral persuasion with which to deter Beijing from pressing ahead with the security laws.

New orders also recorded their biggest increase since September 2010 as demand from within China recovered. The services sector makes up about 60% of China\u2019s economy. <br></p> <p>This has boosted stock markets in Asia and is also expected to spill over into Europe. Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose to its highest level since February and closed 1.29% higher, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 1.32% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi added 2.87%, after the South Korean government proposed its biggest stimulus package yet.</p> <p>MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.3%, hitting a three-month high and taking the gain from its trough on 23 March to almost 36%.</p> <p>Over here, the FTSE 100 index in London is expected to open 60 points higher and Germany\u2019s Dax is being called 125 points higher.</p> <p>Global stocks have so far shrugged off the growing unrest in the US after the killing of George Floyd, along with simmering trade tensions between the US and China.

Earlier, it hit $40.53, the highest since early March, after gaining 3.3% on Tuesday. US light crude gained 2.7% to $37.82 a barrel.

So can my right honourable friend give me the reassurance that as from 1 January 2021, the UK will have access to the quantity and quality of data it currently has,\u201d she said, citing areas such as air passenger name records.</p> <p>Johnson replied: \u201cThat depends, I\u2019m afraid, on the outcome of our negotiations, as she knows well. But I\u2019m absolutely confident that our friends and partners will see sense in the great mutual benefit of continuing to collaborate in exactly the way we do.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty minutes later, May expressed her concern again, this time more openly, adding her criticism of the government\u2019s new 14-day quarantine system for overseas arrivals, which begins next week.</p> <p>The former prime minister said the aviation industry sustained millions of jobs.</p> <p>\u201cInternational air travel is necessary for trade,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout it there is no global Britain.

The latest round of Brexit talks are under way this week, but with few signs of an imminent breakthrough in areas such as mutal standards and fishing rights.</p> <p>The former prime minister is likely to be among a number of Tory MPs who would express concern if a no-deal end to the transition period may mean the UK losing access to data and information sharing in areas such as security.</p> <p>More immediately, a number of Conservatives are angered by the quarantine plan, saying it will provide little public health benefit, and will badly affect the travel and aviation industries.</p> <p>May criticised the plan during an urgent question on quarantine in the Commons from Huw Merriman, the Tory chair of the transport select committee, who is a persistent critic of the scheme.</p>",
  "<p>More than 250,000 people have signed a petition calling for a ban on cheaply produced low-quality food imports in post-Brexit trade deals.</p> <p>The National Farmers Union (NFU) is lobbying the government to ensure that imports from countries such as the US of food produced to lower standards than expected of UK farmers should not be allowed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/farmers-urge-government-protect-food-standards-trade-bill\">Attempts last month</a> to write a legal minimum standard into the agriculture bill failed, and the NFU has launched the petition to increase pressure on ministers. By Wednesday morning, <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/news/latest-news/food-standards-petition/\">254,764</a> people had put their names to it.</p> <p>The petition says: \u201cFarming throughout the UK has high standards of safety and welfare&nbsp;with an ambition to be net zero in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. There are very strict controls on farming methods allowed in the UK and I expect the same of all food which is imported here so the food I eat is as safe, traceable and produced to high welfare and environmental standards.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the UK begins to negotiate trade deals with countries around the world, I call on the UK government to put into law rules that prevent food being imported to the UK which is produced in ways that would be illegal here.\u201d</p> <p>Imports that are of particular concern to UK farmers and producers include US poultry products, such as chlorinated chicken and eggs, and hormone-injected beef.</p> <p>The TV chef Jamie Oliver issued a plea on social media for people to sign the petition, saying if there was no law to protect standards, the market would be flooded with very low quality, high salt and sugar products, and that trade deals allowing these imports would be \u201ctraumatic\u201d to the British farming industry.</p> <p>The agriculture bill is moving to the House of Lords. Neil Parish, the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee, who put forward one of the amendments to the bill in the Commons, said he hoped the Lords would amend the bill in order to protect against substandard imports in trade deals.</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said:&nbsp;\u201cWe have been clear that in all of our trade negotiations \u2013 including with the US in our first round of negotiations \u2013 that we will not undermine our high domestic environmental protection, animal welfare and food safety standards by ensuring in any agreement British farmers are always able to compete.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A groundbreaking survey of Facebook users suggests that around 1% of Britons are showing symptoms for Covid-19 at any given time, with the proportion in Scotland rising as high as 3.5% over the last week.</p> \n<p>The findings are part of Facebook\u2019s Covid-19 symptom survey, a global effort on the part of the company to use its enormous user base to track the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>Since its launch in April, around 120,000 people in the UK have taken part in the survey, registering the presence or absence of Covid-19 symptoms by following a prompt from the social network. Globally, there have been more than 10m responses, the company said.</p> \n<p>The survey is being run in collaboration with statisticians at the University of Maryland, who worked with Facebook\u2019s Data for Good team to build a publicly available map and dashboard&nbsp;<a href=\"https://covid-survey.dataforgood.fb.com/?date=2020-05-23&amp;dates=2020-05-02_2020-05-23&amp;region=GBR\">visualising the international results</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cBy fielding questions that are comparable globally the UK is benefiting from additional data that will be even more valuable going forward as we jointly examine the conditions for reopening in different countries under different scenarios,\u201d said Dr Frauke Kreuter, the director of the university\u2019s joint programme in survey methodology.</p> \n<p>The symptom survey differs from a number of others in its selection process. Many large-scale symptom surveys require users to opt-in to the survey, by proactively downloading an app or visiting a website. That risks biasing the results, if certain demographics are more likely to volunteer themselves, or if people proactively join the survey when they begin experiencing symptoms.</p> \n<p>\u201cSurvey methodologists and statisticians at UMD value particularly the fact that people cannot self-select into the respondent pool, Kreuter said. \u201cUnlike surveys done via specific apps or websites designed to collect symptom data, the recruitment through the Facebook platform allows us to reach everyone who is using Facebook, and then randomly select within those users.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>For the UK at large, the symptom tracker shows a slow but steady reduction in the number of people reporting Covid symptoms, from slightly over 1% at the beginning of May to slightly under 1% now.</p> \n<p>Within the nations of the UK, the data is noisier for smaller nations, with Scotland reporting zero symptoms some days, and as high as 4% other days \u2013&nbsp;a sign that the programme still has work to do to improve the quality of the data it collects.</p> \n<p>As well as the surveys, Facebook also analysed location data from its ubiquitous surveillance of its own users to show the extent to which Brits are changing their behaviour as the requirements to stay at home are lifted. At the beginning of April, 46% of English people were staying in place, Facebook\u2019s tracking revealed, while that figure has dropped by a quarter, to 36.9%, in the latest data. Similar declines were seen in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.</p> \n<p>In this, Facebook\u2019s data is similar to that gathered by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/\">Google</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility\">Apple</a> through their mapping programmes, released much earlier in the Covid crisis. All three companies have seen mobility rise significantly from the lockdown lows, with some countries, including the US and Germany, returning to normality, as measured by requests for directions.</p>",
  "<p>In the summer of 1997, I lived in Seattle.

Too often, by default, black people are perceived as threats to white people\u2019s physical safety.&nbsp;And as a consequence, it is our physical safety that is compromised, as the stories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">Christian Cooper</a>, the birdwatcher who filmed a white woman in Central Park lying to the cops about how he was threatening her (when all he did was ask her to leash her dog), and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, the man who died with a police officer\u2019s knee on his neck, illustrate.</p> <p>I have backpacked around the world and lived in Nepal and Kenya, and I\u2019ve seen how my presence can be challenged or questioned. Earlier that year, when I lived in Seattle, I went hiking on Mt Baker with two white friends.&nbsp;It was a typically cloudy and cool day, and we stopped at the park lodge to warm up.&nbsp;At some point, my friends wandered off while I stood there with my colorful shawl wrapped around me.</p> <p>I began to feel uneasy; I noticed an elderly, white woman staring at me.&nbsp;Suddenly, she jumped (as did I).&nbsp;She then said: \u201cMy dear, I thought you were a beautiful, Indian statue.\u201d&nbsp;I was shocked, as I didn\u2019t know whether to feel complimented (you\u2019re beautiful) or insulted (I wasn\u2019t even real).&nbsp;Not to mention her complete misidentification of my racial and ethnic origins.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My experiences backpacking through mountain trails and wildlife have forever changed the way I see and engage nature. I have channeled that passion into my work: I completed a PhD in geography, taught classes about the environment in our institutions of higher learning, written about the black experience of the outdoors, served on the national parks advisory board for eight years and work with environmental non-profits and government agencies on diversity and environmental issues.&nbsp;I am invested in finding ways to improve the quality of our relationship with the environment and our relationship to each other. But regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth.</p> <p>I wish I could feign surprise at what happened to Christian Cooper when he encountered Amy Cooper in Central Park.&nbsp;I wish I could imagine it to be a blip in the United States\u2019s history; an accident, an outlier, not at all reflective of the truth of how black people are all too often treated.&nbsp;But I can\u2019t.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Amy Cooper threatened to tell the police that \u201can <em>African American</em> man is threatening her life\u201d, she revealed what it\u2019s like to know, deep down in your bones that she would be protected, valued and saved by virtue of her skin color.&nbsp;By calling the police, she exemplified what James Baldwin meant when he said that whiteness is about power.</p> <p>Our outrage as black people is justified.&nbsp;Let me say that again.&nbsp;Our outrage as black people is justified. As the CNN commentator Don Lemon said recently: \u201cThe knee has always been on our neck.\u201d&nbsp;But your outrage, white America, is not enough. What many of us want is fundamental, consequential and absolute change.</p> <p>The response to Amy Cooper by a justifiably angry public \u2013 the demands for her to lose her job, her dog and perhaps some \u201cmembership\u201d in her community \u2013 is frustrating because it leaves me wanting.&nbsp;None of those measures would change the way Christian Cooper or any African American is perceived in any outdoor space, or any space for that matter.</p> <p>The revelations about Christian Cooper having gone to Harvard and how he sits on the board of the New York City Audubon Society (which I\u2019m thrilled to learn) should not matter as much as they seem to. This information helps us understand the passion and commitment he brings to birding. They do not confer his worth. At the end of day, it\u2019s about everyone being protected, valued and if need be, saved, regardless of their station in life.&nbsp;</p> <p>What happened between Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper was, in many ways, simply an echo of what\u2019s always been true in the US about our ability, as black people, to walk in the woods or on a city street.&nbsp;We are all Christian Cooper and George Floyd.&nbsp;</p> <p>What can be done? We should recognize that systemic racism exists on both the streets of our cities and inside our national parks. We have to see full representation at every level in the environmental sector, and we need power structures to shift so that black and brown people are shaping policies and our national conversations. We need predominantly white environmental organizations and academic institutions to be more concerned with how the climate crisis disproportionately impacts black and brown people and give more resources to these communities. We need to change the prison industrial complex and law enforcement, which both undoubtedly shape how black people move through space.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is not about political correctness.

  "<p>The last major football match played in England before all sport was suspended because of the coronavirus crisis was the European Champions League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/22/liverpool-atletico-madrid-coronavirus-champions-league\">showpiece between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid</a>. It was a thrilling contest that transfixed 54,000 people under the floodlights of Anfield.</p> <p>But now that match, along with many other mass events that the government allowed to go ahead as the pandemic spread in March, is coming under renewed scrutiny as evidence grows of the lethal danger to which people were exposed. They include rugby matches, horse races, musical concerts and dog shows attended, in total, by hundreds of thousands of Britons.</p> <p>One of those at Anfield was Simon Renoldi, 48, an Essex businessman and pub-restaurant owner. A lifelong Liverpool supporter, he travelled up on the train from Euston station in London with his young son.</p> <p>\u201cWe were in first class on the train, and we passed through a few carriages of Madrid fans, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s when I caught the virus, or at the game,\u201d he said. Anfield was packed, as were the old Victorian pubs around it, and the stadium\u2019s bars, megastore, snack bars, and the corporate areas where Renoldi had his seats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2398a33f809ba4489d27a65e5a69635a41682887\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2398a33f809ba4489d27a65e5a69635a41682887/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool fans let off flares outside the stadium before the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liverpool fans let off flares outside the stadium before the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time, the government\u2019s official policy was to \u201ccontain\u201d the coronavirus, although an initial testing and tracing effort had been overwhelmed and was abandoned the following day. Around 3,000 Atletico supporters were allowed to come from Madrid, a Covid-19 hotspot already, where crowds at football matches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/22/liverpool-atletico-madrid-coronavirus-champions-league\">had just been banned and schools closed</a>.<br><br>Nobody who has had Covid-19, or the families of almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-nears-50000-latest-official-figures-show\">50,000 British people</a> who have since died from the virus, can be certain when they caught it. But Renoldi is one of almost 200 people who have contacted the Guardian in recent weeks to say they believe they became infected during the course of a major event in those first two weeks of March.</p> <p>As the death toll in Britain has risen to become the highest in Europe, the initial policy of Boris Johnson\u2019s government \u2013 to dismiss other countries\u2019 rapid responses and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/revealed-the-inside-story-of-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-crisis\">allow the virus to spread</a> \u2013 has been subjected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/bereaved-families-seek-justice-for-uk-victims-of-coronavirus\">unforgiving scrutiny</a>. Permitting the \u201cmass gatherings\u201d to continue has become an emblem of the government\u2019s inaction, captured most vividly in pictures of teeming crowds at the Cheltenham horse racing festival from 10-13 March.</p> <p>The full impact the events had will never be known, but a broader picture is beginning to emerge. Having examined his evidence, Prof Tim Spector, of the <a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/\">Covid-19 Symptom Study</a>, told the BBC last week that \u201csporting events should have been shut down at least a week earlier, because they\u2019ll have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52797002\">caused increased suffering and death that wouldn\u2019t otherwise have occurred</a>\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018I will never forget that day\u2019</h2> <p>Renoldi recalled a landmark football occasion at Anfield that day. \u201cBecause the game was on and the government advice was that it was safe to be held, you couldn\u2019t have kept me away,\u201d he said. \u201cA few days after the match I had it: dry cough, hot sweats, short breath, gritty lungs.\u201d<br><br>When he felt the symptoms, he self-isolated, but then Simon\u2019s father, Gino, 75, who had diabetes and other health issues but was still working at the pub and living above it, fell ill. On 3 April, he collapsed.<br><br>\u201cThey managed to get his heart going again, and took him to Basildon hospital, but within three hours we were told his lungs were in a very bad way and he wasn\u2019t going to survive. They let three of us in, and we had the last 20 minutes with him, then they turned off the machine. I will never, ever forget that day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab7cc6577f0bdd2e8e4ed45636a9635a2d4fb026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab7cc6577f0bdd2e8e4ed45636a9635a2d4fb026/0_928_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon with his father, Gino.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon with his father, Gino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only eight people were allowed at the funeral. \u201cMum had to grieve on her own after that,\u201d Renoldi said. \u201cThe Covid-19 test came back negative but they\u2019re not always accurate are they? A respiratory consultant at the hospital told us that he was sure it was covid.\u201d<br><br>Reflecting on the match, he said: \u201cNow so many people have died from covid, it\u2019s obvious a lot of things should have been stopped sooner and the game should not have been held.\u201d<br><br>The justification still maintained by ministers for waving ahead that match, the Cheltenham festival, music concerts and other \u201cmass gatherings\u201d \u2013 before they were finally stopped on 16 March \u2013 is that they carried a \u201clow risk\u201d of people transmitting the virus.</p> <p>That was underpinned by advice from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) that critics now argue looks confusing and alarmingly superficial.<br><br>Sage scientists advise that although such events draw huge crowds, they involve little close human contact, partly because spectators are outdoors. On 11 February, the Sage sub-group SPI-M <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873748/12-spi-m-o-consensus-view-on-public-gatherings.pdf\">noted</a> that \u201cin most larger events, such as sports matches, attendees will come into close contact with at most a handful of people, so the risk to attendees is low.\u201d.</p> <p>But that claim seems to be based on assumptions, not on a researched examination of people\u2019s movements at such events: the nationwide and international travelling, the eating, drinking, shopping, and all-day cramming together involved in a modern sporting or cultural event.</p> <p>The Guardian asked the Government Office for Science, which represents Sage, if the advice was based on detailed scientific research. It did not respond.<br><br>The other element of the Sage advice is about scale: scientists in the group argue that while mass events look as if they would spread a virus, and some people undoubtedly do become infected, only a small proportion of the population attends, so stopping the events is not significant for a nationwide response to a pandemic. </p> <p>Minutes of Sage meetings published for the first time last week <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/882718/21-potential-impact-behavioural-social-interventions-04032020.pdf\">reveal that</a> as late as 3 March, the scientists advised: \u201cThere is currently no evidence that cancelling large events would be effective.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Johnson government\u2019s decision to allow mass gatherings to take place was not solely because they were considered \u201clow risk\u201d. At that time, the government was not stopping any activities, including those regarded as higher risk: allowing schools, workplaces, pubs, cinemas and restaurants to remain open.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

Jax Hill-Wilson, 63, said she was sure she became infected there while working in corporate hospitality, and she believes she subsequently infected other people close to her. Several people said they found themselves on packed trains to Cheltenham, or on the platform at Birmingham New Street when it was crammed with racegoers, and later came down with Covid-19.</p> <p>Geoff Beadnell, a retired businessman, marked his 71st birthday on 11 April on a Covid-19 high-dependency ward at Cheltenham general hospital, having been to the Gold Cup, the festival\u2019s finale, on 13 March.</p> <p>\u201cThe timing made me convinced I was infected when we went racing,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember queueing for the bar, it was packed, and a guy right in front of me was clearly unwell and sweating; I tried to back away from him but you couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>A week later he began to have \u201creally hot sweats\u201d, and developed a sore throat, then breathing problems. After calling 111 on three consecutive days, then his GP, he was taken to hospital by ambulance and within 10 minutes was wired up to machines in an isolation ward.</p> <p>\u201cIt was horrendous,\u201d Beadnell said. \u201cI didn\u2019t eat for five days; I had two blood transfusions, they put me on an oxygen machine \u2013 a Cpap \u2013 the mask is horrible, it gave me nasal and throat infections and I have scars on my eyes.\u201d</p> <p>He said of the festival being on: \u201cThe excuse was that it was outdoors and you didn\u2019t have to be close to people, but we were packed like sardines; you couldn\u2019t put a bet on, get a drink or go to the toilet and not be crammed together.

On 2 April she was admitted to intensive care.<br><br>\u201cThere were 15 or 20 people there on ventilators; I was the only one conscious,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cI was on my side so could only see one person; I think he died. They moved me to a side ward for covid patients and on 5 April I thought I wasn\u2019t going to survive. The next day, four people on the ward died. But I had a miraculous turnaround. On 7 April they let me come home. I was absolutely terrified because I felt 100 years old, frail, and needed a Zimmer frame. I haven\u2019t recovered yet.\u201d<br><br>When Clifford discussed the races going ahead, and recalls Vallance explaining herd immunity, she became emotional.<br><br>\u201cI\u2019m a rational person, a financial auditor, I\u2019m all about facts.

The events are outside, and \u201cyou don\u2019t actually come into contact with that many people. So the total number of contacts made in these situations compared with every day in a pub for instance, is really negligible.\u201d</p> <h2>Postcode data</h2> <p>However, there is evidence suggesting mass gatherings did have a significant impact on the spread of the disease.</p> <p>Cheltenham became a coronavirus hotspot in the south-west after the festival, and Liverpool cases rose significantly following the Atletico match. <a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/#category=ltlas&amp;map=rate&amp;area=e08000012\">The official government data on </a><a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/#category=ltlas&amp;map=rate&amp;area=e08000012\">Covid-19 cases</a>&nbsp;states that on 12 March, there were only nine cases in Liverpool; by 11 April, there were 937. </p> <p>Postcode data <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs\">leaked to the Local Democracy Reporting Service</a>&nbsp;showed that on 3 April, the area of GL52, next to Cheltenham racecourse, had the <a href=\"https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/cheltenham-news/leaked-map-shows-postcode-next-4071259\">highest number of hospitalised Covid-19 sufferers in Gloucestershire</a>.

Stopping Cheltenham on its own would not have preserved the UK from the pandemic, but delays in a coherent response made the initial surge more intense, and cost lives.\u201d<br><br>Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser from 2000-07, argues that major events are \u201cideal\u201d spreading episodes. Told by the Guardian that Sage scientists had advised that large gatherings have minimal impact on the spread of the virus, King said: \u201cI find it very difficult to believe scientists said that; I am absolutely astounded.\u201d<br><br>He pointed out that countries that responded well to Covid-19, and kept cases low, banned crowds at events early, including Greece, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. \u201cYou need to get in early, test, trace and isolate infectious people, take all action to stop the virus spreading. But here they allowed the virus to spread. There is nothing to be said for going down the herd immunity route; it involves so many deaths.\u201d<br><br>The DHSC denied again that it was ever part of its plan to allow the virus to spread and attain herd immunity. </p> <p>A DHSC spokesperson maintained the position stated by Hancock on 16 March: that \u201cthe risks of transmission at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low\u201d. Yet despite that stance, crowds are not being allowed at horseracing or Premier League matches as they restart; health concerns are now expressed about people gathering even outside stadiums without social distancing.<br><br>The DHSC did not acknowledge any mistakes or regret, and issued its standard statement. \u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the latest scientific advice,\u201d it said. \u201cThe government\u2019s clear strategy all along has been to protect our NHS and save lives.\u201d<br><br>Renoldi was at Hillsborough as a Liverpool supporter on 15 April 1989, and survived the terrible crush that killed 96 people.</p> <p>After that disaster, a whole architecture of safety legislation was constructed to protect people from ever again being killed at a sporting event. Those who have lost loved ones as a result of such events going ahead earlier this year are now asking if that public health principle has been overturned.</p> <p>\u201cNow it feels terrible, horrendous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that match should not have gone ahead. It\u2019s another disaster.

  "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen\">Yemeni</a> journalist has been shot dead in the southern city of Aden in an incident that is likely to inflame tensions between the government and secessionists seeking independence for the south.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nabil Hasan al-Quaety, a 34-year-old photographer and video journalist who worked for news organisations including Agence France-Presse, was shot in his car shortly after leaving his home on Tuesday morning.&nbsp;</p> <p>Security officials told AFP that the gunmen escaped. The head of Aden\u2019s security administration, Abdullah al-Jahafi, posted a message on Facebook on Tuesday evening that said several suspects had been detained, but there has been no official announcement of any arrests.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sabrina Bennoui, of Reporters Without Borders, said: \u201cNabil\u2019s murder is unacceptable and constitutes a terrible new blow to journalism in Yemen. The country\u2019s division and the polarisation of its media have reached a critical point in which journalists are now favourite targets, regardless of the region they cover.\u201d</p> <p>Quaety was a vocal supporter of independence for southern Yemen. The secessionist Southern Transitional Council (STC) has been in conflict with the UN-recognised Yemeni government, a former ally, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/01/yemen-adens-changing-alliances-erupt-into-four-year-conflicts-newest-front?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">since 2017</a>. Both the STC and the Yemeni government are fighting against Houthi rebels who seized control of the capital, Sana\u2019a, in 2014.&nbsp;</p> <p>The STC is backed by the United Arab Emirates, the Yemeni government is supported by Saudi Arabia, and the Houthis are allied with Iran. Yemen\u2019s five-year-old war has also drawn in western powers which sell arms and supply technical assistance to the Saudi-led coalition.&nbsp;</p> <p>The STC and the Yemeni government called for a \u201ctransparent\u201d investigation into Quaety\u2019s death.</p> <p>Several journalists in Yemen have been killed in airstrikes and bombings during the war, and hundreds more imprisoned, tortured or forced to flee the country. Quaety\u2019s killing appears to be the first targeted killing of a media worker since 2015, when the journalist Abdel Karim al-Khaiwani was shot dead in Sana\u2019a in an attack claimed by al-Qaida.&nbsp;</p> <p>Quaety\u2019s support for the STC was frequently criticised by members of Islah, a Muslim Brotherhood-linked bloc of the Yemeni government, who also accused him of being funded by the UAE.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Tuesday there were tributes to Quaety on social media, as well as allegations that Islah was behind the killing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fatima Abo Alasrar, a non-resident fellow at the US-based Middle East Institute, said: \u201cThis is such a shocking incident. It will have political implications and increase the sense of vulnerability and collective grievances [of southerners]. It might be too presumptuous to pin this on the Islah party because there are other political players in the south, including [President Abd Rabbu Mansour] Hadi supporters, who want to suppress the STC voice. This is why a fair investigation is badly needed.\u201d</p> <p>Quaety was a finalist in 2016 in Britain\u2019s Rory Peck awards for freelance journalists, for work the judges described as \u201crare and outstanding\u201d.</p> <p>Last year he survived a Houthi drone attack on a military base near Aden that killed six soldiers.&nbsp;</p> <p>He leaves behind a pregnant wife and three children.&nbsp;</p> <p>AFP\u2019s global news director, Phil Chetwynd, said: \u201cWe are shocked by the senseless killing of a courageous journalist doing his job despite threats and intimidation. Through his work with AFP over the past five years, Nabil had helped to show a global audience the full horror of the conflict in Yemen. The quality of his work had been widely recognised. The thoughts of everybody at AFP are with his wife and children today.\u201d</p> <p>Yemen ranks 167th out of 180 countries listed in Reporters Without Borders\u2019 world press freedom index. Four media workers are facing the death penalty in Sana\u2019a after being accused of spying.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p> Understandably, your feet may have not featured highly on your list of concerns for 2020. But now, with the weather often warm enough for sandals and UK lockdown measures being eased, it is time to take a good look at those toes.&nbsp;</p> <p>From cracked skin to fungal infections, many of us will be in need of more than just a lick of polish before unleashing our feet on the world \u2013 even if it is from a two-metre distance. With nail salons in England <a href=\"https://professionalbeauty.co.uk/site/newsdetails/beauty-salons-in-england-to-reopen-july-4-earliest\">not expected to reopen for </a><a href=\"https://professionalbeauty.co.uk/site/newsdetails/beauty-salons-in-england-to-reopen-july-4-earliest\">at least a month</a>, it may be time to take matters into your own hands. Here\u2019s how to give yourself a simple and affordable pedicure at home, according to the experts.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>How often should you have a pedicure?</strong></h2> <p>If the word alone sends you running for the hills, then don\u2019t panic: we are not talking full shellac. However, untrimmed nails can become painful if they dig into the toes, as can a build-up of hard or cracked skin.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait until your nails are really long and the hard skin is very thick before you take action,\u201d says Louise Reaney, the director of <a href=\"https://www.lrpodiatry.co.uk/\">LR Podiatry</a> in Sheffield. \u201cCut and file your nails gently every two to three weeks. And use a file on your hard skin a couple of times a week. Apply foot cream every day.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Is it possible to give yourself a good DIY pedicure?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>As long as you can comfortably reach your feet, then yes. It is worth investing in a pumice stone or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jan/26/the-best-products-for-fabulous-feet-beauty\">skin file</a> (\u201cLike a large emery board or a small metal grater,\u201d says Reaney) and a good pair of nail clippers (\u201cThe ones that look like small pliers\u201d) before you get started.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>My socks are off \u2013 now what?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b05e637f4a169d4a4ea0c195634775c8371957ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b05e637f4a169d4a4ea0c195634775c8371957ea/0_0_2121_1273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feet soaking in soapy water\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soak your feet in warm water with a mild soap.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: globalmoments/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Start by soaking your feet in warm water with a mild soap. \u201cUse a sponge to give them a good scrub,\u201d says Reaney, then dry well, paying particular attention to the areas between the toes. Use your pumice stone or skin file to gently rub any areas of rough or thickened skin. Then, cut your nails using the clippers, going either straight across or giving them a slightly rounded shape. \u201cDo not cut down the sides of your nails, as this can cause ingrown toenails,\u201d Reaney warns. Smooth the edges of the nails using a nail file. Finally, apply a foot cream. \u201cI recommend one with 10% urea in it (available from most chemists). If you have very dry skin or cracked heels, you could step it up to 25%,\u201d says Reaney.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What about the cuticles?</strong></h2> <p>Pushing back cuticles \u2013 AKA the eponychium, a thickened layer of skin at the base of the nail \u2013 is common practice as part of manicures and pedicures at most nail salons, but podiatrists do not approve.</p> <p>\u201cNever push back cuticles,\u201d says Andrew Gladstone, the director of <a href=\"https://citychiropody.co.uk/\">City Chiropody</a> in London. \u201cThe cuticle is there for a good reason and pushing it back can lead to paronychia, which is an infection of the skin around the nail. I see that all the time.\u201d&nbsp;The condition causes pain, redness and swelling around the affected area.</p> <h2><strong>Can I do it wrong?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1022652bbc57f53b0795a4bed079eb5f84fcffa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1022652bbc57f53b0795a4bed079eb5f84fcffa9/0_99_2119_1271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"young man using a foot raspcloseup of a young caucasian man in the bathroom using a foot rasp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Use a skin file to gently rub any areas of rough or thickened skin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: nito100/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A basic pedicure is fairly straightforward, but there are a few things to watch out for.&nbsp;\u201cRipping the toenails is a big problem,\u201d says Gladstone. \u201cPeople seem to cut the nail a bit and then just yank the last bit off, with a bit of skin as well, and then you can be in trouble.\u201d Gladstone and Reaney caution against using blades or other sharp implements on your feet, even if the skin is really tough.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t dig and scrape into the corner of nails,\u201d says Gladstone. \u201cIf you can see a bit of sock or skin down the side of your nail, but it\u2019s not bothering you, then don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What if I have an ingrown toenail?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Again, Gladstone advises a hands-off approach. \u201cI spend a lot of time telling my patients to leave their ingrowing toenails alone \u2013 maybe soak it in warm salt water to try to keep it clean,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky, the problem will subside, but digging around can make it worse.\u201d If it does not, consult a podiatrist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jan/26/the-best-products-for-fabulous-feet-beauty\">The best products for fabulous feet | Sali Hughes</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What about fungal infections?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/01/how-to-treat-a-fungal-nail-infection\">Fungal skin infections</a>, such as athlete\u2019s foot, are common and usually start between the toes. Symptoms can include itching, cracked or blistered skin. If left untreated, the infection can spread to your toenails, causing thickening and discolouration.</p> <p>Reaney advises washing your feet in tepid water and drying thoroughly using kitchen roll, \u201cso that it can be disposed of and you are not passing the possibility of infection to someone else in your household. Also, dab to dry them \u2013 don\u2019t rub, as that can damage the delicate infected skin.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"151f355b96d9a082e51d54d183dd16bea2c7d268\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/151f355b96d9a082e51d54d183dd16bea2c7d268/0_137_2121_1273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman applying cream to foot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apply cream on your feet every day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrey Popov/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then apply an antifungal cream and repeat the whole process twice a day. The infection thrives in the warm, dark, moist environment of shoes, so Reaney suggests swapping between pairs every day. This gives them time to dry out properly. You should wear fresh socks daily, which should be washed at a high temperature. \u201cNatural fibres such as cotton and especially bamboo are a big help,\u201d she adds. \u201cMaintaining a good foot hygiene routine will help keep the symptoms at bay.\u201d</p> <p>Although salons are closed, many podiatrists are still seeing patients, so it is worth getting in touch if you require urgent care. They can also advise on other foot conditions such as verrucas and corns, which can often be remedied with over-the-counter treatments.</p> <h2><strong>I\u2019ve done my pedicure.

That proportion may fall to under 20% this year, with analysts predicting a further halving within the coming decade.</p> <p>A rapid slump since then has not been reversed despite the efforts of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a>, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/19/trump-climate-crisis-coal-pollution-clean-power-plan\">dismantled</a> a key <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a>-era climate rule to reduce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-emissions\">emissions</a> from coal plants and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/09/in-shadow-of-pandemic-trump-seizes-opportunity-to-push-through-his-agenda\">eased</a> requirements that prevent coal operations discharging mercury into the atmosphere and waste into streams.</p> <p>Coal releases more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">planet-warming</a> carbon dioxide than any other energy source, with scientists warning <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/publications/2019/coal-phase-out-insights-from-the-ipcc-special-report-on-15c-and-global-trends-since-2015/\">its use must be rapidly phased out</a> to achieve net-zero emissions globally by 2050 and avoid the worst <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">ravages</a> of the climate crisis.</p> <p>Countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/britain-breaks-record-for-coal-free-power-generation\">including the UK</a> and Germany are in the process of winding down their coal sectors, although in the US the industry still enjoys strong political support from Trump.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big moment for the market to see renewables overtake coal,\u201d said Ben Nelson, lead coal analyst at Moody\u2019s. \u201cThe magnitude of intervention to aid coal has not been sufficient to fundamentally change its trajectory, which is sharply downwards.\u201d</p> <p>Nelson said he expects coal production to plummet by a quarter this year but stressed that declaring the demise of the industry is \u201ca very tough statement to make\u201d due to ongoing exports of coal and its use in steel-making. There are also rural communities with power purchase agreements with coal plants, meaning these contracts would have to end before coal use was halted.</p> <p>The coal sector has been beset by a barrage of problems, predominantly from cheap, abundant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/fracking\">gas</a> that has displaced it as a go-to energy source. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19\">Covid-19</a> outbreak has exacerbated this trend. With plunging electricity demand following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">shutting</a> of factories, offices and retailers, utilities have plenty of spare energy to choose from and coal is routinely the last to be picked because it is more expensive to run than gas, solar, wind or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/nuclearpower\">nuclear</a>.</p> <p>Many US coal plants are ageing and costly to operate, forcing hundreds of <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=40212\">closures</a> over the past decade. Just this year, power companies have <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coals-decline-continues-with-13-plant-closures-announced-in-2020/\">announced</a> plans to shutter 13 coal plants, including the large Edgewater facility outside Sheboygan, Wisconsin, the Coal Creek Station plant in North Dakota and the Four Corners generating station in New Mexico \u2013 one of America\u2019s largest emitters of carbon dioxide.</p> <p>The last coal facility left in New York state closed earlier this year.</p> <p>The additional pressure of the pandemic \u201cwill likely shutter the US coal industry for good\u201d, said Yuan-Sheng Yu, senior analyst at Lux Research. \u201cIt is becoming clear that Covid-19 will lead to a shake-up of the energy landscape and catalyze the energy transition, with investors eyeing new energy sector plays as we emerge from the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>Climate campaigners have cheered the decline of coal but in the US the fuel is largely being replaced by gas, which burns more cleanly than coal but still emits a sizable amount of carbon dioxide and methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, in its production.</p> <p>Renewables <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/flow/css_2019_energy.pdf\">accounted</a> for 11% of total US energy consumption last year \u2013 a share that will have to radically expand if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. Petroleum made up 37% of the total, followed by gas at 32%. Renewables marginally edged out coal, while nuclear stood at 8%.</p> <p>\u201cGetting past coal is a big first hurdle but the next round will be the gas industry,\u201d said Wamsted. \u201cThere are emissions from gas plants and they are significant. It\u2019s certainly not over.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The early months of Donald Trump\u2019s administration saw its approach to science routinely compared to George W Bush\u2019s \u2013 both governments were highly sympathetic to large corporations, distrustful of anything to do with the climate crisis and enthused at the idea of delegating oversight to the states.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s version may have been more abrasive and bungling but it at least seemed a familiar extension of the last Republican administration.</p> <p>More recently, however, scientists have been struck by Trump\u2019s embrace of fringe beliefs and extreme, unsupported theories. Suddenly, it is not the profit-driven lobbyists and lawyers that are the worry, it is the quacks, cranks and conspiracy theorists.</p> <p>\u201cThey have exceeded my imagination with their scientific denial,\u201d said Gretchen Goldman, a research director at Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cPrevious administrations at least gave the appearance of wanting scientific evidence and qualified people in positions of power. This administration clearly doesn\u2019t care, which changes the game.\u201d</p> <p>Trump himself has a long history of defying mainstream scientific findings on the existence of climate change and the efficacy of vaccines, but his actions during the coronavirus pandemic have startled even his most vocal critics.</p> <p>The president falsely claimed Covid-19 would evaporate in the April sunshine, expressed bewilderment that a vaccine wasn\u2019t imminent and pondered the merits of injecting disinfectant as a treatment. Trump has also repeatedly touted the benefits of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug he says he himself has taken as a precaution despite evidence it can cause heart problems in some patients. The World Health Organization recently <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/health-52799120\">halted</a> trials to see if the drug could treat Covid-19, citing safety fears.</p> <p>From its inception, the Trump administration has handed leadership of federal agencies to figures who have represented polluting industries. Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, heads the Environmental Protection Agency, while David Bernhardt, another former energy lobbyist, is in charge of America\u2019s public lands as secretary of the interior.</p> <p>The deregulatory zeal of these agencies, often in the face of scientific advice, has seen droves of scientists leave the government. In a January estimate, 20% of high-level scientific positions within the government are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/science-ranks-grow-thin-in-trump-administration/2020/01/23/5d22b522-3172-11ea-a053-dc6d944ba776_story.html\">vacant</a>, with long-term officials complaining of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/17/whistleblowers-scientists-climate-crisis-trump-administration\">being sidelined or silenced</a>.</p> <p>But the administration has also increasingly shown willingness to ally itself with groups far more fringe than the standard class of lobbyist that inhabits Washington DC.</p> <p>The administration defended Trump\u2019s use of hydroxychloroquine by pointing to supportive statements from the Association of Physicians and Surgeons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/24/hydroxychloroquine-trump-us-doctors-coronavirus\">an outlier group</a> that has questioned whether HIV causes Aids (it does), argued abortion causes breast cancer (it does not) and even alleged former president Barack Obama used hypnosis techniques to trick voters, especially Jewish people, into supporting him (there is no evidence of this).</p> <p>In April, Trump unveiled advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that Americans should wear face masks to curb the spread of Covid-19, but has since echoed fringe rightwing views that masks are pointless or somehow unmanly. The president said on Tuesday it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d that Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was seen wearing a mask, calling its use \u201cpolitically correct\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe elevation of fringe views is even more vivid with coronavirus, the impacts are more evident,\u201d said Goldman.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Trump administration has aligned itself with an anti-abortion lobbying group called the Center for Family and Human Rights, helping spread its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/16/cfam-rightwing-white-house-anti-abortion-un\">message to the UN</a>, while Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/27/paula-white-donald-trump-pastor-evangelicals\">own spiritual advis</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/27/paula-white-donald-trump-pastor-evangelicals\">er Paula White</a> has said she hopes abortion laws are overturned, declaring on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/satanic-pregnancies-trump-spiritual-adviser-paula-white-outlandish-acts\">video</a> that emerged in January: \u201cWe command any satanic pregnancies to miscarry right now!\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has obscured a determined push by the Trump administration to further roll back regulations designed to prevent pollution and protect public health, with some of these efforts jarring uncomfortably with the federal government\u2019s own analysis.</p> <p>For example, the administration is scaling back fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, a process that has provoked a <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/5.27.20%20Petition%20for%20Review.pdf\">lawsuit</a> from 23 aggrieved states and, according to <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/Cars_Final_Rollback_Factsheet.pdf\">a study of the EPA\u2019s own figures</a>, will cause an extra 18,500 deaths over the next three decades from air pollution, as well as $240bn more in extra fuel costs for Americans.</p> <p>\u201cThis administration is antithetical to science, there is an ideological mandate to roll back regulations. Facts and logic doesn\u2019t matter, even the law doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Chris Frey, a a professor of environmental engineering at NC State University.</p> <p>Frey was part of an EPA clean air advisory panel that was dismantled as part of a revamp that has seen agency panels filled with industry-aligned and fringe characters \u2013 including an official who <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/14/583972957/top-epa-science-adviser-has-history-of-questioning-pollution-research\">has argued air pollution is good for public health</a> \u2013 and the process of considering science rerouted to bypass a large body of research that links pollution to harm such as asthma and heart disease.</p> <p>\u201cIt will take years to undo the damage. This administration is honestly a threat to public health,\u201d Frey said. \u201cThe past three years have hurt the US scientific community in a lot of ways. If this continues for another three years, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s robust enough to take it.\u201d</p> <p>US politics\u2019 problematic relationship with science doesn\u2019t just hinge upon one administration, however. Until the election of a handful of people with scientific backgrounds in the 2018 midterms, Bill Foster was the only member of Congress with a scientific PhD. Foster has admitted the experience often felt lonely and frustrating.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve achieved a lot with science but I\u2019m embedded in a culture that doesn\u2019t value science,\u201d said Foster, an Illinois Democrat. \u201cThe heroes we are looking for are the people who have spent their careers in science.\u201d</p> <p>Foster added that Trump\u2019s reaction to mask wearing has cost lives.</p> <p>\u201cIf he had said masks are very useful and then apologized for the fact the stockpile of masks was so low, many tens of thousands of Americans would be alive today,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the tragedy that bothers me more than anything.\u201d</p>",

Wright has always maintained her innocence. \u201cI\u2019m no threat to society,\u201d said Wright. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to Governor Gavin Newsom speak. I know if he knew my condition, he would listen to me.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Maria Aredondo, 67, has stage II breast cancer, and is held in the same prison as Wright. As CIW has locked down in an attempt to contain Covid, it\u2019s been even harder for her to get basic medical attention, her family said. Aredondo was convicted of murder after her gun was used in a robbery attempt that turned fatal.&nbsp;According to her lawyers, she was moved to a dirty cell after returning from chemotherapy last month. No one checked on her, said her daughter, Maria Nu\u00f1ez. \u201cEvery time we hear from her she says her health is deteriorating,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4809613065af78a4350864288281984110192cb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4809613065af78a4350864288281984110192cb5/0_167_1242_745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Aredondo has stage two breast cancer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria Aredondo has stage two breast cancer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Aredondo, courtesy of family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Terri Hardy, a prison spokeswoman, said&nbsp;CIW had moved women \u201cto allow for more social distancing\u201d, and that cells are cleaned before transfers. Women placed in isolation or quarantine due to Covid have access to \u201cdaily medical rounds\u201d, she added.</p> <p>Some other severely immunocompromised women who remain incarcerated in jails with Covid outbreaks are serving time for more minor allegations. Carole Dunham, 29, was convicted of a drug charge and was jailed after she failed to complete all the hours of her community service. She has two children, for whom she became the only parent after her husband was murdered.</p> <p>Dunham has type-one diabetes and said she recently collapsed inside an LA county jail because her blood sugar was so low. As Covid spread among the women around her, she said their treatment by staff had worsened, and she struggles to get the basic nutrition she requires. Sometimes they give her rotten food, she said in a phone call.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cOur rights are being violated here,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cWhat happens if my kids will be left without a mother and a father? I think about it all the time.\u201d LA sheriff\u2019s office, which runs this jail, did not respond to inquiries.</p> <h2>Thousands of jailed survivors: \u2018We need healing\u2019&nbsp;</h2> <p>Newsom has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/how-the-coronavirus-crisis-gave-gavin-newsom-his-leadership-moment\">earned some national praise</a> for his handling of Covid-19, instituting early lockdowns and avoiding the level of crisis that has hit New York. But civil rights activists say his inaction on prisons could define his coronavirus legacy.&nbsp;</p> <p>He has granted 44 commutations since he became governor last year, including 21 last month, though his office said the move was not related to Covid, and many are still waiting to be released or have parole hearings. Advocates with a number of <a href=\"https://survivedandpunished.org/\">community groups</a> say there are at least 150 active applications on his desk from women who are survivors of domestic violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>Newsom\u2019s office did not respond to questions about Ma\u2019s letter and declined to comment on the women\u2019s individual cases. A spokeswoman said, \u201cEach and every clemency application is reviewed on its own merits, and receives the careful and individualized consideration by the governor.\u201d</p> <p>Shajia Ayobi, 54, has been incarcerated for the past eight years and is held at CIW. She has developed diabetes and recently suffered from kidney and bladder infections.</p> <p>Ayobi was born in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, and says she still has nightly flashbacks after witnessing rocket attacks and the murder of her neighbors during her childhood.</p> <p>Ayobi fled the Soviet-Afghan war, but the violence followed her. She raised four children in Sacramento, California, and endured constant physical and psychological abuse from her husband, who suffered from complex PTSD from his time in the army, she wrote in one letter from prison. Her young children, she said, became accustomed to hiding kitchen knives from their father, who also threatened her with a gun.</p> <p>By December 2011, \u201cI believed 100% with all my heart and my bones in my body that my husband was about to commit a murder-suicide and kill all the kids, my poor kids,\u201d she said by phone. A friend who was trying to help her escape the abuse ended up killing her husband. A jury later determined that although Ayobi did not pull the trigger, she was guilty of plotting the murder and sentenced to life.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere are millions of women like me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe separation from my kids, this is the harshest punishment I have received. Because my kids were very vulnerable and they were very young and they needed me.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Audio clip of Shajia Ayobi\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;audio controls&gt; &lt;source src=&quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/archive-5-zip/giv-3902AwSj6ffJQYES/SHAIJA.wav&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><em><strong>My incarceration is nothing for me, because I come from a war-torn country.

A century later, it\u2019s still failing</strong></p> \n  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carol-anderson\">Carol Anderson</a>, the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, writes for The Guardian: </em></p> \n  <p>In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Summer.html?id=2ogt4871j3sC\">Red Summer</a>.</p> \n  <p>The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings \u2013 a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/hatred-endorsed-president\">praised</a> the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42977761,%20pages%20691-692\">had been silent</a> while whites slaughtered African Americans in <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2017/06/28/first-hand-accounts-show-the-horror-of-east-louis-1917-race-riot\">East St Louis</a> in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale.</p> \n  <p>When African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state \u2013 communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt.<br></p> \n  <p>More than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor \u2013 not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD \u2013 our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice.

  "<p>The UK lockdown might be easing, but the path ahead for the economy will be long and difficult. Unemployment this quarter is likely to rise <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/class-of-2020/\">twice as fast</a> as it did following the global financial crisis. Almost half of businesses that have taken up one of the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/government-backed-loan-schemes-deliver-15bn-to-uk-businesses\">bounce-back loans</a> do not expect to be able to pay it back.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting in a crisis to want to do whatever it takes to get economic activity \u2013 measured by GDP \u2013 back to where it was before. But an overwhelming and singular focus on increasing GDP would be a mistake. GDP figures do not tell us who is benefitting from growth. GDP does not tell us whether environmental resources \u2013 and nature \u2013 are being dangerously depleted, and does not reflect the value of caring, much of which is performed by women.</p> <p>Boris Johnson has called for the UK to \u201cbuild back better\u201d, but to use government resources and capacity most effectively and \u2013 more fundamentally \u2013 to take the opportunity to build a better kind of economy and society, we need to know what it is we want to rebuild. This is precisely the moment to think beyond a blind pursuit of GDP, about what kind of economic activity to bring back and prioritise, and what we could do without. Any stimulus package must be tailored to create not just any economic activity, but that which will serve society best.&nbsp;As a result, any recovery or spending plan should be scrutinised not just on its size, but what it is spent on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The recovery must involve a reconsideration of what is valuable in society</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This must be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged\">green recovery</a>. That does not mean adding on a few green job programmes to a larger, fossil-fuelled stimulus: the whole recovery package must accelerate the UK\u2019s path to net-zero carbon and restore our natural environment, which is in crisis. Anything else risks emerging from one disaster only to accelerate headlong into another. As the government turns on the taps to boost the economy, there is a huge opportunity to fill the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/uk-green-recovery-covid-19-mps-climate-nature\">\u00a330bn per year funding gap</a> for green investment.</p> <p>The recovery must target well-paid, high-quality jobs, spread around the country. These must provide good work for those who have lost it as a result of Covid-19, as well as people previously locked out of the jobs market or at risk of being left behind on the journey to net zero. This is a more profound shift than it appears. Currently, stimulus packages aim to boost GDP, and jobs are a way to get there. But what matters is that ordinary people have access to secure incomes \u2013 both for themselves, and because this will ensure spending in the economy (people who need money are more likely to spend it) and a sustainable tax base. An alternative approach, for example, of loosening lending restrictions for mortgages, might boost GDP but would do so by increasing debt and raising house prices, benefitting the already wealthy while hurting people without wealth.&nbsp;</p> <p>The recovery must involve a reconsideration of what is valuable in society. The pandemic has put into stark relief the extraordinary contribution of health and care workers, many of whom are women and migrants, and the essential support of key workers across the economy. The recovery must recognise that contribution in higher pay and better working conditions. So, too, the pandemic has caused conversations up and down the country about unpaid care work and who performs it. But the easing of lockdown has prioritised marketised activity over human relationships, which don\u2019t require cash. You can visit your parents at home, but only if you want to purchase their house or clean it. The recovery should recognise and reflect what is important to people and valuable \u2013 not just economic activity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/10/britons-want-quality-of-life-indicators-priority-over-economy-coronavirus\">Britons want quality of life indicators to take priority over economy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These goals are not in conflict but instead are inextricably linked.

  "<p>I took my father into hospital on 20 March, because I was sure he had coronavirus. We walked in together. He had worked for 46 years as a community pharmacist and I am a dentist. Neither of us had any idea that his situation would deteriorate to the point that I would be turning off his ventilator four weeks later.</p> <p>My 74-year-old mother also got Covid-19, as did my pregnant wife.

When I took him in to hospital, the ward was half-empty. A few days later it was packed. Staff were off because they had symptoms and couldn\u2019t get tested. There were so many bank nurses who were stretched and not used to working in an environment of infection. I could see how things would escalate.</p> <p>My dad didn\u2019t want to die. He survived for weeks on the ventilator but his doctors and I knew that if he ever came off it, he wouldn\u2019t be able to lead the life he had done before. He would have hated that. I went into a side room with the consultant\u2019s permission in full personal protective equipment which I had bought; Dad was unconscious and heavily sedated. I held his hand and said, \u201cDad, I\u2019m really sorry that I couldn\u2019t keep the promise I made you four weeks ago saying you\u2019d be home by the end of the week.\u201d I said I should have been more wary, that it should be me in that bed.</p> <p>It was so painful and surreal.

I\u2019m presuming, from what we gather, that there has been the meteorological data is showing more severe weather than usual in the Middle East, and that the vessel could not be here probably ready to go until about the 10th or 11th of June, and that obviously is well into the moratorium period. So, look, we accept that the regulator has looked at the science. We\u2019re presuming that they\u2019ve made a rational decision, they haven\u2019t issued their reasons yet, but we do understand that, to a significant extent, it was made on the analysis of the meteorological data.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbd86be9940feb65e1a09a856dd1ddb815883ddb\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbd86be9940feb65e1a09a856dd1ddb815883ddb/0_0_5258_3505/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Live export ship Al Kuwait in Freemantle.

Once jobkeeper runs out, we don\u2019t know how many of those employees will stay employed and how many will join the Centrelink queues. <br></p> \n   <p>And it\u2019s a very difficult time. None of us could have foreshadowed horrific bushfire seasons, storms, deep drought and a pandemic. I don\u2019t think that any one of us could have foreseen that and that\u2019s why we need to take decisions which are not decisions we\u2019d usually take. <br></p> \n   <p>Not decisions we are happy to take, but that we have to take. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing what we have to do.

  "<p>\u201cWhen I was hired the United States had never won a game in international competition. Five years later, we were world champions. The way we established the United States is the same way I established my collegiate programme,\u201d says Anson Dorrance, head coach of the University of North Carolina women\u2019s football team.</p> <p>If you are reading this in the US, you will most likely have heard of Dorrance. Beyond the US, though, he is virtually anonymous. Yet he is one of the most successful American coaches of any sport, in any time. At 69 Dorrance is still going, 43 years after he took charge of the UNC men\u2019s team and 41 after he helped to launch the women\u2019s. He coached both for 13 years before switching solely to the women\u2019s side, with whom he has won 22 division one titles. For context, the nearest to that record are Notre Dame and Stanford universities with three titles apiece. From 1986 he managed the US women\u2019s national team for eight years, including to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/apr/20/remembering-usa-v-norway-in-the-first-women-world-cup-final-football-weekly-podcast\">first World Cup win in 1991</a>.</p> <p>Dorrance is the brainchild of the winning mentality that sets apart the US women\u2019s national team. He has fed players through his UNC programme into every US world-beating side since. April Heinrichs, Shannon Higgins, Kristine Lilly and Mia Hamm, each national college player of the year twice during their time at UNC, are four of 19 UNC players to have been given that honour. The former Arsenal midfielder Heather O\u2019Reilly, an assistant coach to Dorrance, and the former Chelsea full-back Crystal Dunn are two more recently similarly recognised while at UNC.</p> <p>Staggeringly, one-third of the players who have won the World Cup with the US have been coached by Dorrance. Five of the 2019 squad were in that category. Lucy Bronze attended Dorrance\u2019s summer camps in her early teens, prompting the coach to encourage England scouts to watch her, and she also spent a semester at Chapel Hill, winning a championship. The Netherlands\u2019 World Cup final manager Sarina Weigman? Another alumna of UNC.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/30/megan-rapinoe-interview-guardian-white-privilege-trump-awards\">Megan Rapinoe: \u2018Everybody has a responsibility to make the world a better place\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI had no coaching r\u00e9sum\u00e9. At a school like this? Where Michael Jordan played college basketball, a school known for its sports teams \u2026 So when I was offered the position to coach the men\u2019s team here it was extraordinary,\u201d Dorrance says from lockdown in his North Carolina home where he jokes that his wife M\u2019Liss, a former professional ballet dancer, is on hand to keep him \u201cexcessively polite\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I got to UNC as a second-semester freshman in college, the intramural director came up to me in my dorm room and said: \u2018Hello Anson, I hear you\u2019ve just moved into the dorm. Well, we take intramural sports here very seriously. I\u2019ve got a list of the winter and spring sports here on this clipboard. Do you mind looking and telling me which sport you\u2019d like to compete in and represent the dorm?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI looked at all the sports he had on his list and I handed the clipboard back to him and I said: \u2018If you wanna win, put me on every frigging team,\u2019\u201d he says with a chuckle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9d81ffd312a47949f4830c28ee4391785471181\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9d81ffd312a47949f4830c28ee4391785471181/0_271_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anson Dorrance leads his Tar Heels in 1994.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anson Dorrance leads his Tar Heels in 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Madison/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe thought I was joking, I wasn\u2019t. And sure enough, he put me on every team and we started an 11-year intramural sports dynasty for Teague Dorm at UNC because I believed in kicking everyone\u2019s ass at everything. I was a four-year intramural wrestling champion. I\u2019d never wrestled in my life.\u201d</p> <p>Dorrance\u2019s father was in the oil business and that led to Dorrance growing up across continents. Born in Mumbai, he lived in Kolkata, Nairobi, Addis Ababa, Singapore, Malaysia and Brussels before a first extended spell in the US. That, he explains, developed his hunger for sport. \u201cWhatever country I jumped into, I would jump into the sports culture and then play those sports.\u201d</p> <p>Finding a way to coach the competitiveness that drove him has been the key to his success. \u201cThat, in my opinion, is the key platform in the success of the US women\u2019s national team. If you\u2019re the Japanese you\u2019re better than we are technically, if you are the Germans you\u2019re better than we are tactically, if you are the French you have just as many athletes as we have, so what is it in the American nature that still permits us to be dynastic in a sport that is not even \u2018our\u2019 sport? Well, we\u2019re dynastic because of our mentality</p> <p>.\u201d</p> <p>Can you train mentality? \u201cAbsolutely.

Because he builds his team to press and fight. </p> <p>\u201cI wanted to design a system that I personally would hate to play against. And the kind of players I hate to play against are the ones that are in my face, challenging me on every 50-50 ball.\u201d</p> <p>But his ultimate tool is the \u201ccompetitive cauldron\u201d, a concept started by the legendary UNC basketball coach Dean Smith which involves recording every bit of information about a player\u2019s performance. Dorrance has a \u201c28-category competition\u201d and his players\u2019 rankings are posted on a public bulletin board. \u201cThey move up and down these competitive ladders based on performance,\u201d Dorrance explains.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest challenge, honestly, when you go from coaching men to coaching women is that we raise our girls and young women to not be competitive. Society conditions them not to be. But what the heck is going on where if you\u2019re a competitive woman you\u2019re excoriated and if you\u2019re a competitive male you\u2019re basically put on a pedestal?.</p> <p>\u201cI had to correct that dynamic, but also protect the competitive women players and basically point to them and say: \u2018You know what? That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to train. We\u2019re going to train like there\u2019s no frigging tomorrow.

  "<p>Most of us who have followed Brexit closely believed coronavirus would soften the government\u2019s stance in trade talks with Europe. The economic shock triggered by the pandemic, and the fact Whitehall is so overwhelmed managing it, made it more likely the government would extend the transition period, due to expire at the end of this year, or strike a deal. It turns out that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/29/june-brexit-summit-on-cards-talks-heading-for-deadlock\">the opposite</a> is true. Rather than encouraging a more flexible and pragmatic approach, Covid-19 has instead reinforced the case for no deal at the very top of government.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important driver is the belief among ministers that the UK economy will be permanently reshaped by the crisis, as companies create new supply chains and reshore production to provide greater resilience in the future, not least in case of another pandemic. The government wants a free hand to facilitate this change, one that it believes would be constrained by the EU\u2019s demand that the UK remain tied to its labour and environmental standards and state aid rules.</p> <p>On the other side of the same coin, there are growing fears in cabinet that maintaining close EU ties would lock the UK into the EU\u2019s post-Covid-19 economic measures designed for its 27 member states, with little regard for the UK\u2019s interests.&nbsp;This is nonsense, as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/defining-moment-coronavirus-as-eu-executive-pushes-for-500bn-in-grants\">EU\u2019s rescue package unveiled last Wednesday</a> assumes no UK financial contribution. But it is a powerful argument on the Eurosceptic backbenches and has scared many in cabinet.</p> <p>Another&nbsp;argument popular with backbench Brexiteers, but now more prominent among ministers, is the belief that coronavirus presents the government with an opportunity to \u201cbury\u201d the&nbsp;loss of growth from no trade deal under the cover of the much more dramatic drop in GDP caused by coronavirus.</p> <p>The politics of this are very juicy for the Vote Leave team in the driving seat in government. Not least because it is only really a no deal that fully delivers on their substantive \u201cdivergence\u201d agenda, while any&nbsp;version of a deal with the EU, no matter how distant, will ultimately tie the UK into EU rules and regulations in some way, an idea they hate and are loth to accept.&nbsp;No deal also&nbsp;facilitates a trade deal with the US, and the symbolism of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/the-guardian-view-on-global-britain-a-lonely-fiction\">Global Britain</a>\u201d is key for ministers \u2013 far more important than the limited economic benefit a UK-US trade pact would bring.</p> <p>Time is also running out. Despite three rounds of talks so far, no progress has been made and negotiators on both sides are downbeat about the likelihood of a breakthrough this week.&nbsp;Big gaps remain \u2013 in the UK over whether and how far to align to EU standards, the role of the European court of justice and the EU\u2019s demands to fish in UK waters. But&nbsp;the government won\u2019t extend the transition period. Boris Johnson believes he would struggle to sell to voters the extra \u00a310bn in financial contributions and further spell of EU control of UK laws that this would bring.</p> <p>A political intervention on both sides will therefore be needed to move beyond the current stage. There will l be an opportunity this month, when Johnson meets the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, virtually, around the time of a long-planned EU leaders\u2019 session in June to review progress.&nbsp;But the EU is unlikely to change its mandate and absent progress, ministers plan to make a judgment in September so they can give business clarity about the trading arrangements from 1 January. They may switch to assuming and preparing for no deal then.</p> <p>Finally, the survival of Dominic Cummings, Johnson\u2019s closest adviser, despite allegations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/durham-police-believe-cummings-probably-did-break-lockdown-rules\">he broke the lockdown rules</a>, also enhances the prospect of no deal. One reason why Brexiteer ministers and aides rallied behind him is that he sees it as his personal mission to prevent Johnson extending the transition period in June, and delivering a version of Brexit that lets the UK \u201ctake back control\u201d. It would be wrong to underestimate his impact on the outcome of these negotiations.</p> <p>Of course, this could all be tactics and bluster. Johnson&nbsp;and his cheerleaders on the backbenches have convinced themselves that such brinkmanship worked during the withdrawal agreement talks, so it is no real surprise they intend to repeat the trick now. Especially as they believe, wrongly, that coronavirus will make the EU more desperate to conclude a deal and buckle at the last moment. But Downing Street is right that December is the real deadline.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s role will be key. I say this not as a naive Brit, believing that Angela Merkel will ride to Britain\u2019s rescue, but as someone who has spent more than two decades studying and working on EU affairs. With Germany at the head of Europe\u2019s rotating presidency, and Merkel in the final throes of her chancellorship, she will find it very hard to sign off on no deal. Of all of the EU\u2019s member states, Germany has been the most focused on the longer-term, geopolitical risk of no deal, and the necessity for the UK and EU to maintain constructive ties.</p> <p>But even Merkel can\u2019t and won\u2019t save the UK from itself, and will not agree to a deal at any price.&nbsp;If the net effect of Covid-19 is that ministers see more benefit than cost from no deal, with the dominant view in cabinet now opposed to extending the transitional period, then that will indeed be the outcome at the end of this year.</p> <p>\u2022 Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm</p>",
  "<p>There was no time to lose when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/super-cyclone-amphan-deaths-india--bangladesh\">Cyclone Amphan</a> began forming over the Indian Ocean in May.</p> <p>But shelters are not built with social distancing in mind in Bangladesh and the country faced a challenge: how to move 2.4 million people from the destructive path of the storm without delivering them into an even greater danger \u2013 Covid-19.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mass evacuations are challenging at the best of times. People are reluctant to leave their homes unguarded. This time the challenge was far more complex. People were afraid to move to shelters for fear of the virus. First responders also had to make sure the evacuation itself was not a vector for contagion.</p> <p>In a matter of days, Bangladesh prepared almost 10,500 additional shelters \u2013 on top of the 4,171 in existence&nbsp;\u2013 to <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/bangladesh/cyclone-amphan-bangladesh-preparedness-paid\">accommodate evacuees with a measure of social distancing</a>. More than 70,000 \u201ccyclone preparedness\u201d volunteers across coastal areas were mobilised. Masks, water, soap and sanitiser were distributed. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/02/fashion-brands-cancellations-of-24bn-orders-catastrophic-for-bangladesh\">garment industry, reeling from cancelled export orders</a>, retooled production lines to manufacture personal protective equipment.</p> <p>Coming on top of the pandemic, a cyclone such as Amphan throws into sharp focus the interrelated nature of the climate and health risks facing mankind. In the US, the <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>&nbsp;predicts this year\u2019s hurricane season will be one for the record books&nbsp;due to unusually warm water temperatures in the Atlantic and Caribbean&nbsp;\u2013 a consequence of the climate emergency. As in Bangladesh, the task of keeping people safe across the southern US and the Caribbean will be immeasurably more complicated as a result of Covid-19.</p> <p>Bangladesh\u2019s disaster preparedness, including a network of 55,000 first responders, meant Amphan killed fewer than 100 people in India and Bangladesh. While any death is regrettable, the country\u2019s early-warning systems and well-rehearsed evacuation drills have saved hundreds of thousands of lives over the years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is not enough to deal with the immediate effects of a natural disaster; communities need to be better prepared for the next storm</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rebuilding infrastructure and livelihoods, however, is another matter. Bangladesh has rebuilt in the wake of cyclones many times before. As one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to tropical storms \u2013 two-thirds of its land lies <a href=\"https://ejfoundation.org/reports/climate-displacement-in-bangladesh\">less than 5m above sea level</a> \u2013 rebuilding is a Sisyphean task. The climate crisis makes it even harder. Cyclones are becoming fiercer and more frequent. Rising ocean levels are poisoning wells and farmland. The pandemic and resulting deep economic crisis mean that the government must now deal with overlapping health, climate and economic emergencies all at once.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cyclone Amphan was the costliest on record in the north Indian Ocean, leaving <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/22/weather/cyclone-amphan-damage-intl-hnk/index.html\">destruction estimated at $13bn</a> (\u00a310.4m). In Bangladesh, it washed out 415km of roads, 200 bridges, tens of thousands of homes and vast tracts of farmland and fisheries. More than 150km of embankments meant to contain storm surges were damaged.</p> <p>This has been catastrophic, but planning makes countries better prepared when calamity strikes. It is not enough to deal with the immediate effects of a natural disaster; communities need to be better prepared for the next storm.</p> <p>The need to rebuild better led <a href=\"https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/BGD/1695%20ClimateChange_FullLayout%20290914.pdf\">Bangladesh to enact a Climate Fiscal Framework</a>&nbsp;in 2014, becoming the first country in the world to develop a multi-year, multi-sectoral approach to funding climate resilience. The framework includes estimates for the long-term costs of combating the effects and tracks climate-related expenditures across 20 government ministries, including agriculture, housing and energy, with multi-year budgets to match.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/25/from-kenya-to-bangladesh-mask-making-has-become-a-thriving-cottage-industry-coronavirus\">From Kenya to Bangladesh mask-making has become a thriving cottage industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was followed in 2018 by an eight-decade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/18/climate-crisis-heat-is-on-global-heating-four-degrees-2100-change-way-we-live\">climate adaptation plan</a> for the delta region, home to 30 million people. The first decade of <a href=\"https://noc.ac.uk/seminars/coastal-seminar-series/bangladesh-delta-plan-2100-mega-plan-making\">Delta Plan 2100</a> focuses on strengthening infrastructure, such as building higher embankments to resist storm surges. After Amphan, schools, hospitals and houses will need to be built back stronger, with increased resilience, so they can resist cyclones, and storm surges in coastal areas, doubling up as shelters when the next disaster hits.</p> <p>Across the world, Covid-19 is adding a huge strain to government finances, but we believe long-term fiscal frameworks and climate adaptation plans give nations better tools to respond. Health, economic and climate resilience are interrelated. That is why the Delta Plan also includes land and water management projects, and measures to make communities healthier and more resilient: for example, solar home kits that can be used to filter contaminated water to stop disease following every destructive storm.</p> <p>Bangladesh is unlikely to be the only country struggling with health, economic and climate emergencies this year.

My brother supported me with things like reading letters and cooking. I love my brother but I wanted to cook, clean, dust, pay my bills \u2013 just like a normal person.</p> <p>The stepping stone to self-belief for me was when I got my own place. I got help from KeyRing \u2013 an organisation which supports people to live independently.</p> <p>You wouldn\u2019t know it now, but a long time ago I was like a doormat. I didn\u2019t have any qualifications when I left school (they don\u2019t teach you much at special school), but I got a job as a trainee hotel porter and then moved on to housekeeping work and handyman jobs at the hotel. I enjoyed it because I was meeting new people and earning my own wage. I felt like a proper adult.</p> <p>My next job in a warehouse was sweeping up, packing and taking boxes to the skip. The boss didn\u2019t trust me to do anything else. I started to get very bored.</p> <p>The other blokes used to abuse me physically and mentally because of my disability. They used to call me \u2013 and I hate these words \u2013 \u201cretard\u201d and \u201cspacca\u201d (as in \u2018spastic\u2019). They\u2019d mock me because I used to stutter quite badly. They\u2019d imitate me talking because of my speech impediment. I hated that job because for the next five years I was bullied, ridiculed and abused. The first time someone said something to me I was on the second floor of the warehouse, pulling boxes off shelves. I heard \u201cretard\u201d from behind me, someone calling out. I said \u201cwhat?\u201d, like I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. Another time, someone lobbed a shoe at me and it got me in the head. I wanted to punch them, but I didn\u2019t want to lose my job. They used to throw boxes at me too. I asked them why and they said, \u201cWe were joking.\u201d I told them I didn\u2019t find it funny.</p> <p>Every time I reported the abuse, I thought, what\u2019s the point?<em> </em>I\u2019d get called \u201cgrass\u201d.

I was a dad by then and I needed that \u00a3100 a week, so I had to stick it out because of my kids and partner at the time, and I wanted to be independent. I used to cry when I got home, but I\u2019d think at least it was another day done.</p> <p>It was a really dark time.

  "<p>Humanity will be \u201cfinished\u201d if we fail to drastically change our food systems in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis, the prominent naturalist Jane Goodall has warned.</p> \n<p>She blamed the emergence of Covid-19 on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/tip-of-the-iceberg-is-our-destruction-of-nature-responsible-for-covid-19-aoe\">over-exploitation of the natural world</a>, which has seen forests cut down, species made extinct and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/01/sixth-mass-extinction-of-wildlife-accelerating-scientists-warn\">natural habitats destroyed</a>. The coronavirus is thought to have made the jump from animals to humans late last year, possibly originating in a meat market in Wuhan, China.</p> \n<p>Intensive farming was also creating a reservoir of animal diseases that would spill over and hurt human society, said Goodall, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jun/27/jane-goodall-chimps-africa-interview\">one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on chimpanzees and a longtime conservation campaigner</a>, speaking alongside two European commissioners at an online event held by the campaigning group Compassion in World Farming, on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have brought this on ourselves because of our absolute disrespect for animals and the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cOur disrespect for wild animals and our disrespect for farmed animals has created this situation where disease can spill over to infect human beings.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>People must <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/28/can-we-ditch-intensive-farming-and-still-feed-the-world\">move away from factory farming</a> and stop destroying natural habitats as a matter of urgency, she said, because of the threat of diseases and of climate breakdown.

Scientists warn that to avoid future crises, we must drastically change our diets and move to plant-rich foods. For the sake of the animals, planet and the health of our children.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stella Kyriakides, the EU\u2019s commissioner for health and food safety, said the EU was responding to concerns through its newly unveiled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/eu-plan-for-3bn-trees-in-10-years-to-tackle-biodiversity-crisis\">agriculture and biodiversity strategies</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">European Green Deal</a>.

The parts that don\u2019t work are ethically questionable and socially and environmentally unacceptable. Our citizens expect more and we will deliver a better balance to ensure farming practices are sustainable and food is affordable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Janusz Wojciechowski, commissioner for agriculture, added: \u201cWe will constantly support sustainable farming and breeding practices as an alternative to intensive industrial farming.\u201d</p> \n<p>Concern about the links between coronavirus and the exploitation of the natural world is growing. Eighteen conservation groups have joined together in the Campaign to End Wildlife Trading, which is urging Boris Johnson to call for a global wildlife trade ban when the G20 leaders meet this November.</p> \n<p>The groups say that such a ban is needed to end the exploitation of wildlife for traditional medicine, exotic pets, tourism and other purposes. Currently, the trade in some endangered species is banned but still rife. It is one of the biggest forms of illegal trafficking in the world, after people and drugs. The legal trade is estimated to be worth $7bn to $23bn a year, according to the campaign.</p> \n<p>Intensive farming\u2019s links to disease outbreaks were examined <a href=\"https://www.fairr.org/\">by the FAIRR global investor network in a new report</a>, which found that more than 70% of the biggest meat, fish and dairy producers were in danger of fostering future zoonotic pandemics owing to lax safety standards, closely confined animals and the overuse of antibiotics.</p> \n<p>Meat companies have been under pressure in the US, where the spread of Covid-19 has led to plant closures and disruption of the supply chain. In the longer term, according to FAIRR, the meat supply chain is likely to come under further pressure because of increased scrutiny and regulation needed to improve biosecurity.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Coller, founder of FAIRR and CIO of Coller Capital, said: \u201cFactory farming is both vulnerable to pandemics and guilty of creating them. It\u2019s a self-sabotaging cycle that destroys value and risks lives. To avoid causing the next pandemic, the meat industry must tackle lax safety standards for food and workers alike, closely confined animals, and overused antibiotics. Covid could be the straw that breaks the meat industry\u2019s back.\u201d</p>",

Their hearts beat just twice a minute, and they can go more than a decade without food.</p> <p>A display of adult olms has been&nbsp;part of Postojna\u2019s offering since the&nbsp;early 19th century (they are mentioned in a 1868 Baedeker Guide), but the creature considered by some to be Slovenia\u2019s national animal had only been bred once before in captivity in the country before (the French, to Slovenian&nbsp;<em>chagrin</em>, managed it in the 1950s). And they had never been seen breeding in the wild. So when, in 2016, a translucent spherical olm egg appeared on the glass of Postojna\u2019s main vivarium, Gnezda and his colleagues couldn\u2019t believe their luck. More eggs appeared. The nation held its breath for an agonising 120 days before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/27/slovenia-baby-dragons-postojna-salamaders-olms-proteus-anguinus\">22 babies hatched in the underground laboratory</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"625aeca5f9c361d00bb581ec739aaf99e23f34e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/625aeca5f9c361d00bb581ec739aaf99e23f34e3/0_550_4459_4459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This olm will be joined by its sibling in a few days\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This olm will be joined by its sibling in a few days</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ziga Intihar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The babies have already yielded insights into olm behaviour. Researchers knew the animals could regrow lost limbs, but when one of the young tore off a sibling\u2019s leg, they were able to study the regeneration process up close. Yet much about the amphibians remains mysterious. We have no idea how many olms live in the wild, nor even how many species there are, says Lilijana Mali, an amphibians expert at Ljubljana University. Her team think there are probably nine types, scattered throughout the Adriatic limestone karst. They do know, though, that the amphibians are sensitive to pollution as well as light, which makes Postojna\u2019s breeding success all the more vital.</p> <p>Like skiing for the Norwegians or surfing for Hawaiians, caving is a national pastime in Slovenia. The limestone bedrock of this country of 2 million people is peppered with more than 13,000 caves. To experience the realm of the wild olms, I pulled on overalls, helmet and wellies and left behind the vivarium and the tourist train. Caver and guide Roman Bogataj, who studies astrophysics in his spare time, was to be my guide, and I warned him that I suffer from mild claustrophobia. \u201cJust think of it as a walk with nice scenery,\u201d he said, with a stroke of his beard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d6e58f170bfdca2aaaad43e5dcea202e48cc4ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d6e58f170bfdca2aaaad43e5dcea202e48cc4ff/0_91_6387_3832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Primo\u017e, in his lab, chats to writer Tom Allan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Primo\u017e, in his lab, chats to writer Tom Allan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ziga Intihar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We followed an easy path along a thundering subterranean river, then turned off into a side chamber known as the Colourful Passage. Translucent curtain stalactites hung from the ceiling and the floor was adorned with cave pearls, glinting stalagmites and jumbled red rocks. Then Roman nonchalantly invited me to crawl through an oval opening in the rock face, a mere olm\u2019s-length high. \u201cI can fit, so for you it\u2019s no problem,\u201d he smiled, patting his modest belly.&nbsp;</p> <p>I peered into the hole and felt darts of adrenalin shoot down my legs, but with Roman\u2019s reassurance, and against every instinct, I found myself squirming into the crevice. The rock squeezed my chest from below and above, narrowing to a point where I had to angle my helmeted head to one side to fit through. I belly-wriggled and kicked until I was alone in a chamber that was the stillest place I\u2019ve ever been.</p> <p>Roman joined me and we clicked off our headtorches. For a few clockless minutes we experienced the world the baby dragons know: a place of silence and deep, smothering darkness, to which my thoughts have often turned in the long lockdown months since. When Roman switched on his torch I found myself like the olm, flinching from the light and in no hurry to return to the bright, chaotic world above.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The trip was provided by <a href=\"https://www.postojnska-jama.eu/en\">Postojna Cave</a>, which is open daily 9am-7pm from 3 June (summer hours), with baby olms in their new vivarium</em><em> from 11 June.

  "<p>Do we live in a democracy? You may well ask.

Parliament is truncated, as the government arbitrarily decides that MPs can no longer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/01/rees-moggs-plans-for-mps-to-vote-in-person-branded-beyond-a-farce\">take part in votes remotely</a>. As the government blunders from one disaster to the next, there seem to be no effective ways of holding it to account.</p> <p>Established power in this country is surrounded by a series of defensive rings. As soon as you begin to name them, you see that the UK is a democracy only in the weakest and shallowest sense.</p> <p>Let\u2019s begin with political funding. Our system permits billionaires and corporations to outspend and outmuscle the electorate. The great majority of money for the Conservative party comes from a small number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/09/money-matters-elections-tories-ultra-rich-brexit-donors\">very rich people</a>. Just five hedge fund managers have given it \u00a318m over the <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/revealed-the-elite-dining-club-behind-130m-donations-to-the-tories/\">past 10 years</a>. The secretive Leader\u2019s Group grants big donors special access to the prime minister and his frontbenchers in return for their money. Courting and cultivating rich people to win elections corrupts our politics, replacing democracy with plutocracy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/coronavirus-economy-change-pandemic\">Coronavirus is our chance to completely rethink what the economy is for | Malcolm Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This grossly unfair system is supplemented by outright cheating, such as breaching spending limits and secretly funding mendacious online ads. The Electoral Commission, which is supposed to regulate the system, has deliberately been <a href=\"https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/latest-news-and-research/publications/reining-in-the-political-wild-west-campaign-rules-for-the-21st-century/\">kept powerless</a>. The maximum fine for winning an election (or a referendum) by fraud is \u00a320,000 per offence. Democracy is cheap in this country.</p> <p>Despite such assistance, the Conservatives still failed to win a majority of votes at the last election. But, thanks to our preposterous, outdated first-past-the-post electoral system, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2019/results\">43.6% of the vote</a> they won granted them a crushing majority. With proportional representation, we would have a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-results-pr-alternative-voting-system-tories-labour-hung-a9246661.html\">hung parliament</a>. Five years of unassailable power for Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, even as popular support collapses, would have been impossible.</p> <p>The structure and symbolism of parliament, with its preposterous rituals and incomprehensible procedures, could scarcely be better designed to alienate people, or to favour former public schoolboys, educated in a similar environment. Even its official emblem tells us we are shut out. <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g09.pdf\">It\u2019s a portcullis</a>: the means by which people are excluded from the fortress of power. The portcullis is topped by a crown, reminding us that power is still vested symbolically in an unelected head of state. Many of her actual powers have been assumed, in the absence of a codified constitution, by the prime minister.</p> <p>These powers are routinely abused, by all governments. Prime ministers bypass parliament, governing through special advisers like Dominic Cummings. When they make catastrophic mistakes, they have the power to decide whether or not there should be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/06/coronavirus-inquiry-uk-evidence\">public inquiry</a>, and, if there should, what its terms and who its chair should be. It\u2019s as if a defendant in a criminal trial were allowed to decide whether the trial goes ahead and, if so, what the charges should be and who the judge and jury are.</p> <p>Even when an investigation does take place, the prime minister can suppress its conclusions, as Johnson has done with the report on Russian interference in the British political system, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/20/boris-johnson-urged-to-publish-report-on-russian-meddling\">remains unpublished</a>. Does it contain details of unlawful donations to the Conservative party? Or of Conservative Friends of Russia, whose launch party was attended by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/04/no-10-blocks-russia-eu-referendum-report-until-after-election\">Cummings?</a> A key figure in this group was a man who has subsequently come under suspicion of being a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/04/brexit-ministers-spy-russia-uk-brexit\">Russian spy</a>. He has been photographed with Johnson, whom he described as a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/suspected-russian-spy-pictured-with-his-good-friend-boris-johnson-2018-2?r=US&amp;IR=T\">\u201cgood friend\u201d</a>. What was going on? Without parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee\u2019s report, we can only guess.</p> <p>The same inordinate powers enabled Johnson to suspend parliament last autumn, until his decision was struck down by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\">supreme </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\">court</a>, and to terminate remote access for MPs this week, preventing many of them from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/rees-moggs-plan-to-end-remote-voting-in-parliament-condemned-by-rights-body\">representing us</a>. He is, in effect, a monarch with a five-year term and a council of advisers we call parliament.</p> <p>The House of Lords is a further defensive ring within this ring. Some of its seats are reserved for hereditary aristocrats. Some are reserved for bishops, making this the world\u2019s only country, other than Iran, in which religious leaders have an automatic right to sit. The rest are grace and favour appointments, keeping power within existing circles. Many of them are granted to major <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/cabinet-office-urged-to-investigate-fresh-tory-cash-for-honours-scandal/\">political donors</a>, reinforcing the power of money.

  "<h2>Top story: Work visa and \u2018route to citizenship\u2019</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with you, well on our way through the week.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson has opened the path to UK work and residency visas for stricken Hong Kong people if China goes ahead and imposes a national security edict on the territory. About 350,000 Hongkongers already hold \u201cBritish National Overseas\u201d passports and more than 2.5 million are believed eligible to apply. Johnson wrote in the Times that if new security laws were pursued by Beijing, \u201cBritain would have no choice but to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/britain-could-change-immigration-rules-for-hong-kong-citizens\">uphold our profound ties of history and friendship</a> with the people of Hong Kong\u201d.</p> \n<p>The prime minister wrote: \u201cIf China imposes its national security law, the British government will change its immigration rules and allow any holder of these passports from Hong Kong to come to the UK for a renewable period of 12 months and be given further immigration rights including the right to work which would place them on the route to citizenship \u2026&nbsp;This would amount to one of the biggest changes to our visa system in history.\u201d Johnson may face cabinet resistance to the idea but it was welcomed by the human rights NGO Hong Kong Watch. Johnny Patterson, its director, said: \u201cNo sitting PM has made a statement as bold as this on Hong Kong since the handover. It reflects first the severity of the situation on the ground, and second the fact that the British government genuinely, and rightly, feel a sense of duty to citizens of Hong Kong.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Coronavirus latest \u2013&nbsp;</strong>Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of causing a collapse in public confidence over the government\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 crisis.

He has not been charged, and the circumstances around how he came to be stopped by police initially remain unclear.</p> \n<p>The police response to the incident has been criticised after the commissioner, Mick Fuller, said on Wednesday the officer involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/03/nsw-police-minister-elliott-horrified-indigenous-teens-language-slammed-gladys-berejiklian\"> \u201chad a bad day\u201d</a>.

Fuller said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d apologised to the boy over the incident.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But George Newhouse, a lawyer from the National Justice Project, said the family would pursue a private prosecution against the officer if charges were not laid.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe family want charges to be laid against this officer. Not an investigation where police are investigating police,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve told me that if charges aren\u2019t laid quickly, we are instructed to launch a private prosecution. In addition, they want to know what\u2019s happening to the other officers that were present. There is a duty on officers to speak out. [And] they don\u2019t want police investigating police. If this was anyone else, you or me or any member of the original community, we would be charged and let the court decide.\u201d</p> \n<p>Under the Criminal Procedures Act in NSW, individuals can commence private prosecutions under some circumstances. Newhouse admitted they were \u201crare\u201d, but said that if the police or Department of Public Prosecutions did not place charges, \u201cwe are entitled by law and on behalf of the family to commence legal proceedings\u201d.</p> \n<p>The arrest comes amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/02/george-floyd-protests-violence-overnight-donald-trump-threat-army-live-updates\">global protests against police brutality in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man from Minneapolis in the United States</a>.

It becomes increasingly hard to feel safe when the police do not have a good connection to their communities [and] their Indigenous youth.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, NSW police assistant commissioner Mick Willing said he was concerned people \u201cmay use this footage to inflame it and turn it into something it\u2019s not\u201d.</p> \n<p>During the press conference, the boy\u2019s family were asked if they wanted people to \u201cremain calm\u201d. His mother said: \u201cWe are not about inciting violence. We\u2019re always checking ourselves. [But] when can we just be people and be free and say that we\u2019ve been hurt?

  "<p>The current global health crisis is, rightly, front and centre of all current political, media and societal discourse.&nbsp;But rewind just a few months and you\u2019ll recall the UK general election, which played out against a backdrop of fraught debate about truth in political campaigns.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why can political parties act with apparent impunity when making claims in ads and other election materials?&nbsp;Those concerns haven\u2019t gone away.&nbsp;The Electoral Commission recently warned that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52366099\">misleading campaign techniques</a> risk undermining trust in elections.&nbsp;</p> <p>The clamour for claims in political advertising to be subject to independent regulation, just like ads by commercial and non-political organisations, has been loud.&nbsp;Some argue the health of our democracy depends on campaigners being made to back up their electioneering claims; why, they say, should ads for commercial products be held to greater account than ads that might move votes and win elections?&nbsp;</p> <p>We at the Advertising Standards Authority agree that claims in political advertising should be regulated.&nbsp;But while that\u2019s straightforward in theory, it\u2019s complex in practice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Before addressing the difficult question of how, an essential first step must be that nations\u2019 political parties (and campaign groups, in the case of referendums) agree to be regulated.&nbsp;Otherwise what authority would any regulatory body have to intervene?&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the strengths of the ASA system is the support and cooperation we receive from the overwhelming majority of UK companies, who abide by our decisions on responsible advertising.&nbsp;And one of the reasons why our system withdrew entirely from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/05/uk-cant-rely-on-us-platforms-to-regulate-political-ads-inquiry-told\">regulating political ads</a> in the 1990s was the absence of sufficient support from political parties and our concern about restraining freedom of speech around democratic elections without a clear mandate to do so.&nbsp;</p> <p>As well as legitimacy, an effective regulatory system must be properly funded, have a carefully defined scope and be independent.&nbsp;</p> <p>Funding is crucial because of the likely high cost of swiftly regulating political advertising to take effective action before polling day.&nbsp;Unless drastic interventions such as mandatory pre-vetting were in place, more complicated or contested claims would need careful investigation and judgment, even if they emerged near the end of an election or referendum campaign.&nbsp;The public would rightly feel short-changed if a significant ruling changed impressions only after the votes had been counted and the winner declared.&nbsp;</p> <p>That careful investigation and judgment would need to happen quickly, while respecting well-established principles of good regulation, including delivering proportionate, consistent, accountable, targeted and evidence-based decisions.&nbsp;Regulators are not the same as fact-checking services.&nbsp;They are typically compelled to offer a reasonable right of response and are subject to judicial review if they get it wrong.&nbsp;Delivering high-quality decisions speedily and diligently is expensive and difficult.</p> <p>The architects of a political advertising regulatory system would need to consider carefully its scope.&nbsp;Given the important and necessary protections free political expression enjoys, they would be wise to consider establishing a narrow remit, regulating only clearly misleading statements of fact, avoiding being drawn into anything resembling a statement of opinion or forecast of the future, however contestable.&nbsp;(Of course, one person\u2019s statement of fact is another\u2019s statement of opinion, so even distinguishing between those can be difficult.)&nbsp;And they would be faced with the unenviable decision of whether also to narrow the remit solely to paid-for advertising, where media owners and platforms could more easily play a gatekeeper role.&nbsp;That might sacrifice comprehensiveness at the altar of expediency, but would the regulator really want to be drawn into \u2013 or be capable of \u2013 deciding what politicians can say on their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/01/the-guardian-view-on-political-advertising-time-to-regulate-it-mr-zuckerberg\">Twitter feeds</a>, websites or election leaflets?&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, if the parties and campaign groups did agree to independent regulation, they must not take it out on the regulator if it\u2019s their advertising, rather than their opponent\u2019s, that is banned.&nbsp;</p> <p>The danger of becoming a political football and the need for different skills&nbsp;might make it worthwhile to explore a more collaborative model: with input from media and advertising industries, experts on legal and data issues, and insight from political and constitutional&nbsp;perspectives.</p> <p>&nbsp;Experts from several appropriate regulators could take on the task, perhaps just for the duration of election or referendum campaigns \u2013 this would combine their expertise and share the reputational risk.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no doubt that the above requirements are challenging.&nbsp;The ASA, as a non-statutory regulator funded primarily by advertisers, is not the right body to lead political advertising regulation, but we are ready to help: sharing our experience of regulating non-political ads and exploring how we might contribute to a more collaborative arrangement.</p> <p>But precisely because this issue goes to the heart of our democracy, it needs to be the political parties and campaign groups who take the all-important first step: agree to be held to the same standard of truthfulness that society expects from companies.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Guy Parker is chief executive of the Advertising Standards Authority<em><br></em></p>",
