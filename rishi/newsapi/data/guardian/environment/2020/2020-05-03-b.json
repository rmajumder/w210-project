The death toll, officially at 85, could also be much higher.</p> \n  <p>More than 250,000 Afghans returned home from Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across their country without being tested or quarantined. Anecdotal reports have emerged of dozens of returnees dying of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.</p> \n  <p>At a recent briefing, a senior government official said 40 people died of the virus in Sarobi district, barely 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Kabul. The Health Ministry said it could not confirm the claim, <strong>reports AP</strong>.

For the first time, it will also include questions about domestic violence owing to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/domestic-abuse-cases-soar-as-lockdown-takes-its-toll\">spike in cases during the lockdown</a>.</p> <p>Research led by Prof Gail Gilchrist, of the National Addiction Centre at King\u2019s College London, who advised on the survey, found an <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/addictions/research/drugs/advanceoutputs\">increased risk of men perpetrating intimate partner abuse</a> when they were in withdrawal or craving alcohol and heroin.</p> <p>Winstock said evidence from other drug experts and law enforcement worldwide suggested a drop in demand for drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy, which were usually taken socially, partly due to the increased risk for dealers of doing home deliveries.</p> <p>He added that supplies of some drugs could start to run out in the coming weeks, leading vulnerable users in particular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-triggers-uk-shortage-of-illicit-drugs\">to take more dangerous alternatives</a>.</p> <p>For example, there were reports of homeless users in the UK turning to heroin and alcohol because of a shortage of synthetic cannabinoids, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/17/spice-sheffield-citys-drive-tackle-highly-addictive-drug\">spice</a>.</p> <p>Interesting trends in drug use overseas during the pandemic included a spike in demand for ketamine in Berlin, said Winstock, adding that at low doses the dissociative anaesthetic had a numbing effect that may appeal to people wanting to cut themselves off from the crisis.</p>",

  "<p>Public trust in science risks being damaged by potential political interference, according to a former chief scientific adviser who has set up a panel of experts to rival those advising ministers.</p> \n<p>Prompted by growing concern about the lack of transparency around the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-whos-who-on-secret-scientific-group-advising-uk-government-sage\">Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies</a> (Sage), Prof Sir David King has convened a panel of experts that he says will act as an independent alternative.</p> \n<p>The group, which will broadcast live on YouTube and take evidence from global experts, will hold its first meeting on Monday.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m worried that with ministers [and] the prime minister continually saying \u2018We\u2019re following the science advice all the way\u2019, that science is potentially going to be damaged by this,\u201d said King. \u201cI believe it\u2019s fair to say that while scientists can give advice \u2026 it is governments who have to make political decisions.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide behind the scientists when you do that, particularly if those of us in the public domain don\u2019t know what the scientists were advising because the advisers are not free to come on radio and television and tell us what their advice has been.\u201d</p> \n<p>King cited the government policy on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/ministers-split-over-coronavirus-advice-on-wearing-face-masks\">face masks</a>, which he said appeared to be politically convenient, but ran in contradiction to the best available evidence.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence to indicate that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-face-masks-why-covering-up-is-becoming-the-new-normal\">wearing of face masks is a major help in reducing person-to-person viral transfer</a>,\u201d King said. \u201cThis is why it has become so much a part of the culture in South Asia.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Austria introduced a requirement to wear face masks in public, the incidence of Covid-19 \u201cjust collapsed around that one piece of advice\u201d, he added.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wonder whether that decision, apparently by Sage \u2026 was driven by the necessity of not requiring it because we don\u2019t have the face masks available in this country,\u201d said King.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a political issue. My advice would always be that face masks are required and that if we don\u2019t have them, you need to see we acquire them for the people at large.\u201d</p> \n<p>The group, which includes a range of leading scientists working across public health, computer modelling, behavioural science and intensive care medicine, aims to present the government with \u201crobust, unbiased advice\u201d.</p> \n<p>King argues that the official Sage is compromised by the fact that 16 of the 23 known members of the committee, including the prime minister\u2019s strategist Dominic Cummings, are employed by government.</p> \n<p>The Independent Sage meeting will cover seven areas, including the criteria for lifting lockdown, testing and tracing and quarantine and shielding policies for vulnerable groups. It will formally submit its recommendations to the health and social care select committee, placing pressure on the government to explain the advice behind its lockdown exit strategy, parts of which are expected to be unveiled in the coming week.</p> \n<p>King said that the biggest potential pitfall in weeks ahead would be to relax lockdown measures too soon and that he believes the government\u2019s so-called five tests for whether it is safe to ease restrictions are inadequate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMy own feeling is that the extent to which the virus is still in the population means we are not yet close \u2026 to coming out of lockdown,\u201d he said. \u201cUndoubtedly the biggest potential pitfall is removing lockdown too early and too quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>A second peak, he said, could not only increase casualties, but could also lengthen the overall period of time before the country is able to fully exit lockdown. \u201cIf you go into a second peak, it just becomes more and more difficult to end the pandemic,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>King previously held the chief scientific role, now occupied by Sir Patrick Vallance, between 2000 and 2007 and served as the UK\u2019s climate envoy from 2013 to 2017.</p> \n<p>The independent advisory group will include some vocal critics of the government\u2019s Covid-19 policies, such as the global public health expert Prof Anthony Costello, as well as former and existing Sage experts.</p>",
  "<p>When Papa died recently \u2013 Mum\u2019s father \u2013 I knew Covid-19 was going to make it harder to attend the funeral. In the hours after his death, all of the energy that I would\u2019ve used to grieve him was taken up by the logistics of attending the funeral in Sydney. I got on the phone with Mum, who told me not to come. \u201cHoney, it\u2019s 10 people only,\u201d she said. I talked to my brother, who echoed my own feelings; we wanted to be there, not only to remember and grieve Papa surrounded by family, but also to support Mum. Even if it meant not attending the funeral service.</p> <p>When I called Dad, we were on the phone for ages weighing up options. Would we have to quarantine in Sydney? If Mum and Dad both had to quarantine coming back into Brisbane, who would shop for groceries? Would our being there make things more complicated? Would the travel, although necessary, put the people near us at risk? In the end, we decided to stay put. I stayed in Melbourne, and Dad in Brisbane with my brother.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/remote-rituals-in-a-time-of-coronavirus-mourners-find-comfort-where-they-can\">Remote rituals: in a time of coronavirus, mourners find comfort where they can</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the days after those conversations I found myself struggling to process Papa\u2019s death. Without the ceremonials of the funeral, how was I meant to grieve? Distractions came up every day \u2013 I was still working, I had a deadline coming up for my thesis, and on the weekend our new housemate moved in. When I was a kid Dad always talked to me about the importance of ceremonies. Weddings, funerals, graduations. He would launch into a version of the same sermon at every opportunity. Humans need ceremonies, he said. They need a way to mark change. Otherwise these things just pass you by.</p> <p>So when Mum told me the funeral was going to be livestreamed, I was glad. The unsettled, intangible feeling I\u2019d had since Papa died wasn\u2019t going away. It needed a place to find anchor.</p> <p>I went to another funeral a month before Papa died \u2013 not a livestreamed funeral but a funeral in real life. It was the week before coronavirus became a pandemic and Covid-19 was not yet the topic on everyone\u2019s lips. When a close friend called me and told me her mum had passed away suddenly, it was a no-brainer. I booked my nine-hour Murrays bus from Melbourne and was in Canberra that weekend. I shared her bed and tried to make her laugh and helped her and her sisters make fridge magnets for the funeral. I sat with her mum\u2019s orphaned cat Lucy on the cold laundry floor, trying to calm its nerves.</p> <p>Being there for her and helping her grieve her beautiful mother was hard and exhausting. The first day I was back in Melbourne I slept all day. But it was also deeply necessary for both of us, and I\u2019m so grateful I could be there.</p> <p>When I realised I couldn\u2019t be with Mum, not only for the funeral but for all the difficult, complicated moments in between, I was devastated. I missed out helping her carry the weight of her grief, on the conversations that would make it easier for both of us to lean into the sadness. Here, in Melbourne, I grieved alone.</p> <p>The livestream began at 11:30am on a Tuesday. I watched from my bed as everyone arrived. I sent a text to my brother. \u201cThis is weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He replied straight away. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre.\u201d Inside the chapel the chairs were evenly spaced apart, like pieces on a checkerboard, separated by the mandated 1.5m. I saw Mum at the front of the room, talking to the minister. Her sister sat behind her and her brother\u2019s family were only a few meters away, but the space between them seemed vast.</p> <p>When she got up to give the eulogy, I clutched my tea and cried. The pain of watching the service from afar made me feel like a gatecrasher, like a bad daughter. But when Mum rang after the service, she said: \u201cI could feel you supporting me, even though you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p> <p>She told me that Papa\u2019s family in Trinidad also livestreamed the service. Drupeti, Indu, Kalawaty; my aunties, uncles and cousins on the other side of the world who, without the help of modern technology and the catalyst of a global pandemic, would have almost certainly missed the funeral. As Mum said: \u201cI felt carried by all of you.\u201d <br><br></p>",

About 1,970bn litres of this water is released back into the environment but, the report says, often it has been polluted or processed in such a way that it is harmful to fish, plants and other species.</p> <p>The research says the amount of water used by coal-fired power is 120 times the amount of water used by wind or solar.</p> <p>To produce the figures, Overton drew on water use data from 39 annual reports from 2018 for NSW coalmines to calculate an estimated total water use figure for coalmining in NSW and Queensland. For coal-fired power stations he used data from a 2009 academic report.</p> <p>He said one of the problems in trying to calculate the amount of water used by the coal industry was there was a lack of consistent and freely available current data.

The reports that were available often used different formats and there was no holistic oversight by a single government agency.</p> <p>\u201cResearch was based on available information and the evidence suggests the true impact of coal activities on Australia\u2019s water resources is not well known and is likely underestimated due to a lack of transparency and current regulatory frameworks,\u201d the report states.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/11/coalmine-would-take-33bn-litres-of-water-a-year-from-sydney-catchment-agency-warns\">Coalmine would take 3.3bn litres of water a year from Sydney catchment, agency warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe lack of data, in particular, is a significant challenge to understanding the true impact of coalmining and coal-fired power on Australia\u2019s water resources.\u201d</p> <p>The report highlights the fact that as Australia\u2019s coalmining activities are concentrated in particular areas, such as NSW\u2019s Hunter region or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/29/collinsville-the-queensland-town-on-the-frontline-of-the-coal-wars\">Bowen Basin in Queensland</a>, the impact of water use in these areas would be more significant.</p> <p>Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the intent of the research was to highlight the impact of the coal industry\u2019s water use on a dry continent like Australia, and also to draw attention to gaps in data.</p> <p>\u201cWhile farmers recover from the last devastating drought and prepare for the next, each year the coal industry uses as much freshwater as every household in Queensland or the entire population of Sydney,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you add coal-fired electricity\u2019s water consumption and contamination to its climate pollution, it\u2019s clear Australia should rapidly replace coal-fired power with clean energy.</p> <p>\u201cBecoming a modern renewable energy nation will enable us to weather future shocks and become a safer, more sustainable and resilient country.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Another working week is beginning, and while the pandemic has left many without jobs, others are struggling to do two at once. The closure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/schools\" title=\"\">schools</a> to all but a few pupils has forced parents and other carers to combine their regular jobs with educating their children. Some, at least, are relishing the extra time together. But many feel overwhelmed and inadequate, fearing that they are failing on both scores.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.booktrust.org.uk/news-and-features/news/news-2020/reading-and-traditional-childrens-activities-surge-in-lockdown--but-significant-minority-are-at-risk-of-falling-behind/\" title=\"\">survey</a> by the BookTrust charity, more than a fifth of adults said they were doing no home education at all with their primary-school-aged children. Two-thirds of children have not taken part in online lessons, according to <a href=\"https://www.suttontrust.com/our-research/covid-19-and-social-mobility-impact-brief/\" title=\"\">a poll by the Sutton Trust and Public First</a>; private school pupils are more than twice as likely as state pupils to receive such lessons each day. The attainment gap, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/30/attainment-gap-widens-disadvantaged-gcse-pupils-study\" title=\"\">already growing</a>, is likely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/27/schools-shutdown-likely-to-widen-attainment-gap-says-ofsted-chief\" title=\"\">increase further</a> \u2013 as many parents are painfully aware. Though nascent plans could see primary schools <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-lockdown/uk-could-allow-primary-schools-to-reopen-as-soon-as-june-1-telegraph-idUSKBN22E0TP\" title=\"\">reopen in June</a>, much remains unclear and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-scientists-caution-against-reopening-schools\" title=\"\">nothing is certain</a>, or even close to it. The impact on many children\u2019s futures is profound, and devastating.</p> <p>Life is far easier for those with quiet space at home for everyone to work, laptops or tablets for each family member, and generous broadband packages. But even the relatively privileged face new strains. Employees, while grateful to be working for now, may know that their jobs are at imminent risk; freelancers are struggling to find work; others are trying to shore up businesses. Though many play catch-up late at night, some jobs must be done within regular working hours. Furloughed workers may have more time, but are worrying about their futures. The pressures can be all the greater for single parents, those with many children, or those whose children have additional needs. Families have lost access to the support networks on which they relied, such as grandparents and friends.</p> <p>Parents of primary-age pupils may envy those with teenagers, who require less supervision, while those struggling with GCSE curriculums may wish that building a volcano model still counted as a good morning\u2019s learning. Lockdown has its compensations: small children especially may cherish the additional hours with their carers. But many adolescents will long for space and the company of their peers.</p> <p>Plenty of schools have done an excellent job of arranging online classes and distributing tasks. Screen time isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing: there is good-quality content from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize\" title=\"\">BBC Bitesize</a>, the broadcaster\u2019s online educational resource, and the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/26/joe-wicks-interview-my-hearthrob-days-are-over\" title=\"\">Joe Wicks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/maddiemoate\" title=\"\">Maddie Moate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/gregfoot08/\" title=\"\">Greg Foot</a> on YouTube, as well as the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thenational.academy/\" title=\"\">Oak National Academy</a>. But many children will still need help to learn, and parents lack the expertise and experience of teachers. Meanwhile, both children and adults are under unusual strain. Some are bereaved. Routines have vanished. Friends and partners are missed. The uncertainty about the future breeds anxiety. </p> <p>Children who are vulnerable for economic or other reasons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/the-guardian-view-on-children-in-the-pandemic-hidden-victims\" title=\"\">need support</a>, either in the school environment, or through increased help and resources for home learning. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has promised that laptops, tablets and the means to access the internet <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-major-package-to-support-online-learning\" title=\"\">will be provided</a>, but has now <a href=\"https://schoolsweek.co.uk/coronavirus-majority-of-free-laptops-wont-be-delivered-until-june/\" title=\"\">said</a> the first are expected to arrive in late May, with most delivered in June.</p> <p>Households that can effectively home-school should be applauded, but for many the current situation is about simply getting by. Sensible schools and teachers have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MonkseatonMid/status/1254702549577412608\" title=\"\">reassured parents</a> that these are unprecedented times, that they are being asked to do the impossible, and that the priority is mental health and stable relationships. Yet some parents report pressure to meet an unrealistic academic workload. Serious planning is needed to help pupils continue their education and overcome the effects of the hiatus when they return to school. For now, the emphasis should be on bolstering families rather than chastising them, accepting that most children will manage and may even thrive given love, understanding and the opportunity to follow their own interests \u2013 and that the emphasis must remain on supporting those who will not.</p>",
  "<p>Rudderless, running wild and 32kg over her current fighting weight, Shannon Courtenay remembers excusing herself midway through her first boxercise class six years ago on the pretence of needing the loo. \u201cI was hungover,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was so unfit and I just couldn\u2019t wait for the hour to be up. I told the instructor I was going out for a wee but I actually went out for a cigarette and got sick.\u201d</p> <p>She was aged 20 at the time and had gone along with friends from Abbots Langley, near Watford. Her instructor noticed that for all her shortcomings in the fitness department, Courtenay packed a particularly ferocious punch and recommended that she present herself at the Finchley boxing gym, where another wayward youth by the name of Anthony Joshua <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/29/anthony-joshua-former-coach-sean-murphy-wladimir-klitschko\" title=\"\">first laced up his gloves</a> for further tuition in the sweet science.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/13/claressa-shields-christina-hammer-middleweight\">Claressa Shields takes center stage on women's boxing's biggest night</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor three months I thought nothing of it then I plucked up the courage to go,\u201d says the bantamweight. \u201cI was the only girl there but the minute I walked in it changed my life dramatically. I knew it was where I was meant to be. I walked out of the gym, threw my cigarettes in the bin, got up at 5am the next morning and went running. My life changed that day and I\u2019ve never looked back.\u201d</p> <p>Before then, Courtenay had no idea where she was meant to be. Her father had walked out on the family when she was 10, while her mother ran a pub and gave driving lessons to support her daughter and son. A teenage tearaway, Courtenay kept her own hours, many of them forever lost in a drunken haze. \u201cI was really unhappy and I had no direction but suddenly I knew what I wanted to do,\u201d she says. \u201cBoxing made me happy and the weight started falling off because I wasn\u2019t smoking or drinking any more. I realised what I was doing was going to turn my life around.\u201d</p> <p>And how. After 22 bouts as an amateur, Courtenay has won five out of five as a professional, the first of them in March last year. Now aged 26, she fights out of the gym in Redhill, Surrey, run by the trainer Adam Booth, who is plotting her career path along with the promoter Eddie Hearn. Because of the Covid\u201119 crisis, she spent the day of what was supposed to be her sixth fight training in isolation, attempting to mow her lawn, and talking to the Guardian. If she is disappointed she hides it well, her conversation punctuated by constant self\u2011deprecating laughter, never more so than when she is discussing her gardening misadventures. \u201cI tried to cut my grass this morning,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I now have one stripe in the middle of my lawn which is all I got done before I mowed over the cable. I cut it in three places so there\u2019s no fixing it now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4566cbd72933e1be37dade5d02d3ea5a764eaed2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4566cbd72933e1be37dade5d02d3ea5a764eaed2/0_0_4082_2980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shannon Courtenay rocks Buchra El Quaissi with a punishing right on her way to victory in December at London\u2019s York Hall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"730\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shannon Courtenay rocks Buchra El Quaissi with a punishing right on her way to victory in December at London\u2019s York Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Holt/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first, Courtenay found life in lockdown difficult. \u201cI really struggled with it because I\u2019d gone from being in camp for a year, being really active, to suddenly not being allowed to go to the gym,\u201d she explains. \u201cI live on my own, which is obviously a bit boring, but then I got a punchbag delivered two weeks ago and I\u2019m absolutely fine now. I\u2019ve been going out running during the day and then doing the bag and weights at night so I\u2019m coping absolutely fine, but at first it was very, very tough. I\u2019m still training really hard so when we are allowed to fight I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p> <p>Talk of her fitness regime, work ethic and apparently iron will calls to mind the old Muhammad Ali quote about fights being \u201cwon or lost far away from witnesses \u2013 behind the lines, in the gym, and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights\u201d. Is it a view to which Courtenay subscribes? \u201c100%,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always said this and I stand by it \u2013 I am not a talented fighter. I am where I am through purely hard work. I don\u2019t have that raw talent that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/01/katie-taylor-fight-undisputed-champion-delfine-persoon\" title=\"\">the likes of Katie Taylor</a> has; I am where I am because I work so hard. That\u2019s why I continue to push myself so much to continue to improve myself because I\u2019ve so much to catch up on because I was so late to the game. I make sure that I constantly give 110% in everything I do.\u201d</p> <p>She must have <em>some</em> talent? \u201cWell, obviously, there must be a little bit there because I\u2019ve got where I am so far but I don\u2019t think people understand my work ethic,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if I\u2019m not physically training, I\u2019m sitting there studying fights, writing things down, rewinding it and going over it again and again looking at everything because I just want to be the best I can be.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/25/jane-couch-britains-first-licenced-female-boxer-interview\">Jane Couch: \u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t been the first in boxing ...

For every 100 comments there might be two nasty ones and they were the ones I focused on. But now I look at it and I think that if somebody\u2019s sitting there behind a keyboard, living in the box room in his mum\u2019s house and he feels the need to slate a young girl, then it says a lot more about him than it does about me.\u201d</p> <p>With her career on hold until elite sport is given the green light to resume, Courtenay has little option but to remain patient. \u201cI spoke to Eddie last week and he\u2019s got a feeling there\u2019s a chance we might be able to fight at the end of June or July,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s wishful thinking but what we do know is that it will be behind closed doors and there won\u2019t be any audience for a while.\u201d While far from ideal, at least it will mean a return to dancing under those lights.</p> <p><em>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scourtenay\" title=\"\">@shannon_courtenay</a></em></p>",
  "<p>The government\u2019s daily briefing (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 1 May) suggested there was a well calculated, organised programme monitoring the testing of staff within a hospital environment. This is far from the truth. My daughter is working in A&amp;E at a London hospital. NHS workers on the frontline were told at short notice that they could sign up by booking a testing appointment. Of course, many health workers were keen to get tested and endeavoured to sign up. The upshot was the hospital computer systems crashed. On Wednesday, the hospital was suddenly flooded with outside testing staff. It would appear the testing was a bit of flannel to make sure the 100,000 target was met. I believe this testing is a stunt and find the trivialisation of the dire situation we are in beyond belief.<br><strong>Sandra Roberts</strong><br><em>Twickenham, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Whether or not the government has reached its target of 100,000 tests for coronavirus is irrelevant if the results are not available. Two weeks ago, at the care home where my husband is a resident with late-stage Alzheimer\u2019s, three residents were tested for possible Covid-19. As a precaution, residents were confined to their rooms and staff remained in isolation on site.</p> <p>The manager attempted to get results and was variously told \u201cif you haven\u2019t heard anything, it\u2019s the virus\u201d and \u201cif you haven\u2019t heard anything you\u2019re probably clear\u201d.</p> <p>On Thursday, the three residents were again tested by someone in full personal protective equipment (the staff are using face shields donated by local businesses from their 3D printers), demonstrating that testing figures are meaningless unless results are produced and made available to those who need to know.<br><strong>Ann Jolly</strong><br><em>Emsworth, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 No social scientist would combine tests conducted with possible tests in the pipeline to produce an indicator of policy outcome. That government\u2019s scientific advisers did so is further evidence that they have forfeited their independence to become part of the government\u2019s propaganda machine. This co-option process is familiar the world over and perhaps unavoidable, but they should not pretend to be independent, nor should the government claim they are to legitimise its policy failures.<br><strong>Alan Walker</strong><br><em>Professor of </em><em>social </em><em>policy and </em><em>social </em><em>gerontology, University of Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a teacher during the lockdown, I post tests out to my pupils and tell everyone that they have been tested. They haven\u2019t been returned completed, they haven\u2019t been marked and I have no idea how accurate the results might be if the tests are returned. Nevertheless, I proudly claim that I have tested all my pupils.</p> <p>This is an extremely close analogy to Matt Hancock\u2019s fatuous claim to have met his target of 100,000 tests for Covid-19. The only difference is that if my pupils have cheated, or I make up a result, it is not a matter of life and death \u2013 except if my pupils grow up and become Conservative politicians.<br><strong>John Broughton</strong><br><em>Calver, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Given the government\u2019s methodology for counting tests, should I assume that HMRC will consider my next tax bill paid when I inform it that my cheque is in the post?<br><strong>Dr Corin Howitt</strong><br><em>Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Matt Hancock says that the achievement of 100,000 tests a day is incredible.

the NHS, when given that challenge, can very, very rapidly put in place the extra capacity that is required.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd they have done that magnificently, and at no point during the surge of cases in April was the NHS in a position where it was not able to give the treatment to patients with Covid-19 that they needed.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThat is a great testament to how well the NHS has been able to cope.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd I think then the lesson going forward is one, that we can do that, but two, we need to keep that capacity in place.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut we need to keep it in place at the same time as standing up all the other services that the NHS is providing.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re the ones we\u2019ve always provided, the emergency services, but some of the services that we\u2019ve had to stand down during April, so elective surgery for instance.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo my lesson is that the NHS is incredibly flexible.

are working internationally to determine what the best means is of dealing with it.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we are piloting treatments which can prevent the virus, once people have been

country\u2019s decision not to extend testing to all care homes regardless of whether there is an outbreak.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Gething said: \u201cEngland have gone out and created lots of capacity very quickly and they\u2019ve then gone out and used that capacity.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe challenge is though, that from a policy point of view there is clearly a difference, but that\u2019s partly because England decided that having set a big target they needed to go out and use all the tests.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNow, other people will tell you about how many of those tests are actual tests, or tests that have been sent out.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut part of the difficulty we\u2019ve had is that the scientific underpinning for how and why you extend that policy isn\u2019t something where there has been a fully informed debate in advance, and we don\u2019t see that the science supports all of the differences in policy and the testing reach in England.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked if Wales could increase its number of tests available, Gething said: \u201cThat capacity is being increased each week.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor the current purpose of keeping people safe, in particular key workers, on understanding people in our healthcare system actually have coronavirus, we do have enough capacity.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut the continued build-up of capacity here is being driven at what happens for us to be able to get out of lockdown.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He also criticised the UK Government for including a testing centre in Cardiff on its test-booking website, despite it

forced to remain locked down for a considerable period of time as younger people were treated differently, according to Baroness Ros Altmann.</p> \n  <p>The pensions expert and political campaigner on age-related issues, told Sky News: \u201cIf they are fit and healthy and need to get out for their own physical health then the idea that the government will tell them you are under house arrest while everybody else is out, and force them into solitary confinement\u2026 then I think they wouldn\u2019t accept it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show, the broadcaster Michael

With the coronavirus lockdown having halted all rugby, a number of highly regarded development coaches believe now is the moment to reappraise the entire national age-group structure.</p> <p>Among them is John Fletcher, the popular head of the England Under\u201118s side for a decade until he was abruptly sacked two years ago in a shake-up under the now-departed Dean Ryan and Nigel Melville. Fletcher believes the steady churn of individuals and conflicting policies at Twickenham have weakened England\u2019s national age-group programme and says that Conor O\u2019Shea, the RFU\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/29/conor-oshea-to-join-rfu-england-rugby-union-nigel-melville\" title=\"\">new director of performance rugby</a>, faces a sizable repair job.</p> <p>\u201cNationally I think we lost our way. Nigel and Dean took us in a direction they clearly thought was the right one but, in hindsight, quite a bit of what they did was not that helpful,\u201d Fletcher says. \u201cThere was some stuff that was good but a lot they did will be changed. Some other unions have not only caught us up but are looking to go past us. We\u2019ve definitely got work to do.\u201d</p> <p>Northampton\u2019s former academy manager Simon Sinclair also believes a widespread overhaul is needed. Sinclair, one of a number of people to assist in the development of the England flanker Lewis Ludlam, insists the regulations surrounding academy catchment areas need reviewing. \u201cHow is it fair that some clubs have 18,000 registered young players to pick from while others have 5,000? There must be 20% of players in certain regions who are getting missed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sinclair, now director of sport at Bedford modern school after a 14-year association with Saints, argues that many of those unluckily dumped at under-16 level would easily be good enough to thrive elsewhere. He also cites the case of the young player whose club dropped him from their squad \u2013 without any feedback \u2013 yet still refused to release him to another Premiership side. Subsequently the teenager concerned has represented England Under-20s and made his senior first-team debut. \u201cMy concern is that at least 15% of the quality players out there are getting lost,\u201d says Sinclair. \u201cYou only have to talk to [Northampton\u2019s] Piers Francis. He gets binned, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/10/flat-whites-all-blacks-piers-francis-world-cup-england-rugby\" title=\"\">goes to New Zealand</a> and ends up playing for England at the World Cup.\u201d</p> <p>Both Fletcher and Sinclair also propose shifting the key years for identifying elite players to under-17 and under-19, rather than under-16 and under-18, to avoid clashing with GCSEs and A-levels. An under-19 league would assist late developers, not least young props, and also provide a useful bridge between school or college and senior club rugby, a perennial English weakness. \u201cThat\u2019s the big one for me,\u201d says Fletcher. \u201cThe problem\u2019s been there for ever and we still haven\u2019t solved it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ef3e9890ace561d33e100e8d8aa02a9083baf026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef3e9890ace561d33e100e8d8aa02a9083baf026/85_98_2899_1740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piers Francis, Northampton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piers Francis was released at a young age but went to play in New Zealand before joining Northampton and subsequently securing a place in England\u2019s 2019 World Cup squad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sinclair believes it would also be helpful educationally \u2013 \u201cRunning camps just before kids take their exams is pretty nuts\u201d \u2013 and is also calling for tighter controls on agents contacting schoolboys via social media. \u201cAgents standing around watching under\u201115 and under-16 school games is terrible. They say: \u2018This is our living,\u2019 but from a safeguarding point of view you can\u2019t be contacting kids.\u201d Nor is endless academy training and bench-warming any substitute for game-time.</p> <p>\u201cThese youngsters aren\u2019t playing enough rugby,\u201d Sinclair adds. \u201cI would also say the RFU have missed a massive opportunity with university rugby. Look at South Africa. Their system is brilliant. We haven\u2019t done that and haven\u2019t given enough funding to universities.\u201d</p> <p>Tony Yapp, the head coach of newly promoted National League One side Taunton Titans and a long-time coach at Blundell\u2019s school and Exeter University, is similarly keen for a rethink. \u201cKids in academies see themselves as being on the path to Premiership rugby but not many make it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t deal with that very well in some cases and a lot give up playing rugby. For me having players in local teams would be a better model rather than Premiership clubs taking them away and, at the end of it, telling 95% of them they\u2019re not required any more.\u201d</p> <p>Some club academies, furthermore, now prefer to draw from one or two colleges, avoiding talented players at other schools, because it is easier to control players\u2019 conditioning programmes. Flawed selection will always exist \u2013 the late-developing Henry Slade could not even make the Devon Under-15s side \u2013 but Sinclair believes Twickenham has latterly been off the pace. \u201cWhen John Fletcher, Peter Walton and Russell Earnshaw left, they knew every single boy in the system. It went from there to bringing in part-time coaches from clubs and asking clubs to put players forward. Did they not know them? Have they watched any games?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/30/rugby-needs-a-command-economy-ex-world-rugby-directors-remedy\">The Breakdown | 'Now or never' for game to reboot, warns former World Rugby director</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fletcher would be open to returning to the RFU, if asked, although the acrimonious end to his previous stint was tough to take at the time. \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy the last couple of years, to be honest.

  "<p>The number of pieces that need to be in place for football to return can be difficult to keep in mind.

That\u2019s because the situation is unprecedented, it\u2019s completely new.\u201d</p> <p>What psychologists do know is that stress has an impact on performance. It leaves players more prone to falling ill and more prone to sustaining injury. It also affects the ability to recover.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t do rehab or prehab because of stress, that can have an impact,\u201d Cunliffe says. \u201cIf you\u2019re not hydrating, or your heart rate or blood pressure is high, it can impact on recovery. Stress has an impact on all that. It can also impact on decision-making, particularly during a match, like the decision to make a rash tackle.</p> <p>\u201cWhat stress is essentially doing is making your behaviours sub-optimal, \u201cwhich then impacts on the physiological. But we also know that stress, in particular psychological stress such as excessive training and performance demands, or stress on social relations, but also fear of infection \u2013 we know that it does impact on the immune system, too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"319b88ad476cddb15a390803e234ab4486c78f3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/319b88ad476cddb15a390803e234ab4486c78f3b/3_122_2126_1276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bournemouth\u2019s Simon Francis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bournemouth\u2019s Simon Francis said there could be no doubting the risks involved in the Premier League returning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Molly Darlington/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Teams are well versed in dealing with stress but not the kind that comes from fear of infection by a virus. Martin Turner, a reader in psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University, says: \u201cUncertainty and uncontrollability are the key factors that cause stress. If you think about how athletes operate, especially in team sports, there\u2019s been a drive to create an environment that is predictable. Everything is in place to maximise potential.</p> <p>\u201cIn some aspects of training they will build in uncertainty to pressure but [Covid-19] is adding uncertainty into the environment <em>per se.</em> It is not a stress athletes are used to.\u201d</p> <p>According to Turner, not only does the addition of a new stress have the consequences Cunliffe describes, it also affects the other messages coaches may want to pass on. \u201cThis stress requires a different way of coping,\u201d he says. \u201cIt requires a kind of emotional coping, for players to be able to tell themselves: \u2018I\u2019m in a safe environment, I trust the medical staff.\u2019 But at the same time they have to try to maximise their potential in a less than ideal context. They have to ask themselves: \u2018What can I do to maintain prowess <em>and</em> keep safe?\u2019 Those two things could be opposing.\u201d</p> <p>The strength of any footballer lies in the team and the routes out of Covid-induced stress will be found through collective support, says Turner. \u201cOne thing about being in a team is camaraderie. The virus could be perceived as a unifier, a shared challenge. What you need is for a leader in the group to come into training with focus and confidence and display trust to staff, so that it can then ripple through the team.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another irony of the current situation is that football often spreads its camaraderie through physical contact, not just in playing together but the hugs, head rubs and pranks that are part of squad building. That, too, is impossible right now.</p> <p>The pandemic is unlike anything anyone has experienced before and that means that there is no guarantee that taking certain measures will lead to the outcome people want.</p> <p>\u201cI think anxiety is the right response in this situation,\u201d Turner says. \u201cAnxiety is there to tell us that things are not right in the environment. If a club was going back into [competition] and they weren\u2019t anxious, that would be a concern.</p> <p>\u201cAccepting and recognising anxiety is key. Footballers are not going to let [anxiety they are feeling] get into the public domain, which is a shame because I think it could help to normalise it. But, internally, they would do well to accept and recognise it. It\u2019s about helping people to cope.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Hostile states are attempting to hack British universities and scientific facilities to steal research related to Covid-19, including vaccine development, cybersecurity experts have warned.</p> <p>The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said the proportion of such targeted cyber-attacks had increased, branding the criminal activity \u201creprehensible\u201d.</p> <p>It is understood that nations including Iran and Russia are behind the hacking attempts, while experts have said China is also a likely perpetrator.</p> <p>There are thought to be dozens of universities and institutions with biomedical capacity working on Covid-19 research, ranging from new diagnostic and antibody tests to experimental treatment.</p> <p>However, it is understood there have been no successful attacks on universities or research institutions to date.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the NCSC said: \u201cAny attack against efforts to combat the coronavirus crisis is utterly reprehensible.

We\u2019re seeing those geopolitical tensions played out in this space.\u201d</p> <p>Sullivan said the attacks highlighted the problems with cybersecurity in the healthcare sector.

You can\u2019t keep doing the same things.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Lagos, Nigeria, he became a musician despite much opposition from his Nigerian father, James Alabi Allen, a motor mechanic, and Ghanaian mother, Prudentia (nee Mettle), because, as he once explained, \u201cback then, musicians were more or less thought of as beggars, or worse\u201d.</p> <p>He took up a position as a radio technician, but at night he was playing <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/claves\" title=\"\">the claves</a> with a highlife band, <a href=\"https://folio.ng/sir-victor-olaiya/\" title=\"\">Sir Victor Olaiya and the Cool Cats</a>. \u201cIt was tedious,\u201d he said. \u201cFor three months I would finish playing and then go to work \u2013 so I was sleeping at work.\u201d</p> <p>He longed to be a drummer, and when the band\u2019s drummer left, he had his chance \u201cand that was it\u201d.</p> <p>He was a huge admirer of the great American jazz drummers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/mar/03/jazz.shopping3\" title=\"\">Art Blakey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/aug/18/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Max Roach</a>, but was determined to create his own style. \u201cFrom the beginning I was searching for my own way of playing. My beats are my beats. I never learned them from anywhere. I create them.\u201d</p> <p>He developed his style while playing with a series of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/highlife-African-music\" title=\"\">highlife </a>bands, and in 1964 he was invited to an audition by Fela, a fellow jazz fan who had been studying in London. They began playing together in the Koola Lobitos, a band that fused jazz and highlife, with the music driven by Allen\u2019s innovative drum patterns. After touring the US they added funk to the mix and Fela began writing increasingly angry and political lyrics. Afrobeat was born.</p> <p>Fela now named the band Africa 70, and Allen, who Fela said \u201csounded like four drummers\u201d, was their musical director. Whether he was drumming for hours at Fela\u2019s all-night shows at his club, The Shrine, or performing on Africa 70\u2019s stream of classic albums, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYk6ihEDOnI\" title=\"\">Roforofo Fight</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlqcrC1I4fs\" title=\"\">Yellow Fever</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvcZwvOxvuY\" title=\"\">Kalakuta Show</a>, he was crucial to their success.</p> <p>One of Allen\u2019s earliest and most devoted British fans was the musician and producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/23/brian-eno-not-interested-in-talking-about-me-reflection\" title=\"\">Brian Eno</a>, who called him \u201cperhaps the best drummer in the world\u201d. He first heard his playing when he bought the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh9hI8AjK8s\" title=\"\">Afrodisiac</a> album (1973) \u201cbecause I had never heard an African big band. I took the record home and was bowled over, and it was a while before it became clear that what was at the centre of it was Tony Allen\u2019s drumming. I told everyone \u2018You have to listen to this drummer, this is something completely new in music.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Allen quit the band in late 1978, angry at Fela\u2019s increasingly chaotic lifestyle and lack of organisation, and deciding that \u201ctwo captains can\u2019t be in one ship\u201d. He had already recorded a series of solo albums with help from Fela and Africa 70, but now he formed Afrobeat bands of his own, including the Afro Messengers, with whom he recorded No Discrimination (1979).</p> <p>In 1984 he left Lagos for London, where he recorded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmc87LsaGo4\" title=\"\">N.E.P.A. (Never Expect Power Always)</a>, a sardonic comment on the erratic power supplies of the Nigerian National Electric Power Authority, and played with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/25/artsfeatures\" title=\"\">King Sunny Ade</a>, the finest exponent of Nigerian juju styles. But Allen decided to leave Britain \u201cbecause the Home Office wouldn\u2019t give me a work permit ... it was dangerous for me to stay here\u201d.</p> <p>He moved to Paris at the end of 1985, helped by the producer <a href=\"http://www.martinmeissonnier.com/\" title=\"\">Martin Meissonnier</a>, \u201cwho arranged French papers and a contract with Barclay Records\u201d. It would be his base for the rest of his life, and he became a French citizen with French and Nigerian passports.</p> <p>The 80s proved to be a difficult period for Allen. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/05/tony-allen-fela-was-right-but-i-detest-singing-militant\" title=\"\">Guardian interview in 2016</a> he described his four-year reliance on heroin. But by the 90s his life had dramatically changed for the better. Afrobeat had acquired a global popularity, and after <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-fela-kuti-1243789.html\" title=\"\">Fela\u2019s death in 1997</a> Allen was seen as the music\u2019s torchbearer, just as he was demonstrating his enthusiasm for embracing new styles.</p> <p>His 1999 album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj6eA9fnvCM\" title=\"\">Black Voices</a>, produced by the <a href=\"https://www.factmag.com/2015/06/08/mbongwana-star-interview-doctor-l-afrobeat-appropriation/\" title=\"\">DJ Doctor L</a>, mixed Afrobeat with dub and electronica, and helped Allen win over a new young following. He was helped by Albarn, who sang \u201cTony Allen ... really got me dancing\u201d, on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49FeYz2JpHo\" title=\"\">the 2000 Blur hit Music Is My Radar</a>. Allen returned the compliment when he invited Albarn (along with the rapper Ty) to appear on his album Home Cooking (2002).</p> <p>Allen continued to collaborate with Albarn for the rest of his life. In 2006 he joined Albarn in The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen, the band that also included Paul Simonon of the Clash, and played on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jan/19/popandrock\" title=\"\">their eponymous debut album</a> (2007) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/16/the-good-the-bad-and-the-queen-merrie-land-review\" title=\"\">Merrie Land</a> (2018).</p> <p>When in 2007 Albarn launched his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/26/worldmusic.glastonbury2007\" title=\"\">Africa Express project</a>, bringing western and African musicians together to play at Glastonbury, Allen transformed the show, forcing the DJ Fatboy Slim to make one of his shortest appearances. When he began playing a Fela track, Allen joined in, playing live, joined by Albarn, Baaba Maal and others and the set was transformed into a glorious jam session.</p> <p>The following year Africa Express were in Lagos, where Allen played with Fela\u2019s son Femi, along with Albarn and Flea from Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and in 2012 he was part of the Africa Express team that travelled around Britain by train, performing along the route.</p> <p>He was always keen to experiment and collaborate, recording with both veteran musicians and those just starting out in Nigeria on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jan/22/shopping\" title=\"\">Lagos No Shaking</a> (2006), or exploring his early jazz influences with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/18/tony-allen-a-tribute-to-art-blakey-and-the-jazz-messengers-review\" title=\"\">Tribute to Art Blakey</a> (2017), His collaborations included work with Grace Jones, Charlotte Gainsbourg and the French trio The JazzBastards.</p> <p>After finishing his tour promoting Rejoice, he had planned to record with young musicians in Nigeria, Paris, London and the US \u201cbecause I want to take care of youngsters \u2013 they have messages and I want to bring them on my beat\u201d.</p> <p>And there were to be more recordings with Albarn. While he was in London in March Allen played on a new song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiWduWEtma4\" title=\"\">How Far?, by Albarn\u2019s band Gorillaz</a>, which has been released as a tribute. Albarn recalled Allen as having \u201cmagic in his feet and hands, joy in his heart, and genius in his mind\u201d.</p> <p>In 1987 Allen married his second wife, Sylvie Nicollet. She survives him along with their three sons, and four children from his first marriage. </p> <p>\u2022 Tony Oladipo Allen, drummer and composer, born 12 August 1940; died 30 April 2020</p>",
  "<p>In a world where the boundary between mixtapes and albums is becoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2017/mar/20/drake-more-life-mixtape-album-playlist-soundtrack\">ever</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2017/mar/20/drake-more-life-mixtape-album-playlist-soundtrack\"> more blurred</a>, the title of Drake\u2019s latest album highlights its interstitial nature. That said, it\u2019s still slightly misleading. There are tracks here that sound like demos \u2013 the mopey James Blake-isms of Chicago Freestyle are audibly unpolished \u2013 but for the most part, it \u2019s a way of collecting up leftovers and leaks, spare tracks he apparently has lying around the studio.</p> <p>Those inclined to view Drake\u2019s career with a cool eye might be surprised he has any spare tracks lying around the studio, given the state of his last album. Listening to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/29/drake-scorpion-review\">Scorpion</a>, 25 songs long, required a certain degree of mental stamina: you needed to steel yourself against the panicky sensation that you might die of old age before it ended. But it wasn\u2019t the sheer quantity that was the problem so much as the quality of what was there. Scorpion had its moments but was so hopelessly uneven that it was easy to buy into the theory that its length was not due to its author\u2019s teeming multiplicity of fantastic ideas, but an attempt to game the streaming services: more songs means more streams, more streams means a higher chart placing.</p> <p>Scorpion was both the second best-selling album of 2018 and the worst-reviewed album of Drake\u2019s career, which leaves him in an intriguing position. Do you listen to the critics and pull your artistic socks up a bit? Or do you file them away in your ever-growing list of haters and continue raking in the cash by manipulating the means by which music is now distributed?</p> <p>The hit single from Dark Lane Demos suggests Drake thought the answer was a no-brainer. Toosie Slide wasn\u2019t really a song, just a bald attempt to incite a dance craze on TikTok: a load of noncommittal meandering attached to instructions on how to do the titular move. On one level, you can\u2019t blame artists for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/03/do-something-weird-that-works-on-tiktok-how-to-write-a-pop-smash-in-2020\">responding to market forces</a> \u2013 TikTok exposure helped make hits out of Lizzo\u2019s Truth Hurts and Lil Nas X\u2019s Old Town Road \u2013 and Drake, to his immense credit, sang the whole thing with a tone of bored disdain, as if he found it all a little demeaning. He\u2019s right: it is. Coming hot on the heels of Justin Bieber\u2019s similarly meme-focussed Yummy, it feels like a harbinger of a nightmarish new pop era in which every major artist feels obliged to reduce themselves to the level of a children\u2019s party DJ and trail their album with some ghastly millennial equivalent of the Birdie Dance or Agadoo.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWggTb45brM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xWggTb45brM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Thankfully, Toosie Slide isn\u2019t the whole story. The stuff Drake has fished out of his waste bin is occasionally fantastic (the Southside-produced D4L booms along with guests Future and Young Thug doing most of the lyrical heavy lifting; Demons is bracingly raw) and occasionally fascinating, not least the closing War, which not only features British drill producer AXL Beats but contains the diverting sound of longtime UK rap supporter Drake going fully native: it\u2019s all \u201cmandem\u201d this and \u201cends\u201d that. It\u2019s also occasionally hugely irritating, as on Pain 1993, which features Playboi Carti whose \u201cbaby voice\u201d is a striking gimmick, but a little of it goes a very long way and there\u2019s an awful lot of it here.</p> <p>Most of Dark Lane Demo Tapes, though, sits somewhere in between. Musically, it largely sticks with opaque washes of synths and muffled loops. Sometimes it sounds atmospheric \u2013 on From Florida With Love, producer MexikoDro constructs a spectral, impressively abstract backing track out of tape hiss and distortion \u2013 but a lot of the time it just sounds like a noncommittal shrug: tracks come and go without leaving much of a sonic impression. That leaves the listener concentrating on Drake\u2019s lyrics, which is seldom one of life\u2019s more encouraging experiences. You know what to expect, and you duly get it: anyone in the market for a game of Drake bingo should have their dobber out midway through opener Deep Pockets \u2013 on which we find him \u201closin\u2019 sleep dealin\u2019 with the envy\u201d \u2013 and find themselves shouting \u201chouse\u201d around the time of Desires, where yet again one of his relationships has gone up the wazoo because, you guessed it: \u201cI was too good to you.\u201d</p> <p>To complain about a rapper bragging about being rich feels a bit like complaining about a Highland dancer wearing a kilt. But there\u2019s something about Drake\u2019s continued willingness to juxtapose his crowing with peevish whinging that feels particularly offputting at this precise moment.</p> <p>Drake conjures a grim universe of self-justification and blame-apportioning, where blustering expressions of his eminence, wealth and superior understanding live alongside bursts of wounded anger that nobody displays sufficient gratitude or respect for his greatness, and a deathless conviction that half the world is ranged in a vast conspiracy to spread lies about him while he alone remains a source of truth and honesty. Listening to Dark Lane Demo Tapes occasionally feels like listening to one of Donald Trump\u2019s daily coronavirus briefings put through AutoTune, a very odd way to spend your lockdown.</p> <p>Of course, Dark Lane Demo Tapes is a stopgap measure. It may be that his forthcoming album proper sees him moving away from the drizzly electronic haze and adopting a different lyrical stance. Then again, why should he? People are still lapping it up: on release, Dark Lane Demo Tapes\u2019 contents immediately dominated global streaming charts. And Drake seems to inhabit a world where commercial success trumps everything. That it isn\u2019t always an indicator of quality appears to be passing him by.</p>",

It is extremely unfair because we\u2019re paying taxes and national insurance, and being told: if you\u2019re to access the services of this wonderful organisation that you\u2019re contributing so much to, you will have to pay a surcharge. It feels very ungrateful to us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s shadow immigration minister, Holly Lynch, welcomed the extension of visas for some frontline workers, but added: \u201cThe government also needs to think again about whether the NHS surcharge paid by migrants to the UK, and working in the NHS, and other essential sectors, is fair.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kimesha from Jamacia, a domiciliary carer for older people who asked to withhold her full name to avoid complications with her employer, said she found the surcharge hard to afford on her hourly rate of \u00a39, which is 18p above the minimum wage.</p> \n<p>She has taken a second job in the evenings as a waitress, in order to pay the cost of renewing visas and paying the surcharge for herself and her three children. She has had to buy masks and gloves on eBay because the protective equipment provided by her employers has run out.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is very stressful because it keeps going up.

At a time when our skilled international colleagues are in many cases putting their lives on the line to fight Covid-19 on the frontline, it beggars belief that they are still being charged to use the very service they are working for.\u201d</p> \n<p>Campaigners point out that many of those paying the surcharge are also on conditional work visas, that say they have \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d, meaning they are not eligible for universal credit if they lose their jobs, and risk losing their visas if they become unemployed. This makes them less willing than UK residents to complain about working with poor protective equipment, and may help explain the disproportionately high fatality rate among BAME workers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-key-workers</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cMigrants are made more vulnerable to exploitation by the immigration system. The NHS disproportionately relies on the labour of migrants who have already paid twice to keep it running, but who are denied access to public funds if they lose their job and face having to leave the country. It is no surprise if they feel huge pressure to stay, uncomplaining, on the frontlines of the fight against Covid, even if they feel unsafe, because they cannot risk speaking out,\u201d said Chai Patel, the legal policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants.</p> \n<p>Susan Cueva, a trustee of Kanlungan Filipino Consortium, which campaigns for migrant rights, said many international healthcare workers were afraid of losing their jobs and being sent back home. \u201cSo they keep on working, knowing they are risking their lives.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>So you have failed to read Proust. Or anything really. And you haven\u2019t learned the piano.

But you feel empty, ratty, unfulfilled, helpless. Mostly helpless.</p> \n<p>It could be because you are literally not helping. Lockdown has been all about you and yours, shutting yourselves in, hunkering down and protecting yourselves. But looking outwards, towards helping others, doesn\u2019t just help them, it can help you, too. What is known in the business as win-win. <a href=\"https://www.stephengpost.com/downloads/Rx%20Its%20Good%20to%20be%20Good%202017.pdf\">A study at Stony Brook University</a> in New York after the 2008 financial crisis found that volunteering had psychological rewards; the majority of people who did so were happier and better able to deal with disappointment and loss.</p> \n<p>Rebecca Kennelly, the director of volunteering at the <a href=\"https://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/\">Royal Voluntary Service</a>, which is behind the NHS Volunteer Responders scheme, goes along with that. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful experience. That sense of giving yourself to a common purpose is phenomenal. But also the acknowledgement, when you do a \u2018check-in-and-chat\u2019 call [phone support to people at risk of loneliness], or you drop somebody\u2019s shopping off \u2013 the knowledge that you\u2019ve made a real difference to a person\u2019s life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sabrina Ellis in Wolverhampton is a check-in-and-chat responder on the scheme. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m helping people, without being an NHS frontline staff member,\u201d she says. It is \u201calmost like being in the shadows, supporting those other services\u201d. </p> \n<p>Here are a few ways to lend a hand.</p> \n<h2><strong>NHS Volunteer Responders</strong></h2> \n<p>When the scheme was launched on 25 March, the target of 250,000 volunteers was quickly passed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/ill-do-anything-coronavirus-volunteers-sign-up-to-help-nhs\">Then doubled, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/ill-do-anything-coronavirus-volunteers-sign-up-to-help-nhs\">then tripled.</a> \u201cI was incredibly humbled by the response, but I wasn\u2019t surprised; this country loves the NHS,\u201d says Kennelly.</p> \n<p>At 750,000, it stopped recruiting new volunteers, as there were many more than were needed for the tasks available (as of last Friday, 50,000 tasks had been completed). Keep an eye on it, though, as the situation develops. \u201cNew roles, or particular areas, might open,\u201d says Kennelly.</p> \n<h2><strong>Help yourself</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/#_ga=2.83406102.1087958294.1587976952-1825737067.1587976952\">NHS Responders</a> has also launched a <a href=\"https://volunteering.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/nhs-volunteer-responders-portal/isolating\">self-referral number</a>, which allows anyone shielding to ask for help. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t underestimate the depth of loneliness and isolation people are feeling,\u201d says Kennelly. \u201cPeople might feel it\u2019s a bit luxurious to ask someone to call them. We\u2019ve got thousands of people ready to do check-in-and-chat calls. It\u2019s not luxurious; these are unprecedented times.\u201d The number to call is 0808 196 3646.</p> \n<p>If you are lucky \u2013 and you are in Wolverhampton \u2013 you might get Ellis. \u201cI have got such a strong passion for supporting any individual in need,\u201d she says. I am pretty sure she is good at it. I feel better after speaking to her and I only rang to interview her.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8e0219f0-48d7-4693-b34e-f278c20f9005\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nu81GG9d29o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Help others to help themselves</strong></h2> \n<p>Tell people \u2013 your older neighbour, maybe \u2013 about self-referral.

Think of the people who may not know about it, or be up to speed with tech. \u201cAnybody who might need support,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be all of us at some point.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Make your own check-in-and-chat calls \u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>\u2026 even if you are not part of the official army. You are doing it already, obviously, for parents and grandparents. You have given Grandad an unscheduled aural inspection. \u201cIT\u2019S FACETIME, GRANDAD, DON\u2019T PUT THE PHONE TO YOUR EAR.\u201d Also, maybe clean them \u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cBe a good neighbour, be a good friend, be a good relative,\u201d says Kennelly. \u201cThose phone calls are moments of magic in somebody\u2019s day.\u201d</p> \n<p>And think beyond your immediate family and friends, to the people who might not be getting daily check-ins.

They discussed \u201capplying the principles of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory)\">Mutual Aid</a> to the situation\u201d, says Kevin Smith, who has been involved from the beginning. \u201cHorizontal principles of solidarity, not a charity model of one group of society helping another.\u201d</p> \n<p>The group put leaflets through doors, asking who needed help and who could help, and started a Facebook page. Then people around the country got interested and involved. <a href=\"https://covidmutualaid.org/\">A website was launched</a>.</p> \n<p>There are now more than 3,500 groups in the country. Smith says the number of people involved is in the millions. People helping others with the shopping, picking up a prescription, walking the dog, advising on renters\u2019 rights, whatever. He tells me about how his group was contacted by the charity Age UK about a strawberry milkshake. A woman who was dying wanted one. Of course, they got her one, a very posh one, delivered. Oh gosh.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s this narrative foregrounded that\u2019s it\u2019s all about self-interest in times of crisis,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThe flipside is that times of crisis also provoke these sentiments of collective care for each other, and that our wellbeing is fundamentally connected to the community as well.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Volunteer at a food bank</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/\">The Trussell Trust</a> supports a nationwide network of more than 1,200 food banks. There are also <a href=\"https://www.foodaidnetwork.org.uk/our-members\">loads of independent ones</a>. Trussell Trust\u2019s director of policy and research, Gary Lemon, says that coronavirus has thrown up new challenges \u201cfrom the health crisis and from the economic crisis and the increased demand for food banks that comes from that\u201d.</p> \n<p>Many older volunteers have had to stay at home. \u201cWe went through a very fraught couple of weeks, with lots of volunteers dropping out of the system,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>He has been moved by the huge response, but there are still opportunities; you can sign up on the website. Yes, there are risks, as there are for any key workers, but \u201cwe do everything we can to minimise them, with the bits of PPE where we can get it and physical distancing\u201d. If you are not high risk, and you want to help, <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-involved/volunteer/\">the Trussell Trust volunteering page</a> is the best place to start.</p> \n<p>They have had to adapt, such as by moving to home delivery, which is a shame, as it means the food bank is not currently a place to come for a non-judgmental chat and a cup of tea. \u201cBut the first thing is the health and safety of the volunteers, and the people who need their services,\u201d says Lemon.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0458a05cca53aa894207b565072ee4911b1dc0ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0458a05cca53aa894207b565072ee4911b1dc0ca/0_0_6405_4270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer collects food donations for NHS staff in Glasgow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A volunteer collects food donations for NHS staff in Glasgow.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Donate food</strong></h2> \n<p>One plea from Lemon: \u201cObviously, we\u2019re very grateful for any non-perishable food we get. But if you <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-involved/ways-to-give/donate-food/\">want to help</a>, find out which sorts of food your local food bank needs, find out what they\u2019re short of, fill those holes.\u201d</p> \n<p>They try to make parcels as nutritionally balanced as possible. Lemon mentions cartons of juice, tins of meat and fish and \u2013 always \u2013 UHT milk. But it will vary from place to place, so find out first. They also take toiletries and hygiene products, such as toothpaste and sanitary towels. Many supermarkets have collection points where you can leave stuff. Online supermarkets have ways of donating when you check out.</p> \n<h2><strong>Can you sew?</strong></h2> \n<p>Annabel Maguire can. She is a set designer, but there is not much need for that at the moment. She wasn\u2019t busy when, a few weeks ago, a doctor in her local Mutual Aid WhatsApp group who couldn\u2019t get scrubs anywhere asked if anyone could make some.</p> \n<p>Maguire and three others in the group \u2013 a pattern cutter in the fashion industry, a charity worker, another with a textile shop \u2013 were quickly on to it. \u201cI guess I had felt \u2026 not useless, but what could I even do with my time now; can I help in any way?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I did actually have some skills that could help, and we quickly realised that between us we did have the perfect skills to help.\u201d</p> \n<p>They figured out how it could be done, a production line, but in different spaces without contact. And so <a href=\"https://scrubhub.org.uk/\">Scrub Hub</a> was born.</p> \n<p>At the time of speaking, there are 128 hubs across the UK with 1,766 volunteers who have delivered almost 3,500 scrubs. On the website, there is a directory of all the hubs. New ones are still being set up; get involved. You need to know what you are doing, have experience of sewing garments, know what \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlock\">overlocking</a>\u201d is. Maguire and her team were not happy when the Sun described them as a bunch of amateurs. They are proud of their scrubs.</p> \n<h2><strong>You can\u2019t sew?</strong></h2> \n<p>What can you do? Maguire and Ellis found meaning, purpose and structure by utilising their skills. \u201cIt sounds cliched, but I asked how I could help people,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cI look for where the gap is that people are trying to fill.\u201d</p> \n<p>What gaps might you be able to fill? What are your skills? There are organisations such as <a href=\"https://volunteeringmatters.org.uk/want-to-volunteer/\">Volunteering Matters</a> and <a href=\"https://do-it.org/\">Do It</a> that can connect you with charities. <a href=\"https://reachvolunteering.org.uk/\">Reach Volunteering</a> matches people with specialist professional skills. On my local <a href=\"https://nextdoor.com/\">Nextdoor</a> page, in Brent (which has a high mortality rate), an overwhelmed carpenter is looking for help making coffins. That might be too grim.</p> \n<h2><strong>Or just give them your </strong><strong>money</strong></h2> \n<p>Maybe you have no useful skills. Or you still have an actual job, no time, but possibly a bit of spare change? Don\u2019t forget charities. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/charities-face-cash-crisis-as-virus-fears-hit-fundraising\">They are suffering badly</a>, because of event cancellations and shop closures. They may not want your \u201cvintage\u201d clothes at the moment, or your CDs, but they desperately need funds.</p> \n<p>Obviously, there are far too many charities to list. You may know who you want to donate to, but don\u2019t forget about the new homeless, people who have lost jobs, the hospitality industry, the arts.<em> </em>One way to ensure it is going to the frontline is by donating to <a href=\"https://nationalemergenciestrust.org.uk/coronavirus/\">National Emergencies Trust</a>, which is coordinating the UK coronavirus appeal.</p> \n<p>Do something, though. Forget Proust; you are never going to read him. The sourdough is a disaster; no one likes it. Get up, look out, help others. Help yourself. Help.</p>",
  "<p>Pandemics force societies to take a hard look at themselves. With many countries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/france-italy-spain-prepare-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdowns\">beginning to lift lockdown</a>, we\u2019ve arrived at another one of those mirror moments: whether we experience a second wave of coronavirus infections depends in large part on the health status of some of the most vulnerable groups in society.</p> <p>In deciding whether or not to lift lockdown, the first and most important question a government has to answer is whether the rate of new infections is slowing \u2013 and doing so in a sustained way. The critical determinant here is the <a href=\"https://www.healthknowledge.org.uk/public-health-textbook/research-methods/1a-epidemiology/epidemic-theory\">basic reproduction number</a>, R0, which is the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to in a population where everyone is susceptible. If R0 is above one, the epidemic is growing, and if it\u2019s below one, it\u2019s shrinking.</p> <p>In the UK, the lockdown has brought R0 down significantly \u2013 possibly even to below one. But modellers can\u2019t be sure about that, because the number of new Covid-19 cases is still climbing \u2013 suggesting either that there has been a delay in the reporting of those cases or that the UK epidemic is in fact still growing. \u201cI am not sure of the exact value of R0 at the moment in the UK,\u201d Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, a modeller at University College London, told me on 27 April.</p> <p>Even if the modellers knew what the UK\u2019s R0 was the number is just an indicator. How well it reflects reality depends on how well you\u2019re sampling your population for the virus and how reliable your tests are. More importantly, perhaps, the R0 is an average. It tells you nothing about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/01/uk-coronavirus-live-job-cuts-end-lockdown-politics-covid-19-latest-updates\">variability across a population</a>, and critically, it\u2019s silent about pockets of high disease prevalence in that population. If there are places where Covid-19 is spreading fast then once the lockdown is lifted \u2013 even a little \u2013 it could roar back out of those places, seeding a second wave in a still-susceptible population before a vaccine becomes available.</p> <p>We know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/the-guardian-view-on-covid-19-and-care-homes-promises-are-not-enough\">care homes for</a> older people represent such a pocket, but others could include prisons, where there is no alternative to confinement; and Europe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/migrant-workers-bear-brunt-of-coronavirus-pandemic-in-gulf\">migrant camps</a>, whose inhabitants in many cases suffer the worst of both worlds \u2013 less than optimal shelter, and restrictions on their movement.</p> <p>If the conditions in which these and other vulnerable groups, such as homeless people, live make it difficult or even impossible for them to avoid infection \u2013 and to get appropriate medical care when sick \u2013 then they will suffer; but so, potentially, will the rest of us.</p> <p>Winston Churchill observed that a society\u2019s attitude to those who commit crimes is the measure of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/blog/winston-churchill-prisoners-friend/\">the stored-up strength of a nation</a>\u201d. A pandemic has the potential to turn that message on its head: a society\u2019s attitude to its prisoners \u2013 and homeless people, and asylum seekers \u2013 is a measure of its stored-up weaknesses.</p> <p>A growing number of prisoners<strong> </strong>are older people \u2013 a trend that has tracked the ageing of the general population \u2013 and older people<strong> </strong>are, of course, at heightened risk of contracting Covid-19. But prisons are also often overcrowded, making isolation, quarantine and social distancing difficult to implement.</p> <p>Both inmates and prison personnel are understandably afraid of the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/prisons-could-see-800-deaths-from-coronavirus-without-protective-measures\">infection penetrating their facilities</a> \u2013 especially if the former feel they have been placed in danger through practices such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/uk-prisoners-covid-19-symptoms-forced-share-cells\">cohorting</a>, where prisoners with coronavirus-like symptoms (but who haven\u2019t been tested) are made to share cells with others who have tested positive for Covid-19. Several countries have already had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/colombian-prison-riot-over-coronavirus-fears-kills-23\">riots in prisons and escapes</a> during this pandemic.</p> <p>The crowded and unsanitary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/21/fears-catastrophe-greece-migrant-camps-lockdown-coronavirus\">migrant camps in Greece</a>, meanwhile, could be Europe\u2019s achilles heel. Greece has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/how-greece-is-beating-coronavirus-despite-a-decade-of-debt\">controlled </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/how-greece-is-beating-coronavirus-despite-a-decade-of-debt\"> the outbreak</a> efficiently to date, mainly thanks to its government\u2019s quick response. It was already blitzing its population with Covid-19-related public-health messages in January \u2013 before Europe recorded its first case of the disease. It reacted to its own first cases with intensive contact-tracing and testing, and used the time this bought to build hospital and lab-testing capacity.</p> <p>But migrant camps in Greece recorded a spike in cases days before the government planned to ease lockdown restrictions. And though the government has said it intends to integrate the camps into its national Covid-19 strategy, it has yet to be properly implemented there.</p> <p>Globally, the approach to homeless people has varied widely. In the US, California moved quickly to house its homeless population in vacant hotel rooms \u2013 a plan the UK and France have been implementing too \u2013 while in Las Vegas, white rectangles were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/las-vegas-parking-lot-homeless-shelter\">painted on a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/las-vegas-parking-lot-homeless-shelter\">car park</a>, apparently as a guide to hunkering down in a socially distanced way (the city has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/las-vegas-homeless-coronavirus-parking-lot-center\">erected temporary isolation units</a> in the same car park).</p> <p>Attempts to model the <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/COVID19_homeless_modelling%20(1)%20(1).pdf\"> </a>pandemic in England\u2019s homeless population <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/COVID19_homeless_modelling%20(1)%20(1).pdf\"> </a>have suggested that, without any intervention, up to three-quarters of them could become infected. Those who fall sick may need medical care, but we don\u2019t yet know what proportion of any population becomes infected without experiencing symptoms. Very approximately, since exact numbers of homeless people are hard to come by, thousands of people sleeping rough in England could be unaware they are infected \u2013 and infectious. That\u2019s not so much a pocket as a seam.</p> <p>As in so many other areas of life, the pandemic is prompting action on social problems where there was inertia before. It would be naive to assume any temporary solutions will be extended beyond the end of this crisis, but they may at least stimulate debate about what should be put in their place. Protecting these vulnerable populations only when doing so protects the rest of us can\u2019t fit many people\u2019s definition of a civilised society.</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author</p> <p><br></p>",

Major top-down reforms in 2012 transferred responsibility for public health outside of the NHS, making it the direct remit of local authorities.

For the last decade, the NHS has been described simultaneously as a beloved institution and a burdensome expense on the public purse. However, relative to other wealthy, western nations our healthcare spend is frugal. In 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/articles/howdoesukhealthcarespendingcomparewithothercountries/2019-08-29#how-does-health-spending-as-a-share-of-gdp-in-the-uk-compare-with-other-g7-countries\">UK spent 9.6% of GDP on healthcare</a>, compared to 11.3% in France and 17.1% in the US.</p> <p>Incredible but necessary economic interventions by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have shaken the dominant narrative on public spending. The lesson the public is learning in real time is that money can be made available when it\u2019s deemed to be important, and so the UK can continue to afford high-quality universal healthcare.</p> <p>Finally, Covid-19 has focused our minds on the most important principle in health: prevention. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-testing-how-some-countries-germany-south-korea-got-ahead-of-the-rest\">Prevention is vital in a pandemic</a> and in healthcare more broadly.

  "<p>One day in the autumn of 2015, a small but significant change was implemented at the Instagram offices in Menlo Park, California. Employees arrived at work to discover the rubbish bins under each desk had disappeared. The bins had allowed people to work efficiently \u2013 no one had to stand up to throw away a coconut water carton or wasabi pea wrapper after they\u2019d enjoyed the company\u2019s free food. But the bins weren\u2019t really Instagram\u2019s \u2013 they were installed by Facebook, which had purchased the photo-sharing app for $1bn in 2012.</p> <p>Kevin Systrom, Instagram\u2019s co-founder, didn\u2019t like the bins. He didn\u2019t like the cardboard boxes employees used to file papers and paraphernalia. He hated old, sagging birthday balloons. Instagram\u2019s offices, he explained, after removing the bins, should represent its ethos. They should be beautiful, simple, pristine \u2013 much like the app itself.</p> <p>Tech reporter Sarah Frier, author of <em>No Filter: The Inside Story of How Instagram Transformed Business, Celebrity and Our Cultur</em>e, explains this story is significant for three reasons. First, it demonstrates Systrom\u2019s aesthetic sensibilities. Second, it is indicative of his frustration with Facebook. (A year earlier he had torn down motivational posters belonging to the parent company, one of which said: \u201cDone is Better than Perfect.\u201d) And third, while the incident obviously affected Instagram employees \u2013 they dubbed it #trashcangate \u2013 it also represented an issue facing its users, who were, Frier says, \u201cintimidated about posting because they thought Instagram warranted perfection\u201d.</p> <p>In the decade since the invention of Instagram, social media has dramatically changed our lives. This pursuit of perfection has led to a rise in filter-inspired plastic surgery and a boom in oversized desserts that don\u2019t fit in your mouth, but fit perfectly into a little square posted online. How did this simple photo-sharing service get 1bn users in eight years? Does Instagram create or reflect our values? And, if the former, shouldn\u2019t we know a little more about the mindset and motivations of the men behind the app?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd3f189c07edf1d670c0f4961cf6d91dc86707fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd3f189c07edf1d670c0f4961cf6d91dc86707fa/0_0_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Systrom, chief executive and co-founder of Instagram, who says he has no interest in leaving Instagram to run Twitter, despite the hopes of some on Wall Street that he would consider the job, in Menlo Park, Calif., June 22, 2015.

Frier interviewed a different person each day for a year after getting the book deal in 2018. Many spoke without Facebook\u2019s permission, and the majority of her sources remain anonymous. \u201cI realised that there was so much uncharted territory,\u201d she says. \u201cMy editor told me a book is ready to be written when you have 100 things in your pocket that nobody else has published.\u201d Frier surpassed this benchmark.</p> <p>One anecdote recalls Systrom saving actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ashton-kutcher\" title=\"\">Ashton Kutcher</a> from a 4am fire in a log cabin. In return, Kutcher helped Instagram grow credibility with celebs. (He hosted a party to introduce Systrom to superstars like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande\" title=\"\">Ariana Grande</a>, who the Instagram CEO didn\u2019t recognise.) Then there\u2019s the time the Instagram team celebrated the sale to Facebook with an all-expenses trip to the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, where they were greeted with personal congratulatory notes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ivanka-trump\" title=\"\">Ivanka Trump</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>But gossip isn\u2019t</strong></em> at the heart of Frier\u2019s book and it\u2019s the mundane stories about Systrom that are most revealing. A Stanford alumnus who, at 25, worked in marketing at Google, he founded his company with software engineer and friend Mike Krieger in 2009. His original idea was a website called Burbn, which showed people where their friends were partying in real time. The name was inspired by Systrom\u2019s love of the whiskey. Throughout the book, Frier reveals his passion for prestige. Systrom enjoys fine drinks and bespoke bicycles \u2013 he snubbed Facebook\u2019s free coffee by importing beans that he only used at their \u201cpeak point\u201d (four days after roasting).</p> <p>\u201cI think that products are ultimately a reflection of their leaders,\u201d Frier says. \u201cHe wants everything to be at a level of quality because he believes in that quality.\u201d Systrom turned Burbn into Instagram when he realised there was a gap in the market for an app that helped people quickly share pictures from phones. But there was another problem he hoped to solve: back then, phone cameras were shoddy and took unattractive pictures. When Instagram launched, it offered filters that people could use to make their photos \u2013 and by extension, their lives \u2013 look more appealing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"388700ca289dc6b3c4f6b7bfee70ad3b7af30fa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/388700ca289dc6b3c4f6b7bfee70ad3b7af30fa6/0_559_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zuckerberg used to end every staff meeting by shouting: \u2018Domination!\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zuckerberg used to end every staff meeting by shouting: \u2018Domination!\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Chou/The New York Times/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the outset, his demand for quality shifted our reality. \u201cA filter on Instagram was like if Twitter had a button to make you more clever,\u201d Frier says. Instagram was heavily curated in its early days. Because there are no mechanisms to go viral on the app (users can\u2019t share posts), Instagram employees manually chose photos to push on its \u201cPopular\u201d page. \u201cInstagram had a hand in it in a way none of us on the outside would ever necessarily realise,\u201d Frier says.</p> <p>For example, in 2013, one Instagram employee dedicated his time to \u201cdiscovering pets\u201d. He tracked adorable dogs, birds and lizards in a spreadsheet before highlighting them on the official <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/instagram/\" title=\"\">@instagram</a> page. Frier chronicles how these decisions changed real lives. Courtney Dasher, for example, was a dog owner with a cute-looking pet named <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tunameltsmyheart/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Tuna</a>. She quit her job and earned money via Instagram thanks to the decision of that employee. Dasher tells Frier that pictures of her dog helped fans cope with anxiety and depression. \u201cThe tastes of one Instagram employee directly affected the habits of the 2m people who now follow that dog,\u201d Frier says.</p> <p>How else have we been influenced by Instagram? Frier\u2019s examples range from how we organise bookshelves by cover colour to how once rarely visited tourist destinations are now trampled underfoot. \u201cBy constantly serving users images of visually appealing lives and hobbies,\u201d she says, Instagram forced people to \u201cmake their lives more worthy of posting about.\u201d She notes how leisure time became a status symbol \u2013 how Instagram gradually affected the economy, as people began to value experiences over things. More of us now \u201cpursue vacations in more picturesque settings,\u201d Frier says, in part because pictures taken in those locations look great on the \u2019gram. (She links the app with nine major retailers filing for bankruptcy in the US in 2017).</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just our lives that have to look interesting on Instagram \u2013 our faces do, too. Photo-editing apps, like Facetune, have boomed in popularity. Teens slim their noses, enhance their waists and hide their spots with the help of digital editing tools. One plastic surgeon told Frier that his clients now seek impossible-to-achieve adjustments inspired by the app. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kimkardashian/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Kim Kardashian,</a> owner of the seventh most popular Instagram account (and a famously large behind) can arguably be linked to the 20,000 people in the US who had a Brazilian bum lift in 2017.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t something Systrom actually wanted. Frier says that selfies and bikini shots were against the CEO\u2019s \u201cartistic sensibilities\u201d. These posts became popular despite the fact they were ignored by the official @instagram account. Yet Frier says that Instagram incentivised selfies and surgery through its metrics, if not its values. The choice to display numbers of followers and likes turned the app \u201cinto a game one could win\u201d. In 2017 a study by the <a href=\"https://www.rsph.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Society for Public Health</a> found that Instagram was the worst app for teens\u2019 mental health. Was this an inevitable outcome?</p> <p>Frier starts her final chapter with a quote from an anonymous Instagram executive: \u201cEverything breaks at a billion.\u201d Instagram reached 1bn active monthly users for the first time in June 2018. \u201cI think at a certain point you lose control of something when it gets that big,\u201d she says, noting that 6m accounts on Instagram now have over 1m followers. \u201cThey wanted to build a better community, but they just didn\u2019t have the resources to do that, which is such a silly thing to say about a product that is part of a gigantic, well-sourced company, like Facebook.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> bought </strong></em>Instagram in April 2012, when the app had just 13 employees and hadn\u2019t made a single penny in profit. Zuckerberg declined to be interviewed for Frier\u2019s book, sending over a single emailed quote via a PR person. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d he wrote, when asked why he both purchased Instagram and committed to keeping the company independent, \u201cit was a great service and we wanted to help it grow.\u201d Despite the fact he refused to take part in Frier\u2019s reporting, <em>No Filter</em> is as much about Zuckerberg and Facebook as it is about Systrom and Instagram. (The word \u201cFacebook\u201d appears 1,179 times in the book, while \u201cInstagram\u201d appears 1,673.)</p> <p>\u201cA lot of times we think when a company has been acquired that their business story is over,\u201d Frier says. She argues this isn\u2019t the case here. The book chronicles the power struggles between Systrom and Zuckerberg. Frier believes Zuckerberg acquired Instagram due to his paranoia about competition. Consequently, Zuckerberg occasionally held Instagram back \u2013 after it reached 1bn users, the Facebook founder deleted a feature that automatically linked Facebook users to their friends\u2019 Instagram pages. He also prevented the company from hiring more staff and prioritised Facebook\u2019s content moderation over Instagram\u2019s. Ineffective moderation allowed troubling practices \u2013 such as the sale of opioids and the proliferation of self-harm \u2013 to flourish on Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fd92787cb3a1ed70026eb181ee1481b75af435e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fd92787cb3a1ed70026eb181ee1481b75af435e/0_180_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram\u2019s founders, Kevin Systrom, left, and Mike Krieger, at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Get the \u2019gram: Kevin Systrom with co-founder Mike Krieger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christie Hemm Klok/New York Times/Redux/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For every banal coffee bean anecdote about Systrom, there is a story that makes Zuckerberg look equally weird. In 2012, on the night the Instagram deal was finalised, the Facebook founder\u2019s sheepdog, Beast, bit the leg of Facebook deals director Amin Zoufonoun. He later joked that Zuckerberg showed more concern for the dog than the man. On a separate occasion, Zuckerberg lost a game of Scrabble to a teenager on a corporate jet and \u201cwas so frustrated he built a computer program to find him all the word options for his letters\u201d. He ended every staff meeting by shouting: \u201cDomination!\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Both men</strong></em><em><strong> have</strong></em> had a profound impact on our lives and yet when we criticise Instagram, we often criticise women. Articles condemning beautiful influencers for earning millions on Instagram are viral fodder. \u201cThose stories take the airwaves and we don\u2019t think, \u2018How did we end up valuing this?\u2019\u201d Frier says. Though influencers are often denounced for not disclosing when they\u2019ve been paid to promote a product, Frier traces this issue back to Systrom. The founder was so dedicated to keeping Instagram aesthetically pleasing that he didn\u2019t want ads on the app to look like ads. (Once he even edited a brand\u2019s picture of French fries so they looked less soggy.)</p> <p>While we\u2019re busy criticising influencers, Instagram has also avoided scrutiny in other ways. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/27/mark-zuckerberg-testify-congress-cambridge-analytica-data-scandal\" title=\"\">Zuckerberg was called before Congress in 2018</a> to answer questions about how Facebook allowed user data to be processed by the political firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge-analytica\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica</a>. Much was made of Facebook\u2019s role in helping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> win the 2016 presidential election after Russian troll farms targeted divisive ads at Americans. And yet, six months after Zuckerberg\u2019s hearing, a Senate research group discovered that Russian ads had actually received more likes and comments on Instagram than Facebook. \u201cThe media spent a day writing about it, and then moved on,\u201d Frier says.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy (and perhaps enjoyable) to think that bikini shots and Brazilian bum lifts are Instagram\u2019s biggest impact on society \u2013 the reality is more complex. Because Zuckerberg allowed Instagram to maintain its independence, the app isn\u2019t tainted by Facebook\u2019s scandals. Yet ultimately, Zuckerberg still owns it \u2013 Systrom stepped down as CEO in 2018, partly because of contrasting values, partly because he wanted to return to his \u201ccreative roots\u201d. Now, one man controls Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, a global network of 2.5bn users.</p> <p>What next for Instagram? Frier says the site will continue to face moderation issues as Facebook is prioritised. She also believes advertising on Instagram will increase as Zuckerberg seeks a return on his investment. Frier also notes that the current coronavirus crisis may change the app. While some influencers are seeing their businesses crumble, others are becoming more creative by releasing books, video tutorials, workout classes and even their own filters. These changes might stick once lockdown is over.</p> <p>But is this really revolutionary? \u201cPeople still know the way to win at Instagram is to do something visually arresting,\u201d Frier says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to go away.\u201d From the moment Instagram introduced us to reality-adjusting filters, it changed the way we presented ourselves to the world. A striking observation in <em>No Filter</em> is that Instagram wanted to build a community that valued art and creativity. Instead, \u201cthey built a mall\u201d. While much is made of beautiful influencers flogging diet pills and luxury travel on the app, everyone on Instagram is selling their life in some way.</p> <p><em>No Filter by Sarah Frier is published by Cornerstone at \u00a320.

They focused especially on the confusion and fear in New York City, the US\u2019s Covid-19 center, where black women were <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/ms/pregnancy-associated-mortality-report-2011-2015.pdf\">already nearly eight times</a> more likely than their white counterparts to suffer a pregnancy-related death.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think where these two public health crises intersect is \u2026 they are thriving on the same forms of discrimination</p> <footer> <cite>Pilar Herrero</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think where these two public health crises intersect is that they are impacting the same communities, they are thriving on the same forms of discrimination,\u201d said Pilar Herrero, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. \u201cAnd there are pregnant women of color who \u2026 were already at risk of dying from a preventable maternal death, who now might also be exposed to the Covid-19 infection, or might not get the care that they need because resources have been reallocated.\u201d</p> <p>Mothers are already suffering the consequences. Amber Rose Isaac, a 26-year-old black, Puerto Rican New Yorker, died on 21 April during an emergency C-section. Her platelet counts \u2014 which help blood clot \u2014 had been falling since February, but the condition went largely unmonitored because her doctor\u2019s visits had been replaced with Zoom conference calls.</p> <p>\u201cAll of this was 100% preventable. All of it,\u201d said Bruce McIntyre III, Isaac\u2019s partner. \u201cI feel like she would have got more attentive care if she was a white mother, to be completely honest with you.\u201d</p> <p>Denise Bolds, a doula who <a href=\"https://www.dona.org/what-is-a-doula/\">supports mothers during childbirth</a>, warned that, because hospitals have limited staff and want to cut down exposure to Covid-19, doctors may rush toward operations such as C-sections.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really changing how women are giving birth,\u201d Bolds said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more clinical. It\u2019s becoming more controlled. And women are losing their autonomy.\u201d</p> <p> <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html\">Preliminary evidence suggests</a><strong> </strong>pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of contracting or getting seriously ill from Covid-19. But the virus has created a tremendous sense of uncertainty around pregnancy.</p> <p>It has also overwhelmed medical staff who don\u2019t have enough personal protective equipment (PPE) or testing, \u201cplacing the human rights of health workers and the human rights of pregnant people in tension with one another in ways that really could have been avoided\u201d, Herrero said.</p> <p>\u201cWhere we see discrimination already pre-Covid, now it\u2019s not only strongly enforced but exacerbated,\u201d said Jennie Joseph, a midwife and health advocate in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re stressed already, you\u2019re at your wits\u2019 end, you\u2019re tired out, you\u2019re scared as well. You\u2019re gonna go to your kneejerk, which is you\u2019re gonna think about things in the way that is simplest, quickest, easiest.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s no worldwide consensus around whether women who test positive for coronavirus or show related symptoms can safely touch their newborn and breastfeed directly. So far, the virus hasn\u2019t been found in breastmilk or amniotic fluid, but hospitals are still separating mothers such as Brown from their newborns in case they\u2019re contagious.</p> <p>The World Health Organization has said mothers should be able to hold their babies skin-to-skin, breastfeed with proper hygiene and stay in the same room, regardless of a Covid-19 diagnosis. But the American Academy of Pediatrics <a href=\"https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/faqs-management-of-infants-born-to-covid-19-mothers/\">has recommended </a>temporary separation between mother and baby, or at least maintaining a 6ft distance.</p> <p>\u201cWe really are building this rocket ship while it\u2019s flying,\u201d said Melissa A Simon, a physician and professor at the Northwestern University Feinberg school of medicine. \u201cSo in general, most of us believe we should err on the side of caution and not have that newborn and mom contact when the mom just was diagnosed with Covid.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Christopher Knaus with the latest developments from Sunday 2 May.</p> <h2>Tehan withdraws extraordinary attack on Victorian premier</h2> <p>The education minister, Dan Tehan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/may/03/dan-tehan-tried-to-pressure-victoria-to-reopen-schools-but-he-went-from-raging-bull-to-mewling-kitten\">began the day</a> with a scathing attack on Victorian premier Daniel Andrews over his position on schools.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/Pages/coronavirus-advice-schools.aspx\">state government\u2019s current position is that all students</a> who can learn from home must do so.</p> <p>Tehan alleged on the ABC\u2019s Insiders that Andrews had taken a \u201csledgehammer\u201d to education by resisting wider reopening, and questioned his leadership.</p> <p>The comments represented a significant tonal shift from an otherwise impressive period of bipartisanship, via the Covid-19 national cabinet. The state health minister, Jenny Mikakos, immediately hit back, saying:</p> <p>\u201cI think Victorians understand who\u2019s been leading the effort in Victoria, how to keep them safe, to suppress the number of cases that we\u2019re seeing in Victoria, and that\u2019s certainly not been Dan Tehan.\u201d</p> <p>The state government also revealed on Sunday that a Melbourne primary school teacher had been infected with coronavirus, prompting the closure of the school for three days.</p> <p>Later on Sunday, Tehan issued a statement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/03/federal-education-minister-dan-tehan-says-he-overstepped-the-mark-criticising-victoria-over-schools\">withdrawing his comments</a>, saying he had spoken in frustration at the prospect children would miss their education.</p> <p>\u201cIt was this frustration that led me to overstep the mark in questioning premier Andrew\u2019s leadership on this matter and I withdraw.\u201d</p> <h2>Death toll rises to 95</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s death toll rose to 95 following another death in NSW at the Newmarch House aged care home, and the death of an 83-year-old woman in WA.</p> <p>The death of 76-year-old Ann Fahey at Newmarch is the 14th death connected to the aged care facility since the start of the pandemic. Fahey had previously tested negative to Covid-19 twice before she returned a positive test on Thursday.</p> <p>Her son, Mark Fahey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/02/why-is-it-spreading-sydneys-newmarch-house-aged-care-home-becomes-epicentre-of-covid-19-fight\">told the Guardian earlier this week</a> that his mother had done everything to protect herself.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. She was a model patient, did everything right, she\u2019s shut herself in her room the entire time,\u201d Fahey said.</p> <p>In WA, the state government said the 83-year-old woman who died had contracted Covid-19 from close contact. She was admitted to hospital in mid-April and died on 30 April.</p> <p>WA recorded no new cases overnight, the fourth consecutive day of zero cases. It now has only 19 active cases across the state.</p> <h2>CMO links app downloads to \u2018bold\u2019 easing of restrictions</h2> <p>The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said about one in four Australian adults with a smartphone had downloaded the COVIDSafe App.</p> <p>Uptake of the app has been tempered by concerns about privacy and data security. But Murphy said a greater uptake might help to relieve restrictions sooner.</p> <p>\u201cThe more we have signed up, the more confidence I\u2019ll be able to give national cabinet that they can make a decision,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe more confidence they can have, the more bold they might be.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy also indicated that universities might be able to resume some face-to-face teaching. The sector would be discussed at national cabinet this week, and Murphy said he expected a recommendation to partially reopen some of the more necessary face-to-face functions.</p> <p>\u201cI think universities are clearly in the mix of things that we\u2019re talking about with national cabinet this week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is likely that they will start to recommence some activities, without pre-empting the decision of national cabinet.\u201d</p> <h2>Further cause for optimism as new cases remain low</h2> <p>The positive trend of low rates of new cases continued on Sunday. Only 18 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours. That\u2019s within the government\u2019s current target of 20.</p> <p>In South Australia, the state\u2019s chief medical officer, Nicola Spurrier, said she was hopeful the state could soon be free of Covid-19.</p> <p>SA has had its 11th consecutive day without a new Covid-19 case. There are only seven active cases remaining.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t have any more cases, soon we will be able to say that we have no one with Covid-19 in the state, which will certainly be something to celebrate,\u201d she said.</p> <p>South Australia joined the ACT, Western Australia, and Tasmania in recording no new cases. Queensland recorded a single new case.</p> <h2>NZ warriors arrive in Tamworth</h2> <p>The NRL\u2019s plans to resume competition later this month took another step forward as the New Zealand Warriors flew in to the NSW town of Tamworth. But one player, Nathaniel Roache, was unable to travel as he reported feeling unwell.</p> <h2>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

We are cooking elaborately. I am sewing, patching holes in things. I am writing.</p> <p>I\u2019m also sleeping 11 hours a night, on average. Wait, what? How did that happen? The woman who hasn\u2019t slept more than five hours straight a night for most of the last decade?</p> <p>It took me a while to identify the cause: I have finally gotten over my Fomo, acronym for \u201cfear of missing out\u201d. Fomo haunted my nights for years, a rat in the dark at 2am, scratching up for review all the things I did not do to stay ahead of the game during the day.</p> <p>Now, Fomo, like the handshake, belongs to another age.</p> <p>I realized this a few days ago, while glancing in the mirror at my gray roots and looking down at my unkempt toenails. How swiftly the true body emerges from the polish and preening. At least I am not alone. No one else \u2013 from millionaires to paupers \u2013 is getting shined up or going anywhere. I\u2019m not missing any premieres with movie stars or other Manhattan diversions. I am not going to hear about a dinner party to which I alone was not invited. Nobody\u2019s got good hair right now.</p> <p>The pandemic has exposed how much of our previous lives hung on vanity.</p> <p>Of course we are still playing the old game. Instagramming gourmet food, candlelit dinner tables (I am a bit guilty of this), pets (guilty also), and sharing the more attractive angles of our Isolation Castles. For city people this means their apartments and brownstones, for us lucky enough to have houses in the country, flowers and fields and trees.</p> <p>Fomo still lurks. A woman I follow on Instagram is married to one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. Early in the lockdown, she posted a video of herself in her bathrobe carrying a barista-worthy caffe latte, taking a brisk walk from one end of her California mansion to the other. The video lasted three or four minutes, involved several staircases, football fields of light-filled spaces, glimmers of ultra-modern furniture, breezeways of floor to ceiling glass revealing paradisal gardens. She was perspiring and breathing hard by the end of the video stroll. It was hard work covering all that ground.</p> <p>Lacking the one-percenter concert-hall-size house, the rest of us have wanly stayed <em>au courant</em> by posting pictures from travels past \u2013 selfies from before sheltering in place rendered us gray and flabby, or, as my husband says, before we gained the Covid-19 pounds.</p> <p>Our governor calls this time a \u201cpause\u201d. New York state is \u201con pause\u201d. But how hard it is to pause and do nothing! Once trees and lichens and darning socks and cooking fail to divert, a great darkness waits for our attention.</p> <p>We are being stalked by a virus that attacks our lungs. Practitioners of traditional Chinese acupuncture believe unacknowledged grief sits in the lungs, leaving damage. I\u2019m not going to go all Gwyneth Paltrow, but it does seem reasonable to associate sorrow at least metaphorically with our lungs. Sobbing is, after all, a respiratory action.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen it. My mother, an Iraqi immigrant to the United States, developed pneumonia during the early days of the first Gulf war. She sat for 72 hours watching the bombardment on live TV and never cried. Then her back started to hurt. An X-ray found the shadow.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, I had a bad cough. I didn\u2019t have a fever and it wasn\u2019t a dry cough, so I couldn\u2019t get tested for Covid-19 without a trip to a hospital. On the eighth day of being sick \u2013 a sunny afternoon, forsythia in golden profusion all around us, birds chirping \u2013 I saw a picture of the mass graves being dug in New York and started sobbing. Almost immediately I felt better.</p> <p>I, in my great good fortune, sleep well while our medics work without protective gear. Every hour, every minute, right here and nowhere else, is precious, a new luxury. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world are dying without loved ones nearby. Machines are lowering coffins into trenches in New York City. The list of possible lamentations is long. We could chant all day and night for months, sob loud enough to echo from New York to the monasteries of Tibet. For the dead, the sick, the koalas burned alive in Australia, the planet combusting with fossil fuel \u2026</p> <p>I might never know if I had the virus.

Prose ice queen or deft emotional miniaturist?</p> <p>Perhaps, by now, all Rooney can do is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ\">quote Beyonc\u00e9</a>: \u201cYou know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation.\u201d Now, with this stunning adaptation of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p089g8rs/normal-people\">Normal People</a></strong>, Rooney (who executive-produced, and worked on the script alongside Alice Birch and Mark O\u2019Rowe) gets to pop another feather in her cap.</p> <p>In 12 half-hour parts, directed by Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie Macdonald, the series (released as a boxset on iPlayer) comprised the slow, bumpy unfolding of the love story, from school to young adulthood, between privileged, intellectual outsider Marianne, with her poisonous homelife (a revelatory Daisy Edgar-Jones from <em>Cold Feet</em>), and jock-with-hinterland Connell (Paul Mescal, making a dazzling TV debut).</p> <p>Early scenes in County Sligo capture the suffocating aspects of small-town life, with Sarah Greene superb as Connell\u2019s mum (who is Marianne\u2019s mother\u2019s cleaner). While Connell at first hides his sexual relationship with Marianne from friends (Marianne\u2019s pitiful acquiescence reeking of deep damage), the tables turn as he struggles and she thrives at Trinity College Dublin.</p> <p>Some elements jarred. Marianne\u2019s supposed transformation from Plain Jane to University Goddess was hampered by Edgar-Jones\u2019s obvious gorgeousness. Marianne\u2019s sexual masochism (hands tied half-heartedly with a scarf) was less than convincing. Elsewhere, elements of Connell\u2019s working-class background felt more boxticked than credible, while Marianne\u2019s absurdly luxuriant Trinity lifestyle made you question how she ended up going to the same school as Connell.</p> <p>Nevertheless, <em>Normal People</em> emerged as a naturalistic masterclass in emotional depth and cerebral elegance. While there were too many overextended sex scenes, they were true to the book, and, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/12/the-stakes-were-really-high-bringing-sally-rooney-normal-people-to-tv\">with an intimacy coordinator on board</a>, both respectful and realistic.</p> <p>Moreover, the leads were heart-stopping. In their hands, you believed in Marianne and Connell\u2019s on-off bond, but also how that gravitational pull wrecked their other (good and bad) relationships. You were convinced by their myriad problems, from the dark (Connell\u2019s refusal to hit Marianne in bed), to the mundane mix-up over him leaving Dublin. Just as with the book, this was a story about barriers (class, social, emotional, intellectual, sexual), and how young love batters itself like a trapped bird against them. It was also about how sometimes people arrive to relationships broken, and then stay broken, and that just has to be OK.</p> <p>The first series of another Irish drama, <strong><a href=\"https://www.channel5.com/show/blood/\">Blood</a></strong>, written by Sophie Petzal, was an engrossing whodunnit about whether a doctor, Jim (Adrian Dunbar), murdered his terminally ill wife. The second series, directed by Maurice Sweeney and Laura Way, and aired over five consecutive nights, opened with a bang, or more specifically a splash, as Jim\u2019s daughter, Fiona (Gr\u00e1inne Keenan) careered out of control in a car into a lake. When her husband (Ian Lloyd Anderson) was discovered dead in the boot of the car, suspicion immediately fell upon her, and others\u2026 including Jim.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ea7c5ce730bada2a707b6292d9b0528165fc55c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ea7c5ce730bada2a707b6292d9b0528165fc55c/0_0_4200_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gr\u00e1inne Keenan, Adrian Dunbar and Diarmuid Noyes in Blood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gr\u00e1inne Keenan, Adrian Dunbar and Diarmuid Noyes in Blood: \u2018bristling with secrets and lies\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: West Road Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As with his role as Ted Hastings in <em>Line of Duty</em>, Dunbar is a genius at ambiguous characters (you root for him, even as you wonder what the shifty-looking sod is up to). Elsewhere, in a stellar cast bristling with secrets and lies, Keenan and Anderson convinced as a couple hopelessly mired in irrevocable toxicity. At times, the show\u2019s constant hurtling between different timezones left one feeling a tad dizzy. Still, once again Petzal proved herself undeniably adept at weaving together a complex knot of murder, family dysfunction, domestic violence, drug-dealing, lesbian love, shattered futures and more.</p> <p>Other <em>Line of Duty</em> alumni, Stephen Graham and Daniel Mays, star in the comedy-drama <strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/code-404\">Code 404</a></strong>, written by Daniel Peak, directed by Al Campbell. They play detective partners, one of whom, John Major (Mays) was killed in action, but then resurrected by artificial intelligence. It emerges that not only has DI Roy Carver (Graham) been involved with Major\u2019s wife (Anna Maxwell Martin), but now, if his revitalised partner makes too many mistakes, he can be \u201cswitched off\u201d.</p> <p>As these are the kinds of roles that Mays and Graham excel in playing straight, it took a while to adjust my perceptions. It was delivered as a classic funny/straight double act, with May hurling himself into the comedy and Graham anxiously trying to contain the fallout. While <em>Code 404</em> didn\u2019t always hit the mark in this opener, the energy and enthusiasm were infectious, and with this level of talent on board I will be sticking with it.</p> <p>Oh dear. US showrunner Ryan Murphy has produced some huge series \u2013 <em>Glee</em>, <em>American Crime Story</em>, <em>Pose</em>, <em>The Politician</em>, <em>Feud: Bette and Joan</em>. Sadly, his latest, <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81088617\">Hollywood</a></strong>, is a bewildering tonal hot mess \u2013 unfunny, but not serious \u2013 despite a hardworking cast including Darren Criss, Queen Latifah, David Corenswet, Patti LuPone, Mira Sorvino, Jim Parsons, Laura Harrier, and Joe Mantello.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a0fa57421c45aeb8a0c66a54357ad5f6f17acd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a0fa57421c45aeb8a0c66a54357ad5f6f17acd4/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Harrier as Camille and Queen Latifah as Hattie McDaniel in the ambitious Hollywood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Harrier as Camille and Queen Latifah as Hattie McDaniel in the ambitious Hollywood: \u2018a bewildering, <br> tonal hot mess\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Adyani/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The series strives to be a hyperreal reimagining of postwar Hollywood \u2013 one where \u201cbaddies\u201d (racism, homophobia, sexism) are vanquished. However, it feels glib, particularly when sexual exploitation is played for giggles, albeit mainly happening to male victims. (Maybe to fend off #MeToo criticism? Particularly with Sorvino, one of the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of sexual harassment, in the cast.) Hollywood looks sublime (think: Netflix <em>La La Land</em>), and it\u2019s not short of vision, with real-life figures such as Rock Hudson, Anna May Wong, and Hattie McDaniel mingling with fictional characters. A shame, then, that the ambitious production ends up dissolving in a huge foaming bath of sentimentality and schmaltz.</p> <p>The opening episode of the new four-part series <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqmn\">Museums in Quarantine</a></strong> saw Alistair Sooke looking around <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqml\">Tate Modern\u2019s Andy Warhol retrospective</a>, when it had just been closed by the lockdown days after it opened (subsequent episodes \u2013 still on iPlayer \u2013 include <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqpj\">Simon Schama on the </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqpj\">Ashmolean\u2019s Young Rembrandt</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqpj\"> exhibition</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hqq9\">Dr Janina Ramirez at the British Museum</a>). The Warhol show looks fascinating, illustrating how the artist, who died in 1987, wasn\u2019t just about his 1960s pop art and Factory period, but also a multifaceted visionary who sensed the modern world developing, and remains a truly contemporary artist today.</p> <p>Certainly, with his famous quote: \u201cIn the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes,\u201d Warhol has long come across as the godfather of the selfie. However, another story was playing out during this documentary: the stilled escalators, the eerie empty halls\u2026 this wasn\u2019t about just one museum exhibition, this was about a country in quarantine, and the cultural world we\u2019re still hungry to see.</p>",

  "<p>Hello friends! Do you fancy listening to \u201ca new type of time-shifted amateur radio\u201d? No? How about a brilliant podcast? Of course you do.</p> <p>Fifteen years ago, <em>Mac</em><em>world</em>, a magazine for fans of Apple products, announced, with limited fanfare, that Apple was about to add podcasts to iTunes, its music download offer. Unfortunately, few readers knew what a podcast was, hence <em>Mac</em><em>world</em>\u2019s \u201ctime-shifted radio\u201d definition. In June 2005, the idea of having thousands of ready-to-hear audio shows, anything from true-crime documentaries to all-chums-together comedy, to up-to-the-minute news to gripping drama to revealing interviews, and being able to listen to these shows whenever you want, wherever you are \u2013 well, that wasn\u2019t quite happening. So Apple\u2019s move didn\u2019t seem important. Nor did the fact that the Oxford English Dictionary added \u201cpodcast\u201d to its lexicon in the same year, after tech journalist Ben Hammersley came up with the term in 2004 (which was also the year the BBC launched a downloadable version of <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl\">In Our Time</a></em>)<strong>. </strong>Podcasts were new. It takes time for the new to become everyday.</p> <p>Podcasts were mostly unheard of, except by the tech savvy. They were either downloadable<strong> </strong>versions of existing radio shows or they were chatty riffs, made by amateurs who knew how to upload their aural blogs online. Still, they were interesting. At least to me. Soon after podcasts\u2019 iTunes debut, I started a new job as the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s radio critic. Great job \u2013 except there was a limited choice of programmes for me to review. Radio schedules rarely changed. Presenters stayed in their jobs for years. The BBC dominated speech radio, aside from phone-ins; hardly any other broadcaster had the money to make documentaries or drama.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af4277da805f53aefe9e0dcf076a2ace0368ef27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af4277da805f53aefe9e0dcf076a2ace0368ef27/0_38_5178_3105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Pilkington, Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais after setting the Guinness world record for the most downloaded podcast in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl Pilkington, Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais after setting the Guinness world record for the most downloaded podcast in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Podcasts rescued me from aural monotony; I wrote my first piece about them in the summer of 2006. Apparently <em><a href=\"http://cokemachineglow.com/podcasts/\">Coke Machine Glow</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://thedawnanddrewshow.com/\">The Dawn and Drew Show</a></em> were the ones to look out for (me neither, now). The podcast I do recall from then is <em><a href=\"https://www.therickygervaisshow.com/podcasts\">The Ricky Gervais Show</a></em>; this dominated the brand new iTunes podcast chart for weeks. Initially free, in early 2006 it switched to a pay-per-listen model and proved both a forerunner and an outlier: since then, much podcast uptake has been driven by comedy, but most shows are still free to listeners, paid for by adverts that appear during episodes.</p> <p>Today, the iTunes podcast chart is bustling with old hands and new kids on the block. Here are <em><a href=\"https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/\">No Such Thing As </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/\">a Fish</a></em>, Fearne Cotton\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.officialfearnecotton.com/news/2018/2/26/happy-place-podcast\">Happy Place</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06kyljg/episodes/downloads\">That Peter Crouch Podcast</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://kathbum.podbean.com/\">Katherine Ryan: Telling Everybody Everything</a></em>. Here are sections for new and noteworthy, cultivating calm, keeping the kids busy. There are lists of the top 10 episodes, top 10 shows; all aside from the 19 other regular categories: news, arts, true crime\u2026 So many podcasts! There are oodles of shows, too many to ever get through.</p> <h2>Gold rush</h2> <p>This is podcasting\u2019s boom time. There are now more than 900,000 podcasts to choose from. In the US, 22% of the population listens to at least one podcast every week and 51% to at least one podcast in their life (roughly 168 million people). In the UK, 12.5% of us (about 7.1 million people) listen to podcasts weekly, up 58% in the past two years.<strong> </strong>And on average, those UK podcast fans are hoovering up approximately seven podcasts a week. Even throughout lockdown, when other art forms closed or stopped producing, podcasts have continued to grow. The big shows just got bigger.</p> <p>Podcasts have taken off across the world. In South Korea, <a href=\"https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/\">58% of the population</a> has listened to a podcast in the past month \u2013more than 30 million people \u2013 while in Spain the figure is 40% (more than 18.5million). And there\u2019s evidence that our ever-expanding love of listening is part of a wider shift to audio. Recently, a media analyst gave a talk about about current and upcoming trends. He noted that car radios are digital, speakers can be blue-toothed, in-ear headphones are more and more popular (Apple sold an estimated 60 million pairs of its <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/apple-airpods-shipments-are-said-to-double-to-60-million-in-2019\">wireless AirPods</a> last year), as are home AI systems with Alexa and Google Home. We\u2019re absorbing more content through our ears than ever before, he said, because we can do other things as we listen and in the future, as smart headphones get smarter, our ears, rather than our eyes, may well become the main way we connect to the internet.</p> <p>Still, that\u2019s the future. For now, perhaps the biggest indicator that podcasts are having their moment is the way big players are moving in, whether brands or celebrities.<strong> </strong>In 2019, Spotify made an eye-watering financial investment, buying Gimlet Media and Parcast (which make podcasts), as well as Anchor (which provides tools for podcast makers), for a combined stake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/06/spotify-buys-podcast-firms-gimlet-and-anchor-streaming-profits-music\">more than \u00a3320m</a>. Universal has done a deal with Wondery, the American true-crime specialist that produced <em><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/dirty-john/\">Dirty John</a></em>.

Even Kim Kardashian is dropping hints.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I would say we\u2019re in the podcast gold rush years,\u201d says Matt Deegan, who co-runs the British Podcast awards, as well as overseeing shows such as the Fun Kids\u2019<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.funkidslive.com/podcasts/#\">podcasts</a>. \u201cBut it can definitely get even bigger. Compared with the millions who use TV, or YouTube, or Instagram, podcasting\u2019s numbers are small\u2026\u201d</p> <p>For quite some time, podcast fans have been of a type: educated Apple users who want to be entertained, but intelligently. (<em>Observer</em> readers, essentially.) There is a massive mainstream audience as yet untapped, though some shows are making inroads; podcasts that discuss popular TV programmes, old and new, are a burgeoning area. So, room for expansion. The questions are: how big can podcasting get? And which shows will get left behind?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7c5628e37eafb601b7b6dbb3682b8c9048a54d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7c5628e37eafb601b7b6dbb3682b8c9048a54d4/0_101_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Corden and David Tennant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Tennant Does a Podcast With\u2026 James Corden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Acast/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Helen Zaltzman, who hosts and produces <em><a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/\">The Allusionist</a></em> \u2013 and, since 2007, the immensely popular <em><a href=\"https://answermethispodcast.com/\">Answer Me This!</a></em> with Olly Mann \u2013 thinks that big companies could bring some more trust to the medium. \u201cTheir investment demonstrates that podcasting isn\u2019t just made by amateurs in a garage,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But the independence of podcasting, the wild and wonderfulness of its offerings, its glorious niche-ness, where someone with a great idea or mad obsession can make a small show that turns into a roaring success\u2026 Zaltzman worries that this will be \u201csteamrollered by big, bland chat series with enormous marketing budgets\u201d. This would be, at the very least, galling. After all, without <em><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/\">99% Invisible</a></em> there would be no <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGeBogGDZ9W3dsGx-mWQGJA\">Impaulsive with Logan Paul</a></em>; without <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lvdrj\">Kermode and Mayo\u2019s Film Review</a></em>, no <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07kjlz7\">Gemma Collins Podcast</a></em>. Outliers light the way for the popular.</p> <h2>The app gap</h2> <p>Today, in the UK, we mostly get our aural hits via Apple, BBC Sounds, Spotify and \u2013 this may sound weird to some \u2013 YouTube. Listeners under 35 use YouTube more than any other platform to get their podcasts, often listening while doing other things, such as playing computer games (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ\">Joe Rogan</a>, one of the world\u2019s most successful podcasters, with 8 million subscribers, is most often accessed on YouTube). YouTubers are moving into podcasting, by the way: football YouTube sensation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/miniminter\">Miniminter</a> has a new podcast, as does <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JaackMaate\">JaackMaate</a>.</p> <p>Some podcasting history. For quite a few years, like many others, I found my podcasts via websites and through iTunes. This required me to be near my laptop, though I could download shows on to my creaky iPod (iPhones didn\u2019t come along until 2007; I got my first in 2011). Podcasting\u2019s accessibility was a problem: there were great shows out there, but most people had no idea how to get them.</p> <p>It\u2019s unusual to have brilliant content without a convenient platform \u2013 it\u2019s like a great chef without a restaurant \u2013 and it\u2019s this mismatch that has long held podcasting back. Usually, the platform exists, the content grows to fill it and then both grow together. But podcasts existed for ages before they were truly easy to hear. It wasn\u2019t until 2012, when Apple put a standalone podcast app on its iPhones, that podcasts became easily accessible (for iPhone users) and podcasting started to take off in the UK. Soon after, 4G and more widespread wifi made it possible to hear a podcast wherever you were.</p> <p>Then, in 2014, <em><a href=\"https://serialpodcast.org/\">Serial</a></em> came out. This who-really-dunnit re-examination of a cold case murder, led by <em><a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/\">This American Life</a></em> veteran Sarah Koenig, massively boosted podcasting\u2019s profile. In every English-speaking country, there is evidence of \u201cthe <em>Serial</em> effect\u201d and the show also gave podcasting an identifiable style for a few years, one where the presenter showed their workings in their commentary (what we might call the \u201cI get that. But I still wanted to know\u2026\u201d style). In 2015, <em><a href=\"https://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/#intro1\">My Dad Wrote </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/#intro1\">a Porno</a></em> became another enormous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/30/my-dad-wrote-a-porno-podcast\">UK hit</a> and advertisers \u2013 other than early adopters Squarespace \u2013 started to take note. <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0008cx6\">Brexitcast</a></em> brought in a lot of new listeners in 2017, as did <em>That Peter Crouch Podcast</em> in 2018 and <em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/sh-ged-married-annoyed/id1451489585\">Shagged Married Annoyed</a></em> last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4a138551db7c3faf3b4c9ba83876a9a0c5a7759\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4a138551db7c3faf3b4c9ba83876a9a0c5a7759/0_326_2400_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama appearing on Marc Maron\u2019s podcast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama appearing on <a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_613_-_president_barack_obama\">Marc Maron\u2019s podcast WTF</a> in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Souza/The White House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But still, if we\u2019re honest, podcasts have been The Next Big Thing ever since I\u2019ve been writing about them and their reaching the mainstream has been a stop-start process. Even now, there are plenty of people who don\u2019t listen and many who have only just started. Why? Access. The problem \u2013 still \u2013 is how podcasts are delivered.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect app for podcasts,\u201d says Zaltzman. \u201cThey are all a bit clunky, because they\u2019re free, so there\u2019s no real reason to make them great. The people who make the apps don\u2019t make their own podcasts, they just host other people\u2019s work.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We put all our time and energy into getting the right people on our shows. We just wind them up and let them go</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Harrison, Podmasters</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is changing. After Spotify\u2019s splashy podcasting entrance, Gimlet is now busily making shows for the streaming service. BBC Sounds hosts BBC podcasts, but has promised to expand to hosting other shows in the future. (During the coronavirus pandemic, it has agreed to host Fun Kids\u2019 excellent <em><a href=\"https://www.funkidslive.com/podcast/stuck/\">Stuck@Home</a></em>.) In the US, Luminary, which hoped to be the Netflix of podcasting (ie a subscription model), had a bumpy launch in 2019, with several established shows pulling out from being on the network. But it undoubtedly made some big signings, including Russell Brand\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://luminarypodcasts.com/listen/russell-brand-395/under-the-skin-with-russell-brand-luminary-exclusive/d55de7eb-6f34-48e6-aee4-48703f8fb675?country=US\">Under the Skin</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://loveandradio.org/\">Love + Radio</a></em>, and it makes its own shows with celebrities such as Trevor Noah and Karamo Brown from <em>Queer Eye</em>. (The subscription model might seem an obvious way for podcasts to go, but faces reluctance from listeners used to getting podcasts for free while suffering the adverts that pay for them.)</p> <p>Matt Hartman, who works for Betaworks, an American startup studio and venture capitalist company that invested in Gimlet in 2014, points out that most podcast apps just do the same thing: \u201cLet people search for and subscribe to shows and that\u2019s it.\u201d He says, diplomatically, that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to app innovation, mentioning <a href=\"https://www.breaker.audio/\">Breaker</a> as an app that\u2019s different: it\u2019s well laid out, has social functions, lets you search for individual episodes and automatically imports all your existing podcast subscriptions. (Breaker is also easy for podcasters to use and gives more listening information, which apps have previously been reluctant to hand out.)</p> <p>But at the moment, Apple\u2019s basic Podcast app dominates in the UK. This is despite the fact that most people don\u2019t own iPhones. Android phone users have various ways to get podcasts, though it took until 2018 for Google to put out Google Podcasts (before that, you had to go via Google Play). Now, Google Podcasts can be used on iPhones too and you can search for individual phrases within shows. There are other apps: Podcast Player, Pocket Casts (which charges a one-off fee), Stitcher, Castbox. So many, but unless Google Podcasts catches on, Spotify seems to be the most likely to threaten Apple\u2019s dominance.</p> <p>And the iTunes podcast chart, with its incomprehensible algorithms, is still where podcasters want to be, though the chart doesn\u2019t work in quite the same way as the UK\u2019s Top 40. Instead, says Deegan, \u201cit\u2019s about momentum\u201d. Momentum means a new show can make a splash and enter the iTunes top 10. The real talent is in making that show stick and, of course, making money from it. Such mainstream hits as <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/thehighlowshow\">The High Low</a></em>, <em>Peter Crouch</em>, <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3GMZiZnqL4Hib6DD5PGhdj\">The Receipts</a></em>, <em>David Tennant\u2026</em>, <em><a href=\"https://adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts\">The Adam Buxton Podcast</a></em> and <em>My Dad Wrote </em><em>a Porno</em> act as starter programmes. Once people listen and love them, they are more likely to try others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d99e294680867ccb8a3638763d4ddfec0b1ca1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d99e294680867ccb8a3638763d4ddfec0b1ca1d/0_0_1125_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former footballer Peter Crouch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former footballer Peter Crouch has enjoyed success with his That Peter Crouch Podcast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet our podcasting industry is a couple of years behind the US. Partly, this is because of our thriving radio sector; as Zaltzman points out, given the choice between a regular paid job at BBC radio and the uncertain economics of podcasting, many producers opt for the former. Things are changing, though: the BBC is losing its audio dominance, at least among young people. Other broadcasters have been quick to launch podcasts, or their own app (<a href=\"https://www.globalplayer.com/\">Global</a>\u2019s is good), and Deegan knows of many podcasters, \u201cbrilliant broadcasters\u201d, who have never worked in radio.</p> <p>Andrew Harrison, who runs a small podcasting company, Podmasters, is one of those. Having worked for nearly 30 years in magazines, he started making podcasts in 2016. One of them \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channel/remainiacs-podcast\">Remainiacs</a></em>, an anti-Brexit show that pulls in several big players, including Tony Blair \u2013 became a hit, and, from that, the company has launched political show <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/the-bunker\">The Bunker</a></em> and started producing other people\u2019s podcasts. What Harrison likes, he says, is the direct nature of podcasting. All the investment is in the show, he explains: there are no printing or distribution costs, no investment in drama scripts and in building sets. \u201cWe put all our time and energy into getting the right people on our shows,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then we just wind them up, let them go, record and edit and get the show out to listeners.\u201d</p> <p>A simple process: idea, execution, direct delivery to consumer. Several podcast producers and presenters I talk to contrast this with the traditional teeth-pulling procedure of making shows for the BBC. There, you \u201csit down in front of a Rupert and listen as your great idea is tweaked to within an inch of its life and then proposed as a vehicle for Sue Perkins or Romesh Ranganathan,\u201d says one producer. \u201cWhy bother?\u201d</p> <p>Presenters don\u2019t have it easy, either: one high-profile BBC host has been promised a podcast for the past two years, yet every suggestion they make for a show is rejected. No wonder BBC regulars such as Clara Amfo, Annie Mac and Clare Balding have recently brought out podcasts independently.</p> <p>So, we\u2019re getting more British podcasts. Perhaps we\u2019ll catch up to the US soon? Deegan isn\u2019t so sure. He says the main reason UK podcasts don\u2019t smash the American market is that \u201cBritain doesn\u2019t have celebrities that Americans have heard of. David Tennant\u2019s podcast has done well, because Americans know who he is.\u201d No doubt if Tom Holland or Idris Elba decided to make a podcast, it would go down brilliantly. But as podcasts move into the mainstream, they need mainstream stars to move with them.</p> <p>There is an argument, though, that niche is where it\u2019s at, especially when niche goes big. The most popular podcasts in the UK are made by enthusiasts, from <em>Kermode and Mayo</em> to <em>My Dad Wrote a Porno</em>. Jamie Morton, with his other <em>MDWAP</em> hosts, James Cooper and Alice Levine, has now done a full world tour twice, selling out the Sydney Opera House and New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall. Still, he says that when he moved into a new house recently, he had to explain to his neighbour what he did, \u201cwhich was embarrassing. They didn\u2019t know what a podcast was and the title was a bit\u2026 suspect.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2c3139e7ad1cc3138edd1c7b5fec7927483ee552\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c3139e7ad1cc3138edd1c7b5fec7927483ee552/0_18_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aoife Wilson, who hosts the BBC\u2019s This Game Changed My Life podcast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aoife Wilson, who hosts the BBC\u2019s This Game Changed My Life podcast with fellow gaming expert Julia Hardy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This combination of being under the radar for most people, but popular enough to sell out the Albert Hall, demonstrates the Big Niche appeal of podcasting. Morton describes <em>MDWAP</em> events as being \u201clike Comic Con: fans dress up as characters, they come by themselves and make friends when they\u2019re at the show\u201d. Podcasting appears to be going through the same arc as YouTube, in that its oldest stars have grown themselves by getting in early and posting regularly on an untested platform. Like YouTubers, the most popular podcasters, who draw huge audiences to their live shows, are able to walk around unnoticed by the vast majority of the population. Real celebrities \u2013 film stars, singers, chatshow hosts \u2013 come in later.</p> <p>So, can Big Niche go Big Big? Perhaps not. First, podcasts don\u2019t really do music very well, due to rights issues. And second, they have always been about individual listening, on headphones. It\u2019s emphatically not a shared experience, listening to a podcast. Which is why many people find it hard to convert. They want a voice chuntering in the background, not someone whispering in their ear. Headphones can feel oppressive and podcasts are too intimate (or sweary!) to blast out to everyone in the room.</p> <p>Podcasts, in the end, are just too personal. Too niche, whether small niche or big. Which is, of course, why we fans love them. They\u2019re ours.</p> <p><br>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 May 2020.

  "<p>At the time that he made an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish\">emergency national TV broadcast</a> to declare the lockdown, Boris Johnson thought he was taking one of the biggest decisions of his premiership. In truth, it was a simple one \u2013 at least it was compared with the choices he has to start making this week. Attempting to ease out of restrictions without reigniting the epidemic will be both the most uncertain and most perilous phase of this crisis. The decisions he makes are ones that will define how he is judged by history. Get it right and he may or may not be rewarded with some public credit. Get it wrong and the blame will likely chase him all the way to the next election.</p> <p>There was a hint that he knows this in the \u201cI\u2019m back at my desk\u201d news conference that marked his return to Number 10. He produced some characteristically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eab03128f08fcc89d8bb448#block-5eab03128f08fcc89d8bb448\">Borisovian metaphors</a> involving tunnels, peaks, sunlight and pastures. </p> <p>Then his language suddenly turned tentative when it came to the actual detail about when and how the government intends to lift elements of the lockdown. He talked not of a \u201cbattle plan\u201d, the sort of flourish a confident Johnson would have gone for, but a \u201cmenu of options\u201d. He didn\u2019t mention an \u201cexit strategy\u201d, a phrase that Number 10 has banned ministers from using. There won\u2019t be a full exit for a long time and there isn\u2019t yet anything worthy of the description strategy. There is general agreement within government that open spaces are early candidates for an easing of rules, while gyms and bars will be the last to reopen. There are very live debates within cabinet about everything in between.</p> <p>We are most likely to see cautious moves to test what can and cannot be done safely. One person at the heart of decision-making puts it like this: \u201cWhat you can\u2019t do is release loads of measures all at once, only to find that there is a resurgence and you have to put them all back on again. You can\u2019t go too fast and you\u2019ve got to monitor and measure as you go.\u201d This points to a very gradual easing of lockdown with the government retaining the option of reimposing restrictions if infection levels flare up. Franklin D Roosevelt addressed the Great Depression of the 1930s with what he called \u201cbold experimentation\u201d. What we will see from the government over the days ahead is tremulous experimentation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Tory leader has encountered an enemy that confounds his have-your-cake-and-eat-it philosophy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The choices confronting the prime minister are not ones he would willingly make. One colleague closely involved in the government\u2019s internal debates reports: \u201cBoris being Boris, he wants to end all the restrictions and get the economy fired up again without a single life lost. He can\u2019t have that, of course.\u201d In the coronavirus, the Tory leader has encountered an enemy that confounds the have-your-cake-and-eat-it philosophy by which he has led his life and practised his politics.</p> <p>The choices are not easy and he will have to navigate them half-blind because there is still much that \u201cThe Science\u201d is currently unable to tell us about this novel disease. It has become one of the ministerial mantras of this crisis that they are \u201cfollowing the science\u201d. That is obviously preferable to the opposite. We can at least be thankful that we do not have a national leader whose wildly reckless interventions have included musing that people might find a cure by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">injecting themselves</a> with disinfectant. A revival of respect for expertise has been a beneficial consequence of this crisis, but it doesn\u2019t relieve politicians from the responsibility to make the toughest calls. Scientific advisers advise; ministers decide. This is even more the case because opinion among scientists has never been homogenous and there is still much that they don\u2019t fully understand. Immunity is one of those unknowns. There has been some optimistic news from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/south-korea-records-no-new-domestic-cases-of-covid-19-for-first-time-since-february\">South Korea</a> in the past few days, but there is not yet certainty about whether infection leads to immunity, how long immunity might last and how strongly, and whether people can be immune and at the same time be carriers of the disease. Another big question mark hangs over the role of children in transmission. If they can be as infectious as adults, that is very bad news, with major implications for when schools can be reopened. If children are not as infectious as adults, that is much more encouraging.</p> <p>The swiftness with which restrictions can be eased is hugely contingent on the rate at which the virus is spreading. Sir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19-nhs\">Patrick Vallance</a>, the chief scientific adviser, says it is believed that the average <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-actually-signify\">reproduction rate</a> \u2013 R \u2013 in Britain is now somewhere between 0.6 and 0.9. In decimal points, that is a small difference. In terms of the options it offers the government, that is a vast range. The closer R is to 1, the greater the hazard that a lifting of restrictions will trigger an explosion of infections. The closer R is to 0.5, the more rapidly the epidemic will reduce in strength and the more easing ministers can dare risk.</p> <p>The government will improve its chances of acting safely if it can put together a reliable system for testing, tracking and tracing infection. Matt Hancock <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">(sort of) achieved</a> his target of 100,000 tests a day at the end of last week, but most expert opinion believes that this needs to rise to more like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-pmqs-boris-johnson-parliament-to-close-early-for-easter-recess\">250,000 tests a day</a> once pledged by the prime minister. The required number of tests greatly depends on how prevalent the disease is among the population \u2013 and the government doesn\u2019t know that either. They hope to start solving that mystery through the recently launched mass survey programme. The <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/news/news/onsjointlyleadinggovernmentslargescalevirusinfectionandantibodyteststudy\">first data</a> started to come in this weekend.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A revival of respect for expertise has been a beneficial consequence of this crisis</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government\u2019s \u201cfive tests\u201d for easing the lockdown are not as definitive as they pretend to be. They were put together while the prime minister was out of action in an attempt to dampen the growing clamour from Tories for a plan to end the lockdown before it completely suffocates the economy.</p> <p>That pressure is still being exerted from the Conservative benches. Mostly confined to their constituencies, Tory MPs are paying more attention than usual to their inboxes and voicemail and both are overflowing with local business owners screaming that they are going bust. One senior Tory says: \u201cIn six months\u2019 time, the argument won\u2019t be about whether we should have shut the pubs a week earlier. The argument will be about how we got into a god awful recession.\u201d</p> <p>There are evident differences among the cabinet. Some of the positions taken by ministers can be explained by the seats that they occupy. As health secretary, Mr Hancock\u2019s overriding priority is to avoid the NHS collapsing under the stress of an overwhelming number of coronavirus victims. He\u2019s always believed, and not wrongly, that this scenario would not only destroy his career, but irretrievably shatter the reputation of this government. As chancellor, Rishi Sunak\u2019s central focus is on the tremendous blows being inflicted on the economy and the vast amount of red ink splashing on to the public finances. But Mr Sunak\u2019s allies report that he fully understands that it would be a disaster to relieve restrictions only for a resurgence in the disease to force the government to clamp a full lockdown back on again. Colleagues of Mr Hancock say that \u201cMatt understands we will need some kind of economy left at the end of this\u201d if the health service is to be funded in the future.</p> <p>Britain has one advantage. We were hit by the pandemic later than many other countries and this offers the opportunity to watch and learn from the experiences of those who are ahead of us in trying to reopen their societies. The lessons are cautionary. Having thought it had beaten back the disease, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/18/asia/singapore-coronavirus-response-intl-hnk/index.html\">Singapore</a> has been confronted with another outbreak. Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/28/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-china-could-have-stopped-virus-as-global-cases-pass-3-million\">Germany</a> started to lighten its lockdown, there appears to have been a resurgence of infection in some parts of the country. This strengthens the hand of those in government arguing for a gradualist approach.</p> <p>The public surprised ministers by being highly compliant with the lockdown and another unknown for the government is how people will respond to an easing. Many are desperate to get back to work because they need to earn money. At the same time, majorities of respondents tell pollsters that <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/majority-britons-uncomfortable-sport-music-bars-coronavirus\">they are wary</a> of leaving their homes and nervous about using public transport again. Over the coming weeks, millions of Britons will be weighing the risks posed by the disease against the fear of losing livelihoods. They will be making what could be life-or-death decisions on the basis of very incomplete information. It may or may not be a consolation that their prime minister is facing the same predicament.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

  "<p>The Russian novelist Guzel Yakhina had learned to live with the persistent buzz of controversy surrounding her bestselling debut novel,<em> </em><em>Zuleikha Opens Her Eyes</em>.</p> <p>Her coming-of-age story of a young woman deported to Siberia during the Stalin-era purges of wealthier peasants, or <em>kulaks</em>, had been picked over for its portrayals of Soviet repressions and national identity in the largely Muslim region of Tatarstan ever since it was published in 2015.</p> <p>But when an <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11012384/\">eight-part television adaptation</a> was broadcast on state television last month, even she was shocked by the ferocity of the backlash.</p> <p>\u201cI was totally unprepared for this wave of emotional response,\u201d Yakhina told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cI understood this was something really serious.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview last week, she defended the television series, which she said had faithfully reflected the \u201ctragedy of dekulakisation\u201d without descending into melodrama.</p> <p>\u201cMy main condition was that the film not just be turned into a love story set [against] the background of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/29/the-remains-of-stalin-gulag-railroad-soviet-union-a-photo-essay\">gulag</a>,\u201d she said of the adaptation. \u201cThat was important to me. And I\u2019m glad that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>But the attacks have poured in from all sides. Communists said the film desecrated the memory of the Soviet past, exaggerating even Stalin-era abuses. Muslim leaders bristled at a sex scene in a mosque and the use of the names of prominent Muslim figures among the exiles. Tatar critics have attacked the romance between Zuleikha and Ignatov, the committed Communist soldier who kills Zuleikha\u2019s first husband.</p> <p>And Chulpan Khamatova, an ethnic Tatar actress who plays the film\u2019s title role, said that she\u2019d received a torrent of online abuse for \u201cdefiling the memory of my motherland. Meaning not only Tatarstan, but the history of modern Russia.\u201d</p> <p>For Yakhina, a rising star of Russian literature who has set her first two novels in the upheaval of the 1920s and 30s Soviet Union, the backlash is a sign of just how thorny that past remains, even when the facts and figures of the millions purged and killed under Stalin are a matter of public record.</p> <p>\u201cIf this topic were not so painful, the emotional response would not be so strong,\u201d Yakhina said. \u201cI think that we are still processing our past and it will take a long time. Thirty years ago, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/jul/14/soviet-union-collapse-in-pictures\">the Soviet Union had just collapsed</a>, we thought that we could leave everything behind and move into the new, bright future.

In 2019, the independent Levada Centre said that 70% of Russians polled said Stalin had played a positive role in the country\u2019s history, a record high.</p> <p>But there are also signs of renewed interest in Stalin-era acts of repression among young Russians, including a 2019 YouTube documentary by the journalist Yury Dud about Kolyma, the site of a large Soviet-era Gulag camp, that became a breakaway hit with more than 20 million views.</p> <p>Yakhina says that Russians are \u201cnot just ready, they want to remember a lot\u201d.

  "<p>Denis Goldberg, who died last week, was one of Nelson Mandela\u2019s two surviving co-defendants from the 1963-64 Rivonia trial at which 10 men were on trial for their lives for conspiring to overthrow the apartheid regime by force. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1964/mar/01/nelsonmandela.southafrica\">the most important trial in South Africa\u2019s history</a> and led, 30 years later, to a relatively peaceful transition to a non-racial democracy. <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/nelson-mandelas-speech-i-am-prepared-to-die-at-the-rivonia-trial\">Mandela\u2019s defiant speech</a> from the dock, in which he declared that the ideal of a democratic and free society was one for which, if needs be, he was prepared to die, was widely reported and made him a household name throughout the world.</p> <p>Less widely reported was that Mandela did not act alone and that of the eight defendants who were convicted and sentenced to life without parole one was white. They all approved his speech, knowing that it made it more likely they would hang. They had all approved his strategy to turn the trial into a political one in which they would put apartheid in the dock of international opinion. By not exposing Mandela to cross-examination, they deliberately courted conviction. Goldberg, the youngest defendant, went further. He offered to pretend that, in attempting to buy grenade casings, he had exceeded his mandate \u2013 thereby effectively signing his own death warrant \u2013 if that would save the lives of the black ANC leaders. His offer was refused.</p> <p>His readiness to sacrifice his life for his beliefs and his comrades, along with that of a handful of other white and Indian activists, was instrumental in persuading Mandela to abandon narrow Africanism in favour of non-racialism and thus played an important part in the eventual creation of the \u201crainbow state\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a white man, Goldberg was denied the comfort of serving his sentence on Robben Island with his comrades</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Goldberg\u2019s courage flowed from a commitment to achieving racial and economic equality and the belief that change comes from the bottom up. His parents were lifelong communists who had emigrated to Cape Town, where he was born in 1933. Aged 11, he asked them why his history book said South Africa was a democracy when black people couldn\u2019t vote. They explained the nature of apartheid and, as he later said, \u201conce you tear away the veil of lies around a society, you can\u2019t put it back together unless you lie to yourself every day\u201d.</p> <p>It was the start of a lifetime of political activism. For him, ending apartheid was personal as well as political. He wanted his children and grandchildren to be free to pick their friends irrespective of colour.</p> <p>He lived to see his dream of a non-racial South Africa realised. But it came at a heavy price. </p> <p>At the University of Cape Town, where he studied engineering, he was ostracised for his political beliefs and was later sacked from jobs at the instigation of the security police. Through the non-racial Modern Youth Society, he met Esme Bodenstein, another activist. They married in 1954 and spenttheir honeymoon running a holiday camp. By 1957, Goldberg had oined the Communist party and the Congress of Democrats, an affiliate of the ANC for white opponents of apartheid.</p> <p>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/mar/22/sharpeville-massacre-eyewitness-account\">Sharpeville massacre</a> in 1960, he was detained without trial for four months. He was then recruited by <em>Umkhont</em><em>o we Sizwe</em><em> </em>(MK), the armed wing of the ANC, took part in its campaign of sabotage against installations and rose to run its first military training camp. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f22fe02171eca7dd44e96688e5f2d43c4e155807\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f22fe02171eca7dd44e96688e5f2d43c4e155807/0_280_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denis Goldberg in 2017, then 84.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denis Goldberg in 2017, then 84.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Oatway/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In May 1963, when the regime passed a law allowing 90 days\u2019 detention without trial or access to lawyers, the MK ordered Goldberg to leave the country for military training. But he was persuaded by Joe Slovo to delay his departure to secure munitions for the armed struggle. That is how he came to be in the Lilliesleaf safe house in the suburb of Rivonia on the day of the raid. </p> <p>The Rivonia trial was the defining moment of Goldberg\u2019s life.

He was a very tormented soul who should have had more help.

The plan was I would spend the weekend and then I would fly back. When I arrived, he said, \u2018I have a doctor here because you don\u2019t look well\u2019.

  "<p>I remember my first experience of boredom as vividly as my first kiss. The recollection is so clear I thought I must have been at least seven years old. Actually, my mother tells me, I was only three or four, which makes being bored my earliest memory. My sister and I were sitting in our family car, parked outside Mum\u2019s friend\u2019s house, into which she had disappeared. \u201cWon\u2019t be long,\u201d she\u2019d said. That had been 15 minutes earlier. I could do nothing but wait, but I wanted, strongly, to do anything else. I felt the bind on a physical level, the confines of the car consistent with the constraints on me. This was boredom, and I was appalled by it.</p> <p>Neither the car radio nor my baby sister offered any relief. Then my gaze landed on a small hole in the velour lining of the car roof. One of the defining characteristics of boredom is that time seems to drag \u2013 minutes pass as hours. The inverse is also true: when we are highly engaged in what we are doing, we lose track. So I cannot tell you how long I had been happily at work on that hole when mum finally returned to the car to find the back seat, and both of her children, coated with foam.</p> <p>I was in trouble, of course \u2013 but I was not convinced that I\u2019d done anything wrong. Instead it was as though, in putting an end to that desperate boredom, I had narrowly escaped falling off some kind of precipice \u2013 and I knew I would do whatever it took to avoid going over the edge in future.</p> <p>I did not understand then \u2013 two decades before my first conference call or doctor\u2019s waiting room \u2013 that boredom was a fact of life no more avoidable than any other mental state, good or bad. At times, it may even be a dominant experience. Studies show boredom levels rise through childhood, peak in early adulthood, and then decline, hitting the floor in one\u2019s 50s. But though boredom may be less prominent in middle life, it is still present \u2013 evidence suggests it comes creeping back in your 60s, especially among women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of a man lying on his back, one leg bent, a pensive finger at his chin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Studies show boredom levels rise through childhood, peak in early adulthood, and then decline again.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a familiar feeling and very common. Indeed, the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a \u201cboom time for boredom\u201d. Most of us are poorly equipped to cope with being shut in our homes indefinitely, even with the internet to distract us.</p> <p>But we should not fear being bored, say psychologists James Danckert and John D Eastwood, the authors of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/out-of-my-skull-9780674984677.html\" title=\"\">Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom</a></em>. Their research has revealed boredom to be widely misunderstood, perhaps even unfairly maligned. Boredom evolved to help us, says Danckert. It signals that we are unengaged, in need of an activity to satisfy us. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing, in a lot of ways. How we respond to it is up to us. I think you can minimise it. But do you want to totally eliminate it? I don\u2019t think you do.\u201d</p> <p>Danckert and Eastwood contend that boredom can steer us towards realising our potential and living full, meaningful lives. They say it communicates an important message that \u2013 in trying to outrun it my entire life \u2013 I had been refusing to heed.</p> <p>What if I stopped and listened?</p> <p><em><strong>Danckert is an Australian</strong></em> cognitive neuroscientist now based at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. He began studying boredom 15 years ago, a case of \u201cphysician, heal thyself,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a kid, and still into my adult years, I experience boredom, and whenever I do, I hate it. I find it a very frustrating, agitating experience.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. To quote from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/26/boredom-lively-history-toohey-review\" title=\"\">Boredom: A Lively History</a></em>, by the classicist Peter Toohey, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote in disgust: \u201cHow long the same things? Surely I will yawn, I will sleep, I will eat, I will be thirsty, I will be cold, I will be hot. Is there no end?\u201d In the Middle Ages monks complained of \u201cthe noonday demon\u201d: the personification of acedia \u2013 torpor, alongside agitation \u2013 provoked by the constraints and repetition of their daily lives. And though one could already be \u201ca bore\u201d, it was Dickens who was the first to term it \u201cboredom\u201d \u2013 in <em>Bleak House</em> in 1852. Lady Dedlock complains of being \u201cbored to death\u201d of herself, more than a century before Bruce Springsteen would express the same restless dissatisfaction in Dancing in the Dark. His characterisation of boredom as a frustrated hunger (\u201cI\u2019m just about starving tonight\u201d) evokes Tolstoy\u2019s definition in <em>Anna Karenina</em> of the feeling as \u201cthe desire for desires\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Couple sitting on a sofa both engaged on their phones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Boredom is neither daydreaming, which we might find highly absorbing, nor, necessarily, vegging out on the sofa.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBoredom is such a fascinating topic, with tentacles that spread into philosophy, anthropology, literature, religion, theology,\u201d says Eastwood, who is head of the <a href=\"http://boredomlab.org/\" title=\"\">Boredom Lab </a>at York University in Toronto. There researchers study boredom from social, clinical and cognitive perspectives \u2013 from shoring up the link with creativity and improving outcomes in education, to better understanding the subjective experience of mental exertion and attention \u2013 with a view to applying their findings in the real world. \u201cBut as a scientist, I wasn\u2019t convinced that everybody was using the term in the same way.\u201d</p> <p>Eastwood became interested in boredom 20 years ago, after observing a seeming \u201ccrisis of agency\u201d among young men he saw in his private psychotherapy practice. They were disengaged, under-achieving, perhaps abusing marijuana or struggling with depression, he says. Eastwood characterises their circumstance as a \u201cfailure to launch into life\u201d, which these men told him they experienced as \u201cbeing chronically bored\u201d. But what was being bored, exactly? \u201cI thought: what is this?\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Out of My Skull</em>, he and Danckert define boredom as the uncomfortable feeling of \u201cwanting to do something, but not wanting to do anything\u201d. It is not an emotion, as such, but an ongoing cognitive process where we wish to engage our minds, but nothing seems to satisfy. It is neither daydreaming, which we might find highly absorbing, nor, necessarily, vegging out on the sofa.</p> <p>It is this particular combination of lethargy and restlessness that distinguishes boredom from frustration (where a specific desire has been thwarted) and apathy (where there is no desire at all). And though boredom seems to be a risk factor for depression, it is not the same. To be bored is often thought of as a character flaw, reflecting laziness or lack of curiosity. \u201cOnly boring people get bored,\u201d goes the aphorism. \u201cI\u2019m highly motivated to prove it\u2019s not true,\u201d jokes Danckert.</p> <p>It is when we fail to act on the signal, or succumb to distractions, that the feeling of boredom becomes protracted and causes us misery. As the Booker prize winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-enright\" title=\"\">Anne Enright</a> wrote recently: \u201cBoredom is a productive state, so long as you don\u2019t let it go sour on you.\u201d It is striking that the predisposition to it is negatively perceived in a way that other personality traits aren\u2019t. Complaints of \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d are often seen as uniquely provoking, Eastwood notes. \u201cThere is this impulse in us to say, \u2018There\u2019s something wrong with you, you should not be bored.\u2019 But to simply judge them, I think, misses the point. They know there\u2019s things to do \u2013 but they can\u2019t bring their desires in the moment in line with what\u2019s there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a girl sitting on the ground looking bored\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To be bored is often thought of as a character flaw, reflecting laziness or lack of curiosity.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some people are better equipped to cope than others. In <em>Out of My Skull</em>, the psychologists compare two astronauts who responded very differently to the constraints and monotony of space exploration. Russia\u2019s Valentin Lebedev, who spent 211 days in space in the early 1980s, failed to be satisfied by the busy work dictated by ground control and, after five months, did not \u201ceven want to look out of a porthole\u201d. As commander of the International Space Station in 2013, Canadian Chris Hadfield found purpose even in plumbing repairs. The psychologists suggest it was Hadfield\u2019s intrinsic motivation to find meaning in what he was doing, and to occupy and challenge himself within the confines of his environment, that set the two astronauts apart. Hadfield claims to never be bored \u2013 but, Danckert says, it\u2019s more that \u201che just deals with it really very well\u201d.</p> <p><em><strong>In the years after</strong></em> I tore apart Mum\u2019s car, I got better at not being bored, even in testing conditions. My parents are enthusiastic sailors and most of my school holidays were spent in the close confines of their yacht, without television or internet, during sometimes long passages at sea.</p> <p>On those trips I read every book on board, regardless of interest (a dictionary; a medical encyclopaedia) or age appropriateness (pulpy Dick Francis thrillers, replete with rumpy-pumpy); and when I ran out of other people\u2019s stories, I wrote my own. I spent long periods listening to the same music. At a push, I could be alone with my thoughts, observing them with slight indifference, as though they were a TV show that had not yet hooked me.</p> <p>I considered this evidence of my extreme aversion to boredom. In fact, according to Danckert and Eastwood, I may just have developed a good response to it. Though it has not been substantiated by research, they suggest that boredom has been the push for much creativity, innovation and growth \u2013 while simultaneously a source of distress for many.</p> <p>The mistake many people make is seeking to escape the uncomfortable feeling, instead of interrogating what it is trying to tell them, says Eastwood. They may distract themselves with social media, or worse: boredom has also been shown to be a factor in unhealthy eating, as well as use of cigarettes, alcohol and drugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/612.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a man twiddling his thumbs\" width=\"612\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Boredom is a call to action, but many of us choose not to hear it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In relying on external solutions, we undermine our sense of ourselves as the authors of our own lives, and the problem may become chronic. In young people, boredom is associated with higher than average risk-taking; in the elderly, it can speed up the degenerative process of ageing. Both groups are at particular risk of depression, for which boredom is a precursor.</p> <p>Boredom-prone people also experience higher levels of anger, aggression and hostility and may be driven to look for meaning in extreme political views, or tribalism. To Danckert, that means boredom may be one part of our ever more polarised politics and public discourse. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the midst of an overload of information, one response is to shout louder,\u201d he says. Sociologist Orrin Klapp, writing in 1986, called it \u201cego-screaming\u201d and that \u201cperfectly captures Twitter trolling,\u201d says Danckert.</p> <p>The fact that our response to boredom is often destructive, adversarial or otherwise problematic speaks to just how deeply uncomfortable we find the sensation. A 2014 study found that many people chose to administer painful electric shocks to themselves rather than being left alone with their thoughts. One man shocked himself 190 times in 15 minutes.</p> <p>\u201cAll too often when we\u2019re bored, we see ourselves as passive, empty vessels to fill \u2013 we look for stimuli that will get rid of the bad feeling in the short term,\u201d says Eastwood. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t foster and grow our capacity for agency \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what we need to be free from boredom and its negative consequences.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Danckert and Eastwood</strong></em> are reluctant to blame the present problem on our preoccupation with technology alone. But it is true that tech presents us with a powerful distraction. If the goal is to simply avoid being bored, it may be easier now than ever, what with the infinite scroll of social media, endless hours of entertainment on Netflix and Spotify, and all our friends always available.</p> <p>But this over-abundance of things to do itself can exacerbate boredom. Eastwood evokes the \u201cparadox of choice\u201d, saying \u201coptions are not necessarily freeing and do not necessarily make us happy\u201d. Seeking relief on the internet \u201ccan feel like trying to drink from a fire hose\u201d Danckert and Eastwood write. Not only that, in hijacking our attention, technology may, over time, compound the issue it seems to alleviate. \u201cIt takes time and attention to scroll through Instagram or play Candy Crush, but at the end of it, you\u2019re not satisfied, because you didn\u2019t do the harder work of figuring out: \u2018What do I really want to do?\u2019 It\u2019s a vicious cycle: you got some engagement, but it wasn\u2019t the thing you needed,\u201d says Danckert. That is the challenge that boredom lays down, he says: \u201cto figure out what is going to be meaningful and useful to you in your life\u201d.</p> <p>Becoming better attuned to our own inner states can allay the discomfort and illuminate a satisfying course of action. Mindfulness, which fosters a non-judgmental response to one\u2019s thoughts (as I now know I practised on my parents\u2019 boat), has been linked to lower levels of boredom. Danckert lets his mind wander on his three-mile walk to work , thinking of \u201cthe dumbest things \u2013 but it is engaging to just follow those threads and see where they lead you\u201d.</p> <p>Eastwood\u2019s own ritual is making time to sit and think, with a cup of tea \u2013 a period of \u201cconstructive internal reflection\u201d, during which he connects with his internal compass. Uncomfortable feelings steer us for the better, he says. \u201cJust as it\u2019s good that we have the capacity for pain, to keep us safe, it\u2019s good that we have the capacity for boredom, because it saves us from the ruin of stagnation. It keeps us moving forward and searching for a better way of applying ourselves, for engaging in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Received in that spirit, boredom can be a call to action \u2013 but many of us choose not to hear it. Wincing, I admit to Danckert that I have opened Twitter, scrolled for a while, become bored with scrolling, closed Twitter, then immediately opened Twitter again, almost instinctively. I do this embarrassingly often, I tell him \u2013 it\u2019s just easier to push through boredom on the internet, rather than taking it as a cue to log off.</p> <p>Danckert reiterates, not without sympathy, I think, that at moments like that it is better to \u201cjust do something\u201d. It does not necessarily have to align with some higher purpose in life \u2013 simply putting down my phone will break the cycle of unsatisfying engagement, and reinforce my own sense of my autonomy.</p> <p>Within weeks of our interview, a global pandemic takes hold, and I count myself lucky to just be bored. Confined to my home, I spend more time alone with my thoughts, wondering about what I might want to do once all this is over. I spend less time on my phone. I read my flatmate\u2019s books that have rested on our communal shelf for years without ever piquing my curiosity. I bake, for the first time since childhood. Constraints that might have been boring are in fact oddly motivational.</p> <p>As Danckert and Eastwood write in <em>Out of My Skull</em>, when we are \u201cconstantly carried along by a fast-moving stream, we can forget how to swim for ourselves\u201d. It is this that boredom seeks to remind us of, they suggest \u2013 that we are the authors of our lives, even now they\u2019ve been derailed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/1650_634_3773_2265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a girl, sitting on the floor, using her phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Confined to my home, I spend more time alone with my thoughts, wondering about what I might want to do once all this is over.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: L.hunt/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How to avoid boredom</h2> <p><strong>1. Don\u2019t fight the feeling.</strong> Boredom is uncomfortable, but you make it worse by layering suffering on top. Think of when you twist your ankle \u2013 you feel pain without berating yourself for being clumsy, or fretting about a chronic injury. Feeling bored is unavoidable, but it is not a judgment on your character or ability.</p> <p><strong>2. Create a new routine.</strong> Boredom flourishes within constraints. In the absence of ordinary routines and busyness, it may feel like you are stagnating. Try to find another gear \u2013 one that may not be as high-energy, or productive, but is full at the same time.</p> <p><strong>3. Find purpose.</strong> Boredom is not an absence of things to do, it is the struggle to find value in any of the options available to you. Being able to connect with a reason \u201cwhy\u201d for doing something (including quarantine) can make it less boring. Instead of agitating for anything to do, try to determine what\u2019s really important \u2013 whether right now, or for the future.</p> <p><strong>4. Avoid passive consumption.</strong> It is all too easy to binge Netflix or scroll social media. If you\u2019re enjoying yourself, there\u2019s no problem, but treating yourself as a passive consumer may mean you are more likely to feel bored. You need to feel engaged.</p> <p><em>Out of My Skull (Harvard University Press, \u00a322.95) is </em><em>out in June</em><em>.

  "<p>Detained at home with time to write instant books, two septuagenarian sages here make very different attempts to wrest a meaning or moral from the coronavirus pandemic. The Slovenian theorist Slavoj \u017di\u017eek treats the disease as an intellectual malaise from which we will only be rescued by a \u201cphilosophical revolution\u201d; John Lennox, an Oxford mathematician who moonlights as a Christian evangelist, approaches Covid-19 as a theological conundrum and tries to explain why God seems so unbothered by our distress. While clinicians work on decoding the coronavirus, \u017di\u017eek unhelpfully inflates it to an imaginary bogey, a \u201cspectral fantasy\u201d. In the absence of a vaccine, Lennox prescribes prayer, which at least is better advice than injecting bleach.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/jan/13/observer-profile-slavoj-zizek-opera\">\u017di\u017eek</a> deplores our superstitions about the virus as a regression to \u201cpre-modern thinking\u201d and in <em>Pandemic!</em> he rethinks the crisis with the aid of the usual postmodern gurus. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/apr/15/artsandhumanities.highereducation\">Michel Foucault</a>\u2019s account of the disciplinary state prompts him to mock hygiene rules: warned against touching our faces, are we being told not to play with ourselves? (Well, no, because the health authorities in New York have officially recommended masturbation to the shut-in users of dating apps, advising \u201dyou are your safest sex partner\u201d.) Drawing on the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, \u017di\u017eek says that a blindly self-replicating pathogen has loosened our hold on reality and exposed \u201cthe ultimate abyss of our being\u201d. The remedy is a dose of updated Marx: because the pandemic is a byproduct of global capitalism, the solution must be \u201csome kind of reinvented communism\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Agony like that caused by the coronavirus can be an aid to what Lennox calls \u201ccharacter formation\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pandemic reminds \u017di\u017eek of the alien invasion in HG Wells\u2019s <em>The</em> <em>War of the Worlds</em>, where humanity is fortuitously spared because the Martians have no resistance to microbes, \u201cthe humblest things that God, in his wisdom, put upon this Earth\u201d. But what if it were God who, in his malice, concocted coronavirus in the first place? In the Old Testament, the vindictive ogre whips up an exterminating deluge, followed later by the 10 plagues of Egypt. <a href=\"https://www.johnlennox.org/\">Lennox</a>, however, is anxious to rule out divine retribution and in <em>Where </em><em>Is God in a Coronavirus World?</em> he declares that the \u201cwonderful and good capacity\u201d of free will with which the creator endowed us \u201calso makes us capable of evil\u201d. This means, I assume, that airborne contagion must be a consequence of our bad choices. It\u2019s a grotesque notion, though it could be applied to the Trump-loving protesters against lockdown in American states: for them, liberty means the right to go back to the diner or the nail salon and to die after doing so.</p> <p>Lennox backtracks by defining Covid-19 as a specimen of \u201cnatural evil\u201d, which sounds like an invitation to demonise the bats, civet cats and scaly anteaters at the Wuhan market, even though they too are surely God\u2019s creatures. As so often, theology stumbles over the problem of undeserved suffering and Lennox defies both logic and common decency when he contends that Covid-19 might turn out to be a blessing in disguise. Viruses, he insists, \u201care in the main beneficial\u201d. They recycle nutrients through food chains, regulate which species eat what and keep ecosystems functioning smoothly; a medical researcher therefore calls them \u201cunsung heroes\u201d, as if they were selfless NHS workers. Agony like that caused by the coronavirus can be an aid to what Lennox calls \u201ccharacter formation\u201d: after all, \u201cAmerican football, British rugby and boxing\u201d demonstrate that \u201centhusiasts will put up with a great deal of pain in order to excel\u201d. So should we admire the sporty zeal of patients on ventilators and see them as athletes in training for some spiritual version of the Tokyo Olympics?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4dd910bd08d3ea326edba06100b5d6112814e7bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dd910bd08d3ea326edba06100b5d6112814e7bc/0_0_3744_5616/667.jpg\" alt=\"For Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, the pandemic has already resulted in \u2018some kind of ethical progress\u2019\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, the pandemic has already resulted in \u2018some kind of ethical progress\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By contrast with this happy talk, \u017di\u017eek describes the virus as \u201ca dark shadow\u201d that will continue to haunt us. At one point, he pictures it as a ghoul from a horror movie, calling it \u201cundead\u201d like a vampire or zombie. Elsewhere, he visualises this invisible enemy as a sci-fi monster: like Wells\u2019s Martians sucking blood from their human prey, it is a parasite with a \u201cstupidly repetitive, pre-sexual life\u201d that uses the bodies of those it infects as \u201cits copying machine\u201d. Television news reports show us a purple grenade studded with spiky red coronets; \u017di\u017eek\u2019s less decorative image is grislier and truer.</p> <p>Lennox may be God\u2019s apologist, but it is \u017di\u017eek, paradoxically identified as \u201ca Christian atheist\u201d, who does a better job of deriving good from evil. Invoking Hegel\u2019s idea of a spirit that pervades nature, he calculates that the pandemic has already resulted in \u201csome kind of ethical progress\u201d: next time you deliver an elderly neighbour\u2019s groceries, please consider your act of kindness an exercise in transcendental idealism. But \u017di\u017eek zanily overdoes it when he volunteers to grapple with the devil and harrow hell. He says that he sometimes longs to contract the virus, which would demystify the \u201cspectral agent\u201d and drag it down into physical reality. I\u2019d advise him to be careful what he wishes for.</p> <p>Housebound isolation even leads \u017di\u017eek to liken himself to \u201cChrist on the cross\u201d, abandoned by God but accompanied on Calvary by Julian Assange, who is crucified \u201cin his prison cell, with no visits permitted\u201d. Despite such grandiosity, \u017di\u017eek does acknowledge the stress or dread we are all experiencing. Lennox is more glibly optimistic. Playing on words, he makes the coronavirus mutate into the \u201ccrown of thorns\u201d worn by Christ, which somehow enables him to conclude that the pandemic may ultimately prove to be \u201cvery healthy\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps as a sign of desperation, \u017di\u017eek\u2019s book begins in the same way that Lennox\u2019s ends: both ponder Christ\u2019s resurrection, luckily without noting the coincidence of BoJo\u2019s emergence from hospital on Easter Sunday. \u017di\u017eek remembers the risen Christ telling Mary Magdalene not to touch him and ingeniously links this with the protocols of physical distancing. We must learn, he says, to transmit emotion by semaphore, relying on a \u201cdeep look\u201d into someone\u2019s eyes rather than a handshake. Lennox finishes with another slippery pun, promising that when Christ next reappears he will perform a mass coronation and award \u201cthe crown of righteousness\u201d to those who have kept the faith. We\u2019re given no date for the saviour\u2019s second coming: let\u2019s hope that while we wait we\u2019ll be reprieved by medical science.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Pandemic!

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Warren Buffett says \u2018world has changed\u2019 for airlines</h2> <p>Warren Buffett, the legendary American investor, has dumped his firm\u2019s holdings in the four major US airlines, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/warren-buffett-dumps-us-airline-stocks-saying-world-has-changed-after-covid-19\">warning that the \u201cworld has changed\u201d</a> for the aviation industry in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. In comments that will send shockwaves through financial markets already pulverised by the economic shock of the outbreak, Buffett said the outbreak could have an \u201cextraordinarily wide\u201d range of possible economic outcomes.</p> <h2>Global cases near 3.5 million as death toll approaches 250,000</h2> <p>According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker there were 3,428,422 confirmed cases worldwide on Sunday, with 243,831 people losing their lives to the disease. The US continues to be the most affected country, with more than 1.3 million cases and 66,385 deaths.</p> <h2>Only 17% of Brits want schools, pubs and restaurants reopened</h2> <p>Fewer than one in five Britons believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The findings, in a new poll for the <em>Observer</em>, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-easing-uk-lockdown-require-tough-enforcement-rules\">ease the lockdown</a> soon. The poll by Opinium, taken between Wednesday and Friday last week, found 17% of people think the conditions have been met to consider reopening schools, against 67% who say they have not been, and that they should stay closed.</p> <h2>Half of UK doctors say they have had to source their own PPE</h2> <p>Almost half of Britain\u2019s doctors<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/nearly-half-of-british-doctors-forced-to-find-their-own-ppe-new-data-shows\"> have sourced their own personal protective equipment</a> or relied on a donation when none was available through normal NHS channels, according to a survey. The British Medical Association said its latest survey was the biggest of frontline NHS staff during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <h2><strong>European leaders join forces to combat Covid-19</strong></h2> <p>European leaders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/european-leaders-join-forces-to-combat-covid-19\">have pledged to raise billions of pounds</a> to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 as part of an \u201cinternational alliance\u201d fighting the disease. An online pledging conference due to be held on Monday will aim to pull in \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a36.6bn) in funding to support the global response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <h2>YouTube deletes conspiracy theorist David Icke\u2019s account</h2> <p>The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old conspiracy theorist David Icke had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/02/youtube-deletes-coronavirus-conspiracy-theorist-david-ickes-channel\">violated its policies</a> on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.</p> <h2>India imposes jail lockdowns as virus spreads in overcrowded prisons</h2> <p>The spread of the coronavirus in India\u2019s notoriously crowded prisons has prompted authorities to impose jail lockdowns and release thousands of pretrial detainees on parole, as health experts worry that the cramped facilities are serving as breeding grounds for the disease. Although there are no official numbers on how many inmates have been infected by the virus, India\u2019s correction facilities are slowly recording more infections and have temporarily banned visitors.</p> <h2>Boris Johnson\u2019s doctors had plan to announce his death</h2> <p>Boris Johnson has revealed that doctors prepared to announce his death as he spent three nights in intensive care last month. Britain\u2019s PM told the Sun on Sunday: \u201cThey had a strategy to deal with a \u2018death of Stalin\u2019-type scenario. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.\u201d Johnson, 55, said: \u201cThe bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.\u201d</p> <h2>Travel within China surges</h2> <p>China\u2019s most populous cities saw a leap in outbound travellers, tourists and day-trippers on 1 May, first day of a long holiday weekend, led by Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic that first struck the country late last year. The number of people travelling outside their home cities jumped nearly 50% at the start of the Labour Day weekend, compared with the first day of the Tomb Sweeping holiday on 4 April, according to Reuters calculations on data from China\u2019s internet giant Baidu Inc.</p>",

  "<p>All hail to Catherine Bennett for calling out Jonathan Sumption (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/25/lift-the-lockdown-on-the-say-so-of-a-tory-with-an-empathy-bypass-no-thanks-catherine-bennett\" title=\"\">A growing clamour of voices treats the pandemic as if it\u2019s just health and safety gone mad</a>\u201d, Comment). She quotes him as saying that previous generations, subjected to worse plagues than the coronavirus, \u201cwould not have understood all the fuss\u201d. As a retired QC, may I lend support to Bennett\u2019s condemnation. Sumption\u2019s exalted status as a retired justice of the supreme court cannot be allowed to blanket out his disregard for the jurisprudence that has evolved in relation to article 2 of the European convention on human rights, which states that \u201ceveryone\u2019s right to life shall be protected by law\u201d. To which I would add that Sumption is a lawyer and a historian, not a scientist or an epidemiologist. In this crisis, I rather incline to the view that the advice of the latter professions is what we should heed.<br><strong>Donald MacLeod</strong><br>Edinburgh<br></p> <p>Catherine Bennett writes against easing the lockdown from a position of privilege. The ultimate solution to the crisis lies in either a vaccine or herd immunity. Given that the vaccine is at least a year away, and that herd immunity has been abandoned as a strategy, waves of lockdown look likely to be with us for the next 12 months or so. This might not bother those who can continue to draw a salary (or a pension) while working at home, those who don\u2019t suffer from domestic abuse or live alone, those whose mental health hasn\u2019t nosedived or who aren\u2019t among the 5 million gig economy workers for whom time has now run out.</p> <p>Further afield, Oxfam warns that shutting down economies could plunge more than half a billion people into poverty. How are they to be factored in to the equation that churns out the lockdown answer to the question, what is to be done?<br><strong>Andrew Dobson</strong><br>Keele, Staffs<br></p> <h2>Reasons to be cheerful<br></h2> <p>Phillip Inman rightly says Nobel prize-winning economist Sir Angus Deaton, Harvard\u2019s Amartya Sen and the Bank of England\u2019s Andy Haldane offer \u201creasons for optimism\u201d about increased global cooperation after the coronavirus crisis (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/25/collective-action-coronavirus-recession-inequality-living-standards\" title=\"\">It\u2019s in all our interests to become a more caring society</a>\u201d, Economics). Likewise, Jared Diamond, Pulitzer prize-winning professor of geography, told BBC2\u2019s <em>Newsnight</em>: \u201cI am cautiously optimistic that what we\u2019ll learn from dealing with this problem of moderate importance [Covid-19] will help in dealing with much more important problems\u201d, such as climate change and resource overexploitation.</p> <p>Before the pandemic, Diamond predicted that \u201cthe chances are about 49% that the world as we know it will collapse by about 2050\u201d. Post-coronavirus, he estimates the chances of survival of the planet\u2019s present network of civilisation as having gone up from 51% to a still very sobering but improved 58% by 2050.<br><strong>Joe McCarthy</strong><br>Dublin<br></p> <h2>An honest appraisal<br></h2> <p>There is one sense in which Boris Johnson will fail to be honest with the voters (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/will-boris-johnsons-brush-with-death-prompt-him-to-talk-more-honestly-andrew-rawnsley\" title=\"\">Will Boris Johnson\u2019s brush with death prompt him to talk more honestly?</a>\u201d, Comment). What has to be accepted is that the threat posed by Covid-19 will remain and that living with that will be the new normal. Society and the economy need to be organised so as to minimise the threat.

Other factors predating the crisis are also at work: this year\u2019s price-cutting war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, overproduction resulting in crude oil surpluses and a chronic lack of storage capacity.</p> <p>Yet conventional market explanations obscure a bigger, more exciting story. It is the story of the green, clean energy revolution, of rapidly expanding use of wind and solar power and the prospective end of the fossil fuel era.

Rambal, then 33, was the technical expertise behind the Oswals\u2019 new project.</p> \n<p>Together they set up Burrup Fertilisers. Norwegian company Yara took a 30% share as it was to be the main customer of the output of the plant.</p> \n<p>But within days of the ribbon cutting, attended by the Western Australian premier in May 2006, the partnership began unravelling in spectacular fashion. Rambal accused Oswal of diverting funds via the offshore structures, and Oswal locked him out of the offices.</p> \n<p>Rambal sued in the WA supreme court but settled six months later, giving up his 15% share in Burrup for an undisclosed sum, reported variously to have been $70m or $85m.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/oswals-fled-aust-when-game-was-up-court-told-20160711-gq3drk\">drama reached a climax in 2010</a> when Oswal and his glamorous wife, Radhika, suddenly left Australia, three days after the ANZ bank and Yara accused him of misusing $150m of company funds for personal expenses and sought to put the company into receivership.</p> \n<p>Some of those funds are said to have been poured into a $70m mansion in Peppermint Grove, dubbed the Taj Mahal on the Swan, that the Oswals were midway through building when they fled.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3fc0b8d8e1f9a9c5e724eb5b54c08cd44dead2b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3fc0b8d8e1f9a9c5e724eb5b54c08cd44dead2b/0_144_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Oswals\u2019 unfinished $70m Perth mansion, dubbed the Taj Mahal on the Swan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Oswals\u2019 unfinished $70m Perth mansion, dubbed the Taj Mahal on the Swan, was eventually demolished.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lloyd Jones/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The rest, the ANZ alleged in court, had gone into the family trust ($60m), luxury yachts, private plane charters, a chain of vegetarian restaurants in London and other luxuries.</p> \n<p>There is no suggestion that Rambal was implicated in the events after he left the company.</p> \n<p>Yara emerged as the owner of the plant, which exports much of its production.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Australia drank the free-trade juice and decided that off-shoring was OK.

Rambal argued he owed less than $10m. The case was settled out of court in 2016.</p> \n<p>The Collie project faltered after Griffin Coal sold its mine to Lanco Infratech which reneged on the 25-year coal supply contract.</p> \n<p>Rambal headed to the WA supreme court, claiming damages of $3.5bn. It was settled in April 2013 for $7.5m.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/about-800000-australians-lost-their-job-in-the-first-three-weeks-of-coronavirus-restrictions\">Australia likely to experience largest economic downturn since the Great Depression</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But a fertiliser plant remained an ambition and by 2018 Rambal was again talking up a new $4.5bn mega-project, known as Project Destiny, back at the Burrup peninsula near Karratha, where he and Oswal had built the first plant.</p> \n<p>In November 2018 Perdaman announced it had signed <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/west-australia-set-for-43b-urea-plant-after-woodside-gas-deal-20181121-h185dn\">a 25-year binding gas deal with Woodside</a> and the environmental impact statement is now on exhibition.</p> \n<p>The project will almost certainly meet some objections. There have been growing concerns about the impact of emissions from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/06/western-australia-chemical-plants-threaten-40000-year-old-rock-art\">Yara\u2019s ammonium nitrate production on the world heritage-listed rock art at Burrup</a>, thought to be 50,000 years old.</p> \n<p>Whether Perdaman has the financial clout to build not one but two fertiliser plants \u2013 Project Destiny and the Narrabri project \u2013 is difficult to gauge.</p> \n<p>Back at the Covid commission, a spokesman insists the body has an advisory role only, and won\u2019t be deciding on projects.</p> \n<p>Under planning norms, the fate of Perdaman\u2019s Project Destiny rests with the WA government. The Narrabri project depends on whether the NSW government approves the Santos gas project and then the Perdaman project.</p> \n<p>But these are extraordinary times. A full court press can be expected from the federal government and its ministers who continue to champion gas as the answer to Australia\u2019s energy needs.</p> \n<p>In their sights will be the east coast states that have balked at expanding coal seam gas because of its environmental impacts and resistance from farming communities.</p> \n<p>The question those concerned at the direction of a post-coronavirus recovery may ask is whether a commission set up by the Coalition will, while delivering the objectives of ensuring the state health systems have the supplies they need and the supermarkets are properly stocked, also pander to the government\u2019s plan.</p> \n<p>The early signs are the commission intends to pursue a much wider and contentious agenda of opening up the onshore gas industry, fast tracking an expansion of the petrochemical industry and building pipelines across the nation.</p>",

That is the grim message from doctors and psychologists who last week warned that even after lockdown measures had been lifted thousands of individuals would still be suffering.</p> \n  <p>Some of these problems will be due directly to the impact that the virus has had on those it has infected, especially those who went through life-saving interventions in intensive care units (ICUs) in hospital. In addition there will be a considerable impact on vulnerable people affected by the lockdown and isolation.</p> \n  <p>As a result, there is a danger our society could become more anxious and risk-averse, say scientists who have called for a range of research programmes to be launched to understand the issues and to allow society to prepare itself for the physiological and psychological problems that lie ahead.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis has been a national trauma like no other that we have experienced,\u201d said psychologist Professor Dame Til Wykes, of King\u2019s College London. \u201cConsider the terrible flooding we had earlier this year. People watched river levels rise and listened to weather forecasts to find out if they might be inundated the next day or the day after. That was stressful.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut it was nothing compared to this threat which has hung over us for weeks already and is likely to go on for much longer. Spending months looking over your shoulder all the time is going to cause considerable, lasting anxiety for many people. In addition, if you look at other natural disasters, you can usually find help or comfort from people around you. However, it is the people around you that are the threat in this case. So there is no consolation there.\u201d</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/coronavirus-britons-health-problems-covid-19\">Britons will suffer health problems from Covid-19 for years, warn doctors</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead84a58f082b32fdd6c13c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:47:30.560Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Migrants allowed off Italy's quarantine ferry</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>About 180 migrants rescued at sea and held in isolation on an Italian ferry off the coast of Sicily will be disembarked in Palermo on Monday, AFP reports, citing the Avvenire daily.</p> \n  <p>The migrants had been pulled to safety in two separate operations by NGO rescue vessels and placed on the Rubattino ferry after Italy closed its ports due to the coronavirus epidemic.</p> \n  <p>All had tested negative for the virus.</p> \n  <p> Far-right politician Matteo Salvini is to stand trial after he blocked migrants from disembarking from a coastguard boat while he was interior minister last year.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>He had insisted they not be allowed off until a deal was made with the EU over who had duty of care for them.</p> \n  <p>It was not yet known whether the 183 people disembarking on Monday, including two women and 44 unaccompanied minors, would be sent to other EU countries.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:53:57.800Z\">at 3.53pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead841f8f087d47c77881ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:30:57.561Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/afghanistan-in-new-battle-against-ravages-of-covid-19\">Civil war, poverty and now the virus: Afghanistan stands on the brink</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:31:05.676Z\">at 3.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead81bf8f082b32fdd6c11a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:20:58.734Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/scotgov/status/1256589349514285066\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As of 2pm today, 58,833 people in Scotland have been tested for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a><br><br>46,906 confirmed negative<br>11,927 positive<br><br>1,559 patients who tested positive have sadly died.<br><br>Latest update \u27a1\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/kZjGNz2EDe\">https://t.co/kZjGNz2EDe</a><br>Health advice \u27a1\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/l7rqArB6Qu\">https://t.co/l7rqArB6Qu</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID%E3%83%BC19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID\u30fc19</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jJU0Sp8xGL\">pic.twitter.com/jJU0Sp8xGL</a></p>\u2014 Scottish Government (@scotgov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scotgov/status/1256589349514285066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 2, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead80128f0806a479811ec5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:19:04.212Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Reuters reports on the conservative groups advising the US government that have issued an array of coronavirus economic reopening plans.

But the agency has had a low profile during this pandemic, with White House officials controlling communications and leading most press briefings.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis report seems to challenge the idea that the China travel ban in late January was instrumental in changing the trajectory of this pandemic in the United States,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health.</p> \n  <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly celebrated a federal decision, announced on 31 January, to stop entry into the US of any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days. That took effect on 2 February. </p> \n  <p>China had imposed its own travel restrictions earlier, and travel out of its outbreak areas did indeed drop dramatically.</p> \n  <p>But in her article, Schuchat noted that nearly 2 million travellers arrived in the US from Italy and other European countries during February. The US government didn\u2019t block travel from there until 11 March.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe extensive travel from Europe, once Europe was having outbreaks, really accelerated our importations and the rapid spread,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cI think the timing of our travel alerts should have been earlier.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She also noted in the article that more than 100 people who had been on nine separate Nile River cruises during February and early March had come to the U.S. and tested positive for the virus, nearly doubling the number of known U.S. cases at that time.</p> \n  <p>Schuchat also noted the explosive effect of some late February mass gatherings, including a scientific meeting in Boston, the Mardis Gras celebration in New Orleans and a funeral in Albany, Georgia.
