  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>US vice-president\u2019s staffer tests positive for coronavirus</h2> <p>Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary, who is married to one of Donald Trump\u2019s senior advisers, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/08/coronavirus-live-news-trump-cdc-guidance-russia-germany-france-brazil-who-190000-could-die-in-africa?page=with:block-5eb5b5ac8f0858b1a8106bee#block-5eb5b5ac8f0858b1a8106bee\">tested positive for coronavirus</a>. President Trump said that he had not spent time with Katie Miller himself, but that she had spent time with Mike Pence. The vice-president had been tested and the result was negative, he added.</p> <h2>Trump: \u2018Virus will go away without vaccine\u2019</h2> <p>Donald Trump has alleged that coronavirus is \u201cgoing to go away <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/08/coronavirus-live-news-trump-cdc-guidance-russia-germany-france-brazil-who-190000-could-die-in-africa?page=with:block-5eb5a6d68f08c0a2409ba688#block-5eb5a6d68f08c0a2409ba688\">without a vaccine</a>\u201d, but warned there could be \u201cflare ups\u201d next year. Speaking to Republican members of Congress on Friday, he did not offer any scientific evidence for that prediction.</p> <h2>Madrid and Barcelona denied permission to ease lockdown</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/08/coronavirus-live-news-trump-cdc-guidance-russia-germany-france-brazil-who-190000-could-die-in-africa?page=with:block-5eb58f5a8f0858b1a8106acd#block-5eb58f5a8f0858b1a8106acd\">Madrid </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/08/coronavirus-live-news-trump-cdc-guidance-russia-germany-france-brazil-who-190000-could-die-in-africa?page=with:block-5eb5abac8f0858b1a8106bc1#block-5eb5abac8f0858b1a8106bc1\">Barcelona</a> will not progress to the next phase of Spain\u2019s exit from lockdown, which would allow bars, restaurants and places of worship to open with limited capacity, after failing to meet the Spanish government\u2019s criteria for an easing of restrictions. The country is conducting a four-stage end to lockdown, contingent on factors including the rate of infection in the region. Catalonia, whose capital is Barcelona, and Madrid account for nearly half of Spain\u2019s cases of infection.</p> <h2>Colombian capital lifts gendered shopping restrictions</h2> <p>Bogota will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/08/coronavirus-live-news-trump-cdc-guidance-russia-germany-france-brazil-who-190000-could-die-in-africa?page=with:block-5eb5a6b08f0858b1a8106bad#block-5eb5a6b08f0858b1a8106bad\">lift restrictions</a> which required men and women to shop on separate days, the city\u2019s mayor has said. The rules, which have been in place for nearly a month, will end on Monday. Similar measures have been put in place across Latin America, and have been criticised by LGBT groups and transgender people who say these restrictions have exposed them to discrimination and violence from people questioning their right to be out.</p> <h2>US blocks UN vote on lockdown ceasefire</h2> <p>The US has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/08/coronavirus-live-news-trump-cdc-guidance-russia-germany-france-brazil-who-190000-could-die-in-africa?page=with:block-5eb59f978f08c0a2409ba64c#block-5eb59f978f08c0a2409ba64c\">blocked a vote</a> on a UN security council resolution to support secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019s call for a global ceasefire during the Covid-19 pandemic. After more than six weeks of negotiation over the terminology of the resolution, with the US wanting no reference to the World Health Organization, there was cautious optimism a solution had been found when the wording was changed to exclude direct reference to the WHO. However, the US signalled on Friday the motion was still unacceptable, preventing the resolution from moving forward.</p> <h2>German state reimposes lockdown measures</h2> <p>Local authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia<strong> </strong>are set to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/08/coronavirus-live-news-trump-cdc-guidance-russia-germany-france-brazil-who-190000-could-die-in-africa?page=with:block-5eb5a2fd8f08464cd4296d82#block-5eb5a2fd8f08464cd4296d82\">reimpose some lockdown measures</a> after seeing a rise in new coronavirus cases. At a slaughterhouse in the Coesfeld district, 150 of 1,200 employees tested positive. The rise has caused officials to postpone the lifting of restrictions \u2013 which would have seen restaurants, fitness studios, tourist spots and larger shops reopen on 11 May \u2013 for one week.</p>",
  "<p>Somehow the quiet made it louder. By rights, marking the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of VE Day in the midst of a pandemic that has confined us to our homes \u2013 forcing us to keep our distance from one another, denying us the right to gather in crowds \u2013 should have muffled this commemoration. A celebration in private would surely feel like no celebration at all. Katherine Jenkins singing to an empty Albert Hall, streets with no street parties and the pubs all shut: how could that add up to anything other than a damp squib?</p> <p>And yet Friday\u2019s marking of the end of the second world war struck a deeper chord than it might, had it been just another sunny bank holiday. Yes, the usual rituals had to be suspended. There could be no wreath-laying at local memorials; instead, Prince Charles and Camilla laid two small wreaths on their own, in a crowdless corner of Balmoral, watched by a lone piper. There could be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/alone-with-union-jack-ve-day-veterans-90s-miss-out\"> no veterans\u2019 parades</a>, no reunions for those who had served, no grateful handshakes from the politicians: 102-year-old former staff sergeant Ernie Horsfall had to make do with a Zoom call from Boris Johnson. And there were limited opportunities for silliness: the Winston Churchill impersonators were all dressed up with nowhere to go,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/08/ve-day-2020-75th-anniversary-two-minute-silence-red-arrows-flypast-live?page=with:block-5eb53bd88f08464cd429689f#block-5eb53bd88f08464cd429689f\"> forced to perform their cigar-and-V-sign shtick online</a>.</p> <p>All the same, Britons seemed more conscious of this 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary than previous ones. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/06/boom-in-bunting-sales-as-britons-set-to-celebrate-ve-day-at-home\">Manufacturers of bunting and flags reported record sales</a>, busier than for any previous VE Day commemoration, busier even than in the summer of 2012 when the London Olympics and Queen\u2019s diamond jubilee coincided.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1520dd9211ffda40da0d3c0059b4f352a7bd222\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1520dd9211ffda40da0d3c0059b4f352a7bd222/0_149_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Charles and Camilla Duchess of Cornwall mark the VE Day 75th anniversary in Balmoral, Scotland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Charles and Camilla Duchess of Cornwall mark the VE Day 75th anniversary in Balmoral, Scotland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Muir/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Britons in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic should seize on the memory of the allies\u2019 victory in Europe. After all, the second world war has hovered over this crisis from the start. The instant lockdown was declared, headline writers and politicians alike invoked the Blitz spirit, implicitly urging us to keep calm and carry on. In those early days, fear of a return to the wartime ration book sent many to the supermarkets to stock up, even to wrestle with each other for rolls of toilet paper. As Churchill\u2019s grandson, the former MP Nicholas Soames, reflected in a BBC interview on Thursday, seven decades ago people had had to get by on one egg a week, but \u201cthese days there\u2019s practically a riot if you can\u2019t get strawberries in November\u201d.</p> <p>But the last war is the lens through which we see ourselves even in good times \u2013 a decent run in the World Cup has us dusting off the parallels \u2013 so it\u2019s hardly a shock that we do the same when facing a menace that has killed tens of thousands in a matter of weeks. That association has been certified from the top. The Queen made the connection in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/queen-urges-britons-stay-strong-coronavirus-covid-lockdown\">the TV address she delivered last month</a>, when she channelled Vera Lynn to promise the country that \u201cwe will meet again\u201d, and VE Day was bound to be no different.</p> <p>In a broadcast timed for the exact hour \u2013 9pm \u2013 when George VI addressed the nation on 8 May 1945, his daughter offered a message of encouragement loud with wartime echoes. \u201cNever give up, never despair,\u201d she said, phrases with a distinctly Churchillian cadence. And then, as she had in April, she reassured Britons that they were every bit as strong as their forebears: \u201cWe are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.\u201d</p> <p>The link between Covid-19 and the war has found a human face besides that of the monarch and it was on display again on Friday. It\u2019s not a coincidence that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/hes-just-a-wonderful-man-how-captain-tom-became-a-superstar-fundraiser\">Captain Tom Moore </a>has been the anointed talisman of this crisis, raising north of \u00a331m by walking 100 times around his garden to mark his 100<sup>th</sup> birthday. Moore \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/30/captain-tom-promoted-to-colonel-on-100th-birthday-in-flood-of-cards\">now elevated to the status of both honorary colonel and national treasure</a> \u2013 embodies the notion that there is a continuity of British resilience, that the same collective backbone that enabled us to see off Hitler will allow us to \u201csend coronavirus packing\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/boris-johnson-uk-can-turn-tide-of-coronavirus-in-12-weeks\">as Johnson put it before he himself was struck down</a>. It was all but ordained that the hero of this hour would be a second world war veteran. Only someone who had contributed to our finest hour could steel us for one of our darkest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4939d17a4504c07aec61e602335bae2dd262f918\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4939d17a4504c07aec61e602335bae2dd262f918/0_167_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Royal Navy veteran, Charles Medhurst, 95, walks along his street for a victory parade as his neighbours cheer and clap in Greenwich, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Royal Navy veteran, Charles Medhurst, 95, walks along his street for a victory parade as his neighbours cheer and clap in Greenwich, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vickie Flores/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even so, coronavirus and the war that ended 75 years ago make an odd fit. For one thing, war and disease are not the same. Covid-19 reduces no buildings to rubble; it drops no bombs from the sky. It will not send a general and an admiral, in dress uniforms, to sign an unconditional surrender. There will be no moment when, at the stroke of midnight, we can declare that the war is over.</p> <p>And even if there were, we know that we are nowhere near it. Those who listened to the BBC\u2019s rebroadcast of Churchill\u2019s 3pm victory speech, granting Britons a \u201cbrief period of rejoicing\u201d, knew that the two stories were out of sync. Joan Bakewell recalled on this site her childhood memories of VE Day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/ve-day-coronavirus-1945\">the day \u201cthe great deadly cloud of threat lifted\u201d</a>. But that deadly cloud still looms over a country whose official death toll from the virus is now the highest in Europe, above 30,000 and rising.</p> <p>For a moment, and by a benign quirk of timing, it seemed as if the anniversary might coincide with a measure of relief. \u201cHappy Monday,\u201d promised <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1258153630907224067/photo/1\">Thursday\u2019s Sun on its front page</a>, suggesting the government was poised to ease the lockdown, in line with its decision to ditch the slogan \u2013 with its wartime ring \u2013 \u201cStay home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d. That now seems to have been another bit of bungled comms by a government that is making a habit of them. Even if it\u2019s not true that social distancing will endure into 2021, or that a vaccine could take several years to develop, plenty of Britons will feel that, when it comes to the war against the coronavirus, we are rather closer to 3 September 1939 than we are to 8 May 1945.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ae265d3c460184820b98e4d2816da24b82ae203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ae265d3c460184820b98e4d2816da24b82ae203/0_453_5408_3244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking to 102-year-old war veteran Ernie Horsfall, from the cabinet room inside 10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking to 102-year-old war veteran Ernie Horsfall, from the cabinet room inside 10 Downing Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is another difference, one that can feel like bad form to mention. Britain may have stood alone for a valiant year of the war, but it did not end it that way. Victory in Europe was a victory of an alliance, won at a high cost in British, Commonwealth, American and especially Russian blood. Not for nothing did Churchill\u2019s VE day speech spill over with \u201cgratitude to our splendid allies\u201d.</p> <p>But there is no such alliance, and all too little global cooperation, in the war against the virus. At the desk where Franklin D Roosevelt once sat now lurks Donald J Trump, who first denied that a threat existed at all and whose energies since have been devoted not to leading a worldwide effort to defeat it \u2013 a task for which the United States is uniquely equipped \u2013 but to finding someone to blame for the fatal havoc it is wreaking (usually Democratic state governors, the media, China or all three). Trump shows nothing but contempt for the global institutions created after 1945, designed to ensure that the peoples of the world would face future perils together \u2013 institutions that are now creaking under the strain.</p> <p>Britain stands especially alone. Not long after VE Day, Churchill was pressing the case for what needed to happen next. \u201cWe must recreate the European family in a regional structure called, it may be, the United States of Europe,\u201d Churchill declared in Zurich in 1946. Five years later, he <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-churchill-really-thought-about-britains-place-in-europe-36613\">was warning of the \u201cdisadvantages and even dangers to us in standing aloof\u201d</a> from a more united Europe. He was sad that Britain had refused to discuss the creation of a European army. He hoped Britain would join the European Coal and Steel Community, the precursor of the Common Market. Close ties to our European neighbours were precious, Churchill argued, even if that sometimes meant \u201cthe abrogation of national sovereignty\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Seventy-five years on, those who most like to invoke the name of our wartime leader choose to pretend he never did or said those things. In today\u2019s Downing Street there\u2019s a Churchill tribute act who led the campaign to wrench Britain away from its allies in the European Union, who has made Brexit into a defining credo and who has presided over a government that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\">passed up three chances to protect its doctors and nurses from a deadly virus</a>, lest joining an EU procurement scheme be seen as engaging in treacherous European cooperation.</p> <p>So, yes, it was natural for Britons to bask in the May sunshine and remember a brighter moment, to take comfort from it and draw strength from its lesson: that even the darkest hours end eventually. It made sense to come together and raise a glass for the day when we will meet again. But we are fighting a different war now, against an invisible enemy, and led by lesser men.</p>",

However, most security council diplomats believed Moscow would withdraw the objection or abstain in a vote rather than risk isolation as the sole veto on the ceasefire resolution.</p> <p>On Thursday night, it appeared that the compromise resolution had the support of the US mission, but on Friday morning, that position switched and the US \u201cbroke silence\u201d on the resolution, raising objection to the phrase \u201cspecialist health agencies\u201d, and blocking movement towards a vote.</p> <p>\u201cWe understood that there was an agreement on this thing but it seems that they changed their mind,\u201d a western security council diplomat said.</p> <p>\u201cObviously they have changed their mind within the American system so that wording is still not good enough for them,\u201d another diplomat close to the discussions said. \u201cIt might be that they just need a bit more time to settle it amongst themselves, or it might be that someone very high up has made a decision they don\u2019t want it, and therefore it won\u2019t happen. It is unclear at this moment, which one it is.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the US mission at the UN suggested that if the resolution was to mention the work of the WHO, it would have to include critical language about how China and the WHO have handled the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIn our view, the council should either proceed with a resolution limited to support for a ceasefire, or a broadened resolution that fully addresses the need for renewed member state commitment to transparency and accountability in the context of Covid-19. Transparency and reliable data are essential to helping the world combat this ongoing pandemic, and the next one,\u201d the spokesperson said.</p> <p>While the force of the resolution would be primarily symbolic, it would have been symbolism at a crucial moment. Since Guterres made his call for a global ceasefire, armed factions in <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2020/05/05/how-covid-19-gave-peace-a-chance-and-nobody-took-it\">more than a dozen</a> countries had observed a temporary truce. The absence of a resolution from the world\u2019s most powerful nations, however, undermines the secretary general\u2019s clout in his efforts to maintain those fragile ceasefires.</p> <p>Talks will continue next week at the security council to explore whether some other way around the impasse can be found.</p>",

My mother had put her tiara on for the occasion, so we asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognized,<br></p> \n  <p>So I pulled my uniform cap well down over my eyes.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cWe cheered the king and queen on the balcony and then walked miles through the streets.

I had recently returned to my grandfather\u2019s empty villa in the city of Lodz, after nearly six years on the run. I come from a Jewish family, and all of my immediate relatives died in the Holocaust. I only survived because I escaped from a train bound for Treblinka, after which I joined the Polish resistance. We fought the Germans in Warsaw, but after they were defeated the Soviets occupied our country and they were arresting and executing Polish home army officers. It was also the time that I realised that my family, for whom I had been waiting in Lodz, wasn\u2019t going to come home.</p> \n   <p>While the rest of Europe celebrated, we were in hiding. We already knew for a few months that the war would end soon, but that it would not bring us any great joy. It was just another grey day, the end of years of suffering, but no freedom. I\u2019m not sure that everyone in Poland felt the same way as us, but we did see substantial collaboration with the new regime. </p> \n   <p>For me, VE Day meant the end of one horror and the beginning of another that I didn\u2019t want to be a part of. After the war I left Europe and moved to what would become Israel. I know it marks a great achievement, but for the last 75 years I have never celebrated this day and I doubt I ever will - the part of me that remains strongly Polish does not allow me to do so.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T10:23:42.487Z\">at 11.23am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb52ca08f08464cd42967bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-boffey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T10:11:44.192Z\">11.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A 98-year-old RAF veteran has completed a 2.2-mile walk in Belgium to raise funds for a much-loved soldiers\u2019 club in the Flemish town of Poperinge.<br><br>George Sutherland, the son of a Belgian mother and Scottish father, escaped to Britain when the Germans invaded Belgium in 1940.</p> \n  <p>He walked from Lijssenthoek commonwealth war cemetery in Poperinge to Talbot House, a clubhouse for all the ranks founded in 1915 but which is facing financial ruin because of the coronavirus lockdown.<br></p> \n  <p>Sutherland had a police escort and was accompanied by a pipe major from the memorial bagpipe band of the Church of our Lady in Poperinge.

  "<p>Before the pandemic struck, Sara Blazey made the same three-hour commute to work, three days a week, for the better part of 12 years. The 63-year-old family lawyer from the Blue Mountains works for a domestic violence legal advice hotline in Parramatta and it used to be that she would wake at 7am, drive seven minutes to Hazelbrook station and from there catch the 7.17am train to Parramatta before making the same one-and-a-half hour trip home in the evening.</p> <p>With the pandemic, all that would change. Domestic violence support services such as the one Blazey worked for were declared \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/covid-19-will-slam-the-door-shut-australias-family-services-brace-for-domestic-violence-spike\">essential</a>\u201d services, meaning they could keep operating despite restrictions. To ensure they could do so safely, the organisation did what some commentators long thought impossible and began to transition its employees into working from home.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a couple of us older ones in the office who said it all sounds too hard, really,\u201d Blazey says. \u201cAnd then we were reluctant to work from home. My home is my home. I don\u2019t particularly want to do my work from there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0c266c7813181580bd5a31029deb939c1634272b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c266c7813181580bd5a31029deb939c1634272b/0_0_5279_3519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The road to Katoomba in the Blue Mountains\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The road to Katoomba in the Blue Mountains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the country went through a collective tech upgrade, millions of workers like Blazey retreated from office blocks and entire cities emptied out. It was a pattern that would be replicated worldwide. Streets devoid of cars and pavements free of people were so haunting that photographs of cities including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-photos-us-new-york-seattle-washington\">New York</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/15/europe-empties-its-streets-to-slow-coronavirus-in-pictures\">Paris</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2020/apr/24/look-no-people-sydney-seen-from-the-air-during-coronavirus-lockdown-in-pictures\">Sydney</a> were shared across social media.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/08/work-after-coronavirus-how-will-it-change-when-the-lockdown-is-over\">Work after coronavirus: how will it change when the lockdown is over?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within Australia, the scale of this change was captured in data obtained by the Grattan Institute. Anonymised geolocation data gathered from people\u2019s mobile phones showed how crowds in central business districts along the east coast had thinned by half even before the Australian government announced stage-one restrictions on social movement. By mid-April they would be nearly deserted. Crowding in the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane CBDs had fallen to a fifth or less, while crowding around suburban train stations had fallen to a 10th.</p> <p>Those like Blazey might have regained an extra three hours in their day but, as society begins to reopen, the question now is whether the embrace of working from home sticks. Should it become permanent, it may drive a radical change in the way governments think about how we drive, fly, commute and ride in the post-pandemic world.</p> <h2><strong>Planes, trains and cars</strong></h2> <p>Already transport is taking centre stage. In mid-April Labor\u2019s transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, called for the construction of a high-speed rail line to be built between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as a brace against a looming recession. King billed the idea \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/26/from-showpiece-to-goat-track-the-long-dangerous-decline-of-sydney-to-melbourne-rail-travel\">which has been around since the 1980s</a> \u2013 as a \u201cgame changer\u201d for regions along its route.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57233788bc4efd302b894fc02459f9a3a61bca60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57233788bc4efd302b894fc02459f9a3a61bca60/0_0_5076_3384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine King\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labor\u2019s transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, calls high-speed rail a \u2018game changer\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ross/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHigh-speed rail has the potential to revolutionise interstate travel, allowing travel between capital cities in as little as three hours,\u201d King said.</p> <p>As an idea, the thought was as much about the past as it was the future. A century ago, when economies were transport-driven, everything depended on the ability to move people around. Ever since, planes, trains and cars have played an outsized role in the imagination, especially for policymakers looking for \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects.</p> <p>Marion Terrill of the Grattan Institute says this romance may prove costly today. Having studied proposals for high-speed rail, she says that if the country were to lock itself into such a project, it would be 22 years before the first leg was complete and it would be 39 years \u2013 if not longer \u2013 before the country saw any reduction in carbon emissions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"339e16f2e64fb4b16bbd8d52759179e98378bfed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/339e16f2e64fb4b16bbd8d52759179e98378bfed/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The WestConnex tunnel at Haberfield in Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sydney\u2019s WestConnex tunnel.

It\u2019s something people respond to emotionally.

Faced with renewed mistrust of public spaces and social distancing requirements, public transport systems must now be retrofitted to reduce touchable surfaces and capacity. Doing so carries a cost beyond the financial.</p> <p>The risk, says Prof Kim Dovey, the chair of architecture and urban design at Melbourne University, is that the lowering capacity will make public transport unviable when what\u2019s needed is a massive expansion.</p> <p>\u201cThe virus is really an attack on cities, in many ways,\u201d Dovey says. \u201cOne of its biggest effects is it stops cities from functioning effectively. It stops people from coming together and interacting. This, in my view, is what makes cities work.</p> <p>\u201cIf people want to stay two metres apart from each other into the future, that will kill cities.\u201d</p> <p>Thought of in this way, Covid-19 is the sociological equivalent of a distributed denial of service attack \u2013 where a swarm of computers repeatedly attempt to access the same system all at once, eventually overloading it with demand. If at the start of the pandemic the main concern was the ability of health systems to cope, now the worry is that secondary systems like transport will buckle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We should be out there turning streets into walkways. All you need is a bit of authority and paint on the road</p> <footer> <cite>Kim Dovey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The consequences are profound. If density and walkability combine to make cities vibrant places to live, public transport is the sinew that makes it possible. Cars may have dominated cities over the last century but in the last decade patronage of public transport has slowly grown once more. Should this trend be broken, Dovey says, the result would be \u201ctragic\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cReducing public transport to 30% will kill cities,\u201d he says. \u201cWe really need to go the other way.\u201d</p> <p>These concerns go beyond trains, trams and buses to the \u201cmicrospatiality\u201d of cities and efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jul/24/the-us-government-has-checked-out-on-renewables-can-cities-fill-the-gap\">green them</a>. The more room provided for cars, the less there is for footpaths. Lifts in high-rises built to handle eight to 10 people become unworkable when they are limited to one or two.</p> <p>\u201cRight now a lot of people will avoid public transport for a while, which means they\u2019ll get in their cars,\u201d Dovey says. \u201cAnd that will produce demand for more roads, as it always does.</p> <p>\u201cPeople still believe building roads can ease congestion but that is not true. All it does is stimulate demand for cars. This is going to set back major moves for cities that have been going on for a long time, particularly in trying to claw back space for usage from cars.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A fork in the road</strong></h2> <p>In January 2019 the Australian car fleet numbered 19.5m, <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbytitle/28861A19CCDB9441CA25753D001B59DA?OpenDocument\">according</a> to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. With millions now out of work or working from home, many of these vehicles have remained off the road. What comes next depends on what happens when restrictions are eased and those people go back to work \u2013 particularly as global oil prices remain low.</p> <p>The cause was simple enough. As whole national economies were put on ice at the start of the pandemic, the world\u2019s oil producers kept pumping even as demand fell off a cliff. When they ran out of storage the mismatch between supply and demand grew so chronic <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-russia-production/repair-abandon-burn-russia-explores-options-for-historic-oil-cut-idUSKCN2252RD\">oil producers</a> in Russia found it easier to burn their excess, marking a disaster for efforts to combat climate change.</p> <p>\u201cOil fields are not like wine bottles, where you can put in a cork and return to it later,\u201d Jeff Colgan says. \u201cShutting an oil field down can damage it, which reduces or even eliminates the field\u2019s future production.\u201d</p> <p>Colgan is the Richard Holbrooke associate professor of political science at Brown University and expert on the global oil industry, who says low fuel prices will last for some time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"233290fba52c48f1092c7dd46c92aea86b1d826a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/233290fba52c48f1092c7dd46c92aea86b1d826a/148_0_5723_3434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tram on the near-empty Bourke Street mall in central Melbourne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tram on the near-empty Bourke Street mall in central Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Asanka Ratnayake/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNothing lasts forever in the oil business but low oil prices are probably here to stay for at least the rest of the year and perhaps much longer,\u201d he says. \u201cEven when consumer demand increases after lockdowns end, there is an awful lot of inventory build-up that will keep prices from rising too quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Against this global backdrop, Australia \u2013 which boasts the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/05/among-the-worst-in-oecd-australias-addiction-to-cheap-dirty-petrol\">highest sulphur content</a> fuel in the OECD and rising road transport emissions \u2013 finds itself caught between two competing futures.</p> <p>On the one hand, persistent low oil prices will make petrol cars cheaper to run, frustrating any attempt to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles as part of a transition to a zero-carbon economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4721c74c855ffecc169d271fe96f1113b419c23e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4721c74c855ffecc169d271fe96f1113b419c23e/0_0_5363_3575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A electric vehicle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Electric vehicles are improving all the time.

When Australia\u2019s largest trading partner lifted restrictions and moved to reopen its factories early this month, its people <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-is-open-for-business-but-the-post-coronavirus-reboot-looks-slow-and-rocky-11585232600\">stayed home</a>. Should this pattern be repeated the world over, the cumulative fall in demand would destabilise oil-producing economies, while making it harder to decarbonise transport at home.</p> <p>Some like John Quiggin lean more to this second scenario. While he acknowledges incentives created in the post-pandemic world may lead to less public transport and more cars on the road, the University of Queensland economist says \u201cmost forces are going the other way\u201d. If historically the opposition to working from home by business was a meta-conversation about their ability to trust their workforce, the focus could shift to basic costs as social distancing regulations remain and the capacity of a working office falls.</p> <p>\u201cOffices are going to be under pressure to keep a lot of space and the very low-cost way of doing that is to give people a choice about whether they come in or not,\u201d Quiggin says. \u201cMeanwhile, electric vehicles are improving all the time. Their take-up comes with anything that pauses the growth of the car fleet which gives EVs a chance.\u201d</p> <p>What is true for the average employee will also be true for the boardroom. Even if Australia has avoided the worst of the virus, other countries have not. Many will remain in a state of lockdown for some time, forcing individual countries or regions to become more self-reliant. Freight may continue to move across borders into the future but people will not. Anyone looking to travel for business faces the prospect of a mandatory five- to 14-day quarantine each time a border is crossed. In the end, it will be easier \u2013 and cheaper \u2013 to do deals by video conference.</p> <p>The same could also be said for Australia\u2019s tourism, education and aviation sectors. Education-related travel services and personal travel services respectively ranked as Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dfat.gov.au/sites/default/files/trade-investment-glance-2020.pdf\">fourth and fifth largest exports</a> in 2018-19.

Flying foxes rarely stay in the same place for very long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDispersals are predicated on the idea that you can teach flying foxes that another place is better. You might teach some individuals, but not others.\u201d</p> <p>In a single year, Welbergen says one individual bat might fly across the entire range of its species \u2013 from southern Victoria to south-east Queensland \u2013 multiple times.</p> <p>As bats move, they perform a vital ecological function by spreading thousands of seeds through spit and poop, as well as pollinating flowering trees.

For those that know me know I hate all things cardio and I got bad knees lol but I did it for Ahmaud. I didn\u2019t know the young king the was murdered in cold blood but it resonated with me heavy. Maybe because I think of how that could have been my brother or cousin .Maybe it\u2019s the ample amount of times I have felt uncomfortable in my life for being one of the few black families in my community and the stares that accompanied that when we moved in. Or the times where I\u2019ve been followed in the store because I looked \u201cthreatening\u201d and could possibly steal. or maybe the time where I was pulled over for a headlight being out and was told to get out of my car with my hands where the officer could see them. Or maybe that one time I was traveling with my family and a restaurant blatantly refused to serve us, I wish I could make this up y\u2019all \u2022 I\u2019ve been traumatized before by my own fathers tragic death. This was triggering. I\u2019m not sure how to not stop thinking about this young man. But maybe I\u2019m not supposed to. As a someone training to be a physician I feel it is my obligation to advocate for those without a voice. And with this platform I plan on doing that. There is power in numbers. Ahmaud Arbery this is for you. I\u2019m praying this brings people to realize racism has never gone away. We don\u2019t talk about these issues to \u201cbring up the past\u201d . It is very much our present day. Microaggressions and bigotry are thriving in this country. It is not invisible. #justiceforahmaud #irunwithmaud</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden;

NHS England figures show 12 deaths so far for hospital patients aged 0 to 19 who had tested positive. Some nine, including the baby, had a pre-existing health condition, while three did not. The total death toll in the UK, among patients who have tested positive for Covid-19 now stands at 31,241 - 1,072 more than Italy\u2019s total of 30,201. </p> \n  <p><strong>Government misses 100,000 testing target for sixth day</strong></p> \n  <p>For the sixth day in a row the government missed its target of testing 100,000 people for coronavirus. Despite a rise of more than 10,000 on the previous day, the level reach was 97,029. Defending the figure, the environment secretary, George Eustice said: \u201cThe important thing is to have those ambitious targets you\u2019re working to, to just continually build the capacity.\u201d He claimed the prime minister\u2019s new target of 200,000 tests per day by the end of the May, was for capacity rather than tests carried out. He said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s announced in the last week that we\u2019re going to ramp that up further to 200,000 tests capacity per day.\u201d </p> \n  <p><strong>Plea to open fast food outlets but \u2018no dramatic change in lockdown\u2019</strong></p> \n  <p>Eustice has urged more takeaway food outlets to reopen. He said: \u201cWe never mandated that they should close.\u201d He also said: \u201cMcDonalds drive through was made for social distancing.\u201d But he confirmed there would be no \u201cdramatic overnight change\u201d in the lockdown rules on Sunday. </p> \n  <p><strong>UK scientists\u2019 fury over attempt to censor Covid-19 advice</strong></p> \n  <p>Government scientific advisers are furious at what they see as an attempt to censor their advice on government proposals during the Covid-19 lockdown by heavily redacting an official report before it was released to the public, the Guardian can reveal. The report was one of a series of documents published by Sage this week to mollify growing criticism about the lack of transparency over the advice given to ministers responding to the coronavirus. However large blocks of text in the report, produced by SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, were entirely blanked out.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wales unveils modest easing of the lockdown</strong></p> \n  <p>The first minister, Mark Drakeford, says it is too soon to ease the lockdown in Wales but announced three modest adjustments.</p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Local exercise will be allowed more than once a day.</li> \n   <li>Garden centres will be opened with physical distancing measures.<br></li> \n   <li>Local authorities will open libraries and recycling centres.</li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>Schools will not be opened at the start of June, Drakeford confirmed. He also revealed the R number in Wales is estimated to be 0.8 and if it stays at that level 800 people will die in Wales by August. If it increases to 1.1 an estimated 7,200 will die in Wales.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon warns against easing the lockdown</strong></p> \n  <p>Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was only considering relaxing the restrictions on exercising, saying the R number in Scotland was too close to 1 to contemplate any other easing measures. She also announced a further 49 deaths in Scotland taking its death toll to 1,811. She said: \u201cBy easing restrictions prematurely we would risk undoing all the progress that we\u2019ve made, we would risk allowing the virus to spread out of control and that would cost lives.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rail services set to increase</strong></p> \n  <p>Plans to ramp up rail services have been brought forward by a week and will start from next Monday, a union is claiming. Services were expected to be increased gradually from 18 May as part of an easing of the economic lockdown. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said it had discovered that the plans had been brought forward to start on Monday 11 May.</p> \n  <p><strong>Calls to ease lockdown for angling, shooting and bowls</strong></p> \n  <p>Anglers, game shooting enthusiasts and bowls clubs are increasing the pressure for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/05/longer-lockdown-for-over-70s-would-allow-fewer-restrictions-for-rest-of-uk-scientists-suggest\">lockdown to be eased</a> for their sports, arguing that they can resume them while remaining physically distanced.

coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Staff at the Florence Nightingale Museum in Westminster said her key nursing values \u2013 which focused on maintaining good hygiene, regularly washing hands and carrying out evidence-based practices \u2013 had been widely echoed over the past months.</p> \n  <p>Nightingale was born on 12 May 1820 and Tuesday also marks International Nurses Day.</p> \n  <p>She developed these habits during the Crimean war, where, along with a small troupe of nurses, she tended soldiers\u2019 wounds and worked to improve hospital conditions.</p> \n  <p>Her data-based work also helped shape modern nursing: founding the nursing school at St Thomas\u2019 hospital, developing palliative care and midwifery, and shaping the redesign of hospitals across the UK and the health system itself.</p> \n  <p>Kristin Buhnemann, assistant director at the Florence Nightingale Museum, said: \u201cIn terms of modern nursing, her legacy has never been so relevant, as she was a pioneer for sanitation, hygiene and had a monumental impact on infection control today.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"301dce49ae6acd15b4110e359409b0a71a5e28de\"> \n

We locked down on 23-24 March. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSo I really worry that if we come out of this too quickly, maybe two or weeks too quickly we could see the flare-up of a second wave and so I would say keep it in place until the end of May, to the beginning of June. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe danger both economic and the toll in deaths danger is so great.

  "<p>Ministers\u2019 plans to reopen schools as early as 1 June are in serious doubt after unions representing teachers and school staff insisted that they would not consider a return without a stringent coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/08/how-covid-19-contact-tracing-can-help-beat-the-pandemic\">\u201ctest and trace\u201d</a> regime.</p> <p>In an unusual joint statement, which one senior union official said indicated that an early return to a normal school timetable was \u201coff the menu\u201d, the Trades Union Congress said that there should be \u201cno increase in pupil numbers until full rollout of a national test and trace scheme\u201d, and called for the establishment of a Covid-19 taskforce with government, unions and others to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/07/coronavirus-uk-unions-warn-against-premature-reopening-of-schools\">agree on the safe reopening of schools</a>.</p> <p>But with a national strategy for a scheme that would help identify who needs to be in quarantine yet to be deployed \u2013 and a contact-tracing phone app still undergoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/guinea-pigs-isle-of-wight-residents-mixed-reactions-to-contact-tracing-app-coronavirus\">a limited trial on the Isle of Wight</a> \u2013 the unions\u2019 tests are unlikely to be satisfied by the 1 June date floated by officials last week.</p> <p>That could mean children in England and Wales returning to schools for just a few weeks between now and the new school year in September, and pupils in Scotland \u2013 who break up earlier \u2013 increasingly unlikely to return before the summer holidays at all.</p> <p>The Scottish and Welsh governments have already announced that their schools will not reopen on 1 June.</p> <p>The news comes amid growing signs that Boris Johnson will set out a cautious \u201croadmap\u201d for the next phase of the crisis on Sunday after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/mixed-messages-uk-governments-strategy-fuels-fears-of-rule-breaking\">government faced severe criticism over its mixed messages</a> about what the public should expect.</p> <p>The statement, submitted to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is backed by the main teaching unions, as well as Unite, GMB and Unison, which represent key school staff such as cleaners, administrators and caterers. Any return without their agreement is highly unlikely.</p> <p>\u201cThe wider reopening of our schools will depend greatly on ensuring that families and carers are fully confident that allowing their children to return to school is safe. We do not believe that sufficient levels of confidence exist at this time,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Johnson told last weekend\u2019s Sun on Sunday: \u201cOne of the things we want to do as fast as we can is get primary schools back. It\u2019s not going to be easy, but that\u2019s where we want to go. It\u2019s about working out a way to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Whitehall sources suggested at the time he had in mind a phased return from the beginning of June, after the summer half-term break.</p> <p>But the Guardian understands that conversations with headteachers and trade unions in recent days have underlined the practical challenges of the move \u2013 and the potential resistance from parents anxious about their children\u2019s safety. A government source insisted on Friday: \u201cWe never set a date.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of Johnson\u2019s address to the nation, the environment secretary, George Eustice, on Friday played down suggestions of any major changes to the lockdown regime, stressing that the government would proceed \u201cwith the utmost caution\u201d.</p> <p>At the press briefing, Eustice also stressed the importance of abiding by the existing measures over the bank holiday weekend, despite the fact that the government is poised to allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/picnics-and-sunbathing-on-cards-as-pm-expected-to-allow-more-time-outside\">unlimited exercise, sunbathing and picnics from Monday</a>.</p> <p>But he welcomed moves by some businesses to reopen where existing restrictions already allow \u2013 including McDonald\u2019s. \u201cOur view is that McDonald\u2019s drive-through is made for the social distancing system that we are in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/welsh-assembly-government\">Welsh government</a> stole a march on Johnson on Friday by announcing a three-week extension to its coronavirus lockdown and making modest adjustments, including allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day and plans to reopen libraries. </p> <p>The first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/mark-drakeford\">Mark Drakeford</a>, insisted that the lockdown needed to stay, but said \u201cvery cautious\u201d changes would come into force. He anticipated that \u201cbroadly\u201d similar changes would be announced by the prime minister.</p> <p>He said that from Monday, people would be allowed to exercise more than once a day, provided that they do not travel \u201ca significant distance\u201d from their home. Garden centres will be allowed to reopen if they can ensure that the 2-metre physical distancing rule is enforced. And councils will begin work on plans to safely reopen libraries and municipal recycling centres.</p> <p>The announcement came as Scotland\u2019s first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon\">Nicola Sturgeon</a>, said she believed \u201call four nations now accept there may be differences in pace of how we do these things because the level of the virus is at different stages\u201d, although she expected divergence from England\u2019s upcoming new guidance to be minor.</p> <p>The TUC\u2019s tests include \u201cclear scientific published evidence\u201d that reopening schools will not increase the transmission of Covid-19; agreement between government, unions and employers over minimum safety standards for social distancing and hygiene; and a \u201dsecure supply\u201d of PPE for school staff.</p> <p>But the key demand is that opening up schools cannot begin until there is a \u201cfull rollout\u201d of the government\u2019s test, trace and isolate policy, with targets for testing being consistently met and the numbers of new cases of Covid-19 falling.</p> <p>Williamson has maintained that his top priority is the safety of children, and said that the question of when and how to reopen schools is the government\u2019s most difficult decision.</p> <p>The teaching unions and the Department for Education have been consulting closely in recent days, with ministers and advisers contacting individual headteachers and academy leaders to canvass their views. Following the discussions, the DfE believes the TUC\u2019s tests do not differ significantly from those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/have-the-governments-five-tests-for-easing-lockdown-been-met\">set out by the government to end the lockdown</a>.</p> <p>Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at University College London who has been involved in the development of coronavirus tracing apps in countries including Switzerland and Germany, said it was possible that the first NHS tracing app could be ready by 1 June. But he warned that an app alone would be unlikely to be sufficient to curb a Covid-19 outbreak affecting schools.</p> <p>\u201cThe question is, would an app help schools?\u201d he said. \u201cPrimary schools don\u2019t contain humans with smartphones in the same way as the rest of the world. Certainly, unions should be alert to health risks for the workers they represent, but I don\u2019t think unions should rely on an app to protect their workers. They should make demands that relate to broader tracking and tracing capabilities.\u201d</p> <p>Veale said that an underlying problem in the UK was its failure to conduct enough tests to make tracing work effectively, even with a functioning app available. The first version of the NHS app requires users to self-report symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cWe must be careful not to make strong claims about the effectiveness of an app before we have even deployed one,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has claimed that a nationwide contact-tracing scheme, involving 18,000 contact tracers, will be in place by mid-May. But he has conceded that it is a \u201chuge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity\u201d.</p> <p>The NASUWT teaching union has already called for schools to remain closed until the end of the summer holidays, while the National Association of Head Teachers said it is \u201cclear that parents are very nervous about sending their children back to school\u201d.</p> <p>A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cSchools will remain closed, except for children of critical workers and vulnerable children, until the scientific advice indicates it is the right time to re-open and the five tests set out by government to beat this virus have been met.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also working closely with the sector as we consider how to reopen schools, nurseries and colleges and will ensure everyone has sufficient notice to plan and prepare.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>McDonald\u2019s and other drive-through restaurant facilities are being encouraged to reopen after a government minister said they were \u201cmade for social distancing\u201d.</p> \n<p>George Eustice, the environment minister, said that takeaway food businesses were never explicitly ordered to close because of the coronavirus outbreak, but chose to do so because of footfall, staff anxiety and the sense that it was not socially acceptable to remain open.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3bae1247-1677-4be8-8e00-25e9bb14577f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/njApe_lX5Xg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He suggested at the daily Downing Street press conference on Friday that they could begin trading again, and said he was in talks with McDonald\u2019s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/mcdonalds-full-list-uk-restaurants-reopen-lockdown-coronavirus\">which has reopened restaurants on a pilot basis in some areas</a>, KFC and Costa. He said that Pret A Manger has already opened some branches.</p> \n<p>Eustice said: \u201cWhen we originally did the lockdown we were quite explicit that it didn\u2019t cover takeaway food.</p> \n<p>\u201cProbably a McDonald\u2019s drive-through is made for the social distancing situation that we are in, in that people do not leave their car, they place their order and somebody places a bag of food to them through a kiosk.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it is quite possible for these venues to reopen and reopen safely. We never mandated that they should close.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said takeaway food companies could learn from supermarkets \u201cas they consider tentatively reopening\u201d.</p> \n<p>Eustice also revealed at the press conference that the government missed its 100,000 testing target for a sixth day in a row with 97,029 tests in the latest 24-hour period.</p> \n<p>It was also put to him that care home staff are still not getting the tests they need. He said that regional variances were inevitable with surplus tests in some areas, and if people could not get a test on the first day they want one, they should be able to get one \u201cquickly\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThe important thing is we set this target to get 100k tests and we have that capacity.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/06/boris-johnson-aim-is-200000-coronavirus-tests-daily-by-end-of-may-video\">The prime minister\u2019s pledge to reach 200</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/06/boris-johnson-aim-is-200000-coronavirus-tests-daily-by-end-of-may-video\">,000 tests</a> a day was important to show the ambition of expanding capacity, Eustice added. </p>",

  "<p>For every athlete across every sport there will be a level of anxiety right now regarding a return to action post-lockdown. When will it be? What will it look like? Why, exactly, will it be taking place? But among those from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds the sense of unease is likely to be especially acute given the way in which Covid-19 is ravaging their communities.</p> <p>The numbers are stark. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\" title=\"\">NHS England figures</a> published last month showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number in the white population, while analysis carried out by the Institute for Fiscal Studies soon after found the death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis in English hospitals to be more than 2.5 times that of the white population.</p> <p>On Thursday the Office for National Statistics published a report which provided further evidence that people from ethnic groups are at a \u201csignificantly higher\u201d risk of dying from coronavirus than people of white ethnicity \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\" title=\"\">four times as high in the case of black people</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/07/football-coronavirus-this-could-be-the-end-of-grassroots-game-change-non-league\">Football and coronavirus: 'This could be the end of the grassroots game'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A range of variables are at play here, from health inequalities to socio-economic and cultural factors, but there remains shock and an overall lack of clarity as to why people from BAME backgrounds are being so disproportionately affected. The government has launched an inquiry while medics across the country \u2013 including at Birmingham NHS trust \u2013 are carrying out their own investigations. But there are no guarantees of findings, let alone solutions, and as such it is little wonder BAME athletes are worried about resuming the day job anytime soon.</p> <p>This appears to be the case in football in particular, which is no surprise given how diverse the sport is in the UK \u2013 about a third of Premier League players are from a BAME background, with similar figures in the lower leagues. Emile Heskey spoke for at least some when he said last week that he would be \u201c100% concerned\u201d about returning to action were he still playing. \u201cMy grandad passed away two years ago and he had diabetes, high blood pressure,\u201d the former Leicester, Liverpool and England forward, who is of Antiguan descent, said. \u201cMy eldest kids are sickle cell trait. Are they at risk as well? These are the problems we have.\u201d</p> <p>Jobi McAnuff is a BAME player who shares Heskey\u2019s concerns. The Leyton Orient midfielder said: \u201cYou only have to look at the effect Covid-19 is having on black and ethnic minority groups \u2013 it\u2019s quite shocking really. It\u2019s most definitely a worry for football given the percentage of players from those backgrounds and it\u2019s vital that before we get playing again the strongest safety measures are in place to ensure everyone involved doesn\u2019t catch the virus.\u201d</p> <p>It can be argued that competitive sport \u2013 and football especially \u2013 will provide BAME athletes with a space that is safer than even their own homes. Testing will be stringent, medics will be on hand and, as such, they should not fear a return to action. There is sense in that way of thinking but, equally, it does not fully take into account those circumstances that are BAME-specific, or at least BAME-prevalent.</p> <p>McAnuff, for instance, has been dropping off food at the home of his elderly Jamaican father while he self-isolates, which touches on the socio-economic aspect of the issue given his father lives in Tottenham \u2013 where the family grew up and he has remained through a desire for familiarity but which, like many parts of London with long-standing ethnic communities, is densely populated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5bb48ec0f2ce3fceb4a247c3ab731f2a4ac80b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5bb48ec0f2ce3fceb4a247c3ab731f2a4ac80b0/0_139_4256_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street art in south London by the artist Deanio_X.

But Philip, who has won gold, silver and bronze medals across Olympic, world and European championships and Commonwealth Games, insists her home is safe.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all staying indoors and being very strict in regard to cleanliness \u2013 for instance, all our post is sprayed with Dettol as soon as it comes through the front door,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mum does have diabetes but it\u2019s a mild form and none of the rest of us have underlying health issues, so we\u2019re OK on that front.\u201d</p> <p>Philip, who is of Antiguan and Jamaican descent, has no concerns as a BAME athlete about returning to competitive action. But because of her background she is worried about competing at the world indoor championships in Nanjing next March, having read about the treatment of black people in China following the spread of coronavirus. </p> <p>Last month it was reported that a branch of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-52274326\" title=\"\">McDonald\u2019s in Guangzhou</a> had banned black people from entering because of fears they were spreading Covid-19 \u2013 leading to an apology from the restaurant chain and a temporary closing of the premises \u2013 and that in the same city, hundreds of Africans had been evicted from hotels and apartments due to the same, unfounded fears.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/08/neutral-venue-plan-has-no-rationale-says-former-football-police-commander-premier-league-fans\">Neutral venue plan has 'no rationale', says former football police commander</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHearing things like that is scary as a black person, especially given I\u2019m meant to be going to China next year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a worry.

  "<p>The late 1980s marked a key moment for environmental science, matching triumph with looming disaster. Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/04/latest-data-shows-steep-rises-in-co2-for-seventh-year\">observed since the late 1950s</a>, at the remote Pacific observatory of Mauna Loa, but it was only after three decades of further research that concern over what this rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases might mean reached the desks of the world\u2019s leaders.</p> <p>At the time, politicians appeared receptive to scientific warnings in a way they rarely have been since. In 1987, world governments concluded the <a href=\"https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol\">Montreal </a><a href=\"https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol\">protocol</a>, which still stands today as probably the most successful environmental intervention, phasing out the use of the ozone-depleting chemicals that had threatened to destroy the planet\u2019s protective atmospheric layer.</p> <p>When scientists called for a parallel effort to understand the impact of rising CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the climate, it seemed likely their conclusions would have a similarly galvanising effect. In 1988, the UN and the World Meteorological Organization put together the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/04/FS_timeline.pdf\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPPC), a body of the world\u2019s leading experts on atmospheric physics and chemistry, and the emerging science of climate change, to summarise human knowledge of the climate, and provide policymakers with an assessment of the risks and possible remedies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a534cf0ab5fd4c883d08a50fa33acfac6112679e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a534cf0ab5fd4c883d08a50fa33acfac6112679e/0_0_5000_3334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Houghton with Adam Butler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Houghton, right, during his time as director general of the Meteorological Office, with Adam Butler, the minister of state for defence procurement, at the official opening of the London weather radar in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately, political leadership quickly ran aground on the shoals of the economic vested interests of the fossil fuel industries. But the warnings of that first IPCC report, published in 1990, laid the foundations for the study of what has since been recognised as one of the biggest threats ever to face humanity. One of the foremost scientists who propelled the IPCC, serving as co-chair and chairman of its scientific advisory group from its inception until 2002, was the British atmospheric physicist Sir John Houghton.</p> <p>Houghton, who has died aged 88 of complications arising from Covid-19, had already enjoyed a distinguished public science career when he took on his IPCC role. Chief executive (formerly director general) of the Met Office since 1983, he won numerous prizes and accolades, including the Chree medal and prize in 1979 and election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1972. He served as president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1976 to 1978.</p> <p>While the IPCC\u2019s warnings did not result in the swift remedial action that some hoped for, the body continued to refine and expand its knowledge, producing regular comprehensive assessments and forecasts of the climate crisis. In 2007, the IPCC shared the Nobel peace prize with the former US vice-president Al Gore, with Houghton among those <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2007/award-video/\">accepting the award</a> in Oslo on behalf of the hundreds of scientists involved.</p> <p>Houghton remained as co-chair of the IPCC\u2019s scientific assessment working group until 2002, and in that time also fostered a world-leading research effort at the Met Office and its Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research. The UK still occupies a place at the top table of global climate science today, with the Hadley Centre operating as one of the world\u2019s top climate research hubs. On 1 May, the IPCC announced it would <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/2020/05/01/ipcc-pr-sir-john-houghton/\">dedicate a key part of its forthcoming report next year</a> to Houghton\u2019s memory.</p> <p>Knighted in 1991, Houghton went on from the Met Office to chair, from 1992 to 1998, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/royal-commission-on-environmental-pollution\">Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution</a>, another landmark institution that had an influence on environmental science and policy before it was closed down in 2011 under the government\u2019s austerity cuts.</p> <p>Houghton discovered his interest in science at a young age, while studying at Rhyl grammar school in north Wales. He was born in Dyserth, Denbighshire, to strongly evangelical Christian parents, Miriam (nee Yarwood) and Sidney Houghton, the second of three sons of whom the eldest, David, became a meteorologist and the youngest, Paul, a lecturer in engineering. The family moved to nearby Rhyl when John was two, and a statue of him was erected in the town in 2013.</p> <p>He went on to Jesus College in Oxford \u2013 sometimes known as the Welsh college for its strong links with Wales \u2013 and completed his BA in 1951 and DPhil in 1955. He soon became fascinated by Russia\u2019s Sputnik missions, which he said \u201ctransformed\u201d his thinking as they opened new vistas for atmospheric research through satellites. He developed these interests further as a professor of atmospheric physics at Oxford from 1972 to 1983 and deputy director of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory from 1981 to 1983.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e925e185a5e15e4deb889527455e2917f3db035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e925e185a5e15e4deb889527455e2917f3db035/867_89_1725_2156/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Houghton with Virginia Bottomley\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Houghton with the environment minister Virginia Bottomley and a weather computer, 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Postlethwaite/ANL/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout his scientific career, Houghton remained true to his devout evangelical Christian upbringing, and worked on combining the two as president of the <a href=\"https://www.jri.org.uk/\">John Ray Initiative</a>, which aims to connect the environment, science and Christianity, and as a founding member of the <a href=\"https://www.issr.org.uk/\">International Society for Science and Religion</a>. He said of his Christian faith: \u201cThe most important choice I have made is to accept Jesus as my saviour and lord. I was brought up that way, but there was a point when I realised it was an important decision that I had to make.\u201d</p> <p>As the UK takes on the presidency of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/we-must-use-this-time-well-climate-experts-hopeful-after-cop26-delay-coronavirus\">UN\u2019s crunch climate conference this year</a>, known as Cop26 and set to take place next spring in Glasgow, after being postponed owing to the coronavirus crisis, Britain\u2019s climate science community will play a key role in providing world leaders with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions on rescuing the planet from climate breakdown \u2013 an effort that owes a lot to the work Houghton began more than three decades ago at the IPCC and Met Office.</p> <p>In 1962 Houghton married Margaret Broughton, and they had two children. After her death he set up the Margaret Houghton memorial fund, a research unit on medical nursing. In 1988 he married Sheila Thompson. Houghton published his autobiography, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ur_jBAAAQBAJ\">In the Eye of the Storm</a>, in 2013, and retired to Aberdovey in west Wales, where his final years were clouded by dementia. </p> <p>He is survived by Sheila, his children, Janet and Peter, his grandchildren, Daniel, Hannah, Esther, Jonathan, Jemima, Sam and Max, and his brother Paul.</p> <p>\u2022 John Theodore Houghton, atmospheric physicist, born 30 December 1931; died 15 April 2020</p>",
  "<p>With most local shops shuttered and online sales booming, it\u2019s easy to imagine that coronavirus will deal a mortal blow to the high street. The images of empty public spaces that have come to define this crisis could be a warning of what life will be like after the lockdown, when people will fear crowds and social distancing will continue, either through self-policing or government directive.</p> <p>The decline of public life is one of the biggest casualties of Covid-19. Zoom, Amazon and Netflix are unlikely to replace our human craving for it. Public discourse has shrunk to encompass the virus, while our daily lives have retreated into the private domestic sphere. Streets and public places, high streets in particular, are the physical setting for public life, and the impact of the virus is that life lived outside \u2013 socialising, shopping, working \u2013 has been almost entirely curtailed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Social preferences, economic realities and government policy will shape the future of the high street</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The typical local high street, with a range of small stores providing essential daily goods, services and meeting places, defined towns and cities in the industrial age. But high streets have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2019/jan/30/high-street-crisis-town-centres-lose-8-of-shops-in-five-years\">struggled</a> in our globalised, post-industrial economy; out-of-town superstores with global supply chains sucked consumers away long before the rise of online retail. To counter this, policymakers restricted the growth of out-of-town shopping centres and attempted to create an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/datablog/2015/jul/22/young-people-urban-renaissance-city-centres-millennials-report\">urban renaissance</a>\u201d in town centres, bringing shoppers back into revitalised city shopping districts.</p> <p>In effect, the privatised out-of-town model moved into town, creating high-security enclaves of upmarket shops and entertainment areas, policed by private security guards and CCTV. From Cabot Circus in Bristol to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/11/liverpool-one-private-estates\">Liverpool One</a>, this became the template for a new kind of urban development all around the country. At the same time, many high streets were taken over by hundreds of privately controlled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davehillblog/2012/jun/29/business-improvement-districts-london-midtown\">business improvement districts</a>, which operate in a similar way to privately owned estates: businesses in an area pool resources to pay for private security and surveillance, creating a shopping centre \u201cenvironment\u201d aimed at generating maximum footfall. In privately owned and privately controlled places, a range of activities is prohibited, including skateboarding, cycling, taking photographs, filming and, crucially to democratic public life, political protest.</p> <p>As the government begins to ease lockdown restrictions, the public life of the high street will return. Although public transport will be hard hit by decreased commuting, fewer tourists and our fear of contagion, people will be more likely to walk to their local high street \u2013 or drive to one of the privatised, high-security \u201cmalls without walls\u201d or business improvement districts. But the mark of a successful high street, that it\u2019s busy and bustling with people, will also present a challenge to public health.</p> <p>This may suit some high streets and shopping areas more than others. Though people will avoid crowds of shoppers for some time, home-working could provide a boost to local high streets, which means many high streets have the potential to thrive. This is particularly the case in affluent areas with an array of independent shops, as well as in deprived parts of the country that remain overlooked by private estates and business improvement districts.</p> <p>On my local high street in a south London borough, a <a href=\"https://covidmutualaid.org/\">mutual aid centre</a>, a hub for local volunteers who run errands for older people and those who are self-isolating, has joined the parade of independent and charity shops. Councillors are consulting about where best to widen pavements to enable social distancing: outside the organic butchers or outside the foodbank? Income disparities in London mean that upmarket shops and mutual aid co-exist within the same area. In other parts of the country where high streets are characterised by boarded-up shop fronts, mutual aid centres can also provide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-mutual-aid-how-to-help-the-vulnerable-near-you\">much-needed community hubs</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/sep/26/its-really-shocking-uk-cities-refusing-to-reveal-extent-of-pseudo-public-space\">'It's really shocking': UK cities refusing to reveal extent of pseudo-public space</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Social preferences, economic realities and government policy will shape the future of the high street. In the short term, government support for high streets of every kind will be felt through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/st-albans-firms-group-appeal-business-rates\">suspension of business rates</a> and the range of funds available to carry businesses through the crisis. Business improvement districts have been promised their own <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/6-1-million-funding-boost-to-help-high-streets-and-town-centres-through-pandemic\">\u00a36m </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/6-1-million-funding-boost-to-help-high-streets-and-town-centres-through-pandemic\">fund</a>, but the continuation of social distancing will challenge a model predicated on creating destination environments to maximise footfall \u2013 luring in crowds of shoppers, in other words. The safety of driving to shopping centres may go some of the way to counteract this, and the heavily surveilled, private-public enclaves will no doubt find ways to reinvent themselves, offering data-driven, tech-driven shopping experiences that fit seamlessly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-is-it-safe-and-will-people-use-it\">contact tracing apps</a>.</p> <p>These <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/privately-owned-public-space-pops\">privately owned public spaces</a>, with their many restrictions on behaviour, offer a stifled version of public life. After the lockdown has eased it\u2019s also possible that high streets that nurture conviviality in place of crowds, and prioritise mutual aid, local goods and services above footfall, will be the places where public life can begin to flourish again.</p> <p>\u2022 Anna Minton is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/big-capital-9780141984995.html\">Big Capital: Who is London for?</a> and is a reader in Architecture at the University of East London</p>",
  "<p>This weekend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/solemnity-celebration-britain-tribute-war-ve-day\">marks 75 years since the end of the second world war in Europe</a>, and 70 years since the foundations were established of what became the European Union. With the continent facing its biggest challenge since 1945, do the lessons of the war and its aftermath have any resonance for young people? Millennials from around Europe share some of their thoughts and fears.</p> <h2>We are forgetting the lessons of 1945</h2> <p>\u201cAt times of crisis, populism, racism, xenophobia and fascism rise. After the coronavirus economic crisis really hits, we will witness an unbearable climate of pro-nationalist sentiment. In a world of global challenges nations are the wrong scale to solve those problems.\u201d<br><strong>Isabel, scientist, 32, Spain</strong></p> <h2>We thought war had gone the way of the guillotine</h2> <p>\u201cThe fraying of the European project recently has made the second world war suddenly more relevant. For a long time we thought the continent\u2019s bloody divisions were consigned to the past along with slavery or the guillotine. Now it feels like Europe\u2019s tormented history was merely suspended for a few decades. I\u2019m not frightened of a return to armed conflict, but the potential of destructive disunity feels very real. I have no sentimentality for VE Day but I do think that it should be commemorated.\u201d<br><strong>Aleks, 20s, Serbian, living in the UK</strong></p> <h2><strong>As a </strong>German<strong>, people backing the far right feels very scary</strong></h2> <p>\u201cOf course there are lessons for my generation from the second world war. I grew up in Germany after all, and what thoughts of racial elitism can do was shockingly impressed on me. How people are turning back to far-right groups all over Europe is very scary.\u201d<br><strong>Sophia, 22, Brandenburg, Germany</strong></p> <h2>It was hell, not our finest hour</h2> <p>\u201cI am sick of hearing about the war. The allies committed atrocities, war brings out the worst in all people. My friend\u2019s grandad took part in the D-day landings. He said they hit the legs of the soldiers to get them out on the beaches, they were not brave or heroic willingly and they all shit themselves literally. It was hell, not our finest hour. The lesson to learn is no one should think they are better than anyone else and that peace is the most valuable thing we can possibly have.\u201d<br><strong>Jennifer, 35, London</strong></p> <h2><strong>I live in fear of another war</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI feel like it\u2019s our moral responsibility to not let history repeat itself. I\u2019m very fearful of the nationalism, populism, isolationism and the rise of hard-right parties in Europe (and in the world of course) that we face currently. I live in constant fear that this degradation will eventually evolve and lead to WW3. From the pandemic I see a lot of great humanity, empathy, solidarity. But I also see terrible things: self-centredness, selfishness, disinformation, intolerance, etc. And I see countries that are absolutely not ready for what\u2019s coming.\u201d<br><strong>Nina, legal assistant, 27, Montpellier, France</strong></p> <h2>Division hides behind nationalism</h2> <p>\u201cAustria in particular has a tragic past when it comes to nationalism, and people here are acutely aware of this. On the other hand, history never exactly repeats itself and I doubt the horrors of the past would really take place in the same way. Nevertheless, what hides behind nationalism is a profound division between groups of people, which is the antithesis of the European project.\u201d<br><strong>Louis, mid-30s, Vienna</strong></p> <h2>You can feel the nationalism in Denmark</h2> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s good we talk about the second world war in the UK. My boyfriend is Danish and says that despite the country being occupied, and he has family who were young adults at that time, it isn\u2019t talked about. He\u2019s never had a conversation with them about it, or how it impacts their views today. Nationalism worries me very much. You see it across Europe, in ways more subtle than Brexit. Freedom of movement seems to be viewed very negatively by many people. When visiting my boyfriend\u2019s family in Denmark multiple acquaintances or random people have expressed negative feelings about the fact he\u2019s dating a foreigner.\u201d<br><strong>Heather, Edinburgh</strong></p> <h2>My grandmother\u2019s garden was bombed during WW2</h2> <p>\u201cThis was a traumatic experience and has taught me, as a millennial, not to take peace for granted. Our national curriculum is flawed, however. At school we are taught predominantly about Britain\u2019s role in the war, as if it defeated the Nazi regime singlehandedly. In reality, Britain\u2019s success depended entirely on our continental and global alliances.\u201d<br><strong>Sonia 22, British, living in Paris</strong></p> <h2>The pandemic has boosted rightwing populists</h2> <p>\u201cThe second world war still divides my nation today. Politicians have been using it divide the nation. It\u2019s like a continuous witch-hunt ever since the breakup of Yugoslavia that shifts the focus away from the real lessons of the war. The pandemic too has made me pessimistic. It has enabled a rise in rightwing governments in many parts of Europe which used the lockdown to start implementing their draconian laws.\u201d<br><strong>Andreja, 30s, Ljubljana, Slovenia</strong></p> <h2>In Italy, few have heard of VE Day</h2> <p>\u201cVE Day symbolises an important victory indeed. People were happy not to be under German oppression anymore, but in Italy most people do not feel it or don\u2019t even know it exists. We mark our own liberation day on 25 April. I can see first hand in Italy what nationalistic propaganda is like and what nationalism-oriented communication is like. It\u2019s scary.\u201d<br><strong>Lorenzo, 20s, Milan</strong></p> <h2>Commemorating matters</h2> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important to acknowledge those who gave up so much for our freedom. My dad lives in South Yorkshire and they have been celebrating VE Day in their socially distanced front gardens! My generation should still learn the lessons of the war. But as our government refused PPE from the EU procurement agreement, it makes me pessimistic about the idea of Britain working with Europe.\u201d<br><strong>Rosie, primary teacher, 30, South Yorks, based London</strong></p> <h2>Time to move on from a nationalist icon</h2> <p>\u201cI think we need to get away from the second world war as a cultural touchstone. Not forget that it happened but with every passing day the context we live in is further removed from it. It has become warped into a nationalist icon, removed from the reality of what actually happened. The \u2018lessons\u2019 people use it to teach are that Britain is special in Europe because we weren\u2019t invaded, fuelling the delusion that we can do everything alone. The tub-thumping pseudo-patriotism of wannabe demagogues is terrifying.\u201d<br><strong>Nick, PhD student, 26, Manchester</strong></p> <h2>Croatia remains blighted by that era</h2> <p>\u201cFor a Croat in particular, the second world war continues to mark my generation as we haven\u2019t been able to transcend divisions dating from then. Some in my generation still struggle to make sense of the lessons of the war. For me it is clear: after the worst modern atrocities on the continent, we as Europeans committed to creating a more peaceful continent. One thing that the Covid crisis might bring is to reveal the inability of nationalist governments to manage the pandemic on their own.\u201d<br><strong>Luka, 22, Zagreb</strong></p> <h2>Solid wartime values are evident in the pandemic</h2> <p>\u201cCaptain Tom and my grandfather exemplify VE Day to me. That stiff upper lip determination that were are not alone and all in this together. Or the Queen saying we will meet again. This crisis shows that the level of support forged in the cauldron of the second world war are still with us. Whether the staff of the NHS or carers, volunteers racing around to deliver food parcels.\u201d<br><strong>Ben, engineer </strong><strong> working as a bin collector, 20s, Carlisle</strong></p> <h2>Britain is obsessed by the war in a way no other country is</h2> <p>\u201cI am anxious about VE Day. My fear is that the loudest voices will be those who want to shout about Britain standing alone and using that to justify a nationalist agenda despite the passage of 75 years. Britain seems obsessed with the war in a way no other European country is.\u201d<br><strong>Peter, 29, London</strong></p> <h2>I feel blessed that my best friends are now German</h2> <p>\u201cI am the grandchild of a Holocaust survivor, and my Dutch grandparents both suffered under German occupation. Being Jewish and living in Amsterdam, the scars of the Jewish community are all over the city. I can\u2019t speak for my generation, but I can say that for me it feels like peace is conditional, it is hard-fought. The fact that many of my best friends are now Germans is a blessing I never take for granted.\u201d<br><strong>Software engineer, 25, Amsterdam</strong></p> <h2>The UK cherrypicks history</h2> <p>\u201cThe second world war teaches us \u2018never again\u2019. The trouble is, most people take that to mean just the gas chambers; everything leading up to that point is apparently acceptable. I also think the UK looks on WWII as a glorious victory of the British against the Germans, rather than a collaborative effort against fascism. The UK has cherrypicked and romanticised history, which makes it impossible for us to learn from it.\u201d<br><strong>Sarah, 31, Milton Keynes</strong></p> <h2>Two lessons matter</h2> <p>\u201cI would say the second world war taught us that no country can make it alone and left us with a deep mistrust of nationalism. However, I look around and I see how little of these two lessons has actually stuck.\u201d<br><strong>Michaela, scientist, 32, Italy</strong></p> <h2>Young people are ignorant about the parallels</h2> <p>\u201cToo many people my age do not even know about the Holocaust, and just how easily European countries slid into horrific persecution and violence. I think our generation needs to contend with this now more so than ever, with razor-wire fences going up all over European and racism, Islamophobia, anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination and gender-based discrimination all on the rise in recent years. A better understanding of this history will remind our generation how easy it is for a society to fall into the abyss.\u201d<br><strong>Adam, 25, Helsinki</strong></p> <h2>The memory of the war has been corrupted</h2> <p>\u201cThe narrative often portrayed in our history lessons was of national pride and British exceptionalism. Having been fortunate to speak to a number of elderly relatives who played a part in the war their stories didn\u2019t match what we were taught, rather they focused on the horrors experienced, and the need for co-operation. I think our generation needs to be aware that the memory of the war has been corrupted to encourage nationalism and British exceptionalism.\u201d<br><strong>Oliver, student, 21, Norfolk</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 8 May 2020 to remove some personal information.</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Hundreds of Rohingya Muslims, including children, have arrived at \u201ca de facto detention island\u201d in Bangladesh after being stranded at sea for weeks.</p> <p>Rights groups had warned that the refugees, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/02/let-the-boats-in-rohingya-refugees-plead-for-stranded-relatives-to-be-saved\">who ha</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/02/let-the-boats-in-rohingya-refugees-plead-for-stranded-relatives-to-be-saved\">d been turned away from other countries in the region</a>, were at risk of starvation and abuse by people traffickers. It is believed that other boats remain adrift.</p> <p>Bangladesh confirmed on Thursday that a boat carrying 280 people was being towed to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited silt island off the southern coast. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Abdul Momen, had earlier said that refugees rescued at sea would be sent to the island to prevent any risk of spreading the coronavirus to the sprawling camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, where a million Rohingya live in cramped conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902XAiJHopvdo1F/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902XAiJHopvdo1F/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>Bangladesh, which has struggled to cope with the camps, planned to start moving refugees to Bhasan Char last December, and has built rows of concrete barracks to house about 100,000 people. The relocation was put on hold following an outcry from Rohingya community leaders and international agencies.</p> <p>Human rights groups say the island, which can be reached only by a three-hour boat journey, has no access to basic services and is vulnerable to sea-level rise and storm surges.</p> <p>Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division, said there was no need to send refugees to the island to be quarantined because the UN\u2019s refugee agency and other bodies had facilities set up for this purpose in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Instead, families should be reunited with missing relatives as quickly as possible.</p> <p>\u201cWhile everyone is appreciative that Bangladesh has brought forsaken Rohingya boats ashore, arbitrarily branding the passengers as \u2018new arrivals\u2019 and packing them off to a de facto detention island like Bhasan Char is not a rights respecting solution,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"feec6ef9eb9a100958e7e0974dc51b725f3a0aff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/feec6ef9eb9a100958e7e0974dc51b725f3a0aff/0_35_3811_2286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Makeshift housing in the Cox\u2019s Bazar refugee camp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Makeshift housing in the Cox\u2019s Bazar refugee camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Joyce/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the people on board are refugees who had been living in Cox\u2019s Bazar but who attempted to flee in search of a better life in Malaysia.</p> <p>\u201cThe Rohingya have repeatedly stated they do not want to be moved to Bahsan Char, but that is precisely what the Bangladesh government is forcing this group to do,\u201d Robertson said.</p> <p>Serazul Hoque said he believed his 14-year-old nephew, who had been missing for more than 50 days, is among those taken to Bhasan Char. Traffickers had told the family to pay a ransom to secure Nur Kamaal\u2019s release, but he called on Wednesday to say the Bangladeshi navy had stopped his boat and that all people on board were being taken to a different location.</p> <p>The family later heard news reports that refugees from the boat were being taken to Bhasan Char, but have not been able to confirm that Kamaal is among them.</p> <p>\u201cWe are worried about conditions there and how good the healthcare is,\u201d Hoque said. \u201cIf he comes back to his mother then his mother can take care of him \u2026 She is worrying for her son.

Moms have long been the primary caregivers of their children, and even though more moms are working outside the home and fathers are more involved in their kids\u2019 lives than ever before, moms are still shouldering the majority of the parenting responsibilities.</p> <p>With nine in 10 children out of school, and daycares across the country closed, it is moms who will likely be forced to stay home even if, and when, their jobs resume. Historically, even in non-pandemic times, it is moms who end up adjusting their jobs for the sake of their families, not dads.</p> <p>Now, arguably more than ever, we need more moms in positions of power.</p> <p>If more moms were in charge, elected officials and other leaders would know that to open up the country without also opening up schools and daycares is to put millions of women out of a job. It also means putting additional strain on low-income families \u2013 especially black families and families of color, who are already <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/05/black-counties-disproportionately-hit-by-coronavirus-237540\">disproportionately affected by Covid-19</a> \u2013 and will continue to harm the mental health of parents, whoare reportedly <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-parents-stress-066aa3e1-d1d9-4112-84ed-c65184d04e39.html\">experiencing insomnia</a>, stress, anxiety, depression, anger, emotional exhaustion and PTSD symptoms as a result of quarantine and its implications.</p> <p>It\u2019s no wonder that Nancy Pelosi, a mother of five and grandmother of nine, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/13/senior-dems-national-plan-reopen-united-states-184135\">has called</a> Trump\u2019s plan to reopen the country \u201calmost sinful\u201d.

The women, and especially the moms, who have managed to find a seat at the proverbial political table know what the president either refuses to acknowledge or is simply too stubborn to admit: it will be women, mothers and caregivers who will be most at risk if the country reopens prematurely. It\u2019s House Democrats who proposed a monthly stimulus check to support families while they shelter-in place, instead of a one-time $1,200 payment, argued for increasing food assistance (Snap) benefits, and fought for millions of dollars in aid to hospitals in the $484bn relief package passed in April.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Ohio \u2013 led by the Republican governor, Mike DeWine \u2013 the department of job and family services is asking businesses to report employees who refuse to return to work during a deadly global pandemic. . More than half the country is now reopening in some form.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/coronavirus-women-essential-workers.html\">Seventy-seven per cent of healthcare workers are women</a>. Nine in 10 nurses, respiratory therapists and nursing assistants are women. Fifty-three per cent of critical retail workers are women. In fact, women make up 52% of all essential workers, and 73% of the healthcare workers who have been infected with Covid-19. And it will be women that Trump and other Republican leaders will continue to sacrifice on the altar of consumerism if they maintain their heartless calls to reopen the country before it is safe to do so. Moms will lose their jobs, financial independence and freedom, and the gains they have made as workers outside the home.</p> <p>We need more women \u2013 especially moms, who currently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/parenting/childcare-coronavirus-moms.html\">feel as if they\u2019re working \u201cfive jobs\u201d</a> to maintain a semblance of normalcy \u2013 in leadership positions to help this country navigate such an unparalleled moment in world history. We could have had a mom in the White House after the 2016 presidential election. We could have had a mom in the White House in January 2021. But the absence of both those possibilities, coupled with the tragedy we\u2019re all enduring and the cruelty and cold indifference of the men in charge, should serve as a reminder that this country would be better off, in more ways than one, if it was led by a mom.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"http://drjessicazucker.com\">Jessica Zucker</a> is a Los Angeles-based psychologist specializing in women\u2019s health, and the author of the forthcoming book I Had a Miscarriage: a Memoir, a Movement (Feminist Press, 2021)</p></li> </ul>",

She is particularly keen on the idea of making a green papaya salad. \u201cYou harvest it before it turns orange and grate it. It\u2019s good with a little lime juice.\u201d</p> <p>Competition for the fruit is fierce, though. \u201cThe birds keep their eyes on it. You have to be pretty quick to beat them.\u201d</p> <p>A huge treat is clearing out the pools. During this fine spring the biomes have reached temperatures of more than 40C, but the water is nice and cool. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely shorts and T-shirt conditions. Sometimes I think I could get along with even less because I\u2019m alone,\u201d Oldale says with a twinkle in her voice.</p> <p>Other jobs include keeping a record of what work needs to be done to allow visitors back in. \u201cBecause the biome has really been heating up, the vents have started opening automatically to control the temperature. Open vents create air movement and this paired with new growth is a bad combination, resulting in lots of snapped limbs.</p> <p>\u201cI have been monitoring the trees carefully, keeping the biome safe and pruning any snaps I am able to reach. I can\u2019t do a lot of tree work alone so I have been keeping a record of all the jobs we will be able to do when the team is back. We\u2019ll use a cherrypicker and even work from ropes to make the rainforest safe before we invite the public back.\u201d</p> <p>Usually pests are controlled by releasing predatory and parasitoid bio-controls \u2013 insects that like to eat or parasitise the main pest species such as aphids, scale insects and mealybugs. \u201cThis is not possible right now, so as an alternative I have been clearing out annual crop displays and cutting back as much herbaceous material as I can. This will reduce food sources for pests and help me to keep the biome clean and tidy.\u201d</p> <p>Oldale\u2019s situation has some parallels with the ecologist in the 1972 film Silent Running, who are alone in outer space with a dome filled with forest trees saved from Earth. \u201cEveryone is feeling isolated in some way,\u201d said Oldale. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to keep the biome going for when visitors can return.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s nothing like a global pandemic when you want to slip a contentious planning application in under the radar. As all attention is focused on Covid-19, <a href=\"https://www.investgateshead.com/article/2104/Gateshead-Quays\">plans have been submitted for a gargantuan new arena, conference centre and hotel complex</a> on the banks of the River Tyne, which could change the face of Newcastle-Gateshead for ever. The timing is striking. Just as the future of conferences and other mass events is being called into question, the developers are pressing ahead with one of the biggest people magnets the north-east has ever seen.</p> <p>Billed as bringing \u201canother landmark destination\u201d to Gateshead Quays, the \u00a3260m project will occupy one of the most prominent sites in the region, slap bang between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/nov/28/urbandesign.arts\">Sage concert venue</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/jul/16/artsfeatures.regeneration\">Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art</a>. Designed by <a href=\"https://www.hok.com/\">arena specialist HOK</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.ahr.co.uk/\">AHR architects</a>, the scheme is set to bring a 12,500-seat arena, 300-room hotel and three vast exhibition halls to the 10-acre waterside site, along with shops and restaurants, all packed inside a crumpled mishmash of competing structures. It looks like the compromised result of design-by-committee, employing a plethora of materials and awkward angles in a vain attempt to break up the lumpen mass. Public reaction has been caustic. \u201cThey\u2019re proposing to build something from scratch that looks like the result of multiple awkward extensions to a 1970s shopping centre,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adambanksdotcom/status/1257279247254781952\">commented one Twitter user</a>.

For almost two decades, the heart of Gateshead\u2019s waterfront has been scarred by a great windswept wasteland. On one side stands the Sage, a divisive building \u2013 variously compared to a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/content/articles/2004/12/13/sage_gateshead_have_your_say_feature.shtml\">metallic peanut and a swollen slug</a> \u2013 but one that seems to unite all opinions with its world-class acoustics. It was designed by Norman Foster in the early 2000s, at around the same time that he was conjuring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/17/norman-foster-president-pyramid-architects-built-astana\">vanity monuments for central Asian autocrats</a>, and it has always seemed cast adrift, marooned up a slope on the edge of a car park.</p> <p>Across the other side of the windswept tarmac expanse, down several flights of stairs, across a road and down yet more steps, stands the Baltic, a 1950s flour mill transformed into a gallery in the Tate Modern mould, opened in 2002. Together with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2001/sep/24/architecture.artsfeatures\">winking Millennium Bridge</a>, which cleverly pivots to let boat traffic through, these projects were an impressive symbol of Gateshead\u2019s culture-led regeneration programme during the New Labour years \u2013 only let down by the great unplanned mess between them.</p> <p>\u201cWe always held it up as an example for our students,\u201d says Mark Tewdwr-Jones, professor of town planning at Newcastle University, \u201cof how not to do planning. That site has been a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for planning disasters.\u201d</p> <p>While the Newcastle side of the river was subject to a Terry Farrell masterplan, led by the former Tyne &amp; Wear Development Corporation in the 1990s, the Gateshead side never had an overarching idea in place. John Devlin, Gateshead council\u2019s development director at the time, says the Sage and Baltic were conceived as \u201canchor tenants\u201d that would then encourage private development for the space in between. In 2004, Taylor Woodrow built an S-shaped flank of cheap-looking apartment blocks that loom <a href=\"http://idpartnership.com/portfolio/housing/baltic-quays/\">immediately behind the Baltic</a>, but their plans to continue across the rest of the site ran out of steam. Other proposals came and went over the years, but nothing stuck.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74d24d02456e4ade613897587330ca3069f1eb81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74d24d02456e4ade613897587330ca3069f1eb81/0_485_4900_2939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trinity Square shopping centre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harbinger of doom \u2026 the unpopular Trinity Square shopping centre, built in 2013</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Islandstock/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe could never make it stack up,\u201d says Peter Udall, director of economy, innovation and growth at Gateshead council. \u201cWe have long had the ambition for a conference centre on this site, but we could never find the right operator. This is about the third attempt to get something that works.\u201d</p> <p>Following an open <a href=\"https://www.ojeu.eu/\">OJEU tender</a> process, developer Ask Real Estate and German investment manager Patrizia were selected to work with the council to bring forward plans for the site. As the duo behind Manchester\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/15/manchesters-25m-home-sorely-missed-architectural-opportunity\">uninspiring First Street development</a>, where the cut-price arts venue Home is hemmed in by a tacky hotel and offices, it is not an auspicious choice.</p> <p>\u201cIt was going to be a rather safe mixed-use development with offices and hotels,\u201d says Udall, \u201cbut then SMG [an arena-operating firm, now known as ASM Global] came on board and it became far more ambitious.\u201d ASM currently operates the <a href=\"https://www.utilitaarena.co.uk/\">Utilita arena</a> (formerly the Metro Radio arena) across the river in Newcastle and intends to shift its operations to the new complex in 2023, if the project goes ahead.</p> <p>The resulting design betrays the piecemeal nature of its evolution, with AHR architects in charge of the boxy hotel and HOK attempting to cram the rest of the facilities on the steeply sloping site, linked by a clumsy series of terraces and steps. In an attempt not to drown out the \u201ciconic\u201d status of its illustrious neighbours, the architects have resorted to a language of banal blocks, jazzed up in places with jaunty angles and faceted rooftops, wrapped in a busy palette of brick, slate, concrete, glass, Corten steel and expanded metal mesh \u2013 the latter material listed as \u201cto disguise\u201d, as if in the hope that people might not notice the hulking great pile.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://public.gateshead.gov.uk/online-applications/caseDetails.do?caseType=Application&amp;keyVal=Q93DO9HK0E000\">planning application</a>, the architects describe how brick is used to \u201cdraw on the industrial heritage of the site\u201d while the roof of the squat river-facing block has a \u201csawtooth movement leading to a gradual crescendo\u201d towards the Sage. \u201cThe organisation and massing of the large scale components has been carefully curated to complement the immediate context and neighbouring buildings,\u201d they continue, in garbled platitudes. \u201cThe expression of the buildings take visitors on a cognitive journey through the site and give clues to the usage and communicates to the visitor at each interface.\u201d By attempting to be both landmark building and background filler, the only journey the architects offer is a one-way ticket to cognitive dissonance.</p> <p>The council is in a bind. While the Sage, the Baltic and the Millennium Bridge were all the result of international design competitions, and led by the council, for this project it has handed over control to the private sector, with predictable results.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b45073cea247ff17ec4d54ba606bad068aa9a27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b45073cea247ff17ec4d54ba606bad068aa9a27/9_0_3850_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clog on the Tyne \u2026 a rendering of Gateshead Quays from the waterfront.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clog on the Tyne \u2026 a rendering of Gateshead Quays from the waterfront.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of HOK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe process is very different,\u201d says Udall. \u201cWe were the client for the other three projects and were a lot more involved in the detail of the brief. With the arena and conference centre, we feel we can still maintain our influence, but the choice of architect is up to Ask and Patrizia.\u201d</p> <p>Why not insist on an architectural competition, given it is such a prominent site? The complex will be centre stage in views from the Tyne Bridge, and confront anyone looking across the river from Newcastle for generations. \u201cI think we\u2019d have lost the developer if we had insisted on going down the competition route,\u201d says Udall. \u201cIt\u2019s such a massive building with so many commercial constraints for the operator. A grain of sand can derail this kind of project.\u201d</p> <p>In the calibre of its design, the proposals sadly call to mind the Trinity Square development nearby. Once home to <a href=\"https://c20society.org.uk/lost-modern/trinity-square-car-park-gateshead\">Owen Luder\u2019s brutalist car park</a>, featured in the 1971 film Get Carter, it was demolished to make way for a comically bad Tesco with student flats on top, shortlisted for the <a href=\"https://www.bdonline.co.uk/buildings/carbuncle-cup-trinity-square-gateshead/5070309.article\">Carbuncle Cup in 2014</a>. As Owen Hatherley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/27/brutal-unrepentant\">wrote at the time</a>: \u201cWith this demolition, we\u2019re exchanging architecture as a physical experience for buildings as a mute, grinning, lobotomised accompaniment to consumerism.\u201d</p> <p>It is true that development economics in Gateshead are not comparable to London or Manchester. The town centre is full of vacant retail units, while half of the population has a total household income of under \u00a330,000. The local authority clearly has more urgent priorities. But that\u2019s no excuse to see the waterfront desecrated with such mediocre fare. Enjoying the rare position of being a major landowner, and having a recent history of commissioning brave buildings for the arts, Gateshead council must have the confidence to insist on better.</p>",

Not from the terraces, of course, but hey, you can\u2019t have it all. </p> <p>The K-League was meant to start in February, so many of these players will have endured an impatient off-season akin to the A-League\u2019s fabled five-month preparation. They\u2019ll be raring to go, you\u2019d imagine, although two Australians who will be used to months of hill sprints are Suwon\u2019s Adam Taggart and Terry Antonis, presumably in action tonight.</p> <p>What better way to kick things off then two powerhouses of the Korean game: reigning champions Jeonbuk Motors v cup winners Suwon Bluewings.

  "<p> My father, Paul Kennedy, who has died aged 78 after suffering from pancreatic cancer, was a writer and sociologist, and a hugely popular lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University. His final book, Vampire Capitalism (2018), was a prescient study of the devastating effects of liberal capitalism on both the masses and the environment. He also co-authored, with Robin Cohen, the influential Global Sociology (2000), published in eight languages.</p> <p>His early published works, including Ghanaian Businessmen (1980) and African Capitalism (1988), focused on development issues in west Africa, where his sympathy towards indigenous entrepreneurs was viewed as heresy by the Marxists dominating the field in the 1970s and 80s. In the late 90s he co-founded the Global Studies Association, working with academics from all over the world to analyse the impact of globalisation on the lives of ordinary people.</p> <p> Born in Hayes, Middlesex, to Tom Kennedy, a sewing machine mechanic, and his wife, Joyce (nee Coats), a secretary, Paul attended Drayton Manor grammar school in Ealing, west London, then studied sociology at Birmingham University.</p> <p>On graduating in 1963, he travelled to Ethiopia where he taught English under the Voluntary Service Overseas programme. Returning to the UK two years later, he joined Birmingham University\u2019s Centre for West African Studies. In 1966 he married his teenage sweetheart, Sue Peppin, who worked with children with learning difficulties and later taught English to adult learners. They, along with their baby daughter Anna, moved to Ghana the following year where Paul began his doctoral studies at the University of Ghana, Legon. I was born during this time, in Accra. In 1971 the family returned to the UK and Paul worked at Sussex University for a couple of years before moving to Manchester in 1973, to teach at Manchester Polytechnic.</p> <p>In 1976 the family moved back to Ghana for Paul to take up a teaching post at Cape Coast University. Cape Coast was then far more impoverished than Accra, and there were severe food shortages, with only rice, plantain and yam readily available to eat. After a few months Paul was hospitalised with hepatitis and the rest of the family, suffering with malnutrition, malaria and hepatitis, returned home. Paul stayed on to finish his contract and became involved in the student protest movement, which saw him arrested at gunpoint and imprisoned for two days.</p> <p>Back in the UK, Paul joined the sociology department at Manchester Polytechnic where he remained for almost 40 years until his retirement in 2014.</p> <p>A great nature lover, Paul was a keen ornithologist, gardener, and advocate of sustainable living long before it became a fashion. He was a brilliant cook, famed among his PhD students for his annual Ghanaian curry nights, a member of Altrincham choral and allotment societies and a volunteer at his local wildlife conservation group.</p> <p>He is survived by Sue, their children, Anna, Rebecca and me, and two grandchildren, Jasmine and Camille.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br><br></p>",

  "<p>It was only a few years ago that BT\u2019s policy on dividends was to shoot for an increase of 10%, minimum, annually. That was downgraded to a \u201cprogressive\u201d approach, meaning up a bit, in May 2017. Now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/bt-suspends-dividend-to-free-up-5g-broadband-investment-coronavirus\">shareholders\u2019 rations</a> are being suspended and, when a divi returns in the 2021-22 financial year, it\u2019ll be at half the old level.</p> <p>Chairman Jan du Plessis and the new (ish) chief executive, Philip Jansen, offered obligatory apologetic words to investors about a \u201cdifficult\u201d decision, but this was a case of bowing to the inevitable. A cut to finance investment in the fast-fibre network should have happened before now.</p> <p>The City, which had expected a light dividend trim rather than a full lockdown crew cut, was appalled. But boldness seems the correct choice. The pandemic has underlined the need for superfast broadband across the nation and BT was horribly exposed to yet another round of political argy-bargy. Best to get ahead of events.</p> <p>The good news for non-shareholders, therefore, is that BT is now equipped to spend big \u2013 or bigger \u2013 on fibre. Jansen has upped his target from 15m to 20m premises by the \u201cmid- to late-2020s\u201d, which represents a commitment of \u00a312bn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/bt-suspends-dividend-to-free-up-5g-broadband-investment-coronavirus\">BT suspends dividend to free up 5G and broadband investment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But shareholders themselves, once they\u2019ve overcome the shock of another downwards lurch in the share price, ought to view the reset positively. Assuming the last pieces of the regulatory fix fall into place, Jansen sees BT making a pre-tax return of 10%-12% on its fibre investment. The return is not without risk, but the terms are decent for infrastructure that could be used for half a century.</p> <p>The shame is that BT\u2019s boardroom was so slow to turn. Blame the old guard \u2013 led by former chairman Sir Mike Rake and former chief Gavin Patterson \u2013 that expended corporate energy fighting Ofcom and politicians over the pace of fibre investment. What was the point? The frustration tactics didn\u2019t work, and the dividend proved unaffordable anyway.</p> <p>An earlier divi sacrifice would not have spared BT shareholders\u2019 pain, obviously, but everybody would have been better off by now. BT\u2019s share price would surely be higher than today\u2019s 10-year low. And the UK\u2019s connectivity would rank higher in international league tables, which is rather more important. A lot of time was wasted on squabbles for no gain.</p> <h2>Virgin-02 strategic merger will not move digital mountains</h2> <p>The planned creation of Virgin-02 probably had zero influence on BT\u2019s investment thinking as the merger has been unveiled only this week. But a bigger rival should usefully intensify competition in future, right?</p> <p>Well, up to a point. The merging duo\u2019s corporate parents \u2013 Liberty Global for Virgin and Telefonica for 02 \u2013 are making a logical strategic move, but their primary motive looks to be financial. The new corporate beast will be saddled with debt on day one, allowing Telefonica to extract \u00a35.7bn in cash and Liberty \u00a31.4bn from the transaction.</p> <p>The joint venture will also be \u201cinvesting \u00a310bn in the UK over the next five years\u201d, announced the owners, which is a handy sum but is also only the aggregate of what Virgin Media and O2 would have been expected to spend anyway.</p> <p>In combination, there\u2019s an opportunity to spend more smartly by marrying 5G and broadband technology and offering consumers an integrated package. Liberty has had success on the continent that way. Yes, it\u2019s possible this is the moment when British punters decide \u201cquad play\u201d is more than marketing spiel.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear, though, a clever financial deal, with Liberty inserting large accumulated UK tax allowances, does not necessarily \u201cchange the digital landscape\u201d, which was the boast.

  "<p>My grandmother Edith Redstone, who has died aged 101, was a co-author, in her 70s, of the popular book Growing Old Disgracefully, which suggested ways in which women can get the most out of their later years. Its publication in 1993 led to a global tour by Edith and its five other authors, and in the UK precipitated the launch of a nationwide network of <a href=\"https://www.growingolddisgracefully.org.uk/\">Growing Old Disgracefully groups</a> that still exists today.</p> <p>Edith met her co-authors \u2013 all women and all over 60 - in the early 1990s on a course about ageing at the Hen House co-operative in Yorkshire, where they hatched the idea of the book. Subtitled \u201cnew ideas for getting the most out of life\u201d, it challenged accepted views of growing old, and encouraged readers to learn to age with a sense of self-esteem and playfulness.</p> <p>Edith certainly put that philosophy into action: until the end she was known for her vigour, openness, generosity and love of single malt whisky. When asked about the secret to longevity, she would reply: \u201ckeep moving\u201d. She was brilliant at adapting to change.</p> <p>Edith was born in New York to an Austrian seamstress, Tillie Bandler, and a Russian pattern-cutter, Max Halpern. After Evander Childs High school in New York, she worked in the women\u2019s clothing section of the Saks department store, studying in the evenings for a degree in engineering at Hunter College.</p> <p>When she was 22 she met an Englishman in New York, Charles Redstone, who was looking after the US operations of his family\u2019s British tobacco firm. They married in 1942 and in 1944 moved to the UK, where Edith worked during the second world war at the US Office of War Information. There she helped to write propaganda leaflets that were dropped by American planes into enemy territory; when hostilities had finished she was occasionally taken as a passenger in the bombers as they dropped humanitarian messages over Germany. </p> <p>After the war she focused on raising her two children, Amanda and Peter, in Hampstead, north London, where she and Charles lived for the rest of their lives. She combined motherhood with various jobs over the years, including polling work with Gallup and becoming a partner in the <a href=\"https://www.gillianjason.com/\">Gillian Jason Gallery</a> in London.</p> <p>A staunch anti-monarchist, she declined to receive a letter from the Queen when she hit 100, but was pleased to receive one from the former US secretary of defence Leon Panetta, acknowledging her contribution to the war effort.</p> <p>Charles died in 1994.

The poll was prompted by concerns that misinformation, such as discredited claims linking coronavirus to 5G mobile phone masts, that had been widely viewed and circulated among the public could be undermining trust in science.

The work suggests that the virus spread rapidly after it emerged in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, sometime between October and December last year, and that it was being transmitted extensively around the world early on in the epidemic \u2013 possibly entering Europe weeks or even months before the first cases were detected.</p> \n<p>In many countries, including the UK, the variety of virus mutations sampled was almost as great as the variety seen across the whole world. This suggests the virus entered the UK lots of times independently, rather than via any one \u201cpatient zero\u201d case that seeded the national epidemic.</p> \n<p>The fact the virus has mutated is not in itself sinister, according to Prof Francois Balloux, who co-led the work. \u201cAll viruses naturally mutate,\u201d he said. \u201cMutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest Sars-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected. So far we cannot say whether [it] is becoming more or less lethal and contagious.\u201d</p> \n<p>Identifying which sections of the virus genome are mutating most rapidly is important for vaccine development \u2013 if a vaccine candidate targets a region of the virus that later changes, it is less likely to be effective.</p> \n<p><strong>Unequal risk of deaths for people from different ethnic backgrounds</strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">Data from the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics</a> found that black people are more than four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people, in figures that starkly show the divergence in the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in England and Wales.

South America is also highlighted as a region of concern, due to the rapid deforestation of the Amazon, as well as Myanmar, where there has also been rapid forest clearance.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that one of the most positive things to come out of horrible tragedy will be the realisation that there is a link between how we treat the forest and our wellbeing,\u201d said Tierra Smiley Evans, an epidemiologist at the University of California who studies virus distributions in forest species in Myanmar. \u201cIt really impacts our health.

  "<p>Sea-level rise is faster than previously believed and could exceed 1 metre by the end of the century unless global emissions are reduced, according to a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-020-0121-5\">survey</a> of more than 100 specialists.</p> <p>Based on new knowledge of climate sensitivity and polar ice melt, the experts say coastal cities should prepare for an impact that will hit sooner than predicted by the United Nations and could reach as high as 5 metres by 2300.</p> <p>\u201cA global sea-level rise by several metres would be detrimental for many coastal cities such as Miami, New York, Alexandria, Venice, Bangkok, just to name a few well-known examples. Some may have to be abandoned altogether as they cannot be defended,\u201d said co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.</p> <p>In the worst-case scenario \u2013 with rising emissions and global heating of 4.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 the study estimates the surface of the world\u2019s oceans in 2100 will be between 0.6 and 1.3 metres higher than today, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming\">would potentially engulf areas </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming\"> home to hundreds of millions of people</a>.</p> <p>By contrast, if humanity succeeds in cutting carbon dioxide and holding the increase in temperature to 2C, the rise would be a more manageable 0.5 metre.</p> <p>The figures for both pathways are more pessimistic than those outlined by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), which predicts the worst possibility is a 1.1-metre rise by 2100.</p> <p>The gap reflects advances in climate science and differences in approach. The IPCC works largely through consensus among scientific working groups, which tends to produce relatively conservative estimates.</p> <p>By contrast, the new survey \u2013 published in the journal Climate and Atmospheric Science \u2013 aggregates the views of 106 specialists, who were chosen because they have published at least six peer-reviewed papers on the subject in major academic journals. As a result, the predictions are more representative of a range of views in the field.</p> <p>The higher estimates highlight growing concern about the world\u2019s two biggest ice sheets, in Antarctica and Greenland. Satellite data and on-the-ground measurements show these regions are melting faster than most computer models predicted. Many of the scientists said there was now greater understanding of the risks posed by marine ice-cliff instability, which can lead to the collapse of ice shelves.</p> <p>The study was led by scientists at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore with support from seven research institutions across the world, including Durham University in the UK, Tufts University in the US and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.</p> <p>The lead author, Prof Benjamin Horton of the university\u2019s Asian School of the Environment, said the research aimed to condense the growing mass of academic studies about sea-level projections into a simple overview. \u201cIt is useful to survey leading experts on the expected sea-level rise, which provides a broader picture of future scenarios and informs policymakers so they can prepare necessary measures,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The authors said the results showed how much warming \u2013 and sea-level rise \u2013 could be avoided if governments fulfilled their 2015 Paris climate agreement promises to cut emissions of the gases that are heating the planet. Most countries are far off reaching their goals.</p> <p>\u201cLike in the Covid pandemic, timing is critical to prevent devastation. If you wait until you already have a serious problem, then it is too late. Unlike with corona, sea-level rise cannot be stopped for many centuries or even millennia once ice sheets have been destabilised past their tipping points,\u201d Rahmstorf said.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has temporarily slowed the discharge of carbon dioxide and methane because there are fewer cars on the road and industrial activity is lower. The <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/\">International Energy Agency</a> projects global fossil fuel emissions will decrease by 8% this year.</p> <p>But, without deeper structural changes, the reduction is likely to be temporary and will make little difference to the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The Met Office predicted on Thursday carbon dioxide measurements at the Mauna Loa measuring station would rise 2.5 parts per million this year.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough emissions are reducing this year, this does not mean the build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere will reverse \u2013 it will just be slightly slower\u201d the Met Office\u2019s chief CO2 forecaster, <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/richard-betts\">Richard Betts</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.metoffice.gov.uk/2020/05/07/coronavirus-will-impact-the-atmospheric-co2-record-but-not-enough-to-slow-global-heating/\">said in a blogpost</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAn analogy is filling a bath from a tap \u2013 it\u2019s like we are turning down the tap, but because we are not turning off the tap completely, the water level is still rising.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>California took its first cautious steps towards reopening, seven weeks after the state became one of the first to order its residents to stay at home to curb the spread of the coronavirus.</p> <p>A small set of retailers, including bookstores and clothing shops, were allowed to reopen their businesses with curbside service on Friday but not have customers in their stores. Manufacturers\u2019 warehouses considered low risk for the virus could reopen as well.</p> <p>The new guidelines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/04/california-lockdown-business-reopen-coronavirus\">were announced</a> by the California governor, Gavin Newsom, and move the state into the second phase of a methodical four-step process to full reopening. They also allow some local governments to move faster with reopening than the state overall if the counties meet certain testing and tracing requirements and have a healthcare system that can handle a potential surge.</p> <p>In this phase, roughly 70% of the state\u2019s economy will reopen with modifications in place, Newsom said at his Friday briefing. Though optimistic at the direction the state was heading, he warned Californians to \u201cbe sober about this reality\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to want to remind you and need to remind you of the incredible importance of vigilance at this moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThis pandemic has not gone away. We may be exhausted by it, we may be chomping at the bit to get back to some semblance of normalcy, but we had 1,898 new positive cases yesterday. We had 81 families torn apart because of the loss of a loved one.\u201d</p> <p>Newsom said the state government wants to work with local counties who could open up sooner. \u201cNot every part of the state will move at the same time,\u201d he acknowledged.</p> <p>The governor also announced California would send every registered voter a mail-in ballot in the upcoming November elections. Newsom signed an executive order Friday that he hopes will give voters a choice and make sure they \u201cdon\u2019t feel like they have to go into a concentrated, dense environment where they feel like their health is at risk\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no safer, physically distancing way to exercise your right to vote than from the safety and convenience of your own home,\u201d said California secretary of state Alex Padilla. Voters will still have the option to vote in person, he added.</p> <p>In many cities, this week\u2019s changes did not lead to immediate dramatic changes. Several local governments have announced they will take more time to open up, and many smaller retail stores have already organized curbside pickup. In the Los Angeles region, where half of the state\u2019s Covid-19 deaths have occurred, officials are <a href=\"https://corona-virus.la/SaferLA\">maintaining most restrictions</a> and making only \u201cminor adjustments\u201d, allowing some brick-and-mortar business to start curbside pickup, including music stores, bookshops, florists and clothing stores.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/coronavirus-california-rural-counties-reopen\">'Covid's not the only health issue': inside the rural counties defying California's lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The county, which remains the primary coronavirus hotspot in California, was also reopening some popular hiking trails and golf courses, but have said residents must continue to practice social distancing and wear face coverings if near others.

Like LA, bookstores, florists and music stores will be the first merchants allowed to operate storefront pickup, the city said.</p> <p>\u201cGiving businesses the option to reopen and provide storefront pickup will provide some relief for everyone in our city \u2013 allowing some people to get back to work, while still protecting public health,\u201d the mayor, London Breed, said in a statement. \u201cThe last thing we want is to see a spike in the number of cases or hospitalizations, so we\u2019re going to be keeping close track of our key Covid-19 indicators and will be ready to make any adjustment needed to keep our community healthy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3333758fbcb36282eba472eae6dc601230ba3f8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3333758fbcb36282eba472eae6dc601230ba3f8b/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A flower seller waits for customers on the first day of the reopening of Los Angeles flower market.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A flower seller waits for customers on the first day of the reopening of Los Angeles flower market.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Streets and sidewalks in Oakland\u2019s Chinatown appeared reanimated on Friday morning, with more traffic than they\u2019ve seen since mid-March.</p> <p>Many grocery store workers wore full face shields, as shoppers sifted through produce displayed outside the markets. \u201cToday\u2019s been the busiest, that\u2019s the only difference,\u201d said a stockperson at Aloha Market. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly grocery stores and restaurants around here, so not a lot has changed \u2013 just more people\u201d.</p> <p>On the eve of Mother\u2019s Day weekend, business appeared to be buzzing at From Heart Florist. Staff made fast work out of flower arrangements, prepping bouquets for pickup orders and delivery.</p> <p>Some rural counties in northern California didn\u2019t await the governor\u2019s decision. Modoc county was the first last week to allow its only movie theater to resume operations. Yuba and Sutter counties <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/coronavirus-california-rural-counties-reopen\">started opening up businesses</a> such as retail stores, gyms, salons and tattoo parlors on Monday, prompting a warning from the governor they were making \u201ca big mistake\u201d.</p> <p>In Yuba City and Marysville on Tuesday, few customers wore masks when they entered stores or strolled along the sidewalks. The counties\u2019 public health commissioner warned the business communities the next day to make sure employees and customers adhere to social distancing guidelines and wear face coverings. \u201cIt has become clear a number of businesses are not enacting required protocols to ensure the safety of the community,\u201d Dr Phuong Luu said.</p> <p>State regulators have begun contacting businesses opening early, but are focusing less on penalizing them and more on gaining voluntary compliance. Thirty-three salons in two counties that had reopened in defiance of the statewide order have now shut down again, Newsom said. \u201cThey\u2019re now working with us in the spirit of collaboration and cooperation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Businesses across California, America\u2019s most populous state, are eager to follow suit. Since the stay-at-home order was issued on 19 March, more than 4 million Californians have been put out of work. Newsom projected on Thursday the state will have a budget shortfall of $54.3bn because of the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus.</p> <p>Small groups of protesters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/california-coronavirus-protests-huntington-beach-sacramento\">have gathered in cities</a> across the state in recent weeks, urging Newsom to open up.</p> <p>Public health officials have cautioned, however, that the state has not seen a sustained decline in Covid-19 cases, and that its capabilities to test people and trace who might have been exposed to the virus are nowhere near those of countries like South Korea and Germany that have successfully eased restrictions.</p> <p>By Thursday, California had recorded more than 61,000 confirmed cases and 2,500 deaths. If the numbers continue to decline, the next phase in the governor\u2019s plan could see salons, gyms, movie theaters and in-person church services resume. That phase, however, could be months away. Phase four would end all restrictions and allow for large gatherings at concerts and sporting events.</p> <p>Jefferson Wagner, owner of Zuma Jay surf shop along the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, put up a sign that said \u201cno mask, no service\u201d as he prepared to reopen on Friday, allowing customers to order in advance and pick up surfboards, apparel or other items in the parking lot. \u201cWe\u2019ve got full inventory. We\u2019re well stocked after two months of doing nothing,\u201d said Wagner, 66, who is also a longtime Hollywood special effects operator. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get these businesses open \u2026 though in LA and Malibu, we\u2019re not the kind to run around and carry banners and firearms to protest.\u201d</p>",

AFL players, league confirms</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From AAP: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The AFL won\u2019t mandate its players to have a flu vaccination ahead of the season resumption and will leave the decision up to footballers and their respective club doctors.</p> \n   <p>NRL players are required to either have the flu vaccination or sign waiver forms as rugby league works towards a planned 28 May season restart.</p> \n   <p>But the AFL maintains flu shots will be at the discretion of players and club staff, not a league-wide policy.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWhile the AFL recommends players and officials to get a yearly flu shot, the decision is ultimately that of the player and club doctor as to whether they wish to do so,\u201d an AFL spokesperson said.</p> \n   <p>On Friday morning, Gold Coast Suns captain <strong>David Swallow</strong> questioned whether flu vaccinations should be compulsory in the AFL if players weren\u2019t comfortable with them.</p> \n

possibility of domestic travel from next month. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAll the signs are pointing to green shoots of domestic travel from June,\u201d Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director <strong>Simon Westaway</strong> said, according to AAP. </p> \n  <p>Westaway said while there was a long way to go before tourism returned to normal, members had already expressed their excitement about the plan for the way out.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really important about today is that there has been a level of certainty put out there,\u201d he said</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe level of uncertainty has been a big part of the angst for our industry.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But he said the biggest challenge facing tourism operators was the ongoing closure of state borders.</p> \n  <p>He said if businesses in the sector could be given confidence about when they would reopen, that would help stimulate its recovery.</p> \n  <p>Despite the easing of restrictions in some states from next week, Westaway said he didn\u2019t expect every 4WD would be on the road straightaway.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI think people are going to be a bit circumspect to a degree,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI think

extension to deadlines, the Australian community still expects to see action on the Banking Royal Commission.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Australians just want fair treatment from our financial

It\u2019s been an extraordinary period of self-reflection, new wisdoms, self-actualisation \u2026</p> <p>Mel O\u2019Gorman wrote a paean to a daughter thousands of miles away. Here is an extract:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dear Daughter,</p> <p>The upside of a situation like this one is that is forces us to focus fiercely on what matters. When we think we are near to extermination we jerk on our chains of complacency and become very clear on the things that truly matter. One of these for me are the unspoken conversations that we neglect to have or are embarrassed to have in the usual social mill when everyone is around and having fun together in the unending social whirl. Or our social habit of cool nods to the neighbours who are always strangers.</p> <p>This is now a quieter time, a blessed lull in the world that was speeding so fast with so many lost opportunities for real conversation. Now as we are all forced to look within we can see so clearly that the precious links between us all had become frayed and ragged.</p> <p>I hope that you are feeling this change in our mode of connecting. I hear it more clearly now every morning in the birdsong that heralds each new day with its melodies of pure joy. I also hear it in the news reports with more and more evidence about the kindness of people to each other. I see neighbours no longer taking each other for granted. Or involved in really helping each other for the first time. Reporting on this before was seen as dead news. Now it is at the centre of our locked down lives. We are learning again that how we celebrate ourselves and each other is the key to our happiness in this chaotic and rapidly changing world.</p> </blockquote> <p>Maria Andrea Melo Cruz got in touch from Spain</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My learning is that there is something magical about stopping, not having scheduled appointments, or having the obligation to meet friends. From this lockdown I get the pause, the silence and the ability to know what really matters. All we need is a little food, an important reason to live, to be loved and a someone to love. This coronavirus teaches us that we can really live with very little. The constant travelling, the full schedule, the compulsive shopping are all things that are totally expendable. In my case I now only eat twice a day, wake up at 5:30 to meditate, read newspapers from around the world every day and practice yoga. All this makes me feel really happy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Priya Ohri wrote in from Birmingham</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have learnt that this time could be spent creating a documented account of your life. The ups, the downs, what you\u2019ve learnt, what mistakes you\u2019ve made. I don\u2019t mean an exasperated comprehension of what the news is telling you, but what you, personally, want to tell the next generation in years to come. What you want to recall from this stilted time. How we lived in our homes, what we saw in our community, what we cooked, how we fought. The list is endless.

  "<p>There are many reasons you might want to think about cycling for commuting or other transport when the coronavirus lockdown starts to ease, particularly if you live in a city.</p> <p>With physical distancing remaining in place for some time to come, capacity on public transport <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-52539585\">will be limited</a>. If more people drive it will create gridlock.</p> <p>Thus, cities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/01/encourage-cycling-and-walking-after-lockdown-uk-mayors-told?CMP=fb_gu&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR35Lo3grt1wSZW30rqttyeivLhR3Qw5FQJ0inkygrqX4Q7zNNPAz1r3z1E\">are being encouraged</a> by the government to do all they can to promote cycling, as well as walking, as a way of getting around. Safer routes are being rolled out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/cycling-could-increase-five-fold-in-london-after-lockdown\">in London</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-52561862\">Manchester</a>, with others likely to follow.</p> <p>What if you\u2019re a cycling newcomer? Which obstacles, and practicalities, might you need to think about? Below is a list of 10 possible ones. It\u2019s by no means exhaustive, so do add any thoughts in the comments.</p> <p>But it is meant to be hopeful: reasons to get on a bike, not reasons to think again. Covid-19 has been a tragedy for the UK and countless other nations. But as it eases, some aspects of life will change. More bikes on the roads is one where it could change for the better.</p> <h2>1. Remember \u2013 it\u2019s safer than you might think</h2> <p>Safety, and just as importantly, perceived safety, is perhaps the biggest barrier to more cycling. And if you start riding regularly, a scary incident or two with a motor vehicle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/11/female-cyclists-bad-driving-harassment-study-uk-women-men-near-miss\">is inevitable</a> at some point. But while the UK\u2019s streets could and should be much safer for cycling, very serious incidents remain rare, with a serious injury or death <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/686969/pedal-cycle-factsheet-2017.pdf\">once every million miles</a> ridden.</p> <h2>2. You\u2019ll be doing yourself a lot of good</h2> <p>About 100 cyclists are killed a year in the UK. But how many people die because of ailments connected to long-term physical inactivity? <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/physical-activity-applying-all-our-health/physical-activity-applying-all-our-health\">About 100,000</a>. Everyday cycling is <a href=\"https://www.eltis.org/sites/default/files/case-studies/documents/anderson_et_al_2008_all-cause_morality_5.pdf\">one of the </a><a href=\"https://www.eltis.org/sites/default/files/case-studies/documents/anderson_et_al_2008_all-cause_morality_5.pdf\">best ways</a> to improve your health. Even a fairly sedate pace counts as moderate activity, and if you rack up half an hour of this, five times a week, you\u2019re already past the recommended minimum for aerobic activity.</p> <h2>3. The health benefits massively outweigh the risks</h2> <p>Studies <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.0901747\">have calculated</a> that even in the UK, the benefit\u2013risk ratio is about seven to one. This even includes pollution. A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019337122\">new study</a> has found that the health gains from both walking and cycling outweigh the risks from smog even in cities like Beijing and New Delhi.</p> <h2>4. You\u2019ll be doing others a lot of good</h2> <p>This might not be your primary motivation, but it all counts. If you cycle rather than drive, you\u2019re sparing others the associated noise, danger, climate emissions and pollution of car use. This last is particularly relevant given studies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/is-air-pollution-making-the-coronavirus-pandemic-even-more-deadly\">linking high levels of pollution</a> to worse outcomes from coronavirus.</p> <h2>5. You\u2019ll enjoy it \u2013 really*</h2> <p>For most people, commuting is a chore. Yes, on a train or bus you can listen to a podcast, and a car might feel like precious time alone to think. But your destiny is not in your hands. Bikes have the near-magical ability to, 99% of the time, deliver you to your destination within more or less a minute of when you expected, often with a smile on your face. Bike travel is on a human scale, and at a human speed. It simultaneously gets you places fast, but keeps you in touch with the environment and people around you. All this can become quite addictive.</p> <p>*Not every single day. But most days.</p> <h2>6. You don\u2019t have to dress up in Lycra</h2> <p>There is nothing wrong with donning the full <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=mapei+cycling+kit&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiN3-LI1aHpAhVDihoKHRZ1BIgQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=mapei+cycling+kit&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAA6BAgAEEM6BggAEAgQHjoGCAAQBxAeOggIABAIEAcQHlDGiAJY6JkCYOWbAmgAcAB4AIAB5QGIAb0JkgEFMC44LjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZw&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=r_OzXs3LHsOUapbqkcAI&amp;bih=696&amp;biw=1391&amp;hl=en-GB#imgrc=X_irBWBHv5MqKM\">1990s-style Mapei team colours</a> for your ride to work if you prefer, and then having a shower and a change of clothes when you arrive. But for many people this can feel like a chore \u2013 not least making sure you have the necessary clean shoes and jacket at the office. So why not cycle in your work clothes? If your commute isn\u2019t too long or hilly, you don\u2019t need to arrive a sweaty mess. If it is long and/or hilly, you could get an e-bike (see below). The key is not to carry a bag on your back: think about panniers or \u2013 my personal choice \u2013 a basket or crate at the front of the bike. You may also want mudguards, and maybe a chain guard, but this is all fairly simple stuff.</p> <h2>7. Don\u2019t be afraid to rely on bike shops</h2> <p>It is a long time ago now that bike shops were intimidating places, staffed by unsocialised types who \u2013 as in one now reformed London outlet I shall not name \u2013 would sigh heavily if you couldn\u2019t immediately remember the difference between Presta and Schrader inner tube valves. They tend to be very welcoming and happy to talk about anything from a new bike to the best puncture-proof tyres. Most people who run or work in bike shops tend to love cycling. Bike shops are permitted to be open even under the lockdown, as they are considered essential services. Some are not open, but even then it\u2019s worth giving them a ring.</p> <h2>8. Maybe think about an e-bike</h2> <p>Electric-assist bikes are considerably less clunky than they used to be, but they\u2019re just as much fun. If your commute is long or has some steep sections, or indeed if you\u2019re taking an increasingly heavy child to nursery on the way, they could be the answer. Or even if you\u2019re not. Yes, you do get help from an electric motor, but e-bikes are not cheating. Studies <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259019821930017X?via%3Dihub#bb0015\">have shown</a> that e-bike users tend to get about as much physical activity as those on ordinary bikes, mainly because they tend to use them more often and ride further.</p> <h2>9. Don\u2019t worry too much about punctures or the weather</h2> <p>Those are often significant concerns for newcomers. On the former, modern, puncture-resistant tyres like Schwalbe Marathon Plus are not hugely cheap, but astonishingly durable. I cycle most places, and average maybe one puncture a year at most. And if it rains, you can either not cycle \u2013 it isn\u2019t compulsory, yet \u2013 or put on some waterproofs. You can even do this over work clothes and still arrive fairly presentable. As for the cold, well, it\u2019s May. By the time it temperatures drop again in the northern hemisphere you\u2019ll own six bikes and have strong opinions about the next <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/apr/06/bradley-wiggins-tour-of-flanders-cycling-climbs-cafes-flemish-ardennes\">Tour of Flanders</a>. The cold will be the least of your concerns.</p> <h2>10. One for everyone else \u2013 be welcoming and patient to newcomers</h2> <p>If I can politely beckon in the veterans standing at the back, it\u2019s also up to you. The actions of other cyclists are by no means one of the major barriers to cycling, not least as they\u2019re really not going to kill you. But a repeated lack of patience, a tendency to overtake closely and at speed, and just a general tendency to selfishness can be pretty wearing and dispiriting. Such behaviour comes from a very small minority of riders. The next few weeks are going to be a potentially big moment for everyday cycling in the UK, and there are going to be some nervous people on the roads. Let\u2019s just all be thoughtful.</p>",

  "<p>The world I grew up in was always circumscribed by war: I was five years old when it began, and it was all I knew. There were lots of rules. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/01/blackout-britain-wartime\">The world was black</a> \u2013 no chinks of light from curtains, or someone would come knocking; no street lights, shop windows, tiny hand torches to find your way. Just total blackness, so the bombers wouldn\u2019t see.</p> <p>They came anyway, lighting up the sky as our nearest city, Manchester, burned. We would huddle safe in our underground shelter, grabbed from my bed in the dark by my father, nestled among soil and spiders. As I grew older we played hiding from Germans in the wheatfields, and swapped pieces of fallen shrapnel. We were aware of mysterious worried chatter among the grownups. My father\u2019s Home Guard rifle stood in the hall.</p> <p>Then suddenly, in May 1945, there was this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/exhausted-relieved-yearning-for-change-britain-on-ve-day\">explosion of light</a>: brightness was everywhere. And excitement, laughter, joy. Everything was allowed. \u201cIt\u201d was over. Even our teachers relaxed, laughing too. The great deadly cloud of threat lifted. We knew from the song that, \u201cSomewhere over the rainbow skies are blue, and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true\u201d. And they had. It was our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU\">Over the Rainbow</a> moment.</p> <p>From my village, Hazel Grove, south of industrial, smoky Stockport, the clanging tram would take me to school and back every day. But VE Day was different: a corporation tram was decked out with lights on every surface, glittering like Cinderella\u2019s coach. As the evening darkened it came rattling down the track, through cheering crowds. At the terminal we were all gathered: families, shopkeepers, teachers, doctors. Even the vicar.</p> <p>For the first time I was allowed to gallivant off with friends. Suddenly all the young people joined hands, circling the now stationary tram, and skipped and danced round it into the night. Yes, the world would never be the same again: a future without war, without bombing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/08/rationing-second-world-war1\">rationing</a>, fear, damage, death. </p> <p>Today, 75 years later, I ask myself: will it be like this when the coronavirus is defeated? Our release, when it comes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/uk-will-need-social-distancing-until-at-least-end-of-year-says-whitty\">will be slow</a>, conducted out of sight by scientists, measured and sometimes clumsy. But though we can\u2019t expect that instant euphoria, there are larger parallels.</p> <p>The war taught us many things: fellow feeling, shared values, resourcefulness. People grew their own fruit and veg, kept chickens. Of course, there was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/aug/29/blitz-london-crime-flourish-blackout\">black market</a>; petty crime increased, and the rich dined at the Dorchester. The rest of us took our ration books when we went on holiday. But we knew it would end, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/11/second-world-war-rebuilding\">the world would be changed</a>.</p> <p>Above all, we appreciated the power of the state to organise for the benefit of everyone: even the royal family was said to limit their bath water to 5 inches deep \u2013 a requirement instinctively obeyed by us all, even if unpoliced. A vast infrastructure of recruitment, to the services and factories, the commandeering of transport on roads and ports, was all part of the war effort. \u201cDon\u2019t you know there\u2019s a war on?\u201d was a good-humoured response to anyone complaining.</p> <p>But something else was afoot. The years before the war had seen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/18/great-depression-photography-art-exhibition-chicago\">Great Depression</a> and suffering among working people. Today we acknowledge the damage the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/14/austerity-poor-disability-george-osborne-tories\">recent years of austerity</a> did to the lives of the poorest, and in that sense to us all. With both the war and the pandemic has come the resolve, hardly formulated today but widely shared, that we can\u2019t go back to the old ways. There is a drive to make things better.</p> <p>During the war, improvements were already being mapped out: in 1942, William Beveridge (a Liberal) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/10/beveridge-five-evils-welfare-state\">published a report</a> attacking what he called the five giants: idleness, ignorance, disease, squalor and want. He first used the phrase \u201cfrom cradle to grave\u201d to describe universal provision, and his study would be a blueprint for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education\">postwar welfare state</a>.</p> <p>In 1944 Rab Butler ( a Tory) saw through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/apr/22/1944-education-act-butler-policy-today\">Education Act</a>, which completely transformed schooling in Britain by abolishing fees for all state secondary education. It also introduced the 11-plus exam, splitting educational options: I, the granddaughter of factory workers, passed, and went to a grammar school. This was all happening even as we battled the enemy in the Mediterranean and Normandy. It was based on creating a more equitable society, and there was a wide consensus this should be so. It translated into a Tory defeat in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/26/in-praise-1945-general-election\">1945 general election</a>. Churchill was shocked: hadn\u2019t he won the war for us? But change was pressing forward.</p> <p>Will change on a similar scale come to us in the coming years? Who is doing the planning right now? Who is setting out the blueprint for a fairer society?</p> <p>The ever growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/22/wealth-gap-widening-for-more-than-70-per-cent-of-global-population-researchers-find\">disparity of wealth</a> \u2013 between individuals, between countries \u2013 is probably the major blight of our present world order. It is, like Covid-19, a global issue. In confronting the one, as we already are doing, we could also seize the chance to confront the other. It is an opportunity that may not come again.</p> <p>\u2022 Joan Bakewell is a broadcaster, writer and Labour peer</p> <p><br><br></p>",
  "<p>In making his landmark post-Brexit speech in February under Sir James Thornhill\u2019s baroque painted ceiling in the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, Boris Johnson believed he had found the perfect setting to paint his own picture of Britain charting a new course as a free-trading, independent, open and liberal nation.</p> <p>Like the painting above him, eulogising the triumph of William and Mary over the popish and tyrannical French, Johnson\u2019s speech was an optimistic and patriotic piece of work. It offered a distinctive vision of British prosperity and diplomatic superiority.</p> <p>The speech had no hint that the world he described, and Britain\u2019s place in it, was under any existential threat. But the past three months have left UK foreign policy thinkers suddenly searching in the fog for Britain\u2019s future role in this changed world.</p> <p>Indeed, as the UK prepares to celebrate VE Day, the institutional order created by the west following the defeat of Germany, and on which Johnson\u2019s vision rested, seems after 75 years finally to be coming apart. Those institutions, in which the UK thrived, are either paralysed, or a battleground.</p> <p>Covid-19, an invisible enemy, but deadlier than the blitz, has exacerbated and accelerated trends recalibrating risk, revealing new Great Powers and placing all UK diplomatic alliances under scrutiny. Sir Simon McDonald, the foreign office senior mandarin, says it is a \u201cwatershed moment for humanity\u201d, and a chance for \u201ca world reset\u201d.</p> <p>Ministers have postponed the foreign and security policy review, due to have been published this autumn, to devote time to fighting the virus. Yet the UK\u2019s most senior diplomats, including at foreign office executive committee level, are already examining Britain\u2019s strategic posture.</p> <p>The question of the UK\u2019s greatest ally, the US, currently, in the words of the former foreign secretary David Miliband, \u201ca flagship for dysfunction\u201d can be set aside until the US elections.</p> <p>For most British analysts, the most pressing foreign policy question for the UK will be its relations with China. Will the divisions between the US and China deepen so much that, regardless of the outcome of the US election, all nations, including the UK, are sucked into its vortex, requiring Britain to choose? If so, multilateral solutions become harder.</p> <p>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has spoken of the need for \u201ca deep dive\u201d into the role of China, adding vaguely: \u201cWe cannot have business as usual.\u201d The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has backed an inquiry.</p> <p>The mood towards Beijing on the Tory benches, already sceptical, is turning ugly and suggests at minimum that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/29/johnson-faces-tory-rebellion-over-huawei-5g-plans-for-britain\">the Huawei deal</a> will not survive in its current form, placing other Chinese infrastructure projects in the UK at question.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all paying the price for Beijing\u2019s decision to ignore the science, prioritise trade \u2013 and put the rest of the world\u2019s health at risk,\u201d says Tom Tugendhat, the liberal internationalist chair of the foreign affairs select committee. His committee is relentlessly pressing the foreign office for clear strategy on China. It\u2019s clear that his committee will at minimum demand the UK adopt takeover rules that sees Chinese investment as a security risk.</p> <p>Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s former special adviser and a long-term China sceptic, has lambasted \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2015/oct/27/where-does-britain-draw-the-line-with-saudi-arabia-and-china\">David Cameron\u2019s Operation Kowtow</a>\u201d and identified the chief culprit as George Osborne and the Treasury. He says: \u201cJust as Harold Macmillan had perceived that, as British power declined, we should play Athens to America\u2019s Rome, Mr Osborne thought he could pull off a geopolitical pivot that would strengthen Britain for decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>Echoing the US State Department, Timothy adds: \u201cIt is surely now obvious that China is also a strategic rival to the west as a whole. It is an autocratic and oppressive state, with wildly different values and interests to our own. Its policy towards Asia, Africa and elsewhere is inevitably imperialistic. And its modus operandi \u2013 setting debt traps for countries to gain leverage over them and engaging in mass industrial espionage \u2013 is a danger to our interests and those of our allies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09077ac6cc0d9df384c3f896ca2985860032d0f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09077ac6cc0d9df384c3f896ca2985860032d0f6/0_141_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soldiers help to carry out Covid-19 testing in Plymouth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soldiers help to carry out Covid-19 testing in Plymouth. In a post-coronavirus world, the case for traditional defence spending is weakened.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MoD/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this context, British alliances with Japan and South Korea, rivals to China, will be at a premium.</p> <p>But a faultline on China is emerging in the Tory party. The Foreign Office is urging caution, making the case for keeping a few bridges unburnt. The former foreign secretary Lord Hague told Policy Exchange: \u201cWe can\u2019t solve global problems without China. And global problems are some of our most pressing and obviously most existential. The Covid-19 crisis is an example of such a dramatic world crisis. So we can\u2019t be dependent on China, but we can\u2019t be without a framework of cooperation with China.\u201d</p> <p>McDonald agrees: \u201cThere is no problem that the world faces today that can be addressed, still less solved, without the active participation of China.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband also argues that a balance needs striking. He says he has no illusions about China. \u201cIt is obvious that the Chinese state is being very confident in its response to Covid-19, describing it both as a success and the product of its one-party system. Their message is being effectively delivered \u2013 through aid supplies and diplomatic outreach around the world. It is much harsher than before, with crackdowns at home and favour-buying abroad.\u201d</p> <p>But that does not mean cooperation with China should be seen as appeasement, Miliband argues. \u201cWe need to worry about a democratic recession, and the debate about whether democracies or autocracies coped best in this crisis is materially relevant to lives around the world, but it is really important this debate does end up excluding the need for institutions that encompass both democratic and autocratic regimes.\u201d<br> China is not just a seminar discussion for the UK. Britain needs China on board if its chairmanship of the UN climate change conference, set for Glasgow in November but now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\">delayed until the middle of next year</a>, is to be a success.</p> <p>Even now the best UK diplomats are pressing China to adopt bolder carbon emission targets for 2030. McDonald has said he hopes the coronavirus crisis will lead to greater Chinese ambition. \u201cBuild back better\u201d has long been part of UK disaster relief thinking, and has now become the slogan of those preparing green post-coronavirus stimulation packages.</p> <p>But there are countervailing forces. Many of the building blocks for Glasgow have been removed. An EU-China meet-up scheduled for September and seen as a moment for China to float new targets has been cancelled. A Chinese-hosted conference on biodiversity, a chance to discuss carbon sinks and nature based solutions, has <a href=\"http://sdg.iisd.org/events/2020-un-biodiversity-conference/\">also been postponed</a>, while governments are under pressure to save industries such as aviation.</p> <p>Above all, even under a Democrat presidency, relations between China and the US will be on a downward curve, making a climate change agreement more difficult. Tim Benton, head of the Chatham House energy and environment programme, foresees an uphill task for Britain\u2019s diplomats. He argues that: \u201cAny tension that undermines the existing international architecture \u2013 whether it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/wto\">WTO</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">WHO</a>, UNFCCC [the UN framework convention on climate change] \u2013 anything that creates stress is going to get in the way of reaching climate change targets.</p> <p>\u201cYou can imagine there is so much to-ing and fro-ing between major powers vying for their own nationalistic interest that climate change just gets pushed further down the agenda because economic reconstruction is seen as so much more important.\u201d</p> <p>Economic reconstruction leads to the Brexit question. For many diplomats, the thought of piling a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/04/no-more-deal-or-no-deal-no-10s-brexit-diktat-to-foreign-office\">no-deal Brexit</a> on to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\">\u00a3300bn coronavirus hit</a> to the UK economy looks less like an act of self-harm, and more like a death wish. McDonald, speaking to the foreign affairs select committee, held out the faint hope that it was still an open question whether the PM might yet revisit the timetable.</p> <p>Robin Niblett, Chatham House director, senses Johnson will not delay, but instead look for a short-form agreement. \u201cIf you think that by the summer, the politics may get nastier with inquests about how we got into quite such a mess, and the money for what was called levelling up has been diverted to survival \u2013 the survival of businesses and the economy \u2013 then Johnson may feel politically he has to follow through on Brexit. Once you delay, you lose your agency and Brexit is about agency, as much as it is about control.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband predicts the UK and the EU might settle for an outline deal that leaves details to be negotiated.</p> <p>Either way, the integrated review will have to work with changed assumptions about both resources and security. \u201cThe budget for global Britain promises to be brutal,\u201d Niblett says.</p> <p>In the UK, growth is due to fall 7% this year. The World Trade Organization sees world trade declining by between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-putting-world-on-track-for-new-great-depression-says-who\">13% and 34%.</a> Covid\u2019s lasting legacy may be a switch away from just-in-time imports towards shorter supply chains and national sourcing.</p> <p>In this deglobalising world, Johnson\u2019s promise in Greenwich to be \u201ca superhero champion\u201d of free trade looks incongruous. The US \u2013 with which the UK seeks to sign a signature free-trade deal \u2013 is in free fall.</p> <p>Yet Johnson fervently believes that the coronavirus only strengthens the case for a free-trade deal. Any scrap of extra growth becomes important.</p> <p>At the same time, definitions of security are in flux. In the view of Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, the virus ranks alongside the cold war or 9/11 in terms of its security implications. The original concept of the walled state as protector has been reasserted, but the case for traditional defence spending has weakened.</p> <p>The army has had its role in the UK crisis, but the aircraft carrier has proved irrelevant, acting as much as an incubator as a shield from the virus. If the new stealth bomber is a pathogen, vaccines are the new missile defence system.</p> <p>In a post-coronavirus comprehensive spending review it will be health and not defence that will be first in the queue for the distribution of dwindling resources, Chalmers suggests.</p> <p>Beatrice Heuser, professor of international relations at Glasgow University, predicts defence officials \u201cwill have to cook their books like hell to reach the Nato target of spending at 2% of GDP\u201d.</p> <p>There is a final issue for Britain: relevance. Many analysts also fear that the UK\u2019s credibility as a leading convening power on the whole nexus of issues of the climate crisis, global health and development has taken a hit by its performance over coronavirus.</p> <p>Bill Gates may right to say that no country is likely to get an A grade for its pandemic preparedness, but judging by the European press the UK is currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/complacent-uk-draws-global-criticism-for-covid-19-response-boris-johnson\">near the bottom of the class</a>, labelled, rightly or wrongly, as leading on \u201cherd immunity\u201d and then abandoning the policy.</p> <p>Niblett argues that \u201cBrexit was such a shock to people that thought Britain was pragmatic and had a sense of its national interest. Now the almost wilful lack of preparation over coronavirus makes it feel like Britain just assumed it was separate, an island off the coast of Europe, and it has discovered it is not. It does play into a lethal combination of incompetence and hubris that has been used against Britain for a while now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"474b8ea51dc251dd3a9480feb52b244383b0b4c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/474b8ea51dc251dd3a9480feb52b244383b0b4c7/0_182_5981_3589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson Visits a laboratory in Bedford in early March\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson visits a laboratory in Bedford in early March.

Even though our scientific and university calling card remains unparalleled, the NHS was held up to a mirror and it has been shown at best to be underfunded. We could be put into an Anglo\u2013US box of just-in-time living, and that seems less worthy of imitation. Soft power is all about attraction and people wishing to imitate you.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband also issues a warning that Britain will need to be \u201cbrutally honest about its mistakes or risk irrelevance\u201d.</p> <p>He sees one cause of optimism. \u201cThis may be the first global crisis where it is British universities seeking a vaccine, British companies developing contact tracing apps, British NGOs framing global connections. It is these institutions that may lead government rather than government provide the lead.\u201d</p> <p>The Foreign Office is also urging Johnson to recognise there is a hard-won reputation on which he can draw. As far back as 2008, the UK government published a cross-government white paper entitled \u201chealth is global\u201d. The paper argued that health should be seen as \u201can agent for good in foreign policy\u201d so the UK was in at the birth of health diplomacy.</p> <p>The UK may have been trounced in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\">election to head the WHO in 2017</a>, but there are influential Brits all around the international health set-up. UK\u2019s strong medical research base, large aid budget and an interventionist mindset gives Johnson the platform from which to engage. The natural instinct within Whitehall is to be a player, but it will require leadership that only a prime minister can provide.</p> <p>Greenwich, according to Nicholas Hawksmoor, writing in 1728, was chosen as the site of Royal Hospital because it was located on the bend in the river \u201cin the View of all the World and in the Sight of the Grand Emporium London\u201d.</p> <p>The nation\u2019s wealth and global outlook were seen as interdependent. It will be up to Johnson to decide if and how he honours that tradition.</p>",

This is a very dangerous and treacherous virus.

  "<p>In liberal democracies, the integrity, impartiality and professionalism of intelligence agencies matters. That\u2019s why it is essential that intelligence agencies remain aloof, not only from the political debates of the day, but also from the policy decisions that individual governments may take. The intelligence community\u2019s core task is to provide brutally realistic analysis on the threat environments we face so that governments can then make the best-informed policy decisions possible to preserve our common security.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/09/usa.iraq2\">failures of the intelligence community </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/09/usa.iraq2\">before the Iraq war</a>, the gullibility of much of the western media, as well as the cynical manipulation of both by the political class of the day, provide us with a stark reminder of what can go radically wrong. On 8 September 2002 the New York Times published one of this century\u2019s most consequential news articles.

Hundreds of thousands of people were killed, first in the invasion, then the ensuing chaos, then in the rise and fall of Islamic State. It strengthened Iran\u2019s hand in both Iraq and Syria. It contributed to a massive outflow of refugees across the world, a factor in the resurgence of the far right across Europe. And Washington has spent nearly two decades trapped in a Middle Eastern mess of its own making, diverting much of its attention from China\u2019s regional and global rise.</p> <p>Lies were reported as facts. Credible sceptics were downplayed, ignored or attacked as unpatriotic \u201cappeasers\u201d. The thrill of landing a big \u201cstory\u201d overtook the media\u2019s fundamental duty to prevent the public from being deceived. Journalists who believed they were muscling up to a looming security threat turned out to be working instead against their own countries\u2019 long-term interests.

The sheer magnitude of the damage means that the people of the world have every right to know how this came about. Whether China\u2019s new class of \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomats care to recognise it or not, there are fundamental questions we can all legitimately demand answers to. These include the origin of the virus in Wuhan; whether the earliest genetic evidence of the outbreak has been properly preserved for independent research; the danger of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/how-did-the-coronavirus-start-where-did-it-come-from-how-did-it-spread-humans-was-it-really-bats-pangolins-wuhan-animal-market\">wildlife \u201cwet markets\u201d</a> in the transmission of such viruses; what delays occurred in notifying central authorities; why some local medical staff were either <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">silenced or punished</a>; what delay occurred in notifying the World Health Organization of human-to-human transmission, given China\u2019s obligations under the relevant international health regulations. There are also fundamental questions on whether the WHO properly discharged its mandate to provide clear and early warnings to the international community. And whether national governments took all necessary actions to prepare for the virus reaching their own shores, or whether these warnings were effectively ignored \u2013 as appears to have been the case in the US.</p> <p>But amid all these questions, and the parallel debate about the mechanism now needed to conduct an effective international inquiry, we suddenly have a unilateral declaration by the US president and his secretary of state that the body of evidence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory\">overwhelmingly points to the virus having leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology</a>, where research projects have been under way into various categories of coronavirus borne by bats. They claim a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d in this theory, citing compelling but as-yet undisclosed evidence \u2013 despite the US director of national intelligence issuing a rare public statement disparaging this theory.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The bitter lessons of Iraq appear to have been lost on Trump and the Murdoch empire that supports him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Enter the \u201cglobal exclusive\u201d story of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Australian Daily Telegraph last weekend, headlined \u201cChina\u2019s batty science \u2013 bombshell dossier lays out the case against the People\u2019s Republic\u201d. The paper claims to have been leaked a 15-page research dossier prepared by unnamed \u201cwestern governments\u201d on the Chinese government\u2019s culpability for the outbreak. The clear inference from the Telegraph report is that the document was prepared by the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence community linking the US, UK, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand intelligence services. Other Murdoch journalists, re-reporting the story, have expressly stated it was a Five Eyes document. While the article itself shies away from stating explicitly the document\u2019s authorship, the newspaper goes on to detail a number of investigatory actions being undertaken by the Five Eyes to nail the Chinese state\u2019s responsibility.</p> <p>The most critical part of the Telegraph newspaper report deals with apparent divisions among the wider intelligence community on the authenticity of the \u201cWuhan laboratory leak\u201d thesis. And it\u2019s here that Murdoch\u2019s paper becomes explicit in its assertion that the Five Eyes research dossier helps validate the as-yet-unproven claim by Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo that the virus was \u201cinvented\u201d at the Wuhan laboratory. The article and associated stories are laced with colourful reporting about Chinese \u201cbat virus\u201d researchers \u2013 \u201cbat men\u201d, \u201cbat women\u201d and other tales from the Wuhan bat cave. Nonetheless, having delivered its political ordinance in support of Trump and Pompeo, the Murdoch story carefully and cleverly seeks to cover its traces by stating repeatedly that nothing is yet proven about the laboratory leak.</p> <p>The Murdoch journalist in question, Sharri Markson, a few days later pops up as the prime interview on the Murdoch-owned US cable TV network Fox News. The interviewer is none other than Trump\u2019s personal favourite, Tucker Carlson, who together with Sean Hannity are his cheerleaders-in-chief in the American media. Right on cue, Tucker chimes in that the dossier \u201cis the most substantial confirmation of what we\u2019ve suspected that we\u2019ve had so far\u201d and that \u201cbecause it\u2019s a multinational effort I think it would be hard to dismiss it as a political document\u201d.</p> <p>The truth is, at this stage, none of us know definitively whether the virus came from the Wuhan laboratory. The best we can do is accept the Australian government\u2019s assertion that this is at best a 5% possibility. Politically, the bottom line is that the leak of this alleged Five Eyes intelligence dossier to the Murdoch media in Australia, before being resold back into the US political audience by the very same Murdoch media, appears designed to back Trump\u2019s and Pompeo\u2019s claim. But this time with the added \u201cauthenticity\u201d factor of the dossier being \u201cmultinational\u201d and not just a normal drop from the White House to Fox, which have become a dime a dozen.</p> <p>This is all about US presidential politics. There are three issues in this campaign: Trump\u2019s handling of the virus; how to dig the US out of its virus-induced economic hole; and who can be most hardline on China \u2013 the Donald or \u201cBeijing Biden\u201d, as the Republicans now seek to tag his Democratic opponent. There\u2019s little else on the table. Therefore, using an intelligence leak pushing Chinese culpability, laundered through a foreign country, turbocharged with the credibility factor of being an alleged Five Eyes product, helps the partisan political cause. And let\u2019s be clear: Murdoch is campaigning full-bore for Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/rupert-murdoch-open-letter-journalists-coronavirus-fox-news\">Rupert Murdoch, Fox News\u2019 Covid-19 misinformation is a danger to public health | Todd Gitlin and others</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here are questions now for the Australian government and potentially its Five Eyes partners. First, was this an \u201cintelligence\u201d product, or was it simply open source material derived from information in the public domain? Second, was it an authorised Five Eyes product, or was just prepared in the US? Third, who leaked it, given that leaking such material is a criminal offence \u2013 as the US has made plain in its handling of Chelsea Manning\u2019s and Julian Assange\u2019s cases that included the large-scale unauthorised release of<br>classified Five Eyes material. Were any ministers of the Australian government complicit in this? Or was the US embassy in Canberra involved? If the Australian government is serious about the protection of classified documents, then why hasn\u2019t a full police investigation been commissioned? Or is the government fearful of what it might discover if, as is likely, the leak has been driven by political and electoral interests within the US.</p> <p>The extent to which the Australian intelligence community has sought to distance itself from the \u201cdossier\u201d suggests it does not wish to be in any way drawn into domestic politics \u2013 either Australian or American. The British intelligence community <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/australia-hits-back-at-us-claim-linking-coronavirus-to-wuhan-lab\">is reportedly doing the same</a>. This is good. These institutions appear to have learnt from the Iraq war fiasco and the political abuse of intelligence agencies that occurred at that time. But on this question, the bitter lessons of Iraq appear to have been lost on Trump and the Murdoch empire that supports him.</p> <p>China has much to answer for, including the ultimate origins of the virus. But if Trump\u2019s claim in the Wuhan laboratory saga ultimately ends up being disproven, either by the Five Eyes or by US intelligence itself, then the irony is that the net political winner will be China. Remember the humiliation when no WMD were found in Iraq? Beijing would seek to exonerate itself as a result of egregious presidential overreach \u2013 once again aided and abetted by the Murdoch media. This is why the watchword of any sophisticated intelligence agency is caution in endorsing premature conclusions until all the facts are on the table.</p>",

It enjoyed 120 consecutive months of job growth and the lowest unemployment rate it saw in many years. It was making measurable progress in paying down pension obligations. </p> <p>Three months later, said Newsom, the state is facing a shortfall of tens of billions. </p> <p>Almost $12 billion in unemployment has been released just since March 15. Those job losses will soon trickle down to local governments, making messes out of next year\u2019s budgets and forcing tough decisions. </p> <p>Every budget around the globe will in some way be impacted by the pandemic, but the losses have outsized impact in a state whose economy is the fifth largest in the world. </p> <p>\u201cThis moment is directly related to COVID-19, not mismanagement. But because of this pandemic, these revenue shortfalls are bigger than even the state of California,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this. This will be challenging ... But my optimism is conditioned on this: more federal support,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Moving forward will require a historic level of partnership between states and federal governments, he said. While the CARES Act has been profoundly beneficial, the enormity of the moment demands even more support. </p> <p>\u201cThis is bigger than all of us and we really need the fed government to do more and help us through this moment. We punch above our weight in this state. We\u2019ll come back stronger than ever.

We\u2019re interested in argument and will try to provide some flexibility. But it\u2019s a health-first frame,\u201d Newsom said. </p> <p>Among the conditions: health officials must attest that they\u2019ve had no more than one case per 10,000 people in the last 14 days, no deaths in the past two weeks, and that they could handle a surge in hospitalizations from coronavirus. </p> <p>They must also be able to conduct 1.5 tests for every 1,000 residents, have 15 contact tracers, or \u201cdisease detectives\u201d per 1,000 residents, can support homeless residents, and skilled nursing facilities must have a two week supply of personal protective equipment on hand. </p> <p>\u201cIf they can\u2019t meet the guidelines, we aren\u2019t able to accommodate that and will enforce in a thoughtful and judicious way.
