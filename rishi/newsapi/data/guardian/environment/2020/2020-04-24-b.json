  "<p>Insurers expect to pay out \u00a31.2bn to businesses and individuals hit by the coronavirus crisis, including a record figure for cancellation claims on travel policies, the industry trade body has revealed.</p> <p>The figure, which the Association of British Insurers (ABI) described as a working estimate, includes \u00a3900m in business disruption claims, \u00a3275m in travel claims and \u00a325m for customers covering weddings, school trips and other events. The initial total compares with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/20/storm-dennis-damage-could-cost-insurance-companies-225m\">more than \u00a3400m</a> for the two February storms this year.</p> <p>The ABI said that while most businesses did not have cover against Covid-19, some of those that did were likely to make substantial claims. It added that because such cover was rare, insurers had not built up reserves to pay claims.</p> <p>The spotlight has been on the industry since the crisis began, as businesses have faced problems making claims. While some have discovered they were not covered under the terms of their policy, others claim that insurers are not meeting their promises.</p> <p>On Thursday, 100 pubs and bars said they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/uk-firms-plan-legal-action-against-hiscox-over-covid-19-insurance-claims\">taking legal action against the insurer Hiscox</a> over its response to business interruption claims.</p> <p>The ABI\u2019s director general, Huw Evans, said insurers were \u201cpainfully aware that the majority of businesses are uninsured for global pandemics\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cAlthough ABI members expect to pay \u00a3900m in business interruption claims, most policyholders are not covered for pandemic losses.</p> <p>\u201cWe agree strongly that the UK should examine public-private partnerships to find a lasting solution, to enable more affordable, more extensive pandemic insurance cover to be available to those firms who want it.\u201d</p> <p>The chair of the Treasury select committee of MPs, Mel Stride, urged insurers to be clear and fair in their dealings with customers. He said UKHospitality, a trade body for hotels, pubs and bars, had reported that 71% of its members had had claims rejected.</p> <p>Stride said: \u201cThere may be many instances where individuals and businesses believe they are covered, but in reality may not be. However, we are concerned that the insurance sector goes the extra mile in meeting claims wherever possible.\u201d</p> <p>The ABI\u2019s estimate does not include claims made through Lloyd\u2019s and the London Market, so is not an estimate of the total UK cost of the crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Public memory is a funny business.</p> <p>The New Zealand government spent $65m on its first world war commemoration programme. According to its own figures, 93% of New Zealanders aged 15 and over engaged in the centennial in some way. The futility of war was the most-cited emotional response, which is interesting when put alongside the programme\u2019s objective to strengthen \u201cnational identity\u201d (read: the nation state) and an \u201cenduring commitment to peace, global security and international cooperation\u201d (read: current and future wars).</p> <p>The foundation stone of this nationalist and militarist commemoration was, and is, Anzac Day. Every year on 25 April the country marks the anniversary of New Zealand and Australia\u2019s 1915 colonial invasion of Turkey. State events and dawn ceremonies have been present from the very beginning, held every year since 1916.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/feb/01/beating-the-khaki-drum-how-australian-identity-was-militarised\">Beating the khaki drum: how Australian identity was militarised | Paul Daley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this year Aotearoa New Zealand will not mark Anzac Day with public services. Lockdown restrictions to eliminate Covid-19 has seen all dawn ceremonies and other civil events cancelled. Instead, people can decorate their letterbox, lay a virtual poppy or hashtag their tweets. For the first time since 1916, Anzac Day will be relatively free of the state.</p> <p>For some, the idea of not having a public dawn service will be hard. Even this historian of wartime resistance has trouble imagining what Anzac Day will look like without them. Some of my earliest memories of Anzac are of emerging into the cold, autumnal morning to attend a dawn service. My understandings of why were vague. Yet the message was clear. The simple act of getting out of bed and attending a dawn service was enough to say to an eight-year-old boy: if you fight and die for your country, you will be remembered.</p> <p>This year, we have an opportunity to jettison the militarism and remember the trauma of war in a different way. This year, we may be able to escape what the Pulitzer prize-winning novelist and scholar Viet Thanh Nguyen calls the \u201cindustrialisation of memory\u201d and consider the root causes of war, as well as the voices that are heard in wartime commemorations and those that are not. Not having a public commemoration defined and organised by the state might just enable a \u201cjust\u201d remembering of war.</p> <p>What would a just remembering of war look like? This year we don\u2019t need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/apr/23/anzac-day-should-be-quarantined-from-politicians-a-solemn-moment-to-reflect-on-the-enduring-agony-of-war\">to ban politicians, as Guardian writer Paul Daley has suggested</a>, as there are no public events for them to crash. Would it be to <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2048-416X.2014.12001.x\">focus on the horror of war</a>, what David Aldridge claims to be the only justifiable approach to the commemoration of war, especially in education? Would it be to widen our remembering to others, to those our grandfathers and great-grandfathers killed with bullets and bayonets, and the millions of <a href=\"http://www.whitepoppies.org.nz/\">civilians killed and maimed</a>? Would it mean recognising <a href=\"https://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2016/06/28/dissent-during-the-first-world-war-by-the-numbers/\">the thousands of wartime resisters</a> \u2013 M\u0101ori included \u2013 who would not fight for the state? Would it mean refusing the day altogether?</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to war, the basic dialectic of memory and amnesia is not only about remembering and forgetting certain events or people,\u201d writes Nguyen. It is also \u201cabout remembering our humanity and forgetting our inhumanity, while conversely remembering the inhumanity of others and forgetting their humanity.\u201d For Nguyen, doing justice to the historical trauma caused by war involves recognition of both the humanity and inhumanity within ourselves and within others.</p> <p>Personal reflection at home might be the perfect way to start. So, as we stay in our bubbles and avoid state-sanctioned memory-making, we can decide to commemorate Anzac Day (or not) on our own terms. And maybe it will mark the dawn of an honest, meaningful, and \u201cjust\u201d remembering of war.</p> <p><em>Jared Davidson is an archivist and labour historian based in Wellington, New Zealand.</em></p>",

We are in constant dialogue with our governing bodies about when and how that will happen and we will continue to engage with this forum to keep fans consulted.</p> <p>\u201cAnd while it may be that games need to be played behind closed doors in the shorter term, we all recognise that football will not be fully back to normal until supporters are once again in attendance.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>February 2020 was the wettest February on record for the UK and the fifth wettest of any calendar month in a series dating back to 1862. 209mm of rain fell across the country, and some areas recorded as much as four times their normal February rainfall, resulting in severe flooding.</p> <p>So how does this compare to the UK\u2019s wettest month on record: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/weatherwatch-britains-wettest-october-on-record-1903\">October 1903</a>?

Part autobiographical, part how-to live a non-conventional life, part essay on the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle, part character study and part cook book \u2013 it has no obvious genre. It is an invaluable historical archive and there are so many parallels we can draw from her experience in the 60s and 70s, to how we live with technology now.</p> <p> In one memorable portion, a young child takes the author foraging, to teach her which chicories are for eating fresh, and which for cooking. This child was well versed on the names and uses for these foraged wild foods, because children from this village had been taught how to identify food by being taken out for walks with their elders, thus continuing to transfer folk tradition and knowledge. <br><br>This book is full of wisdom on simple living and taking pleasure in cooking \u2013 although she never gives precise measurements \u2013 that\u2019s exactly why I love it.</p> <h2>Mr. Wigg</h2> <p><em><strong>Inga Simpson, <a href=\"https://www.hachette.com.au/inga-simpson/mr-wigg\">published by Hachette</a></strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"95af8be98c8ad7afd4d2a4a52492fb6833a2f1a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95af8be98c8ad7afd4d2a4a52492fb6833a2f1a5/0_0_1592_2488/640.jpg\" alt=\"Mr Wigg book cover\" width=\"640\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Although this book is fiction, the titular Mr Wigg could be virtually every farmer I know.

In other words, businesses have to front the money to pay their workers for each month, and then claim it back through the tax office.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/24/jobkeeper-payment-eligibility-ato-tax-for-sole-traders-start-date-faq-application-jobseeker-payments\">Jobkeeper payment: check your eligibility.

hundreds of thousands of dollars that they need to pay now to get into the program, but just don\u2019t have.</p> \n<p>None of this is the fault of Australia\u2019s banks \u2013 </p> \n<p>it is instead a fundamental flaw in the way the program was designed by Morrison and his treasurer, Josh Frydenberg.</p> \n<p>And expecting businesses that are already broke to borrow more money is also pretty rich.</p> \n<p>Banks have so far <a href=\"https://www.ausbanking.org.au/banks-bolster-efforts-to-help-businesses-bridge-the-gap-to-jobkeeper/\">loaned $700m</a> to businesses to help them get through the crisis \u2013 which sounds like a lot but really isn\u2019t anywhere near enough.</p> \n<p>Guardian Australia understands about half has come from Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, and reports from businesses suggest smaller banks have struggled to get their systems up to scratch quickly.</p> \n<p>But the big problem with going to the bank is that businesses are borrowing to get behind.</p> \n<p>This is, once again, because the jobkeeper payment is made after the fact.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related:

next month \u2026 and have to immediately borrow the money again to meet the next month\u2019s payroll.</p> \n<p>While banks are offering an interest deferral for six months, that just means interest payments are quietly compounding in the background, ready to mug business owners when the crisis is over and they\u2019re expected to resume making payments.</p> \n<p>As a result, many businesses have done the sums and closed their doors rather than get further into hock.</p> \n<p>For the Liberal party, which is supposed to be the champion of small business, a failure to understand the basics of cashflow seems mind-boggling.</p> \n<p>But the Morrison government made two design decisions that made this problem inevitable.</p> \n<p>First, they decided not to pay workers directly, as the UK does \u2013 asked about this, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has previously <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/coronavirus/2020/03/27/wage-aid-mathias-cormann/\">claimed</a> this \u201cwould not work\u201d in Australia.</p> \n<p>He\u2019s never really explained why, given that the Rudd government was able to use ATO systems to put government money in people\u2019s bank accounts during the global financial crisis.</p> \n<p>Once the government decided to use the business tax system to make the payments, they made the second decision that ensured things would go wrong: to pay in arrears.</p> \n<p>One of the attractions of using the business tax system to make payments is that tax boffins have a very good idea of the finances of every business in Australia because of a system called single touch payroll, which <a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Other-languages/In-detail/Information-in-other-languages/Single-Touch-Payroll/\">requires</a> businesses to send wages, super and tax information to the ATO at the same time as they do their regular payroll run.</p> \n<p>This means the ATO will be able to check that correct jobkeeper payments have been made.</p> \n<p>But it also means that payments could also be made in advance, and then checked against the actual payroll.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

  "<p> Government and parliament were told by the intelligence agencies last week not to use the videoconferencing service Zoom for confidential business, due to fears it could be vulnerable to Chinese surveillance.</p> <p>The quiet warnings to limit the technology came after the cabinet had used Zoom to hold a well-publicised meeting at the end of March, a decision that was defended at the time as <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52126534\">necessary in \u201cunprecedented circumstances\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Parliament was advised last week by the National Cyber Security Centre, part of intelligence agency GCHQ, that Zoom should only be used for public business.</p> <p>A parliamentary source said those involved were advised Zoom ought not be used for classified business and there was an explicit warning from NCSC \u201cnot use it to talk about things detrimental to the interests of China\u201d.</p> <p>But the warning was only shown to people directly engaged in the negotiations, and not shared more widely with MPs, including members of the foreign or other select committees who may want to conduct inquiries into China-related matters.</p> <p>Senior parliamentary figures were also told that Zoom was safe to use for public business, and the technology was this week used as part of the proceedings in the House of Commons, including at prime minister\u2019s questions.</p> <p>Zoom has exploded in popularity during the coronavirus lockdown as a tool for communication for both social and business purposes, and is now used globally by an estimated 300 million people a day. The company\u2019s success has prompted rapid responses from competitors such as Facebook, who announced on Friday a new feature letting up to 50 people join a Messenger video chat.</p> <p> The Citizen Lab, a digital communications laboratory based at the University of Toronto, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2020/04/move-fast-roll-your-own-crypto-a-quick-look-at-the-confidentiality-of-zoom-meetings/\">warned in early April about potential security risks</a>. Security keys, which are supposed to encrypt conversations \u201cin some cases, are delivered to participants in a Zoom meeting through servers in China\u201d it said in a special report published earlier this month.</p> <p>Zoom said this traffic was mistakenly routed through China. However, the government of Taiwan \u2013 a country not recognised by China \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52200507\">announced early this month that it would ban the use of products \u201csuch as Zoom\u201d</a> where there were security concerns.</p> <p>The Citizen Lab said the popularity of the technology made it of \u201chigh priority interest to multiple governments\u201d and would make \u201cZoom a high priority target for signals intelligence gathering and targeted intrusion operations\u201d.</p> <p>Zoom is based in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, but it owns three companies in China that develop its software. The Citizen Lab said the structure allowed the company to lower its development costs, but added \u201cthis arrangement may make Zoom responsive to pressure from Chinese authorities.\u201d</p> <p>In response, Zoom has sought to beef up its security, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/23/zoom-update-security-encryption-bombing\">releasing the new version 5 of its app with greater encryption and privacy controls</a> and introducing controls to prevent \u201cZoombombing\u201d where people have hacked into meetings \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/online-support-groups-for-alcoholics-on-the-rise-during-lockdown\">such as Alcoholics Anonymous sessions</a> \u2013 to disrupt them.</p> <p>A Whitehall source said that an alert about Zoom was circulated to government departments, who were asked to pass it on to <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/key_issues/Key-Issues-Quangos.pdf\">quangos</a>, because of the concerns about whether China might be able to listen in.</p> <p>But they complained that the warning was not always being taken sufficiently seriously in parts of Whitehall, although Zoom is currently permitted for meetings where no confidential matters are being discussed.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said that \u201cZoom is being used for unclassified communications in government under unprecedented circumstance\u201d but added: \u201cOther services are in place for more sensitive communications.\u201d</p> <p>The availability of these more secure services was being increased to meet the demand of more civil servants having to work remotely, the spokesperson added.</p> <p>Zoom said its technology is being used by banks, universities and other government agencies around the world. It added the \u201crouting issues described in Citizen Lab\u2019s research were a temporary issue caused when Zoom failed to fully implement its usual geo-fencing best practices\u201d. These were fixed, it said, and customers who pay to use Zoom can customise where the traffic is processed.</p> <p>The software company said the software developers in China who work as subcontractors to the company were \u201clargely managed by our engineering team in the United States\u201d and said they did not have access to Zoom\u2019s development environment in the US.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2020/04/faq-on-zoom-security-issues/\">a second Citizen Lab report on April 8 \u2013 five days after the first</a> \u2013 said that while Zoom had taken actions to improve its security \u201cwe discourage the use of Zoom in cases where strong confidentiality and privacy is required\u201d including for \u201cgovernments worried about espionage\u201d.</p> <p> In response to Zoom\u2019s success, Facebook announced on Friday the launch of Messenger Rooms, a new feature for the company\u2019s Messenger app that allows up to 50 people to join a group chat \u2013 even if they don\u2019t have a Facebook account, an unusual move for the company that mirror\u2019s Zoom\u2019s own attempts to prioritise ease of use.</p> <p>The social network also doubled the number of people who could join an encrypted WhatsApp video call, from four to eight, and announced a raft of updates to Facebook Live, which lets users broadcast to many viewers at once. </p> <p>According to Stan Chudnovsky, vice-president of Messenger, video calling on Messenger and WhatsApp more than doubled in areas most affected by Covid-19, and views of Facebook Live and Instagram Live videos increased significantly in March.</p>",

Data has to be robust, recording of ethnicity both by country of origin or ethnic group is hugely complex. The death certificate might give country of origin, for example, but this does not tell us anything about cultural background, community and lifestyle, she says.</p> \n  <p>She says it is still \u201cpotentially\u201d an issue as we need clearer data. Public Health England will do a review into this.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s also about increased risks associated with certain ethnic groups, for instance high blood pressure and hypertension is linked to poor outcomes in Covid-19 and is more prevalent in some ethnic groups.</p> \n  <p>The disease is more likely to transmit more in close communities and will have a different impact across different socio-economic statuses. </p> \n  <p>She adds that there is very high representation in the NHS and frontline care services of minority ethnic groups.</p> \n  <p>All these things must be considered, she says.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea319558f08fa2bdcb1af56\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T16:59:33.140Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q.

It will end at the end of the year, he adds, to provide certainty to businesses.</p> \n  <p><em>Q. Are you confident that tests will be reliable and what is the failure rate for self-administered tests?</em></p> \n  <p><strong>Harries</strong> says tests can fail for several reasons including specificity, storage and sensitivity. This makes it hard to put a number on failure, she says.</p> \n  <p>In piloting the tests, she says, tests have been run in parallel using trained and non-trained persons to trial tests.</p> \n  <p><em>Q. Do you have a message to Donald Trump about the dangers of spreading misinformation?</em></p> \n  <p><strong>Harries</strong> says that clearly from a medical, professional perspective, people must use evidence-based and properly trialled treatments.</p> \n  <p>Nobody should be injecting anything, she adds.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea317a78f08e05690dc41eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T16:52:32.906Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q.

The chief executive of Heathrow Airport has called on the government for passengers to be screened for Covid-19 as they come into the country, why is this not currently being done?</em></p> \n  <p><strong>Shapps</strong> says air travel is \u201cdown massively\u201d and many of those returning have been British nationals. </p> \n  <p>He says the requirements for incoming passengers are to stay in one place and not leave for any reason.</p> \n  <p>He says countries who have taken such measures have not necessarily weathered the pandemic better. </p> \n  <p><strong>Harries</strong> adds that \u201cscreening\u201d can be reassuring and helpful to the public. Early in the pandemic, we quarantined people coming back from high-risk areas, she says. Once the disease is more prevalent, this becomes a less effective mechanism, she adds.</p> \n  <p>Once our rates are very tightly controlled, even then it isn\u2019t so simple, she says, due to variations in reliability in recording temperature and the likelihood in catching somebody during the incubation period. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea3140b8f08e05690dc418a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T16:35:03.891Z\">5.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q.

the lockdown depends on the speed at which the number of new cases of Covid-19 falls and that is as yet \u201cunknown\u201d, the health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock,</strong> has said.</p> \n  <p>The number of new cases is being tracked through hospital admissions, through a new testing study in the community announced on Wednesday, and data that will be gathered from people coming forward for tests under an expansion of the programme.</p> \n  <p>However, he added that there was no prospect of easing the lockdown yet, and that cases needed to drop substantially before the next phase of isolating infected people and their contacts could be truly effective.</p> \n  <p>Through a process of mass testing and by isolating infected people and their contacts, ministers hope that future localised outbreaks of coronavirus can be kept under control.</p> \n  <p>Hancock told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Now that we\u2019re at the peak, and we very much hope that things will start to slow down and, if and when they do, then the speed with which the number of new cases reduces will, frankly, determine how long we need to keep the measures on, and that is as yet unknown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said contact tracing worked better when the number of infections was pushed right down.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The truth is that we need to get the number of new cases down, right down, and the lower you go, the more effective contact tracing is because the more resources you can put into each individual case that gets a positive test.</p> \n   <p>You can really make sure you can get hold of all of their contacts and get them, in many cases, to self-isolate.</p> \n   <p>The smaller the number of new cases, the more effective the test, track and trace system will be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Physical distancing was driving down the numbers, Hancock said, adding that the contact tracing operation would be functioning in a \u201cmatter of weeks\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He said mass testing, contact tracing and a new contact tracing app were \u201cso crucial to holding down the rate and level of transmission of the disease\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T11:15:50.120Z\">at 12.15pm BST</time></p>

The figures are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes.</p> <h2>UK records 684 more hospital deaths</h2> <p>The Department for Health and Social Care <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-death-toll-trump-china-live-news-us-passes-480bn-relief-bill-as-ramadan-restrictions-are-imposed-indonesia?page=with:block-5ea301bc8f08fa2bdcb1adb5#block-5ea301bc8f08fa2bdcb1adb5\">reports 684 more deaths in UK hospitals</a>, bringing the death toll to 19,506. Friday\u2019s update also shows an increase of 5,386 confirmed cases, bringing the UK total to at least 143,464.</p> <h2>Recoveries outstrip infections in Spain</h2> <p>Authorities in Spain, which has seen the second largest number of confirmed cases in the world, point out that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-death-toll-trump-china-live-news-us-passes-480bn-relief-bill-as-ramadan-restrictions-are-imposed-indonesia?page=with:block-5ea2ce4f8f08fa2bdcb1aa90#block-5ea2ce4f8f08fa2bdcb1aa90\">more people are being diagnosed as cured</a> than are falling sick for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak.</p> <p>On Friday, there were 2,796 new infections confirmed while 3,105 overcame the infection. \u201cWith all the effort that we have done, the evolution of the epidemic is obviously beginning to be where it should be,\u201d said Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the ministry\u2019s health emergency centre coordinator.</p> <h2>Italy to ease lockdown, local media report</h2> <p>Newspapers in Italy are reporting that the country\u2019s lockdown, the longest and toughest in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-death-toll-trump-china-live-news-us-passes-480bn-relief-bill-as-ramadan-restrictions-are-imposed-indonesia?page=with:block-5ea2d58b8f08fa2bdcb1aaf1#block-5ea2d58b8f08fa2bdcb1aaf1\">is to be eased over the next four weeks</a>.

  "<p>I have never appreciated my back garden so much.</p> <p>At this time of year, I\u2019m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National, or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo.

A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong \u2013 more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0e6d7db7b355bf1ce59c465d4c53e6d4e9a1164c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e6d7db7b355bf1ce59c465d4c53e6d4e9a1164c/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of the tulip variety Mystik Van Eijk, 10 April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close-up of Mystik Van Eijk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A close-up of Mystik Van Eijk, 10 April.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"615c28b7e62186046b52e09b21a7b98c3fb8cb3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/615c28b7e62186046b52e09b21a7b98c3fb8cb3e/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pot filled with the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 4 April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pot filled with the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 4 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A pot filled with Christmas Dream, 4 April.</p></li> </ul> <p>I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/03/ed-jackson-rugby-interview-everest\">whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier</a>. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what\u2019s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what\u2019s out of your control.</p> <p>Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"12883e39c8eae889971f84fc01a15146a7a637ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12883e39c8eae889971f84fc01a15146a7a637ba/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mystik Van Eijk, 6 April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mystik Van Eijk, 6 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Mystik Van Eijk, with water droplets, print available <a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/home-not-away-the-tulip-project\">here</a>. </p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"3070f55a98bf56f8865f87855812d43bf31afb88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3070f55a98bf56f8865f87855812d43bf31afb88/0_0_3528_5292/667.jpg\" alt=\"Christmas Dream tulip\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tulip variety Christmas Dream, 20 March</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"537bf8b4084de7768142803239150595cf4cf747\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/537bf8b4084de7768142803239150595cf4cf747/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"The tulip variety Christmas Dream, 20 March\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tulip variety Christmas Dream, 20 March</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"3385546d80184804c401ea9c07b9980f5d777be5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3385546d80184804c401ea9c07b9980f5d777be5/0_0_3860_5790/667.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 10 April\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close-up of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 10 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"e63f7479cb871c7682645d2a62df0e6eca7fab09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e63f7479cb871c7682645d2a62df0e6eca7fab09/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 10 April\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close-up of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 10 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Christmas Dreams.</p></li> </ul> <p>It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving \u2013 and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.</p> <p>To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my \u201choliday camera\u201d, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and \u2013 most crucially \u2013 able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"c79c7f200df03d74d163d70c0211df4c7592f1ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c79c7f200df03d74d163d70c0211df4c7592f1ab/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of a Red Revival tulip, 4 April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close-up of a Red Revival tulip, 4 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Red Revival.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c813c3e05167be5805e9046f340badda19c49529\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c813c3e05167be5805e9046f340badda19c49529/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A close-up of the tulip variety White Prince, 4 April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close-up of White Prince, 4 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>White Prince, print available <a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/home-not-away-the-tulip-project\">here</a>. </p></li> </ul> <p>As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.</p> <p>Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"8b1079be631eb6b2906b9006056bee4f811da7ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b1079be631eb6b2906b9006056bee4f811da7ae/16_16_3805_5965/638.jpg\" alt=\"Mystik Van Eijk, 23 March\" width=\"638\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mystik Van Eijk, 23 March</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"1d7ea96ef78d21f5fc2ad7b6b6b18457e2bf6a06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d7ea96ef78d21f5fc2ad7b6b6b18457e2bf6a06/185_3_3737_5857/638.jpg\" alt=\"A Christmas Dream, 14 April\" width=\"638\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Christmas Dream, 14 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"11a528fe59c2328db8cc42ecf0a280eb7c4f1ce1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11a528fe59c2328db8cc42ecf0a280eb7c4f1ce1/0_0_3869_5804/667.jpg\" alt=\"Mystik Van Eijk, 9 April\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mystik Van Eijk, 9 April</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"64d37c1df80fd4630a3f2662a3f06a077e5a955b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64d37c1df80fd4630a3f2662a3f06a077e5a955b/40_5_2686_4025/667.jpg\" alt=\"A view after rain of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 19 March\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view after rain of the tulip variety Christmas Dream, 19 March</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London.

  "<p>Suspected Hutu militiamen have killed 16 people, including 12 rangers, in the Virunga national park, a Democratic Republic of the Congo government official has said, in the deadliest attack in the park\u2019s recent history.</p> <p>The park in eastern DRC, home to <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/mountain-gorilla\">critically endangered mountain gorillas</a> as well as hundreds of other rare species, has faced repeated incursions and attacks by local armed groups.</p> <p>About 60 fighters from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a Hutu rebel group, ambushed a convoy of civilians that was being protected by 15 rangers, said Cosma Wilungula, the director of the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation. Many others were seriously injured, he said.</p> <p>There was no immediate confirmation from the Virunga park of the incident or casualties.</p> <p>The park has been repeatedly hit by violence. It was shut to tourists for eight months in 2018 after a series of attacks on staff but reopened after a thorough review of security precautions and reinforcement of the 700 rangers deployed to keep animals and visitors safe.</p> <p>The park, in North Kivu province, has a reputation as one of the most dangerous conservation projects in the world. It faces multiple security threats including illegal charcoal production, smuggling and poaching, as well as from the Mai Mai militia.</p> <p>Founded in 1925 by Belgian colonial authorities, the park struggled in the immediate aftermath of the country\u2019s independence in 1960 but flourished under President Mobutu Sese Seko, who took power in 1965.</p> <p>The park suffered further during the civil war that followed Mobutu\u2019s chaotic fall in 1997. Virunga\u2019s mountain gorilla population declined to 300. It has since risen to more than 1,000, and the numbers of other animals such as forest elephants are also rising.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/22/gorillas-charcoal-fight-survival-congo-rainforest\">Gorillas, charcoal and the fight for survival in Congo's rainforest | Peter Beaumont</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2007 a partnership was established between charities funded by private donors, the EU and the Congolese wildlife service.

  "<p>The Dutch government has announced measures including huge cuts to coal use, garden greening and limits on livestock herds as part of its plan to lower emissions to comply with a supreme court ruling.</p> <p>Climate litigation activists described the move as \u201can enormous win\u201d. The small non-profit Urgenda Foundation, which filed the initial legal challenge in 2013, said this and earlier compliance measures totalled about \u20ac3bn euros, which confirms the impact of the world\u2019s most successful climate lawsuit to date.</p> <p>Under the new package, coal-fired power stations will have to scale back or close completely , cattle and pig herds will be reduced, subsidies will be provided to home owners to use less concrete and more plants in their gardens, and industry will have to find alternatives for several polluting processes.</p> <p>\u201cThat is an enormous win,\u201d said Marjan Minnesma, the director of Urgenda, which has 15-staff and operates out of two former school classrooms. \u201cFor many people this will give hope that it is possible to use the law as a strategic instrument for change.\u201d</p> <p>After a seven-year legal battle, the supreme court in the Hague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/dutch-supreme-court-upholds-landmark-ruling-demanding-climate-action\">ordered the government</a> in December to reduce emissions by 15 megatonnes in 2020. The judges accepted Urgenda\u2019s argument that climate change posed a dangerous threat to human rights and the Netherlands needed to accelerate its actions to meet its international commitment of a 25% cut compared with 1990.</p> <p>To comply, the government has adopted 30 of the proposals in Urgenda\u2019s \u201c54 Climate Solutions Plan\u201d, which was drawn up in collaboration with 800 civil society groups and other organisations.</p> <p>The headline change is a 75% reduction in capacity at the country\u2019s three coal-fired power stations, all of which have been opened in the past five years. The government is also reportedly in negotiations to close one of these plants.</p> <p>In addition, it will provide about \u20ac400m for household energy saving measures such as double glazing, \u20ac360m to compensate farmers for livestock reductions, and \u20ac30m for LED lighting in greenhouses.</p> <p>Along with earlier steps \u2013 including lower speed limits to control emissions of nitrogen dioxide, \u20ac2bn for rooftop solar and other forms of renewable energy, solar panels on all school rooftops, more sustainable forestry and changes in the use of concrete, the measures are expected to save 8 megatonnes of emissions this year and provide extra benefits in terms of air quality and wildlife habitat.</p> <p>Minnesma said this should be seen as a \u201cpromising start\u201d because the government is still about 4 megatonnes short of its obligations. She said the coronavirus lockdown should not be used as an excuse to backpedal.</p> <p>The package was presented to parliament on Friday afternoon. The government said the measures would provide an economic stimulus and also help to reduce<strong> </strong>nitrogen pollution, which has been the subject of other legal actions.</p> <p>MPs said the package should inspire activists across the world to pursue litigation against governments that drag their feet.</p> <p>\u201cWithout a doubt this should encourage climate lawsuits in other countries. It\u2019s a shining example,\u201d said Green party politician Tom van der Lee. \u201cThis package wouldn\u2019t be there without an order from the highest court. Without that verdict, the government would have chosen a slower trajectory.\u201d</p> <p>The environmental law charity ClientEarth said the result was unprecedented in Europe and testament to the impact of climate litigation, which is spreading around the world. \u201cThe Urgenda case should be considered a groundbreaking success, not just legally, but for driving real world action on climate change,\u201d Sophie Marjanac, a ClientEarth lawyer.</p> <p>The Dutch legal system\u2019s ease of access and political independence of judges helped to make the case possible. If Urgenda had lost, they would only have had to pay \u20ac18,000 rather than the government\u2019s extensive costs.</p> <p>The Urgenda case has been closely watched around the world. While climate activists have welcomed the outcome, they urge the Netherlands to raise ambition beyond 2020 compliance with the orders of the supreme court. \u201cThe Netherlands now needs to lay out a strategy to reach net zero by around the middle of this century,\u201d said Bob Ward, policy and communications director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.</p>",

Broadly speaking, southern European economies are calling for grants, while the northern members are keen on loans. The lingering division is hanging over sentiment.</p> <p>Hopes for a potential Covid-19 treatment were running high this day last week, as Remdesivir, an antiviral drug produced by Gilead Sciences, was reported to have helped patients with fever and respiratory problems.

  "<h2><strong>FOUR MEN WALK INTO AN ONLINE CHAT</strong></h2> \n<p>A mere 42 days after the successful conclusion of The Fiver\u2019s STOP FOOTBALL campaign and football remains resolutely stopped. They said it couldn\u2019t be done, but now each Thursday night, The Fiver basks in the warm, heartfelt applause of strangers who emerge from their front doors to applaud and bang saucepans in thanks for being spared the tedium of having to watch Burnley getting gubbed by Liverpool at Anfield this weekend.</p> \n<p>With no football to discuss and hours of airtime to fill, Sky Sports have got their best people on the case, busily discussing no football at great length with the urbane Dave Jones \u2013 one-time Company Magazine north-east bachelor of the year (subject to a still-to-be-processed objection from a certain Big Paper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/apr/23/inverting-jonathan-wilson-newcastle-takeover-football-weekly-extra-podcast\">pyramid-inverter</a>) \u2013 asking the hard questions. Warming up by telling Roy Keane, Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville it could be 182 days before the nation\u2019s hairdressers and barbers next throw open their doors, his query regarding the Irishman\u2019s beard was greeted with stony silence, dying like a Trump supporter who\u2019s just mainlined a litre bottle of Harpic on the advice of their president.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/officials-to-investigate-potential-covid-19-link-with-liverpool-match\">Officials to investigate potential Covid-19 link with Liverpool match</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But while the subject of haircuts was strictly off limits, Keano had plenty to say about footballers and salary chops. \u201cThis idea that players should take a pay cut, I think that is nonsense,\u201d he roared. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the individual. I know there is pressure on players, but it is nobody\u2019s business what you do with your wages. You take your wages and if you want to be generous, go ahead and do it. I don\u2019t think players should feel pressured by clubs, particularly the bigger clubs, to take pay cuts.\u201d</p> \n<p>Next up to the plate was Carragher, who said that in the continued absence of football, Premier League placings should be decided on some sort of unspecified sporting merit, which The Fiver suspects might entail handing the title to the team who is 25 points clear at the summit. \u201cI actually think what Uefa came out with about [Big Cup] places and European qualification being decided on sporting merit, I\u2019d actually love the Premier League to come out and say that,\u201d he cheered, from his well-appointed isolation hub. \u201cI do feel there are a few teams, certainly down the bottom, who are not shy in coming out at times and saying why the season shouldn\u2019t continue and it should be null and void and should be curtailed.\u201d</p> \n<p>And while The Fiver can\u2019t help but feel there might be one particular team, certainly up the top, who have every reason to hope the season will continue, we haven\u2019t time to go into that now because we\u2019re running out of space and still need to cover Neville\u2019s contribution. \u201cI\u2019ve gone from anger to despair to almost now pleading with somebody at the Premier League just to do the right thing for the game,\u201d he sighed, having urged top-flight bosses to take out a massive loan to help financially imperilled clubs in the Football League. While The Fiver applauds his optimism, we can\u2019t help but feel he\u2019d get a more positive response if he asked Keane for permission to lovingly massage a bottle of oil into his whiskers.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cIt was like stepping into a danger zone.

A couple of years later I was at The Den for Millwall v Barnsley, for whom Hunter was playing in the twilight of his career. Millwall had some young shaver in direct opposition to Norman, and he kept hurling himself at the old warhorse as if to prove his worth against one of the greats. Inevitably, there came a point when Norman decided enough was enough and dealt with this matter decisively. In one smooth, seamless movement he chopped down the over-eager tyro, beckoned on the Millwall trainer and gave his name to the ref. The ref was absolutely delighted to be able to get Norman\u2019s name in his book and, in fact, seemed to be giggling nervously at this sudden familiarity between them. Neither looked at the victim, still groaning on the ground. Instead, Norman seemed to be beaming at the Millwall subs on the bench, as if to say, \u201cThere you are, <em>that\u2019s</em> how it\u2019s done\u201d \u2013 Paul Sanderson.</p> \n<p>\u201cShall we try and come up with good names for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/21/barcelona-to-sell-camp-nou-naming-rights-and-give-proceeds-to-charity\">the sponsorship of Barcelona\u2019s ground</a>?

  "<p>Ministers were warned last year the UK must have a robust plan to deal with a pandemic virus and its potentially catastrophic social and economic consequences in a confidential Cabinet Office briefing leaked to the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The detailed document warned that even a mild pandemic could cost tens of thousands of lives, and set out the must-have \u201ccapability requirements\u201d to mitigate the risks to the country, as well as the potential damage of not doing so.</p> \n<p>It comes as the UK\u2019s hospital death toll from coronavirus heads towards 20,000. Less than a month ago, the medical director at NHS England, Prof Stephen Powis, said the country would \u201chave done very well\u201d to stay below this grim milestone.</p> \n<p>Marked \u201cofficial, sensitive\u201d, the 2019 National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA) was signed off by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, as well as a senior national security adviser to the prime minister whom the Guardian has been asked not to name.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"NSRA doc\"> \n <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Uknsra Selected Pages Redacted\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/457900683/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-99TDyoyNM3ontPRHXRxL\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7068965517241379\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The recommendations within it included the need to stockpile PPE (personal protective equipment), organise advanced purchase agreements for other essential kit, establish procedures for disease surveillance and contact tracing, and draw up plans to manage a surge in excess deaths.</p> \n<p>Having plans for helping British nationals abroad and repatriating them to the UK was also flagged as a priority.</p> \n<p>All of these areas have come under relentless scrutiny since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with the government accused of being too slow to react to the crisis. It is now under sustained pressure to provide answers about what was done nationally and locally to provide the support that planners have long called for, amid growing fears ministers were \u201ccaught out\u201d by the crisis and have been playing catchup ever since.</p> \n<p>The Cabinet Office document, which runs to more than 600 pages, not only analysed the risk of a viral flu pandemic but also specifically addressed the potential for a coronavirus outbreak (the earlier Sars and Mers were both coronaviruses), though it regarded this as potentially much less damaging. In reality, the UK is dealing with a hybrid of the two, raising further questions about whether ministers were quick enough to recognise the dangers and were able to rely on whatever preparations were already in place.</p> \n<p>Drawing on previous security assessments and health risk registers, the document implicitly warned ministers they could not afford to be complacent. \u201cA novel pandemic virus could be both highly transmissible and highly virulent,\u201d it said. \u201cTherefore, pandemics significantly more serious than the reasonable worst case \u2026 are possible.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government declined to provide specific details of the preparations that had been made prior to the pandemic, but said it would be unfair to say they were \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d, pointing to planning exercises carried out in recent years.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice,\u201d a government spokesman said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government has been proactive in implementing lessons learned around pandemic preparedness.

  "<p>Careful analysis of the National Security Risk Assessment document illustrates how the Covid-19 pandemic represents a hybrid of two of the major threats to the UK anticipated by the British government.</p> <p>The first, an influenza-type disease pandemic, predicts waves of a novel flu virus striking several months apart. This type of threat represents the basis of the UK government\u2019s blueprint for how it would respond to a pandemic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"NSRA document\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Uknsra Selected Pages Redacted\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/457900683/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-99TDyoyNM3ontPRHXRxL\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7068965517241379\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Britain\u2019s preparations for a flu pandemic include stockpiles of millions of doses of antivirals, including the drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, as well as a digital distribution system called the National Flu Pandemic Service that would be deployed to coordinate the distribution of antivirals to people who were symptomatic.</p> <p><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf\">Plans published in 2011</a> detail stocks of pre-specific vaccine that could be administered to healthcare workers in parallel alongside antivirals, so as to maintain the UK\u2019s health workforce.</p> <p>However, these preparations are contingent on the pandemic being a variation of influenza. Covid-19 is a coronavirus, not a strain of influenza, making some of those preparations less useful.</p> <p>The document also contains a separate chapter anticipating non-flu-based \u201cemerging infectious diseases\u201d, even specifically citing the risk of a novel coronavirus arriving in the UK.</p> <p>The risk model assumes that such a disease would be comparable to Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome), outbreaks of which afflicted south-east Asia and the Middle East in recent years. Those viruses have case fatality rates of between 33% and 50%, making them far more lethal than Covid-19.</p> <p>In some respects, the UK\u2019s response necessarily has to begin from scratch because of the novel nature of the disease: treatments, vaccines and even the mode of transmission all have to be identified.</p> <p>But the building blocks of responding to a pandemic are roughly the same, a source said: \u201cWe are not moving from a standing start. We should be building out from what we know \u2013 PPE [personal protective equipment], community disruption, supply line difficulties and public anxiety.</p> <p>\u201cPandemic flu gives us the modelling to start from. It\u2019s about building on what you have. What we had at the beginning had been depleted over the years and no one challenged the changes because [the feeling was] something like this would never happen.\u201d</p> <p>Containing any novel disease outbreak in the UK would require intensive measures to detect and limit its spread, the document states. \u201cSustained human-to-human transmission in emerging airborne diseases is possible,\u201d it reads, \u201cwhich is why infection control procedures are critical to the mitigation of this risk.\u201d</p> <p>The impacts of an emerging infectious disease anticipated by the risk assessment are vastly less severe than the havoc Covid-19 has wrought. A reasonable worst case scenario included 200 fatalities and an economic cost of \u00a37.5bn, chiefly as a result of a drop in tourism.</p> <p>This is, again, largely because the prediction is modelled upon Sars and Mers, which never achieved the same level of community transmission as Covid-19 has.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic\u2019s damage has instead been much more comparable to what the document anticipates for a flu pandemic: potentially hundreds of thousands of fatalities, as well as a total economic cost of over \u00a32tn as a result of widespread and lasting disruption.</p> <p>Alarmingly, the document notes that, although unpredictable, \u201cthe emergence of new infectious diseases \u2026 appears to have become more frequent\u201d, possibly as a result of worsening global heating. \u201cClimate change may result in conditions that may make the UK more hospitable for establishment of insect vectors of diseases currently not endemic in the country,\u201d it warns.</p>",
  "<p>The 2019 National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA) is a comprehensive planning document that sets out the risks facing the UK \u2013 and what is needed to prepare for them.</p> <p>It was signed off by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. Over 600 pages, it runs through dozens of potential threats \u2013 but an \u201cinfluenza-type pandemic\u201d is at the top of this worry list, as it has been for years. Here are some selected extracts\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"NSRA document\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Uknsra Selected Pages Redacted\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/457900683/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-99TDyoyNM3ontPRHXRxL\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7068965517241379\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2>Overview</h2> <p>Up to 50% of the UK population may fall ill, with up to 20% of people off work during the peak weeks, causing a significant impact on business continuity. Critical national infrastructure may also be affected during peak periods. There would be a huge surge in demand for health and social care services.</p> <p>Besides very severe levels of stress on the NHS, the level of excess deaths would stretch capacity within organisations involved in the management of deaths. This would be felt on a national scale, with local capacity likely to start to be overwhelmed during the peak of the pandemic. While not explicitly stated in every case, an influenza- type pandemic would probably compound the effects of the vast majority of risks in the NSRA, as all sectors would experience staffing pressures.</p> <h2>Response capability requirements</h2> <p>Procedures related to disease surveillance and early detection, plus any associated infrastructure, should be in place. Robust and tested arrangements for rapid scientific and clinical advice should similarly be set up.</p> <p>Local and national plans for management of excess deaths resulting from any mass casualty event should be present.</p> <p>Local and national plans to deal with a surge in demand for health and social care services need to be accounted for.</p> <p>There needs to be stockpiles of countermeasures and advanced purchase arrangements for those that cannot be acquired in advance.</p> <p>Communication plans to encourage social distancing and good hygiene should be active. Sector resilience plans, including planning for absence of key workers, need enforcing.</p> <h2>Multiple waves</h2> <p>It is predicted that an influenza pandemic would come in multiple waves.</p> <p>This means that recovery from one wave could be hampered by the arrival of a subsequent wave. Even after the end of a pandemic, it is likely that it would take months, or even years, for health and social care services to recover, although an exact timescale cannot be predicted. It is likely the economic impact would be felt for years.</p> <p>The reasonable worst case scenario (RWCS) assumes that the pandemic will come in multiple waves (up to three), each approximately 15 weeks long.</p> <p>For example, in the RWCS, 9,840,000 people would require assessment by health services (30% of those who are symptomatic), of which 1,312,000 people would require hospital treatment and 328,000 the highest level of critical care. Using the estimated UK population for 2016, this RWCS could result in 820,000 fatalities.</p> <p>Besides very severe levels of stress on the NHS, the level of excess deaths would stretch capacity within organisations involved in the management of deaths, including coroners and burial services. This would be felt on a national scale, with local capacity likely to be overwhelmed during the peak of the pandemic.</p> <p>\u2022 The pandemic would present in one or more waves. Each wave is expected to lasting 15 weeks, with the peak weeks occurring at weeks six and seven in each wave.</p> <p>\u2022 Ffity per cent of the population would be infected and experience symptoms of pandemic influenza during the one or more waves. The actual number of people infected would be higher than this, as there would be a number of asymptomatic cases.</p> <p>\u2022 A case fatality ratio of 2.5%, meaning 2.5% of those with symptoms could die as a result of the influenza virus. Four per cent of symptomatic patients would require hospital care, 25% of whom are expected to need the highest level of critical care (level three).</p> <p>\u2022 Peak illness rates of about 10-12% (measured in new clinical cases per week as a proportion of the population) are expected in each of the weeks in the peak fortnight (weeks six and seven).</p> <p>\u2022 Workplace absence rates for illness will be reaching 17-20% in the peak weeks.</p> <h2>On vaccines</h2> <p>There are no known markers that herald the start of a new pandemic. Based on most current vaccine technologies, it is likely to take at least four to six months after a novel virus has been identified and isolated for an effective pandemic influenza vaccine to become available from manufacturers in large quantity.</p> <p>This means that the first pandemic wave will not be vaccine-preventable; it will not be possible to contain a novel pandemic virus in its country of origin or on arrival in the UK.</p> <p>The expectation must be that the virus will spread rapidly to the UK (a major global transport hub) and that any local measures taken to disrupt or reduce the spread are likely to have very limited or partial success at national level and cannot be relied on as a way to \u201cbuy time\u201d.</p> <p>The UK has an advanced purchase agreement for pandemic vaccine, which can be triggered in response to a pandemic threat. Even after the end of the pandemic it is likely that it would take months, or even years, for the health and social care services to recover, although an exact timescale cannot be predicted<strong>.</strong></p> <h2>On deaths \u2013 moderate viral pandemic</h2> <p>This variation models a moderate pandemic, based on the 1957 and 1968 pandemics.</p> <p>The annual likelihood of a pandemic with the characteristics described below is 2%.</p> <p>The specific assumptions of this scenario are listed below.</p> <ul> <li><p>About 32% (21,320,000) of the population would be infected and experience symptoms of pandemic influenza.</p></li> <li><p>A case fatality ratio of 0.2%, resulting in 65,600 deaths.</p></li> <li><p>Of symptomatic patients, 0.55% (117,260) would require hospital care, 25% (29,315) of whom would be expected to require the highest level of critical care (level three).</p></li> <li><p>Peak illness rates of about 6.5-8% (measured in new clinical cases per week as a proportion of the population) would be expected in each of the weeks in the peak fortnight (weeks six and seven). This scenario would still have a significant impact on health and social care systems as well as death management systems.</p></li> </ul> <p>There would also be higher than usual absence from work.</p> <h2>On lockdown</h2> <p>Public health measures such as school closures and social distancing may be partially successful in delaying the peak of a pandemic wave by a few weeks at most, and might reduce the overall size of a pandemic wave.</p> <p>However these measures are disruptive, with known secondary consequences (eg closing schools would reduce the availability of healthcare workers), and the limited evidence available suggests that such measures have maximum effect when implemented early and simultaneously.</p> <p>For the RWCS, it is assumed that schools have not been closed. Global travel, particularly commercial airlines, will have an impact on the spread of the disease. Although the strain was mild, the pandemic in 2009 showed that a rapid global spread was possible. However, evidence suggests that border control measures would be largely ineffective, because the duration of most international passenger flights is considerably shorter than the incubation period of the illness.</p> <h2>On behavioural impact/public outrage</h2> <p>The public outrage would likely be determined by the preparations and response undertaken by the government. Poor government handling of the situation would exacerbate the level of outrage significantly. There would be significant and widespread public outrage directed at the authorities given the very high numbers of fatalities and casualties within vulnerable groups. There would also be significant anger if vaccines, antivirals or other countermeasures were not perceived to be effective, evenly distributed or available as soon as practically possible, including when compared with other countries. The performance of the health and care system is likely to contribute to the public outrage, especially if provision of the remaining services is seen as unevenly distributed. There is also a risk public outrage may be directed at both foreign nations and nationals (who are seen as the \u201csource\u201d of the problem) for not preventing its spread or importing disease into the UK.</p> <h2>Economic impact</h2> <p>Total cost: \u00a32,354,738,558,884</p> <p>Economic impacts \u2013 confidence assessment.</p> <p>To put that figure in context, \u00a32.35tn is the equivalent of 131% of GDP.</p> <p>It is worth noting that a large proportion (\u00a31.5tn) of the economic impact comes from the social value of deaths.</p> <h2>Emerging infectious diseases</h2> <h2>Response capability requirements</h2> <p>The capability requirements include disease surveillance systems, staff trained in enhanced infection control practices, adequate access to personalised protective equipment, adequate access to public health staff for contact tracing and follow-up, and excess death management capabilities (including potential infectious material). Decontamination services need to be available.</p> <p>Appropriate specialist healthcare services eg, high level-isolation units must be accessible, as well as appropriate facilities for quarantine.</p>",

  "<p>A dramatic increase in technological surveillance is a \u201cprice worth paying\u201d to fight Covid-19, argues <a href=\"https://institute.global/policy/price-worth-paying-tech-privacy-and-fight-against-covid-19\">a report</a> from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.</p> <p>Governments and private companies can use location data to track the success of lockdown measures, monitor bluetooth signals to help contact tracing efforts, or keep an eye on search queries to help identify new clusters of infection or previously unknown symptoms.</p> <p>Privacy activists have warned, however, that such extensions of surveillance could be a dangerous precedent that would be hard to roll back once the crisis is over.</p> <p>The TBI argues in the report published on Friday that those fears are valid, but understate the degree of trade-off that many countries face. </p> <p>\u201cCarefully applied, technology gives policymakers a possible way through the crisis that reduces otherwise very high costs in terms of lives lost and livelihoods destroyed,\u201d said Chris Yiu, the institute\u2019s executive director of technology and public policy. \u201cBut this escape route comes with a price: dramatically increased technological surveillance. Under the right conditions, this is a price worth paying.</p> <p>\u201cIn normal times the degree of monitoring and state intervention we are talking about here would be out of the question in liberal democracies,\u201d Yiu continued. \u201cBut these are not normal times, and the alternatives are even more unpalatable. This is quite different from the traditional debate about whether confronting security threats to our way of life merits sacrificing the values of freedom and privacy that define us. </p> <p>\u201cCovid-19 is not an ideology, and rebalancing the contract between citizens and the state to take advantage of the capabilities of new technologies is not capitulation.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, governments should consider a number of interventions that might normally cross the line, Yiu said. For instance, states could require technology platforms to share, in aggregate form, search and social media trends, and telemetry from wearables and other connected devices, to help them respond to the crisis. And they could share patient data internationally, to accelerate the search for treatments and vaccines, rather than putting up walls around national health services as they would in normal times.</p> <p>But the brakes should not be removed entirely. The TBI argues strongly against \u201ccoercive\u201d linking of apps and services: for instance, requiring people to use a contact tracing programme in order to receive digital credentials proving they are key workers. \u201cIf it is necessary to deem participation in a scheme mandatory,\u201d the report argues, \u201cthis should be legislated for.\u201d</p> <p>Others disagree, however.

Thus, solutions which allow reconstructing invasive information about the population should be rejected without further discussion. Such information can include the \u2018social graph\u2019 of who someone has physically met over a period of time.\u201d</p> <p>The TBI\u2019s intervention comes amid an uneasy alliance of technology companies and nation states.

Rogier van der Weyden was one of the first artists to master the realistic portrayal of people and space, and, in this panel from an altarpiece he and his team created in Brussels almost 600 years ago, his consummate abilities are on display. Look at the way the Gothic architecture of a cathedral curves around the scene in eye-fooling depth and the lifelike faces of the priests. But he uses these new techniques to depict a macabre miracle. As they uncover the body of a bishop who has been dead for a century, the assembled clergy are astonished to see his flesh perfectly preserved.

  "<p>A recording spread around the world at the end of March, purportedly featuring a former Vodafone executive claiming to let the public in on a secret that the coronavirus pandemic is cover for a global plot to install 5G mobile phone masts, track the world\u2019s population through vaccines, and then destroy human society as we know it.</p> \n<p>In reality, the Guardian can reveal, the voice on the tape making the baseless claims is an evangelical pastor from Luton who recently tried to convince Zimbabweans to use cryptocurrency in their economy.</p> \n<p>Jonathon James, who regularly preached at churches in Bedfordshire, is the previously unidentified individual who reached millions of people with his detailed but nonsense claims that Covid-19 is a fake disease covering for the impact of 5G.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with biological warfare but is our bodies reacting to radiofrequency radiation,\u201d he told listeners to the 38-minute recording, claiming the real cause of global deaths was new mobile technology causing cell poisoning. \u201cThey are using coronavirus to try to hide the fact that people are dying from the 5G frequency.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although James was not the first individual to attempt to connect the pandemic and 5G, the popularity of his recording grew at the end of last month, just as people believing the conspiracy theory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/how-false-claims-about-5g-health-risks-spread-into-the-mainstream\">began to burn down phone equipment</a> and harass telecoms engineers.</p> \n<p>In the recording he suggests that Bill Gates is involved in a plot to produce coronavirus vaccinations that will contain computer chips to track individuals, a move he claims will ultimately herald the destruction of society.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe coronavirus is not what\u2019s killing people, it is clearly, categorically, unequivocally proven that the radio frequencies we are being exposed to are killing the people,\u201d he told his audience without any evidence. \u201cGod has blessed me with the ability to bring disparate pieces of information together that puts the puzzle together and makes sense of it.\u201d</p> \n<p> Although many copies of the recording have been deleted by YouTube for breaching its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/youtube-to-suppress-content-spreading-coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-theory\">policy on dangerous disinformation</a>, new uploads continue to be available. Delivered in the form of a sermon, it has also racked up millions of views across other networks and continues to circulate on WhatsApp. But until now the originator\u2019s identity has been unknown.</p> \n<p>Much of the audio clip\u2019s claims to credibility rely on James\u2019s assertion that he is the former head of the largest business unit at Vodafone, supposedly giving him the inside track on new technologies at one of the world\u2019s biggest telecoms companies.</p> \n<p>Vodafone insiders told the Guardian that while James had worked for the company, he was hired for a sales position in 2014 at a time when 5G was not a priority for the company and was unlikely to be in his remit. They said he ultimately left Vodafone after less than a year.</p> \n<p>Despite this, many of the leading online anti-5G groups repeatedly refer to the supposed censoring of a \u201cformer Vodafone boss\u201d as a key source backing up their beliefs, with the recording spreading out of the UK and reaching large audiences in the US and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@amy.duru/the-relativity-of-truth-covid-19-vs-conspiracy-theorists-8df2cca80a9f\">Nigeria</a>.</p> \n<p>International radiation watchdogs have cleared 5G as safe, while NHS bosses have called on people to stop spreading rumours linking the pandemic to 5G and threatening vital infrastructure.</p> \n<p>James\u2019s identity was ultimately pieced together by researchers at the <a href=\"https://www.logically.co.uk/\">fact-checking </a><a href=\"https://www.logically.co.uk/\">start</a><a href=\"https://www.logically.co.uk/\">up Logically</a>, working in conjunction with the Guardian.

I was simply trying to summarise what the \u2018perceived truth\u2019 was behind this bizarre pandemic in the interest of serving my community.\u201d</p> \n<p>James, who regularly preaches at the Light City Christian Ministries in Luton, has apparently had a varied career since his time at Vodafone. He claims to have at one point advised central bankers in \u201cthe Congo\u201d and Bangladesh on cryptocurrencies and he has posed with the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa. In 2018 <a href=\"https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201711281059489192-zimbabwe-unlikely-deliver-economic/\">he was</a> working as an economic adviser for a Zimbabwean opposition party, urging it to save the economy using Bitcoin-type products pegged to diamond deposits through blockchain technology.</p> \n<p>Asked if he had any final comment, James said he was unable to reply as he \u201chad some rather pressing head of state engagement necessitating my full attention and time [for the] last 48 hours\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>The Church of England\u2019s investment arm has urged shareholders in ExxonMobil to vote against re-electing the oil company\u2019s entire board for failing to take action on the climate crisis.</p> <p>The Church Commissioners and New York State Common Retirement Fund have written to fellow ExxonMobil investors ahead of an annual shareholder meeting on 27 May, hoping to support for the protest votes, which include forcing ExxonMobil to disclose its lobbying activities and their cost .</p> <p>\u201cOur voting intentions are, again, a measure of our profound dissatisfaction with ExxonMobil\u2019s approach to climate change risks and the governance failures that underpin it,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000121465920003635/r422201px14a6g.htm\">the letter said</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAs the world, ExxonMobil\u2019s peers and investors confront the climate emergency, ExxonMobil is carrying on as if nothing has changed. It is crystal clear to us that ExxonMobil\u2019s inadequate response to climate change constitutes a broad failure of corporate governance and a specific failure of independent directors to oversee management,\u201d the letter added.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/oil-majors-must-cut-production-by-a-third-to-meet-climate-target-study\">report released last year</a> found that ExxonMobil would need to slash its oil production by 55% by 2040 to meet global climate targets and avoid driving temperatures 1.5C higher than pre-industrialised levels.</p> <p>The C of E holds a small stake in Exxon, worth about \u00a37m compared with the oil company\u2019s market value of more than $183bn (\u00a3146bn). However, the Church Commissioners have proven to be influential shareholders regardless of their size.</p> <p>Last year, ExxonMobil appealed to US regulators and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/16/us-regulators-deny-church-investors-right-to-hold-firms-to-account\">successfully blocked a C of E-led resolution</a> that would have forced the oil firm to disclose its emissions reduction targets. In protest, the C of E called for ExxonMobil to install an independent chairman, and it gained 40% backing.</p> <p>The Church Commissioners have again filed a resolution calling for the chief executive and chairman roles \u2013 held by Darren Woods \u2013 to be separated.</p> <p>But Exxon is again at odds with the Church Commissioners voting plans. The oil giant is recommending that investors vote in favour of re-electing all of its board members, but is recommending they reject the shareholder resolutions, including the lobbying report.</p> <p>A Guardian investigation last year found that Exxon had spent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/24/fossil-fuel-big-five-spent-251m-lobbying-european-union-2010-climate-crisis\">\u20ac37.2m (\u00a332.4m) lobbying the EU since 2010</a>, according to data released though the EU\u2019s transparency register. That is more than other major oil companies including shell and BP, which spent \u20ac36.5m and \u20ac18.1m respectively on lobbying Brussels officials to shape EU climate policy.</p> <p>It also recently emerged that ExxonMobil met key European commission officials in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/exxonmobil-tried-to-get-european-green-deal-watered-down-claims-climate-lobbying-watchdog\">attempt to water down the European Green Deal</a> in the weeks before it was agreed, according to a climate lobbying watchdog.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>ExxonMobil was not immediately available for comment, but in a document released ahead of its AGM it said that its position on key issues and lobbying were publicly available on its website and that it followed all applicable disclosure laws.</p> <p>The company also defended the board\u2019s approach to the climate crisis, saying it \u201croutinely reviews environmental stewardship and discusses issues related to the company\u2019s business, including the risks related to climate change\u201d.</p> <p>ExxonMobil has rejected calls for an independent chairman, saying that the rest of the board was already made up of independent directors and that the change would not improve oversight or be in shareholders\u2019 best interest.</p>",

The satellite-tagged bird became the first of <a href=\"https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/cuckoo-tracking-project\">a small flock of tracked cuckoos</a> to return to his breeding grounds in record time, dashing from the Ivory Coast to southern England in seven days.</p> <p>The British Trust for Ornithology\u2019s satellite tag revealed that upon nearing home, Carlton II stopped at Dulwich &amp; Sydenham Hill golf club in south London before a brief visit to Farnham Park golf club in Berkshire.

Taking just a week to cover more than 3,000 miles from Liberia to Berkshire is an awesome feat and something even swifts don\u2019t manage.</p> <p>\u201cThis shows us just how quickly these harbingers of spring can get here from tropical Africa when conditions for their journey are good. It\u2019s a journey so full of hazards that it\u2019s always a relief when they get back, no matter how fast or slow.</p> <p>\u201cThese cuckoos have taught us so much about their lives, giving answers but also raising more questions as to what might be behind their decline.\u201d</p> <p>Pressures along their route, including habitat loss but also drought caused by climate change, are making the cuckoo\u2019s epic journeying more hazardous.</p> <p>Carlton II has clocked up 22,000 miles since he was fitted with an ultra-light tag at Carlton Marshes in 2018 but still has a way to go to emulate the travels of Chris Packham, a cuckoo named after the naturalist and broadcaster.</p> <p>Chris the cuckoo returned to Britain for four successive summers, flying more than 50,000 miles and traversing 28 different countries on his migration from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-27171529\">On one occasion, the bird diverted hundreds of miles off his usual course to Angola</a>.

The oil industry is investing in a huge surge of plastic production, which is expected to grow by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/02/year-plastic-pollution-clean-beaches-seas\">40% by 2030</a>. Studies have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/15/single-use-plastics-a-serious-climate-change-hazard-study-warns\">also shown</a> the proliferation of single-use plastic is accelerating climate change through greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of its lifecycle.</p> <p>If current trends continue, by 2050 there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish by weight, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.</p> <p>Northern Point, Girlfriend Collective and Rothy\u2019s are all budding companies producing clothing entirely from ocean plastics. Larger brands such as Nike, Adidas and Fjallraven have also launched garments from recycled ocean plastic.</p> <p>The plastics industry has long pushed recycling as the solution to pollution. In reality, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/plastics-material-specific-data\">less than 10%</a> of the plastic produced in the US each year is recycled. This is in part because it is hard to make recycling initiatives profitable, as Bureo learned firsthand when they tried to produce sustainable skateboards in 2013.</p> <p>\u201cOcean plastic is not one type of plastic that can be used for high-value products, it is mixed and degraded and needs to be separated,\u201d says David Stover, who founded Bureo alongside Ben Kneppers and Kevin Ahearn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9c34ad1a558e1eea744fdfde07223bb3c82eaedc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c34ad1a558e1eea744fdfde07223bb3c82eaedc/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"If current trends continue, by 2050 there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish by weight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If current trends continue, by 2050 there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish by weight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Kasnoff</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Durable products need to be made from quality substances. Wading through masses of ocean trash and sourcing key material is time-consuming and financially draining.</p> <p>The company met with scientists and coastal communities in Chile to vet different materials. They found that rather than smaller plastics such as bottles and six-pack rings, coastal communities were particularly burdened by fishing nets piling up on beaches.</p> <p>Nets account for 10% of the ocean\u2019s plastics, according to <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/tempref/docrep/fao/011/i0620e/i0620e.pdf\">a United Nations report</a>. Heavy and cumbersome, they choke land mammals and pollute sea beds and beaches. And fishermen in Chile were desperate to get rid of them.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a burden and they had no solution for it,\u201d says Kneppers.</p> <p>Kneppers spent two years living in Chilean coastal villages, working directly with fishermen to flesh out how to collect and process the nets. Bureo compensates artisanal fishermen for their collaboration, while industrial vessels can earn environmental certifications by participating.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Replacing virgin plastics in the market with recycled materials is important to get to a circular economy</p> <footer> <cite>Luisa Santiago</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Curbing global plastic production, however, may prove the bigger challenge, especially given a likely surge in cheap new plastics resulting from falling oil prices.</p> <p>\u201cReplacing virgin plastics in the market with recycled materials is important to get to a circular economy,\u201d says Luisa Santiago, who leads Latin American operations at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

  "<p>If you\u2019ve ever been at a festival on a Monday morning and thought it was something that might happen at the end of the world, you might have some sympathy for performers and crew at the Tribal Gathering in Panama. The British-run festival \u2013 which takes place on the country\u2019s northern coast and brings together indigenous peoples with DJs, artists and performers from around the world for cultural exchange and a three-week beach party \u2013 was supposed to end on 16 March. But then came lockdown, in this case enforced by armed police.</p> <p>The festival has now been turned into a makeshift camp, with many of its attendees unable to return home and complaining of insufficient flights and strained discussions with embassies. The UK Foreign Office <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/lockdown-leaves-festivalgoers-stranded-on-beach-with-sewage-problem\">told a Guardian reporter</a> that they were \u201cin regular contact\u201d with festivalgoers, who are scattered between the festival and Panama City.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been camping on a beach for 80 days!\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dfranciscoart/\">Doug Francisco</a>, a circus performer and artist from Bristol.

After it was over, the battle became how to leave the site. Confused and conflicting orders were given by the authorities, festivalgoers report. A busload of travellers was held for 12 hours near the site and those without confirmed flights were turned back. But many flights had been cancelled. Embassies became involved with mixed results. \u201cThe British embassy sent a bus, but they just took people to the airport,\u201d says Francisco. \u201cThere were no flights and they just left them there. They didn\u2019t sort them out flights or anything. That was when it was all kicking off. I was like, I\u2019m not getting on the bus if I don\u2019t have a flight.\u201d He remained at the festival site, where he has a four-metre bell tent.</p> <p>British festivals such as Glastonbury cancelled, but at Tribal Gathering the show went on, of a sort. About 300 crew, performers and public were still on site days after it was supposed to have ended. \u201cPeople were dealing with it pretty well,\u201d says Francisco. Because they had been quarantined, they were safe from the threat of coronavirus and could avoid the restrictions the rest of the world was enduring. \u201cThis might be the last show on Earth. I did my one-man show the other night to the kitchen crew. We had a drag queen party with cocktails on the beach.\u201d</p> <p>Some of those who managed to leave the festival are still stranded in Panama City. One who got back to the UK was Barry Rees, a tree surgeon from Anglesey. He had gone to Panama to work on the build, turning the wild jungle beach, with its spiders, snakes and rampaging monkeys, into a safe festival site. When it was time to leave, he found his flight had been cancelled. Nevertheless, he managed to get past the armed guards. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I did it,\u201d he told me down the line from north Wales. \u201cI put on my pirate hat, that might have helped.\u201d After borrowing \u00a31,000 from his brother, almost being stranded in Miami and taking four international flights in three days, Rees finally got home. \u201cI was really jetlagged, had diarrhoea, couldn\u2019t really go anywhere. I was thinking, why did I leave paradise? But I didn\u2019t have much money and I didn\u2019t want to be a charity case.\u201d</p> <p>Those who remained got on with the festival takedown, \u201cmore slowly and methodically than usual\u201d, says Francisco. The organisers kept the food deliveries coming long after they were meant to have stopped. \u201cThey looked after everybody at the hell of a cost for food,\u201d says Rees. The festival has <a href=\"https://crackmagazine.net/2020/04/ravers-panama-city-tribal-gathering-festival/\">reportedly</a> taken out a $160,000 loan and is also <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/let039s-get-our-tribes-back-home-safely-and-quickly\">crowdfunding via GoFundMe</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMoving anywhere in the country is complicated \u2013 you need permissions, there\u2019s lots of checkpoints,\u201d says Francisco. \u201cThere\u2019s all this anticipation trying to leave, we\u2019re gonna go, we\u2019re gonna go, and then it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s no flights, we can\u2019t go. Well, OK, I\u2019ll stay here rather than getting stuck in a hostel.\u201d Rees says some of the crew managed to get put up for a month in a mansion, but it had nothing in it, not even tables and chairs, and no internet. \u201cThey were going out of their minds,\u201d he says.

  "<p>The stakes could hardly be higher; the prize still tantalisingly out of reach. It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of many millions of people rests on the discovery of a vaccine for Covid-19 \u2013 the only sure escape route from the pandemic.</p> <p>Yet the optimism that accompanied the launch of Oxford University\u2019s human trials this week has to be put in context, and the hurdles facing the scientists need to be understood.</p> <p>The vaccine hunters are trying to outwit an invisible enemy so small that a million viral particles could fit inside a human cell, but whose biological ingenuity has brought everyday life to a standstill.</p> <p>So what is the path to success?</p> <h2><strong>How vaccines train our immune system</strong></h2> <p>Traditional vaccines work by creating a weakened version of a virus, similar enough to the original that the immune system will be forearmed if the person is exposed to a full infection in future, helping prevent actual illness.</p> <p>The approach has led to some of our best vaccines, but is also fundamentally risky because there is always a chance that a newly developed attenuated virus won\u2019t be as innocuous as hoped. Clinical trials have to be approached cautiously and slowly \u2013 especially when there are no effective treatments for a disease.</p> <p>A slow approach is not ideal in a pandemic.</p> <p>So it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that only <em>two</em> of the 76 vaccine candidates that the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf\">has on its radar</a> have opted for this traditional approach.</p> <p>The rest rely on the fast-track idea that the immune system doesn\u2019t need to see the entire virus to generate the ammunition to fight it off in the future. If the virus is the warship, the theory is that the immune system needs only to see the enemy flag to form an indelible immune memory. In the case of Covid-19, this flag takes the form of prominent protrusions, known as spike proteins, that form a halo or \u201ccorona\u201d around the virus.</p> <p>Advances in genetic engineering have given full flight to scientists\u2019 creativity in developing this defence.</p> <p>Teams around the world have moved at unprecedented pace, going from having the genetic sequence for the spike protein in January to vaccine candidates a matter of weeks later.</p> <p>But many of these technologies are unproven and the success of any trial is far from guaranteed, as this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/high-hopes-drug-for-covid-19-treatment-failed-in-full-trial\">disappointing results for the drug remdesivir show</a>. Ethical questions need to be navigated to ensure the safety of volunteers.</p> <p>And then, potentially the most contentious question of all: if a vaccine is found, who gets it first?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb4796d83bcae0988f754cbedcae7fea5b48bb0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb4796d83bcae0988f754cbedcae7fea5b48bb0f/0_144_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scientist Xinhua Yan works in the lab at Moderna in Cambridge, MA.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientist Xinhua Yan works in the lab at Moderna in Cambridge, MA.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boston Globe/Boston Globe via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The frontrunners</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/first-participant-us-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-moderna-dose\">First into clinical trials</a>, just eight weeks after the genetic sequence for Covid-19 was published in January, was the US biotech company Moderna, with its RNA vaccine.</p> <p>RNA is a single-stranded messenger molecule that normally delivers genetic instructions from DNA, coiled up inside the nuclei of cells, to the cell\u2019s protein-making factories outside the nucleus.</p> <p>In this case, the RNA instructs the muscle cells to start churning out the harmless spike protein as a warning to the immune system. Imperial College London\u2019s team, this week backed by \u00a322.5m government funding, is also developing an RNA vaccine, but in a form that hasn\u2019t been tested before in people.</p> <p>\u201cSome groups have skipped animal studies because their technology has been used in human studies,\u201d said Prof Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial team. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that luxury. It\u2019s probably cost us one or two months, but it\u2019s much better to be cautious and be sure you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s really safe.\u201d</p> <p>Also testing their candidates in human trials are the Chinese vaccine company CanSino Biologics, and a team at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/uk-drive-develop-coronavirus-vaccine-science\">Oxford University</a> led by Prof Sarah Gilbert.</p> <p>Both are using harmless viruses that have been disabled so that they don\u2019t replicate once they get inside cells. These delivery vehicles are known as \u201cnon-replicating viral vectors\u201d.</p> <p>These teams had already tried and tested the approach for other diseases, such as Ebola, and had flasks of their vectors sitting in freezers, ready to go. </p> <p>A third approach is that of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/a-second-potential-covid-19-vaccine-backed-by-bill-and-melinda-gates-is-entering-human-testing/\">US biotech company</a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/a-second-potential-covid-19-vaccine-backed-by-bill-and-melinda-gates-is-entering-human-testing/\"> Inovio</a>, a firm that has existed for four decades without developing an approved product, but whose stock soared after it started its trial earlier this month.</p> <p>Its vaccine uses DNA to carry instructions for making the spike protein into cells, which gets transcribed into messenger RNA, which then orders the protein factories to start pumping out the enemy spike protein.</p> <p>This might seem an unnecessarily elaborate cascade, but some think that getting the enemy flag inside cells and not just into the bloodstream could be important .</p> <p>\u201cClearly it is true that there are no approved RNA or DNA vaccines on the market today,\u201d said Joseph Kim, Inovio\u2019s CEO. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, a fourth strategy simply manufactures massive supplies of the spike protein itself, and injects a dose directly into people.</p> <p>This is what the big pharma team-up of Sanofi and GSK are betting on. Sanofi is repurposing a vaccine candidate that was developed for Sars in the early 2000s, while GSK is providing an ingredient, known as an adjuvant, that boosts the immune response, which has also been tried and tested.</p> <p>It\u2019s too early to say which option looks the most promising, according to Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is funding the development and testing of eight candidates.</p> <p>\u201cSome vaccines are going to be very fast to clinic, others have tremendous potential to scale up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the challenge that we face is that there\u2019s going to be a great deal of urgency and pressure to roll out vaccines quickly for obvious reasons. You\u2019re talking about giving a medical product to someone who is well.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What are the odds they\u2019ll work?</strong></h2> <p>A few candidates will be filtered out in toxicology testing in animals. Others might fail because phase one trials in people produce unexpected side effects.</p> <p>There is a chance none of them will work.</p> <p>For some illnesses, including other circulating coronaviruses, the immune system wages its battle, then a few months later forgets it ever happened. Others, like chicken pox or mumps, trigger lifelong immunity.</p> <p>The truth is we\u2019re not yet sure where on this spectrum Covid-19 lies.</p> <p>\u201cReasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year,\u201d according to Marcus Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard, whose team recently predicted that, in the absence of a vaccine, social distancing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-distancing-continue-until-2022-lockdown-pandemic\">may need to continue until 2022</a>. \u201cOn the long end, it might be several years of good protection. It\u2019s really speculative at this point.\u201d</p> <p>On the positive side, Covid-19 appears quite stable genetically, meaning that the spike protein that vaccines are built around should still look the same next winter.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the case for flu, which shuffles its genes around so rapidly that new vaccines are needed each year.</p> <p>There are also questions around the type of immunity required.</p> <p>The body overcomes illness through antibodies, which see off the virus itself, and killer T-cells, which eliminate cells already infected by the foreign invader. For some illnesses, antibodies do the heavy lifting, but the balance varies depending on pathogen and even across people.</p> <p>\u201cAn ideal vaccine should generate a response in both arms of the immune system - antibodies and T cells,\u201d said Kim. He predicts this could be a weakness of RNA and protein vaccines, which are delivered outside of cells, meaning that killer T-cells are not likely to be recruited.</p> <p>There is also a chance that some trials could grind to a halt, simply because the pandemic has been so well controlled by lockdowns and other measures. \u201cYou need a certain hit rate in the population you\u2019re vaccinating to get the statistics to show your vaccine is having protective ability,\u201d said Miles Carroll, head of research at Public Health England\u2019s National Infection Service at Porton Down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc99c90aad2dd10402feba15b556c9d85f4162fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc99c90aad2dd10402feba15b556c9d85f4162fc/0_172_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson visits a laboratory at the Public Health England National Infection Service in London in early March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson visits a laboratory at the Public Health England National Infection Service in early March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The possibility of \u201cchallenge trials\u201d, in which people are deliberately infected, have been considered, but there are obvious ethical issues with exposing volunteers to a potentially deadly disease. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in this \u2026 because it would really accelerate vaccine development, but there are some major hurdles to ensure the safety of the volunteers in that setting,\u201d said Prof Andrew Pollard, chief investigator on the Oxford study.</p> <h2><strong>Scaling-up</strong></h2> <p>Vaccine manufacturers talk in terms of yield: how many doses of vaccine do you get out per litre of culture. And there could be significant differences in the ability of teams to produce the number of doses required to make a difference.</p> <p>Shattock believes this will be a strength of Imperial\u2019s RNA vaccine candidate, which has the unique feature of replicating itself thousands of times once inside the body.</p> <p>\u201cWe can make the equivalent of a million doses within a litre of material,\u201d said Shattock. \u201cMany other vaccines would need hundreds or thousands of litres for that. It\u2019s the scalability. Towards the end of the year we\u2019ll be hoping to make tens of millions of doses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf our vaccine were shown to be successful, if everything goes well \u2013 and that\u2019s still a big if \u2013 we could deploy it in the UK this winter,\u201d said Shattock. \u201cAll these smaller approaches will hold the fort until a larger global solution comes.\u201d</p> <p>By September there could be a vaccine \u2013 maybe several \u2013 that appear broadly safe and effective.</p> <p>That\u2019s not enough to get a vaccine licensed, but governments are already talking about the potential for rolling out such candidates to high-risk groups, potentially including millions of health workers, under \u201cemergency use\u201d rules in the absence of this ultimate seal of approval.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There are precedents for this \u2013 in the 2018 Ebola outbreak, more than 200,000 people in Democratic Republic of Congo received the Merck vaccine before it was licensed in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cThat might be enough if you are an intensive care nurse or living in an old people\u2019s home, to say that for you, because you have the most to gain from being vaccinated, the risk-benefit balance is favourable,\u201d said Sandy Douglas, an Oxford vaccine researcher.</p> <p>But very rare side-effects cannot be ruled out. And there have been vaccine calamities in the past \u2013 recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/10/boy-wins-120000-damages-narcolepsy-swine-flu-vaccine-glaxosmithkline\">the GSK vaccine Pandemrix</a>, given to millions during the swine flu pandemic of 2009, which was linked to narcolepsy in one in every 55,000 jabs.</p> <p>The principle of transparent informed consent will be critical, Douglas added. \u201cIn this case, that would include the fact that if you\u2019re being offered a vaccine in October that didn\u2019t exist in April, there will not yet be long-term safety follow-up experience, although we do have longer term experience with several similar vaccines.\u201d</p> <p>Individuals could be faced with tough choices \u2013 take an experimental vaccine or leave themselves at risk of infection.</p> <h2><strong>Global solution</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfb868265e8e7689732af72e9fa16782da3b1041\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfb868265e8e7689732af72e9fa16782da3b1041/0_224_3582_2149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in Tokyo wearing a mask to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman in Tokyo wearing a mask to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the moment, many teams are trying all sorts of ways to develop a vaccine, but there is no coherent solution for the whole planet. Some are banking on big pharma swooping in with a blockbuster product. Sanofi and GSK, as a joint force, are unique in having the ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses without relying on external support.</p> <p>But multinationals are not built for speed and their reputations depend on absolute safety, so there is no prospect of this team making its vaccine widely available before mid to late-2021.</p> <p>Others urge a unified approach; governments, the UN, the World Bank and the WHO need to agree a way forward before a lead candidate emerges.</p> <p>National governments are already making advance purchase agreements and looking to secure their own supply chains.</p> <p>\u201cIf vaccine nationalism asserts itself, you could end up having a limitation of a vaccine to one specific population,\u201d said Hatchett. \u201cIt\u2019s an understandable response of a leader who is elected by a particular population to protect that population. [But] you can\u2019t protect your people and your economy until the global pandemic is brought under control. We really can\u2019t deal with this one country at a time.\u201d</p> <p>Hatchett and others are arguing for a global commitment of tens of billions of dollars to ensure that any successful vaccine is distributed globally and according to need. \u201cIn global health terms that\u2019s a very big number,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if your point of reference is the global impact that this pandemic is having on the economy, then that\u2019s a very small number. If you buy into the idea that the vaccine is the escape route from the pandemic then that\u2019s a really good investment.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020 to clarify that RNA delivers genetic instructions from DNA within the cell, rather than outside the cell as originally suggested in \u201cThe frontrunners\u201d section.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cThis is every record collector\u2019s wet dream,\u201d says Gilles Peterson. The DJ and broadcaster is speaking over the phone from his east London hub, where he is surrounded by his collection of more than 50,000 pieces of vinyl. \u201cThis lockdown has been the first time in my life that I\u2019ve put the brakes on and haven\u2019t got a gig for at least six months,\u201d he says. \u201cIt means I finally have the time to properly go through this collection I\u2019ve built up over the past 40 years. I\u2019m very grateful that I\u2019ve got this place where I can be creative; I need it for my mental health.\u201d</p> <p>Peterson has built his reputation over the past four decades as a label head and DJ championing jazz and global music, perhaps best known for his weekly Saturday afternoon show on <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_6music\">BBC 6 Music</a>, which has been a staple of its programming since 2012. In 2016, Peterson expanded his operation and opened his own online radio station, <a href=\"https://worldwidefm.net/\">Worldwide FM</a>, which has seen its listenership more than double in the month since lockdown began.</p> <p>\u201cWorldwide is a place of research,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a place for what I call the \u2018back room community\u2019 \u2013 those DJs and curators who are always in the back room of a club, experimenting. Worldwide is a place where I can learn from them and they can shine a light on different subgenres. And with what\u2019s going on at the moment, people are looking more for these kinds of curation and experimentation.\u201d As part of this quest to highlight the best of lesser-known music, Peterson has launched a new series of weekly shows, The 20, where he picks 20 records from his collection that define genres from Brit funk to disco and Brazilian jazz.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just really excited to get listening for these shows,\u201d he says, \u201cand to explore how these pieces of music fit in with each other and into the wider context of the time.\u201d In fact, Peterson sees the lockdown as the perfect time for looking back. \u201cThis period is going to be one of nostalgia,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the window of time where we can look back on what we\u2019ve done in life and what we\u2019ve loved, and I hope these radio shows can be part of that nostalgic reflection.\u201d</p> <p>It is, of course, still a time fraught with anxiety, especially for the music industry. \u201cSo many musicians and DJs only make money by playing live, so we\u2019re shellshocked by everything shutting down,\u201d he says. \u201cWho knows who will survive? I\u2019m just trying to protect the people that work for me, and I really hope that the public come out of this hungry for culture and hungry for art.\u201d Now, though, he hopes that his records will provide comfort: \u201cMusic is a form of therapy, and hopefully we can provide that in such difficult times as these.\u201d </p> <p><em>Gilles Peterson presents</em> <em>The 20</em> <em>on <a href=\"https://worldwidefm.net/series/gilles-peterson/\">Worldwide FM</a>, Thursday 30 April, 9am, to 7 May</em></p>",
  "<p>Passing through the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/25/daxing-international-airport-zaha-hadid-starfish-opens-beijing\">Beijing Daxing airport</a> on my way to an international scientific meeting on 25 January, two days after Wuhan had been put under lockdown, one sight in particular was unsettling. Close to 100% of people were wearing masks (myself included). Even in pollution-stricken China, this was highly unusual. Arriving in Europe, masks were nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>Three months on, even as more than 30 countries, including Germany, have mandated face coverings outdoors for the public, the UK government has been adamant that there\u2019s not enough evidence to support such a move here. The government, advised by the scientific advisory group on emergencies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/14/no-10-secrecy-around-sage-coronavirus-advisory-group\">Sage</a>), is expected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/public-can-choose-scarves-instead-of-masks-say-uk-scientists\">to make a decision shortly</a> on whether face masks will be mandatory. Reports suggest that the advice will be a compromise, with the public allowed to choose to wear scarves or face-coverings rather than medical-grade masks. So why has there been such a divergence on this issue?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/can-a-face-mask-protect-me-from-coronavirus-covid-19-myths-busted\">Can a face mask protect me from coronavirus? Covid-19 myths busted</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of us would probably ask how well a mask, especially a one made from cloth, may protect us from Covid-19. But the notion of \u201cpersonal protection\u201d misses the major reason why calls for increased use of masks and face-coverings have gained momentum around the world. From February, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5\">data was emerging</a> that, unlike Sars \u2013 where patients were most contagious several days after showing severe symptoms \u2013 people infected by Sars-Cov-2, the cause of Covid-19, were \u201cshedding\u201d most viruses (that could infect someone else)<strong> </strong>just before or at the time symptoms first appeared, often in very mild form. This had two implications: first, efforts to \u201ccontain\u201d coronavirus would be orders of magnitude more difficult than for Sars. Second, and as it has turned out more contentiously, the official World Health Organization and UK government advice that masks should only be worn by members of the public showing symptoms, and members of their immediate households, is probably wrong.</p> <p>In the field of infectious diseases, stopping a contagious patient infecting others is known as source control. For respiratory infections, source control would include wearing a mask when not under isolation. By advising symptomatic individuals to wear a mask, the government was advocating source control. But what if symptomatic individuals were only half the story? When people have been systematically tested for Covid-19, be it <a href=\"https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180\">passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2009316\">women about to give birth in New York</a>, the number of individuals who test positive but display no symptoms is about half the total number of those who test positive (the range is 20-90%, but most agree it\u2019s 40-60%).</p> <p>So can completely \u201cwell\u201d people transmit Covid-19? We know that even <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2007800\">normal speech can spread droplets</a>, and this is dramatically reduced by the use of cloth masks. And for symptomatic people infected with common-cold coronaviruses and <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/115/5/1081\">influenza</a>, normal breathing also results in shedding of virus, which again, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2\">is blocked</a> by wearing a mask. While we don\u2019t know for sure how contagious a truly asymptomatic Covid-19 patient might be, <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-16-testing\">evidence</a> <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/09/science.abb6936\">suggests</a> that around 40% of cases of transmission arise from people without symptoms.</p> <p>So what are the objections that have been raised against masks in public as policy? There have been repeated statements that the evidence in favour of masks is flimsy and ambiguous. For medics, the \u201cgold standard\u201d of evidence is the randomised controlled trial (some people take the medicine or undergo the intervention, and some don\u2019t, and we look to see if there were benefits or risks). There have been a few trials looking at masks for preventing influenza, and results were disappointing \u2013 although crucially, most of the group meant to wear masks actually didn\u2019t: it turns out we\u2019re just not that scared of catching the flu.</p> <p>But if one looks at the same level of evidence for the other measures strongly advocated by the government, for example hand-washing, studies have been similarly disappointing. And for other advice, such as the two-metre rule, or lockdowns, there have been no trials at all. So masks seem subject to a different standard of evidence than other measures. And while controlled trial data is not available, \u201cnatural experiments\u201d do suggest at least a correlation between mask-wearing and reduced Covid-19 transmission. The city of Jena in Germany introduced mandatory mask-wearing on 31 March and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/17/no-new-infections-german-city-impose-facemasks/\">recorded no new infections for eight days</a>, while surrounding cities continued to see a rise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/24/uk-coronavirus-live-warning-mass-vaccinations-covid-19-latest-updates\">UK coronavirus live: officials apologise after key workers denied tests on day one of Hancock scheme</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other objections include claims that wearing a mask increases other risky behaviours, such as a relaxed attitude to distancing (comparable to the idea that dangerous driving would increase when seatbelts became law), or that contaminated masks will increase rather than decrease infections. In Hong Kong, where mask uptake is an astonishing 98%, there have been no reports of harms associated with the practice, indeed, only four people have died from Covid-19 since the beginning of the outbreak.</p> <p>That perhaps leaves the final objection, which is that the public wearing masks will divert this scarce resource away from hospitals and care homes. In this sense, the government may simply be dragging its feet because of scarcity \u2013 which is a political and economic issue, not a scientific one. It might also explain the recent focus on cloth masks or face-coverings over masks: by advocating these,<strong> </strong>there is no competition with the NHS. And although less PR-worthy than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/we-made-right-choice-in-ventilator-race-says-uk-consortium-head\">collaborations with Rolls-Royce</a> to produce ventilators, other partnerships between government and industry could ensure high-quality cloth masks for everyone in the country.</p> <p>As the government equivocates, unlike our European neighbours, the British public may end up being the \u201ccontrol group\u201d for the face mask experiment the government has been demanding all along. But do we want to be?</p> <ul> <li><p>Babak Javid is a professor at the Tsinghua University School of Medicine in Beijing and a consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University hospitals<br></p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>\u201cThe best part of my job is when you make a difference to someone and they say thank you,\u201d says Dawn Toop, who manages a retirement community in Poole, Dorset. At Homelake House, an independent living development, she is responsible for everything from keeping the buildings in great condition to the happiness of residents.</p> <p>\u201cI love the job because it\u2019s so diverse,\u201d says Toop, who has worked for the property management company FirstPort for nine years. \u201cNo two days are the same. I could go from doing a detailed risk assessment one moment to helping a recently bereaved man with his washing machine the next. As well as ensuring that everything is safe for residents, we also do so many little things that affect their lives in a big way.\u201d</p> <p>Toop is one of FirstPort\u2019s 3,250-strong workforce. Between them, they manage 196,000 residential properties across 3,900 developments in the UK.</p> <p>Such a diverse scope of work calls for an equally varied staff base \u2013 and FirstPort is proud of the way it offers careers to people with all kinds of backgrounds and experience. There is no set route to follow to become a property manager, and it\u2019s often those who least expect it who become the business\u2019s most promising rising stars.</p> <p>Managing the properties and communities can be something of a challenge, but a hugely satisfying one. John Bain, a development manager for leasehold flats, freehold houses and commercial units in London, relishes his responsibilities, which include safety. He carries out regular checks on everything from fire alarm systems to emergency lighting, and arranges inspections at three-monthly intervals to examine the condition of buildings.</p> <p>Like his colleague Toop, he\u2019s also there for residents on a day-to-day basis, ready to deal with whatever comes up, whether that\u2019s coping with noisy neighbours or advising on home improvements. \u201cI used to manage a hotel, and this is very similar, except the residents never leave!\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s great to help people improve their surroundings, and to be able to forge the kind of long-lasting relationships that you only get in jobs like this \u2013 we really are part of our customers\u2019 everyday lives.\u201d</p> <p>The role also offers something else that Bain values highly: independence. He says that one of the best things is having the freedom to manage his own diary, plan his day and be flexible. For those managing a home and family of their own, this can be invaluable.</p> <p>It\u2019s all made easier by the use of technology \u2013 a big feature of life at FirstPort. The company has already embraced a range of digital communications to help staff work smarter, as part of an ongoing digital transformation programme to modernise and streamline the complexities involved with managing buildings.</p> <p>The Your Property Online service allows managers and residents to communicate easily about matters such as repairs and payments. Documents and pictures can be uploaded, and managers can quickly contact all the residents on a development if they need to. FirstPort\u2019s teams across the country stay in touch with each other using Yammer and Microsoft Teams \u2013 social networking tools for business \u2013 and through FirstPort\u2019s own intranet.</p> <p>The company offers plenty of scope for career development. Rhys Brown began working at FirstPort as a cleaner, doing just three hours a week. He took every opportunity to drive his career forward, working his way up to supervisor, then assistant manager. Now he is a development manager for the Park 25 community in Redhill, Surrey, as well as the neighbouring Foxboro Business Park.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve done plenty of on-the-job training,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been to different sites, shadowing different managers. FirstPort is keen for all colleagues to train up in-house and has been really supportive of me as I\u2019ve done so. For example, I wanted to do a leisure centre manager course and they set that up for me. If you bring something to them, they\u2019re happy to help you develop.\u201d</p> <p>The company has gone out of its way to make staff development easily accessible, in everything from leadership to resilience, as well as in technical skills such as Excel. Employees are encouraged to improve their knowledge and build their skills through professionally recognised industry qualifications by, for example, taking the Institute of Residential Property Management exams.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c936e326e86b29f76ce99c0437e81767c997b9e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c936e326e86b29f76ce99c0437e81767c997b9e0/129_154_3178_2363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exterior view of modern apartments\" width=\"1000\" height=\"744\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">FirstPort\u2019s workforce manages 196,000 residential properties across the UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peter Moore, one of the company\u2019s learning and development specialists, spent five years in operations so he knows first-hand the challenges faced by managers on the ground. And he\u2019s not alone: much of FirstPort\u2019s senior leadership team has experience of practical roles, and staff in management positions take a hands-on approach to supporting and mentoring their teams.</p> <p>Making sure that continuing professional development is effective, Moore says, is all about keeping content up to date and learner-led to ensure everyone gets the most effective learning experience. \u201cThe company encourages us to come up with ideas \u2013 from new processes to boost productivity, to community activities. At the same time, it offers the reassurance of tried and tested skills across its national portfolio.\u201d</p> <p>Along with career development, FirstPort prioritises mental health and wellbeing. This includes a programme to train employees to be mental-health first aiders, each able to provide a non-judgmental listening ear for colleagues who might be feeling down.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very aware that this can be a demanding job \u2013 and we have many remote workers and lone workers,\u201d says Callum Austin, FirstPort\u2019s internal communications manager. \u201cProperty management is a dynamic career choice, with colleagues taking on a lot of responsibility and making big decisions. We wanted to make sure that there\u2019s always an option to reach out, particularly at a time when a lot of people are going to be feeling anxious.\u201d</p> <p>In the past few weeks, he has created a dedicated website using SharePoint that collates relevant Covid-19 information, updates and policies, aiming to help the workforce feel supported and informed. Alongside all of the internal information, FirstPort has supported staff by making sure all customers have been kept up to date with regular communication and FAQs relevant to their development.</p> <p>That support makes for a great place to work, says Moore, who previously worked for companies such as Phones 4u and the electrical retailer Powerhouse. \u201cIt\u2019s a friendly environment, and it\u2019s been very welcoming for career changers like me \u2013 as long as you can talk to people, we can show you the rest! And whatever you put in, you\u2019ll get out threefold.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Doctors condemn Trump\u2019s \u2018disinfectant\u2019 virus theory</h2> <p>Medical experts have widely condemned Donald Trump\u2019s musings at the latest White House briefing<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\"> about whether disinfectant and UV rays could be used on people to fight the virus.</a></p> <h2>Russia: 5,849 new cases and 60 deaths in 24 hours</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-death-toll-trump-china-live-news-us-passes-480bn-relief-bill-as-ramadan-restrictions-are-imposed-indonesia?page=with:block-5ea29d9a8f08eb2f433f59de#block-5ea29d9a8f08eb2f433f59de\">Russia on Friday reported 5,849 new confirmed coronavirus cases</a> of the novel coronavirus. It is a sharp increase that appears to dash hopes that the country has reached a plateau in its battle against the virus. The near-record jump in cases brought the total to 68,622, with nearly half of those in Moscow. Sixty people with the virus died overnight, pushing the death toll to 615, Russia\u2019s official crisis response centre said.</p> <h2>Boris Johnson sounds \u2018ready to go\u2019, according to Trump</h2> <p>Donald Trump has said Boris Johnson sounded \u201cincredible\u201d on a phone call with him after he was discharged from hospital, prompting speculation that the prime minister will return to work soon. The US president revealed details of their conversation at one of his regular press conferences in which he claimed Johnson, who was in intensive care with coronavirus earlier this month, sounded \u201cready to go\u201d.</p> <h2>Ramadan begins with new coronavirus measures</h2> <p>The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins on Friday, with some countries easing restrictions and others tightening them. Egypt<strong> </strong>is to ease its coronavirus lockdown by allowing more businesses to reopen and shortening a nighttime curfew. The<strong> </strong>United Arab Emirates<strong> </strong>has cut a nationwide coronavirus curfew by two hours to now run daily from 10pm-6am, instead of from 8pm.</p> <h2>US may extend social distancing until summer</h2> <p>Trump also said he may extend federal social distancing guidelines to the summer. It came as Congress approved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/us-congress-coronavirus-bill-small-business-relief\">a $484bn coronavirus relief package</a>, taking to nearly $3tn the money pledged so far. Also in the US, the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren<strong> </strong>revealed her older brother <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/elizabeth-warren-brother-dies-coronavirus\">ha</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/elizabeth-warren-brother-dies-coronavirus\">d died after contracting Covid-19</a>.</p> <h2>New deaths in Spain at lowest level in more than a month</h2> <p>The number of coronavirus deaths in Spain has fallen to its lowest level in more than a month, with 367 new deaths reported on Friday, Reuters has reported. The latest update took the total number of deaths to 22,524 from 22,157 the day before, the health ministry said. The overall number of coronavirus cases rose to 219,764 from 213,024 the day before.</p> <h2>No deaths in South Korea in last 24 hours</h2> <p>South Korea reported just six more cases of Covid-19 in the 24 hours before midnight on Friday, raising the total number of infections to 10,708. There were no deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 16 March \u2013 39 days. The death toll is now 240, or 2.24%.</p> <h2>China reports low numbers of new cases again</h2> <p>China has published its daily coronavirus figures, reporting just six new cases and no new deaths.</p> <h2>Macron to release lockdown exit plan early next week</h2> <p>The French president said the government aimed to release its detailed end of lockdown plan \u201cprobably on Tuesday\u201d. Speaking to a group of mayors by video-conference on Friday, Emmanuel Macron said managing the return to normal life was a \u201clogistical and organisational challenge\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>It was lunchtime on Monday when counsellor Rebecca Henderson answered a crisis call from a distraught girl with thoughts about ending her own life.</p> <p>The teenager was locked in the bathroom at home, agitated, and scratching at her arms. She knew that she needed help, but was scared about contracting coronavirus if she went to the hospital.</p> <p>\u201cA young woman with existing problems, isolated in a stressful home situation without support with thoughts of taking her own life \u2026 that\u2019s a high-risk perfect storm,\u201d said Henderson, who works at the <a href=\"https://crisiscenterbham.org/\">Crisis Cent</a><a href=\"https://crisiscenterbham.org/\">er in Birmingham,</a> Alabama, part of the national suicide prevention lifeline network.</p> <p>She\u2019s not the only one. Every aspect of normal life has been turned upside down by the strict physical distancing measures to mitigate the pandemic, which has already claimed almost<em> </em>50,000 lives and 26m jobs in the US<em>. </em>With no end in sight, the mental health consequences of Covid-19 are starting to manifest \u2013 fuelled by the devastating mix of uncertainty, isolation, grief and economic despair.</p> <p>Nationwide, crisis services are trying to deal with the immediate aftermath. But the country\u2019s weak mental health system may not be able to meet rising demand.</p> <p>Counsellors on the <a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org/topics/get-help-coronavirus/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3_Sww-v86AIVA-DICh3RwAV9EAAYAiAAEgK5C_D_BwE#dealing-with-coronavirus-1\">crisis text line</a><strong>,</strong> a global SMS helpline typically utilized by teens with relationship issues, said they were dealing with a 40% increase in messages in the US. The demographics have changed radically: now, over-35-year-olds are the most frequent users, with those on low incomes accounting for 31% of traffic \u2013 compared with 19% before the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIn the first wave people were anxious, but now in the second wave people are feeling depressed and isolated, especially very poor people and those in violent situations,\u201d said Nancy Lublin, the CEO and co-founder.</p> <p>In Alabama, calls to the hotline are up 50% since the start of the pandemic, with a big rise in isolated young people and rural dwellers worried about finances. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase in suicidal ideation among people who\u2019ve lost their jobs, worrying about how they\u2019re going to feed their families,\u201d said Meg McGlamery, executive director of the Crisis Center.</p> <p>In California, calls to a disaster distress line more than tripled between February and March, and are on track to rise another 50% this month, according to Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of callers to this national hotline are anxious about Covid-19 .</p> <p>As the economic fallout deepens, mental health advocates<strong> </strong>warn about the potentially devastating impact on millions of Americans. \u201cWe fully expect a jump in calls to the suicide prevention lifeline in the next couple of months as people remain unemployed, lose their homes and can\u2019t pay the bills,\u201d said Lyn Morris, the senior vice-president of clinical operations at <a href=\"https://didihirsch.org/services/suicide-prevention/\">Didi Hirsch.</a></p> <p>There\u2019s precedent for that dire outlook. In the aftermath of the 2007 recession in North America and Europe, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2014/06/11/318885533/suicide-rate-in-u-s-and-europe-climbed-during-great-recession\">about 10,000 more people</a>,<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2014/06/11/318885533/suicide-rate-in-u-s-and-europe-climbed-during-great-recession\"> </a>mostly middle-aged and older men, committed suicide than expected in a two-year span.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just about isolation or financial dire straits \u2013 the pandemic has its own specific victims. The number of Asian Americans using the national crisis text line has doubled, counsellors say, amid a wave of harassment and bullying probably linked to the racist rhetoric spouted by Trump and some of his supporters who blame China for the spread of the virus.</p> <p>Requests for help from domestic violence victims are also up by a third at the crisis text line. The world over, <a href=\"https://time.com/5463069/home-most-dangerous-gender-violence-study-un/\">home is the most dangerous place</a> for women and children \u2013 a grim reality exacerbated by physical distancing and travel restrictions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bcca288b32ed23ebb83ea18c2da8c2ae0af0adc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bcca288b32ed23ebb83ea18c2da8c2ae0af0adc/0_156_4490_2695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman leans out of her window to smoke in New York earlier this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman leans out of her window to smoke in New York earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Alabama, Henderson recalled a call from a woman desperate to flee a violent partner but who was scared of being arrested if she crossed state lines. In another case, the center struggled to find emergency shelter for a rape survivor.</p> <p>Children are often the most vulnerable during public health crises. There is particular concern for those with pre-existing psychological issues, and those cooped up with an abuser or an adult with substance misuse problems, mental health experts said.</p> <p>In order to mitigate the risks, one school counselor in New Jersey told Lisa Athan, a grief specialist, that she holds up a paper sign with \u201ccan you speak freely?\u201d to which the child responds with a nod or shake of the head.</p> <p>Athan said children are struggling to process grief as normal rituals associated with death such as saying goodbye and funerals are almost impossible.</p> <p>\u201cWithout these rituals, deaths don\u2019t feel real, and children feel helpless, anxious, angry and too upset to concentrate on school work,\u201d said Athan, who is trying to teach mindfulness and yoga virtually. \u201cNow they see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/coronavirus-americans-protest-stay-at-home\">protesters [on TV] </a>who want businesses reopened while their teachers and grandparents are still dying \u2026 it makes them feel angry, that these people don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>The unresolved grief and trauma from the pandemic, meanwhile, can increase the<a href=\"https://eddinscounseling.com/understanding-unresolved-grief/\"> risk of complex problems</a> such as depression, substance misuse, physical complaints and violence.</p> <p>Crisis services and clinicians have scrambled to adapt by rolling out virtual therapy and telehealth consultations. But the country\u2019s inadequate mental health infrastructure, means this is unlikely to be enough.</p> <p>\u201cThe US mental health system is patchy at best and faces being overwhelmed by the likely substantial increases in anxiety and depression, substance use, domestic violence and child abuse,\u201d said Sandro Galea, the dean of Boston University\u2019s school of public health.</p> <p>In 2018, there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/profit-over-people-cost-over-care-americas-broken-healthcare-exposed-by-virus\">27.9 million people without health insurance</a>, and record-high unemployment will increase that figure.</p> <p>Recruitment and training of mental heath professionals has also fallen way behind: the <a href=\"https://bhw.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bhw/health-workforce-analysis/research/projections/behavioral-health2013-2025.pdf\">Department of Health and Human Services predicts widespread staffing shortfalls</a> by 2025 including up to 57,000 psychologists, 14,000 psychiatrists and 48,000 mental health and substance abuse social workers.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, half of adults with mental illness did not receive treatment, according to the <a href=\"https://nami.org/mhstats\">National Association of Mental Illness</a> (Nami) which has seen calls to its helpline rise by 40% during the pandemic.</p> <p>As the need for mental health services rises, access to adequate and timely help will probably decline \u2013 unless drastic steps are taken now to expand digital outreach, improve surveillance to detect abuse, and fund services, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2764404\">according to Galea</a>.</p> <p>Even then, the repercussions are likely to be felt well after the peak of the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThe mental health curve is going to have a long tail,\u201d said Dr Ken Duckworth, the chief medical officer for Nami. \u201cWhen life finally returns to normal, the following year will not be a good one for mental health.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 If you need mental health support you can find help 24 hours a day:</em></p> <p><em>Text HOME to 741741 to connect with a <a href=\"https://www.crisistextline.org/topics/get-help-coronavirus/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6rOuhvb86AIVgbbICh3KPAmbEAAYASAAEgLvvPD_BwE#how-to-deal-with-isolation-2\">crisis text line counsellor</a></em></p> <p><em>Call the <a href=\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\">national suicide prevention lifeline on</a> 1-800-273-8255</em></p> <p><em>Call 1-800-985-5990 for the <a href=\"http://disaster-relief.org/pdf/distress-helpline.pdf\">national disaster distress helpline</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic that continues to sweep around the world. As more vaccine trials swung into action and the unequal burden of deaths became clear, governments came under fresh fire to rekindle their ailing economies.</p> \n<p><strong>More vaccine trials start as drug hope fades<br></strong>The first shots of an experimental vaccine from Oxford University were administered to volunteers. The safety trial will run for a month before more participants are recruited to assess the vaccine\u2019s efficacy. The team hopes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/uk-drive-develop-coronavirus-vaccine-science\">complete the trials in record time</a>, but as UK infections fall under lockdown, it will become harder to amass the necessary data without expanding into other countries. Elsewhere, German authorities approved a trial of a potential vaccine developed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-live-news-un-warns-of-biblical-famine-as-white-house-prepares-immigration-halt?page=with:block-5ea00f778f085a072d3bcf40#block-5ea00f778f085a072d3bcf40\">BioNTech</a>, while the Netherlands and Australia launched a trial of the BCG tuberculosis vaccine in the hope it may protect against Covid-19. A far more controversial approach to vaccine testing known as a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01179-x\">challenge trial</a> won support from more than 1,000 volunteers. Challenge trials raise ethical issues because people who receive the test vaccine are deliberately infected to assess whether it has worked: it\u2019s risky, but can deliver results fast.</p> \n<p>Among potential antiviral drugs, Gilead\u2019s remdesivir has been considered a frontrunner. But a draft report posted accidentally on the World Health Organization\u2019s clinical trials site revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/high-hopes-drug-for-covid-19-treatment-failed-in-full-trial\">the drug did not help patients</a>.

With more tests available, about 10 million \u201cessential workers\u201d and their families can now book virus tests if they have symptoms, he announced.

Hans Kluge, the WHO\u2019s regional director for Europe, said personal protective equipment and testing must be prioritised in care homes where deaths amounted to an \u201cunimaginable human tragedy\u201d. Despite the high proportion of deaths among older people, new research from scientists in Scotland challenged the idea that most of those who have died from coronavirus may have died soon of other health issues.

  "<p>Amid the misery and chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic, there are some short-term consolations. The precipitous drop in road and air traffic has left the air cleaner and the skies clearer. For advocates of a Green New Deal (GND) \u2013 a vast, state-funded green infrastructure project, including a total transition to renewable energy and the construction of mass transit systems \u2013 there are reasons to be optimistic. As the severity of the unfolding global recession becomes clear \u2013 the IMF <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8c72052-7e48-11ea-82f6-150830b3b99a\">predicts</a> a 3% global contraction \u2013 the GND looks like the best route to recovery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/23/microsoft-climate-crisis-moonshot-plan\">Could Microsoft\u2019s climate crisis \u2018moonshot\u2019 plan really work?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The GND had been growing in popularity before the outbreak \u2013 including among establishment politicians, with all the leading Democratic presidential candidates expressing support for some form of it. But with 26 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits in the past five weeks alone, and given that green industries are more efficient job creators than fossil-fuel ones, there is a powerful, immediate economic rationale for some kind of \u201cgreen stimulus\u201d. That is without even taking into account the longer-term economic case for decarbonizing: a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/climate/us-climate-report.html\">2018 US climate report</a> calculated that the devastating effects of unchecked global warming will shrink the US economy by as much as 10% by the end of this century.</p> <p>But the economic fallout of Covid-19 has cast a harsher light on another strand of the climate movement, commonly termed \u201cdegrowth\u201d. Influential among Extinction Rebellion activists, but often regarded as unrealistic by mainstream policymakers, degrowthers, as their name suggests, argue that uncontrolled economic growth is ecologically unsustainable and that to avert climate catastrophe we need to not only shut down the fossil-fuel industries but to reduce consumption overall. Degrowthers insist that we must find ways of living and working that do not require our economies to endlessly expand.</p> <p>Degrowthers have been particularly susceptible to caricature in recent weeks. \u201cThe coronavirus crisis reveals the misery of degrowth,\u201d the Spectator <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-coronavirus-crisis-reveals-the-misery-of-degrowth-\">predictably argued</a>. But current living conditions \u2013 sudden mass joblessness, confinement and isolation, widespread food and income insecurity \u2013 are not a meaningful foretaste of greener things to come. The nightmare we are currently enduring is not degrowth\u2019s secret dream come true; it is at most a grotesque parody of it, and one which is now liable to be weaponized by opponents of the movement.</p> <p>Reading the current moment as a repudiation of degrowth is premature and unjustified. It overlooks the distinction between what we are experiencing now \u2013 an unplanned, abrupt cessation of vast swaths of economic and social activity \u2013 and what advocates of degrowth envisage: a thoughtful, democratic, managed and equitable downsizing of the economy.</p> <p>Most degrowth advocates do not champion economic contraction as such, but argue for the necessity of adapting to the continuing, long-term global stagnation sometimes called \u201c<a href=\"https://time.com/4269733/secular-stagnation-larry-summers/\">secular stagnation</a>\u201d. The fact that we can only think of slowing down our economies in terms of recession and austerity \u2013 with the associated cuts to public spending, growth in inequality and decline in real earnings \u2013 says much more about our political landscape than the economic facts.</p> <p>Yet there is one important criticism of degrowth that has been decisively bolstered by the sharp reversal in global economic fortunes resulting from the coronavirus lockdowns: the consequences for jobs. GDP is a notoriously crude and partial measure of a society\u2019s wellbeing, failing to account for a whole host of indicative factors including equality, access to energy, the quality of healthcare, education and social support systems. But when GDP falls or slows because workers cannot produce goods or offer services, unemployment surges. Coronavirus has brought that reality dramatically home.</p> <p>As the economist and energy adviser Robert Pollin has <a href=\"https://newleftreview.org/issues/II112/articles/robert-pollin-de-growth-vs-a-green-new-deal\">written</a>: \u201cthe immediate effect of any global GDP contraction would be huge job losses and declining living standards for working people and the poor. During the Great Recession, global unemployment rose by over 30 million. I have not seen a convincing argument from a degrowth advocate as to how we could avoid a severe rise in mass unemployment if GDP were to fall by twice as much.\u201d</p> <p>The twin crises besetting us \u2013 the public health emergency and the unfolding economic trauma triggered by the measures to contain it \u2013 have laid bare much about the configuration of our world that we already knew but rarely fully apprehend: its interconnectedness, its fragility, its stark inequalities. But these crises have also brought into visceral relief the fact that employment is the heart and soul of the economy. As the British economist James Meadway has <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-will-require-us-to-completely-reshape-the-economy/\">argued</a>, the economic depression now upon us threatens \u201cthe most fundamental institution of all in capitalism: the labor market itself\u201d.</p> <p>Since we have so little time left in which to stabilize the climate, we must be ruthlessly pragmatic in assessing the limitations of green strategies. Degrowth is no exception. The scale and speed of investment required to completely renovate the energy and transportation sectors does not seem conceivable without growth continuing, at least for the time being. Politically, as long as a steadily rising GDP remains an electoral necessity, it is difficult to imagine a recovery that doesn\u2019t involve desperate efforts to restore growth \u2013 and not necessarily through greener means \u2013 by politicians anxious to revive flagging ratings.</p> <p>Yet to fixate on the question of growth risks exaggerating the differences between the Green New Dealers and degrowthers \u2013 elevating the former as practical-minded technocratic capitalists who want a return to normal economic activity, just motored by a different energy source, and dismissing the latter as abstemious, back-to-the-land utopians who want to deprive us of most of the luxuries of modern capitalist life.</p> <p>This in turn could lead to our learning only some of the lessons of the current predicament, and taking only some of the opportunities it offers. What both strands of climate thinking ask us to consider \u2013 and what the current crisis poses with special, brutal force, as phrases like \u201ckey workers\u201d and \u201cessential services\u201d enter common parlance \u2013 is the question of what kinds of jobs we need, and what kinds our planet needs of us.</p> <p>Which goods and services are indispensable, and which would we be better off without? Degrowth and the GND offer different answers to this question \u2013 from green infrastructure construction to the care economy \u2013 but they both pose it, as well as raising important broader questions about how, how much and why we work. Once it is safe to emerge from economic survival mode, I hope we will have the wisdom to follow the lead of both movements by systematically reflecting on which kinds of productive activity actually enrich our lives \u2013 and which among these our planet can sustain.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lola Seaton is assistant editor at New Left Review</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>I\u2019d missed the joke about the three-legged chicken. It was causing a stir.</p> <p>\u201cThat one about the chicken with three legs you told yesterday,\u201d said a presenter on Ireland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.midwestradio.ie/\">Midwest Radio</a>\u2019s afternoon show, \u201capparently Ronald Reagan told it first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he, now?\u201d the co-host replied.</p> <p>\u201cYes. You stole a joke from Ronald Reagan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJeez, I\u2019m going as red as a tomato here.\u201d</p> <p>The conjunction of tripedal fowl, the 40th president of the United States and two men in a studio in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, will never make a list of great radio moments but it was enough to coax me from between my four walls, even if it was via the imagination.</p> <p>Radio has never been more popular: it\u2019s seen off challenges, from television to the internet, to become stronger than ever. In 2017, according to industry ratings body Rajar, nine out of 10 people in the UK listened to the radio every week. Perhaps it succeeds because we have to conjure up our own pictures of events and places beyond our immediate surroundings. As a bored, lonely boy growing up in an anonymous south-east London suburb, I\u2019d spend most evenings in my bedroom jamming a coathanger into the back of an old radio and scanning the airwaves, awestruck by the range of languages and music bursting out of the night through skirling static; each voice sending tantalising reassurance of a world beyond the dispiriting confines of my own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2cdbd37831b8a4b71c19563b360ddcb4c33b16d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2cdbd37831b8a4b71c19563b360ddcb4c33b16d/0_194_3534_2122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Connelly travels the world, wirelessly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Connelly travels the world, wirelessly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Connelly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re living through a different kind of isolation these days but radio is again a valuable form of escape. If we can\u2019t go to the world then it has to come to us and, thanks to its radio stations, is available at the touch of a screen. Streaming has made global radio local and I can eavesdrop on continents through their breakfast shows, travel bulletins and drive-time programmes on a range of devices. </p> <p>A good way to navigate the crowded airwaves is through the <a href=\"http://radio.garden/visit/bow/ighZQ5vt\">Radio Garden app</a>: a portal set up by Dutch national broadcaster NPO in which a tide of little green dots washes across the surface of the planet, each representing a different station.

Many members of my family are coming out about their own mental health, and it seemed like every website I went to for professional help gave a notice that they were receiving a significant number of new patients during the pandemic.</p> \n <p>I know that social isolation is extremely harmful to overall wellbeing, and many people are suffering from social distancing, but a lot of us have actually been encouraged by it to start speaking up for ourselves. It may be interesting for you to research if the world of professional psychological care has really been experiencing an overall wave of new patients during the pandemic. All these changes have exposed serious faults in the way our society was being run, and I think that goes down to the most basic individual level.</p> \n <p>It would be amazing if this crisis has encouraged people to reach out for the help that they\u2019ve needed for so long. Thanks for the positives.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And thank you, Brooke.</p> \n<h2>Where was the Upside?</h2> \n<p>With everyone out there <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6bsRNQrAFeo\">who is still singing</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bsRNQrAFeo\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6bsRNQrAFeo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  18 nations, 32 performers, one song\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>What\u2019s the one thing you have learned in lockdown that you want to retain? <a href=\"mailto:theupside@theguardian.com\">Let us know.</a> Keep positive \u2013 we\u2019ll get through this together.

  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the main stories on Friday 24 April.</p> \n<h2>Aged care providers put on notice over restrictions</h2> \n<p>Scott Morrison has warned aged care providers to loosen restrictions or face stronger regulations that would prevent them from locking down residents without commonwealth approval. The prime minister said aged care providers had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/elective-surgery-restart-will-allow-government-to-wind-back-support-for-private-hospitals\">previously been told</a> not to restrict residents beyond the measures recommended by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, but despite that warning some homes were not allowing visitors and confining residents to their rooms even when no outbreak had taken place.'</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up to get this delivered as daily email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Morrison said there were reasonable circumstances \u2013 such as the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/some-australian-aged-care-homes-go-beyond-official-coronavirus-advice-with-lockdowns\">at Newmarch House aged care home in NSW, where five people have died</a> \u2013 in which to impose stronger restrictions to protect residents. \u201cBut more broadly, having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people, that\u2019s not OK,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2>Testing expanded nationally</h2> \n<p>Every state and territory has now broadened its testing criteria, which is the first of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/the-exit-strategy-how-countries-around-the-world-are-preparing-for-life-after-covid-19\">three steps</a> that Morrison said needed to be in place before the national cabinet would consider lifting social distancing restrictions. The other two steps are improved contact tracing and a strengthened local response capability. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said arrangements for testing asymptomatic people in frontline occupations were well under way.</p> \n<p>It appears likely that restrictions on sport and recreation will be lifted first. The national cabinet on Friday began working on a set of national principles under which professional and community sporting clubs, and individual recreational pursuits, might be allowed to resume. The AFL has said it will announce its season return date next week, while the NRL is still aiming for 28 May.</p> \n<h2>Death toll rises to 79</h2> \n<p>Australia recorded just 13 new cases overnight, while the national death toll rose to 79. A 79-year-old woman, who was part of the cluster of cases in north-west Tasmania, died overnight; a passenger from the Artania cruise ship died in hospital in Western Australia; and a fifth resident at Sydney\u2019s Newmarch House aged care facility died on Friday. Health authorities in Victoria, where six new cases were recorded overnight, are investigating a new cluster at a private inpatient psychiatric facility in Melbourne. So far 14 people, including five patients, have tested positive to Covid-19 in relation to this outbreak.</p> \n<h2>Concerns about US access to tracking data</h2> \n<p>It will be illegal to access data collected by the proposed contact tracing app for the purpose of anything other than contact tracing, the federal government has said. The data will be housed in an Amazon Web Services server, located in Australia, raising concerns that the US government will be able to access the data because of laws allowing it to access data held by US companies. The government services minister, Stuart Robert, said security would be ensured by the Biosecurity Act, under which it would be a criminal offence to transfer the data to any country other than Australia. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/24/virgin-australia-owes-68bn-to-more-than-12000-creditors-documents-reveal\">Virgin Australia owes $6.8bn to more than 12,000 creditors, documents reveal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Virgin Australia planes blocked at Perth airport</h2> \n<p>Virgin Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/24/virgin-australia-owes-68bn-to-more-than-12000-creditors-documents-reveal\">owed $6.8bn to 120,000 creditors went it went into administration on Monday</a>, citing the impact of the coronavirus.

Moulin says the team is considering developing an app with a panic button for women, as well as one for men to deter them from committing acts of violence.</p> <p> </p> <p>The nudge theory was put forward in a 2008 book of the same name by economist Richard Thaler and political scientist Cass Sunstein. One of Thaler\u2019s insights is that people do not always behave in their own best interests. From this, he developed an argument that nuanced changes can trigger desirable shifts in behaviour for individuals and society.</p> <p>Former UK prime minister David Cameron was a fan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/nov/12/david-cameron-nudge-unit\">in 2010</a> set up the first nudge unit, the Cabinet Office behavioural insights team. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/10/nudge-unit-pushed-way-private-sector-behavioural-insights-team\">Its successes</a> include sending letters to British GPs who were prescribing more than their peers, cutting unnecessary prescriptions by 3.3%.</p> <p>The UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/why-is-the-government-relying-on-nudge-theory-to-tackle-coronavirus\">early response to the pandemic</a> was thought to be largely influenced by the behavioural insights team. But this was subsequently changed and, as Tony Yates, a former professor of economics at Birmingham University, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/why-is-the-government-relying-on-nudge-theory-to-tackle-coronavirus\">pointed out in early March</a>, the UK strategy was an outlier: \u201cIf the nudgers have got it right, why are so many other countries taking a very different view of the \u2018science\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Before coronavirus took hold, the four permanent members of the Rio team were working onchanging messaging to tackle flooding. In April 2019, Rio de Janeiro recorded its <a href=\"https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2019/04/09/chuva-do-rio-e-a-mais-forte-em-22-anos-segundo-dados-do-alerta-rio.ghtml\">worst level of rainfall in 22 years</a>, with storms that left 10 people dead. <br><br>Monsoon rains impact poorer communities worst, especially those in favelas on steep hillsides.

To do this, NudgeRio has created different personas, including a mother with a baby and an older person, and seen how they might react to events such as flooding or a landslide.</p> <p>\u201cThe rain in Rio is unpredictable and varies according to which region of the city you\u2019re in,\u201d explains Rafaela Bastos, a member of the NudgeRio team. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that the population knows how to take decisions in certain situations, to be prepared and reflect on what to do with the information available.\u201d </p> <p>Other NudgeRio projects relate to tax collection, school registration and reducing jaywalking and have led to savings.

Sometimes it\u2019s seen as a sticking plaster for gaping holes in public services that need more investment. Rio\u2019s summer weather, for instance, has always been unpredictable, yet the same problems keep reappearing, suggesting a more structural approach is required. </p> <p>Moulin and the NudgeRio team acknowledge the pitfalls but remain excited by the potential impact.

A return to the global game\u2019s top table at the sixth attempt of asking - nearly 24 years after the pioneers of 1974 blazed the trail.</p> <p>A once-in-a-generation crop of talent. A mix of exciting youth - a teenage Harry Kewell, a bustling Mark Viduka - and experienced stars like Tobin and Arnold. Will the Socceroos ever see the like of this squad? One of the world\u2019s top coaches - England and Barcelona\u2019s Terry Venables. He still hasn\u2019t lost a game in charge of the Socceroos since he came down under, but he\u2019ll taste the sickly sweet bile of defeat in his mouth tonight.</p> <p>The sadness in the voice of Craig Foster after full-time said it all. The emptiness of Johnny Warren\u2019s post-match analysis. It\u2019s inexplicable that this team - having played <em>that </em>match, aren\u2019t going to France to mix it with Rivaldo, Zinedine Zidane etc. They utterly dominated Iran, the Socceroos. It could have been five-nil inside the first ten minutes. They only needed one of those chances, and it all could have been so different.</p> <p>Harry Kewell and Aurelio Vidmar did put the Socceroos two to the good; but that most cruel of scorelines - 2-0, has reared it\u2019s head. And it\u2019s Iran going to France, courtesy of Karim Bagheri and Khodadad Azizi.</p> <p>That\u2019s all from me.

  "<p>Black pools, long trenches and charred earth have become common sights in the fields of north-west Syria, signs of an informal oil economy that has developed during the war.</p> <p>Despite damaging both the environment and health, up to 5,000 backyard oil refineries, crucial to the livelihoods of besieged Syrians, have cropped up in recent years, identified through satellite imagery in <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/04/24/dying-to-keep-warm-oil-trade-and-makeshift-refining-in-north-west-syria/\">a report</a> by open source investigators Bellingcat.</p> <p>In and around the last remaining rebel-held areas, these refineries have provided fuel to a region where almost half the population has been displaced internally or from elsewhere in Syria.

Burning this fuel day in, day out raises a lot of concerns among locals,\u201d said Zwijnenburg.</p> <p>He said oil waste produced by these operations was increasingly turned into cooking coals, which heightens health risks because it involves scraping the waste from barrels used in the burning process.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very dirty job,\u201d said Syrian activist Wissam Zarqa. \u201c[A worker\u2019s] skin would become darkened all the time, not from lack of cleanness.

  "<p>Drive-in entertainment, a staple of 1950s America, is on its way to the UK \u2013 but not for the latest blockbuster or trashy horror film. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/english-national-opera-eno\">English National Opera</a> (ENO) has announced plans for what are thought to be the world\u2019s first drive-in opera performances.</p> <p>Planned for the first three weeks of September, the idea is to stage live performances in the grounds of Alexandra Palace, north London, with musicians and singers spaced out to conform with physical distancing guidelines. If successful, ENO hopes to roll out the \u201cDrive &amp; Live\u201d concept to other parts of the UK.</p> <p>Stuart Murphy, ENO\u2019s chief executive, told the Guardian it was part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/17/english-national-opera-to-give-under-18s-free-saturday-night-tickets\">the company\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/17/english-national-opera-to-give-under-18s-free-saturday-night-tickets\"> mission of \u201copera for everyone\u201d</a>. He said: \u201cIt is a bit of an experiment and if it works it might be a way of bringing the artform to people in a totally different and authentic way.\u201d </p> <p>Murphy said the company had been thinking about the concept before the coronavirus outbreak, but had accelerated the plans.</p> <p>People are desperate for communal experiences, he said. \u201cThe odd thing for all of us is the lack of social contact at the moment. If I see one more Zoom thing of 50 musicians singing \u2026 I now find it cold.</p> <p>\u201cI miss seeing my brother and sister, seeing my mates close up, and I miss seeing something live. It is human nature to yearn for that. Hopefully we can offer that universal, collective experience in a safe environment.\u201d</p> <p>The idea is that the audience would be in 300 cars, with the bigger vehicles at the back. People on motorbikes and pedal cycles would also be allowed. Then windows go down and the audience watches the live performance unfold on a specially constructed set.</p> <p>The audience reaction could be interesting, Murphy said. \u201cInstead of clapping or shouting \u2018bravo\u2019, it might be that people flash their lights or honk their horn. As long as it\u2019s authentic, we\u2019re not going to force it.</p> <p>\u201cI think it could attract a whole new generation to opera, people who love their car, see it as an extension to themselves, as well as reassuring an audience they can turn up totally safe.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy said if the concept worked then he could see drive-in operas being staged at racecourses or historic properties. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had a couple of really productive conversations with international opera houses who think we\u2019re on to something. It is an attempt to square the circle and let people have a big collective moment while staying safe.\u201d</p> <p>The first 12 performances will be a shortened 90-minute version of Puccini\u2019s La Boh\u00e8me and a one-hour family-friendly version of Mozart\u2019s <a href=\"https://eno.org/operas/the-magic-flute/\">The Magic Flute</a>.

But things change every day.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy, who joined ENO in 2018 after a career in TV, including working as launch controller of BBC Three, said the company was still planning to open <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/16/hairspray-eno-paul-merton-michael-ball-parasite-box-office-amelie-tate-british-baroque-warnings\">Hairspray </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/16/hairspray-eno-paul-merton-michael-ball-parasite-box-office-amelie-tate-british-baroque-warnings\">at its London Coliseum home</a> in September, and would soon announce details of its 2020-21 opera programme for the autumn and next spring.</p> <p>He said all arts companies needed now to be \u201cnimble and quick\u201d and react to circumstances, but at the moment ENO was not planning for seats being empty. \u201cTo be honest we\u2019re trying to test the temperature every day.\u201d</p> <p>Some countries have allowed drive-in cinemas to remain open during the lockdown. Germany, for example, has two year-round operations, in Essen and Cologne. According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/drive-movie-theaters-thrive-lack-new-titles-people-just-want-get-1290659\">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, both have sold out for every screening since Germany\u2019s lockdown was declared. Makeshift drive-ins are also popping up around the country.</p> <p>In the US, the spiritual home of the drive-in, fewer than 25 of the nation\u2019s 320 drive-ins are reportedly open for business, but that could change. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said last week he would consider allowing drive-ins to reopen. \u201cWhere is the public safety issue? It\u2019s a drive-in theatre. You\u2019re in the car with the same people,\u201d he said.</p>",

  "<p>Caught between the requirement to stay close to home and an irresistible urge to move, we are pacing out our local patch with renewed interest. This brought us on a sunny Sunday morning to the foot of Wimble Holme Hill. The name is a delight: the root of Wimble has been offered as \u201cwime\u201d, a dialect word meaning to take a circuitous route. Streams wime. Bees wime. And when confronted with the alarmingly steep slope of Wimble Holme Hill, so do humans, who most usually take the narrow road that loops to the north at a more reasonable angle.</p> <p>We, on the other hand, were up for a challenge and took the hill direct, which brought us immediately to a tangle of gorse. Here I stopped, not to catch my breath \u2013 we\u2019d hardly started \u2013 but to listen to the rasping call of a <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/greenfinch/\" title=\"\">greenfinch</a>.</p> <p>For years, from one summer to the next, I would lie half-awake in the morning listening to this sound, like an elongated wheeze, emerging from a conifer outside my bedroom window: a lazy, delicious sound that encouraged me to stay just where I was. Then, around the middle of the past decade, my garden greenfinches, my <em>confr\u00e8res</em> in idleness, disappeared, presumably victims of the trichomonosis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/22/bird-disease-finches-uk-europe\" title=\"\">outbreak</a> that caused such a precipitous decline in their numbers. And despite the recent recovery, they\u2019ve not returned to my garden yet. Summer hasn\u2019t been the same since.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/29/how-to-make-the-most-of-the-spring-wildlife-carnival-on-your-doorstep\">How to make the most of the spring wildlife carnival on your doorstep</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I could see why the greenfinches were thriving on Wimble Holme Hill. Plenty of cover, but also some benefactor had hung a couple of feeders from the bushes, crammed with sunflower seeds. Half-hidden behind the gorse was a circular wall of black bricks, the stub of what might have been a massive chimney but is, in fact, the opening of an airshaft to the railway tunnel that runs under Totley Moor.</p> <p>Built in the early 1890s, this huge project had its own story of sudden loss: the graveyard in nearby Dore has headstones to the victims of a smallpox outbreak that occurred among the navvies and their families during construction, unnamed victims of the march of progress. A railway tunnel might never wime, but the path of humans \u2013 and greenfinches \u2013 does little else.</p>",
  "<p>It is going to be a very different Ramadan this year due to the Covid-19 global pandemic and the social isolation laws. For 1.8 billion Muslims around the world, the cultural traditions and customs of this religious month of fasting will have to be forsaken for the safety of the global community. As an introvert, I am really looking forward to spending this month focusing inwards, without the burden of social responsibility.</p> <p>Ramadan in 2020 means no communal gatherings in mosques for \u201ctarawih\u201d night prayers, no large \u201ciftar\u201d dinners with family and friends at sunset to break the day\u2019s fast,and, sadly, restrictions on celebrating Eid, the biggest social holiday for Muslims signalling the end of Ramadan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/covid-19-pandemic-casts-long-shadow-as-ramadan-starts\">Covid-19 pandemic casts long shadow as Ramadan starts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ramadan is the ninth month of the lunar Islamic calendar, and involves fasting from food, water and marital relations from dawn to dusk for 29-30 days. Though cultural traditions have depicted Ramadan as a month of \u201cfeasting\u201d and socialisation, in reality, the pure religious tenets stress Ramadan as a month of extreme self-discipline and self-mastery, concepts that I constantly strive for.</p> <p>The current coronavirus rules involve hygiene practices that muslims are encouraged to do in general daily life. Muslims believe that cleanliness is half of faith, and we perform \u201cwudu\u201d, which is a ritual purification that involves handwashing and washing the face, arms and feet five times a day before each obligatory prayer. </p> <p>Self-discipline when it comes to physical acts of worship is a part of the heritage of Islam. However, the true essence of Ramadan has been diluted, and dare I say, lost, through the generations. The struggle for us today lies in the matters of the heart and the soul, and connecting at a deeper, more authentic level, to our sense of self and to our creator.</p> <p>Unfortunately, today Muslims often subjugate themselves and put the needs of others over our own physical, mental and spiritual needs. We frantically prepare large family dinners, and with the lockdown and children at home every day, this struggle can be magnified. It could simply be a matter of perspective, where a shift into a spiritual reflective state \u2013 a state of being rather than doing \u2013 could help maximise our affinity.</p> <p>The focus of Ramadan can move away from food preparation and \u201ceating at sunset\u201d, to self-improvement and self-discipline. There can be a tendency to overeat at these large iftars due to the spread of food available. However, now, without the self-induced obligation of hosting or attending iftars, meals can be prepared with a focus on simplicity and aligned with Islamic principles.</p> <p>Islam teaches that any food consumption should be to the fullness of one third of the stomach, with another third for water, and the last third for air. Muslims are highly discouraged from overeating and from wasting. Furthermore, any food that is consumed must be \u201chalal\u201d and \u201ctayyib\u201d. Tayyib means that the food eaten must be wholesome and good for you. Ramadan is the best time to discipline the self to eat healthy fresh food and in smaller proportions.</p> <p>Ramadan is also known as the month of the Qur\u2019an, as this is the month in which the Islamic scripture was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. We Muslims place a heavy emphasis on connecting to the Qur\u2019an during this month, through daily recitations and reflections, or attending the mosque for congregational night prayers (tarawih) where the Imam aims to recite the entire scripture in the prayers over the month so that we can reflect as we listen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/ramadan-in-a-time-of-plague-coronavirus-the-best-thing-is-to-stay-home-stay-quiet\">Ramadan in a time of plague: 'The best thing is to stay home, stay quiet'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this time of physical distancing, as Muslims we will be forced to reconnect to our God and the Qur\u2019an on a deeply intimate level. Interestingly enough, this is the authentic practice of Prophet Muhammad. He would isolate himself for days in a cave at the top of a mountain to introspect, reflect, worship and connect with God. During the last 10 days of Ramadan, he was known to self-isolate in a spiritual seclusion practice known as \u201citik\u0101f\u201d.</p> <p>In the time of Prophet Muhammad, tarawih night prayers were initially prayed in congregation for three days, however from the fourth night onwards Prophet Muhammad prayed tarawih in his own home, saying \u201cO people! Perform your [tarawih] prayers at your homes, for the best prayer of a person is what is performed at his home except the compulsory congregational prayer.\u201d</p> <p>I believe the authentic spirit of Ramadan is one of self-discipline, introspection, self-discovery and self-development. Ramadan during the global pandemic may seem disheartening at a superficial level, however I honestly feel that it arrives at an ideal time.</p> <p>You have the choice to embrace this Ramadan with a focus on deep connection and one-on-one intimacy with God through prayer and reflection. I plan to spend this next month practising self-compassion and self-mastery, and I invite everyone to join me in this journey of holistic growth and connection.</p> <p>\u2022 Heba Shaheed is a physiotherapist and women\u2019s health advocate</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

  "<p>This is not unprecedented.</p> <p>Not the presence of a new disease. Not the enforced social measures that fragment how we interact, and who with. Not the laying to waste of the environment.

They give us the dignity of bearing witness to each other, during a long era through which our testimonies have been discredited, and through which we have been isolated from one another.</p> <p>What does it mean to hold something like this in your hand, and be there together in a shared \u2013 if not always uniform \u2013 vision of ourselves as a people? Also, what does it mean to just read good poetry, and to read the essays of others who have been fully immersed in their heat? As these poems go out to First Nations readers, who may have read all or some of them individually, I hope we\u2019ll begin to see some of that collective power of care and comfort.</p> <p>The poems in Fire Front have been chosen because they represent the vital power of a renaissance in Blak verse. These poems know that poetry itself is not enough. These are not poems that observe our world for comfort; instead, they independently (and now together, in this book) clear a path for our imagination. They tell us to do something.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/26/alexis-wright-hey-ancestor\">Hey, Ancestor! by Alexis Wright</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lionel Fogarty calls us to be cautious of comfortable complicity, \u201ceven oiling the dramatist idea after death to the up coming\u201d.

But for local newspapers, already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/01/news-corp-to-suspend-print-editions-of-60-local-newspapers-as-advertising-revenue-slumps\">struggling if not suspended during the crisis</a>, it was a deadly blow. News Corp has suspended 60 of its community papers and Australian Community Media has stopped printing at least 85 and closed four printing presses.</p> <p>The government has now removed the requirement for council notices to be advertised in newspapers, instead giving them the option of putting all public notices on their websites.</p> <p>Helen Dalton, the member for Murray, said the government had effectively robbed regional papers of their last reliable source of revenue.</p> <p>\u201cWhy on earth would they do this now of all times? It\u2019s as if they want newspapers to die,\u201d Dalton told Weekly Beast. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a number of regional editors, and they are very frustrated by the lack of NSW government support and advertising.</p> <p>\u201cMany elderly residents are not on the internet. How will they stay informed during the pandemic? Murray Darling water corruption, dodgy council decisions, rural hospital downgrades \u2013 often these big issues are only scrutinised by rural papers.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for News Corp Australia said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d when local government didn\u2019t support local media. The community relied on public notices in newspapers for information about their local area, he said.</p> <p>Hancock\u2019s office said the government\u2019s hand was forced by the closure of so many papers, and the councils still had the option of advertising with newspapers online or in print if they wished.</p> <p>\u201cThe NSW government will continue to work with local councils to identify, develop and implement more measures to support them and their local communities during the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d Hancock said.</p> <h2>Rating Turnbull</h2> <p>Perhaps proving Turnbull\u2019s critique that the Murdoch media \u201cattacks its enemies and protects its friends\u201d News Corp staffers lined up to pour scorn on the former prime minister\u2019s memoir, which was published by Hardie Grant this week.</p> <p>And it wasn\u2019t just commentators Troy Bramston, Chris Kenny and Paul Murray who had harsh words for the former prime minister, it was even a theme in the Australian\u2019s TV ratings report.</p> <p>\u201cMalcolm Turnbull\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/credlin-ran-abbott-government-turnbull-claims-in-abc-interview/news-story/4725ea19b4cd8ad9798c6e79f38fe194\">much-hyped interview on ABC\u2019s 7.30 television program</a> about his divisive memoir failed to crack the 1 million audience barrier,\u201d the Australian\u2019s media reporter wrote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TroyBramston/status/1252753744984301569\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On interviewing Malcolm Turnbull: I&#39;ve interviewed 10 PMs, asked them all tough questions, but never had any intimidate me by threatening to cancel the interview, telling me my questions were pointless or that it was a useless exercise <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsAust?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SkyNewsAust</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/O5H920bnD5\">https://t.co/O5H920bnD5</a></p>&mdash; Troy Bramston (@TroyBramston) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TroyBramston/status/1252753744984301569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 22, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cThe former prime minister\u2019s lengthy interview about his book, A Bigger Picture, with 7.30 host Leigh Sales was watched by 940,000 metropolitan viewers on Monday night, ranking eighth on the TV ratings table.\u201d</p> <p>Now in fact an audience of close to 1 million in 2020 is a hit in anyone\u2019s book.</p> <p>As ratings guru <a href=\"https://tvtonight.com.au/2020/04/turnbull-interview-draws-big-crowd-on-monday.html\">David Knox from TV Tonight</a> wrote: \u201cABC\u2019s interview with former PM Malcolm Turnbull drew a big audience in what was generally a big night all round.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, the interview was (unsurprisingly) beaten by Nine\u2019s reality hit Lego Masters, but the number of people who tuned in for Sales\u2019 showdown with Turnbull was significantly up on a usual 7.30 night by some 200,000.

Alliances form, pacts are made, and when the rules are broken, finger-pointing and lies rip the group apart.</p> <p>Outwardly all the contestants express their desire to follow the rules and walk away with their share of the $100,000. Privately though, it\u2019s a different matter. Sneaky make-out sessions fray tempers, as it becomes clear some couples are copping a pash, taking advantage of the fact that most members of the group are remaining chaste.</p> <p>This kind of situation, where a group\u2019s shared interests are undermined by individuals who think the rules don\u2019t apply to them, isn\u2019t unique to Too Hot To Handle. In philosophy it\u2019s known as a collective action problem.</p> <p>While watching Too Hot To Handle, I couldn\u2019t shake the analogy to our current situation. We\u2019re all being asked to stay indoors and limit our interactions with friends and family. But the effects of that aren\u2019t equal. Those living alone, without housemates or long-term partners, are feeling the brunt of isolation.<br><br>As time goes on, the temptation to break the rules and venture out for some kind of interaction, whether it\u2019s a weekend lunch at a friend\u2019s place or cheeky hook-up, increase. If everyone else is staying at home, what\u2019s the risk?</p> <p>The same logic plays out on Too Hot To Handle. \u201cWell, if everyone else is keeping it in their pants, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me having a snog right? We\u2019ll still have $97,000 to share around.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20d6164861bb20bfd9f0f7447c2ebc8142ce3a7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20d6164861bb20bfd9f0f7447c2ebc8142ce3a7d/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Too Hot to Handle: in the pool\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The contestants can only prevail through solidarity and a collective commitment to remaining sexually unsatisfied.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aline Arruda/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Comparing the ethics of a show as silly as Too Hot To Handle to the ethics of a pandemic might sound absurd (probably because it is). But I asked Dr Matt Beard from the Ethics Centre about this, and it turns out I\u2019m not crazy. He recommended an answer from the work of Immanuel Kant, \u201cwho most people know thanks to Chidi from The Good Place\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cKant had this view of ethics that, ultimately, one way of testing whether an action was ethical or not was to ask: if everyone behaved in this way, could an individual reasonably pursue that course of behaviour?\u201d</p> <p>In the case of Too Hot To Handle, if everyone starts kissing and having sex, the prize pool runs out very quickly. When it comes to lockdown, if everyone decides that visiting their friend, family or lover is OK, then our collective action to stop the spread of the virus evaporates.</p> <p>What both situations reveal is the fantasy of individualism. Covid-19 is not a problem that can be resolved on an individual level. It requires all of us to act in concert.</p> <p>And while you might think a dating show where people compete purely for money is as individualistic as it gets, Too Hot To Handle proves that wrong.
