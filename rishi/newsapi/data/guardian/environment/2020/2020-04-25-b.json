  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global confirmed death toll exceeds 200,000</h2> <p>The total number of people to die worldwide after contracting coronavirus has surpassed 200,000, figures have shown. The global death toll increased to 202,368 on Saturday, according to a <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a> tally.</p> <p>The figures for infections are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic because of suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. Death toll figures are also controversial, with some countries reporting deaths as confirmed Covid-19 cases on the basis of symptoms and in the absence of a positive test, while others are not including them.</p> <h2>UK prime minister to return to work on Monday</h2> <p>Boris Johnson will return to work on Monday and is \u201craring to go\u201d, a Downing Street spokeswoman has confirmed. The prime minister has been recovering in his official country residence after spending three nights in intensive care in April. He returns to face a dilemma over whether to ease the coronavirus lockdown, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/25/boris-johnson-lockdown-dilemma-grim-virus-data\">leading scientists warn</a> that the number of new cases remains much too high.</p> <h2>Dozens of anti-lockdown protesters arrested in Berlin</h2> <p>German police arrested dozens of protesters in Berlin on Saturday for flouting the coronavirus lockdown measures they were demonstrating against. About 1,000 people turned out for the rally, which has become a weekly event in the German capital. Saturday\u2019s protest attracted mainly far-left activists but there were also far-right supporters and members of other fringe groups.</p> <h2>Paraguay reveals plan for \u2018intelligent quarantine\u2019</h2> <p>Paraguayan authorities have laid out details of a plan to begin lifting the country\u2019s total quarantine. Health minister Julio Mazzoleni announced at a press conference on Friday that a new \u201cintelligent quarantine\u201d will begin on 4 May. It will gradually reintroduce public freedoms and economic activities through <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/132YwFEFZF0xPsvSrliqbm8PXfkMy3cfF/view\">a four-stage plan</a> set to run until early July.</p> <h2>UK\u2019s biggest steel producer \u2018needs \u00a3500m government bailout\u2019 as Covid-19 halts production</h2> <p>The UK\u2019s biggest steel producer needs about \u00a3500m in government support to see it through the coronavirus crisis, according to Welsh MP Stephen Kinnock. Tata Steel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/25/tata-steel-needs-500m-government-bailout-says-stephen-kinnock\">has reportedly</a> approached the UK and Welsh governments for a bailout after its big European customers halted production. The company employs 8,385 people across the UK, including more than 4,000 workers at the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales.</p> <h2>Spain to allow exercise and walks from next weekend \u2013 PM</h2> <p>Spain could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/spain-backs-down-on-childrens-walks-as-eu-lockdowns-begin-to-ease\">lift more lockdown restrictions</a> and allow adults out to exercise from 2 May if efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue to pay off, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has said. The strict lockdown enacted after the declaration of a state of emergency on 14 March has been extended until 9 May, but children under the age of 14 will be allowed out for an hour\u2019s exercise each day from Sunday.</p> <p>Addressing the nation on Saturday night, S\u00e1nchez said: \u201cIf things keep going in a positive direction with the pandemic, from 2 May people will be allowed out to exercise individually or to go out for a walk with the person they live with.\u201d</p> <h2>Kim Jong-un \u2018could be sheltering from Covid-19\u2019 amid rumours over health and whereabouts</h2> <p>As rumours of Kim Jong-un\u2019s death <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-live-news-brazils-health-system-on-verge-of-collapse-medics-warn?page=with:block-5ea49bda8f08fa2bdcb1b706#block-5ea49bda8f08fa2bdcb1b706\">circulate on social media</a>, one news agency has suggested that he may be sheltering from Covid-19 in a North Korean resort town. On Friday, South Korean news agency Newsis said that a special train for Kim\u2019s use had been spotted by intelligence sources in the town of Wonsan.</p> <p>A Washington-based North Korea monitoring project called 38 North has captured satellite images that also appear to show a special train, possibly belonging to the North Korean leader, in Wonsan. Though the group said it was probably Kim Jong-un\u2019s train, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-live-news-brazils-health-system-on-verge-of-collapse-medics-warn?page=with:block-5ea49bda8f08fa2bdcb1b706#block-5ea49bda8f08fa2bdcb1b706\">Reuters has not been able to confirm</a> that independently, or whether he was in Wonsan.</p>",
  "<p>China has been accused of using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to take some bold and provocative actions, including expansions in the South China Sea, crackdowns on activists in Hong Kong and further detention of activists in the mainland. Some analysts have suggested Beijing is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security/china-rattles-sabres-as-world-battles-coronavirus-pandemic-idUSKBN2230GC\">sending a message that China\u2019s aggressive foreign policy is still business as usual</a>, or <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2020/04/same-as-it-ever-was-chinas-pandemic-opportunism-on-its-periphery/\">testing its adversaries for weaknesses</a>.</p> <h2>Rounding up activists</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong+protest\">frequent protests</a> that have rocked Hong Kong for months were already in a lull when the outbreak started, but amid fears of an epidemic in Hong Kong they have almost completely stopped. The Chinese government and its supportive Hong Kong counterparts are taking advantage of the break to try ensure they don\u2019t start up again.</p> <p>More than 7,000 people have been arrested on charges relating to the protest rallies, some of which drew millions to the street, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-arrested-on-charges-of-illegal-assembly\">arrests of senior figures in February</a> and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">again on Saturday</a> have drawn sharp rebuke. </p> <p>Martin Lee, the 81-year-old founder of Hong Kong\u2019s Democratic party, has said there will be more fatalities and protests if authorities try to pass anti-subversion laws \u2013 which would outlaw \u201csedition, subversion and the theft of state secrets\u201d \u2013 before the September legislature election. \u201cThe Communist party won\u2019t show any mercy\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/fresh-hong-kong-crackdown-will-result-in-deaths-says-democracy-leader-martin-lee\">he told the Guardian</a>. \u201cThey have already stated their stance.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/hong-kong-using-covid-19-crisis-as-golden-opportunity-for-crackdown-says-arrested-leader\">Veteran activist and politician Lee Cheuk Yan,</a> who was arrested in both roundups, said: \u201cThey are using this opportunity of the pandemic so we can\u2019t come out in the marches.\u201d</p> <p>The arrests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/us-and-uk-condemn-arrest-of-hong-kong-democracy-activists\">drew condemnation from around the world</a>, and China director at Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said the arrests of the 15 activists were \u201canother nail in the coffin of \u2018one country two systems\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Authorities maintained the action was about the rule of law, creating a deterrence, and securing the city before the protests started up again.</p> <h2>\u201cNon-release releases\u201d</h2> <p>After four-and-a-half years in prison for \u201csubversion\u201d, human rights lawyer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/china-quarantines-human-rights-lawyer-wang-quanzhang-400km-from-home\">Wang Quanzhang was released from a Chinese prison two weeks ago</a>. But he was immediately sent to compulsory quarantine in his home town of Jinan, not in Beijing where he lives with his wife and son.</p> <p>The US state department and human rights groups have called for Wang, jailed after the 2015 roundup of more than 300 human rights lawyers and legal associates, to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/us-urges-china-to-let-human-rights-lawyer-return-home-after-unjust-detention\">released from \u201cunjust detention\u201d</a> and allowed to return home.</p> <p>Poet and activist Li Bifeng was <a href=\"https://www.nchrd.org/2011/01/prisoner-of-conscience-li-bifeng/\">released on 7 April</a> after serving a 10-year sentence but forced into \u201cquarantine\u201d in a guesthouse in Sichuan province. Authorities refused to disclose his location to his family.</p> <p>The practice of \u201cnon-release releases\u201d of dissidents has been criticised by rights groups.</p> <h2>Further detentions</h2> <p>Police detained film maker and poet Chen Jiaping in early March, according to his wife. Chen had been making a documentary about legal scholar and activist Xu Zhiyong, who went missing in February and is believed to be held by police under a secretive detention system known as residential surveillance at a designated location.</p> <p>Zhao Huaiguo, the pastor of an underground house church in Hunan was detained on 14 March on charges of \u201cinciting subversion\u201d. Consumer rights activist Wang Qing, known for using China\u2019s open government information system to hold officials accountable, was charged alongside three other men for extortion and blackmail last year. In April, he was denied an appeal on his case.</p> <p>Three citizen journalists disappeared in Wuhan after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/li-zehuajournalist-wouldnt-stay-quiet-covid-19-coronavirus\">reporting on the outbreak</a>, Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/missing-wuhan-citizen-journalist-reappears-after-two-months\">Li resurfaced in the past week</a> with a video detailing his detention by police and forced quarantine.</p> <p>Numerous activists and lawyers remain in jail, despite international calls for their release. Veteran activist and founder of a human rights website, 64 Tianwang, Huang Qi was detained in November 2016, on suspicion of \u201cillegally leaking state secrets abroad.\u201d Last year he was jailed on a 12-year sentence.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said authorities have refused requests from his lawyers for documents, and disbarred two of them. Sichuan police have also harassed his mother, a woman in her eighties, including placing her under house arrest and sending government agents to live in her home, HRW said.</p> <p>\u201cWhile everyone\u2019s attention is on Covid-19, we should not let the Chinese government off the hook for their ongoing crackdown on human rights activists, lawyers and independent journalists,\u201d said Human Rights Watch China researcher, Yaqiu Wang.</p> <h2>One country, one system</h2> <p>While Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy semi-autonomy until 2047 before it is returned to Chinese rule, the past week has seen some suggest China is trying to bring that deadline forward.</p> <p>Last week Beijing\u2019s top organisations in the region, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) and the liaison office, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">weighed into domestic political arguments</a>, criticising pro-democracy legislators over filibustering tactics and creating a backlog of legislation.</p> <p>The office was accused of overreach and intruding into Hong Kong affairs in contravention of Hong Kong\u2019s mini constitution, the Basic Law, which guarantees non-interference.</p> <p>Beijing authorities claimed the protections in the Basic Law article didn\u2019t apply to them, and that the Central government exercised \u201cfull governance\u201d over Hong Kong.</p> <p>It came as the head of China\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong, Luo Huining, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/china-official-hong-kong-luo-huining-pushes-national-security-law\">called for long-shelved national security legislation to be introduced</a> as soon as possible to safeguard against threats to national security, like the protests.</p> <h2>South China Sea</h2> <p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has accused China of exploiting the world\u2019s focus on the virus with \u201cprovocative behaviour\u201d, including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-security-malaysia/australia-joins-u-s-ships-in-south-china-sea-amid-rising-tension-idUSKCN2240FS\">advancing its presence in the South China Sea.</a></p> <p>China claims ownership of much of the South China Sea, but this is disputed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Malaysia.</p> <p>State broadcaster CGTN<strong> </strong>said on Saturday that China had established administrative districts on the Paracel islands and Spratly islands, the site of overlapping ownership claims.</p> <p>Zhang Junshe, a senior research fellow at the People\u2019s Liberation Army naval military studies research institute, told China\u2019s Global Times the new districts would \u201cfulfil the responsibility of safeguarding our national sovereignty\u201d and \u201cbring convenience to residents on the islands and fishermen\u2019s lives\u201d.</p> <p>Vietnam\u2019s foreign ministry quickly accused China of having \u201cseriously violated its sovereignty\u201d, demanding it \u201cabolish its wrongful decisions\u201d.</p> <p>Last week a Chinese survey ship was seen tagging a Malaysian state oil company drillship, just north of Malaysia\u2019s exclusive economic zone, in disputed waters claimed by Vietnam and Malaysia.</p> <p>It also drew criticism from the US, but the Chinese foreign ministry accused US officials of smearing Beijing and said the vessel was conducting normal activities.</p> <p>US and Australian warships also arrived in the region this week.</p> <p>Vietnam also lodged a formal protest after a Chinese military ship rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel off the coast of the Paracels, in the second such confrontation in a year.</p> <h2>Buzzing Taiwan</h2> <p>China has also been <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3075526/taipei-says-chinese-military-aircraft-flew-night-exercise\">flying regular fighter patrols near Taiwan</a>, which China claims is part of its territory despite having not governed the island in modern times. In mid-March the People\u2019s Liberation Army sent warplanes across the median line of the Taiwan Strait, and briefly approached Taiwan. The move, which analysts said was at least partly to intimidate Taiwan, prompted Taiwan to scramble fighter planes to intercept.</p> <p>China is also <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/04/13/china-sends-aircraft-carrier-near-japan-taiwan-us-navy-struggles-coronavirus.html\">sending military flotillas</a> past Taiwan and Japan on a semi-regular basis. Last week a six-vessel strike group led by China\u2019s only aircraft carrier sailed through the Miyako Strait and past Taiwan, under watch by the Taiwanese and Japanese defence forces.</p> <p>In January, a military flotilla, again led by the aircraft carrier, passed through the straits of Taiwan. It didn\u2019t enter Taiwan\u2019s waters, but did cross its air defence identification zone.</p> <h2>Investing in India</h2> <p>Several countries <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-india-investments/india-toughens-rules-on-investments-from-neighbours-seen-aimed-at-china-idUSKBN2200LQ\">including India and Australia</a> have introduced new laws or regulations covering foreign investments amid concerns about Chinese acquisitions while nations and companies struggle during the pandemic.</p> <p>This month the People\u2019s Bank of China bought shares in HDFC, India\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, eventually obtaining more than 1%.</p> <p>Under the new laws in India, anyone from a country sharing a border with India needs government approval before any kind of investment, local media reported. While this included many nations, it has been seen as geared towards China, since it includes Hong Kong.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020. An earlier version said that China had never governed Taiwan. This has been corrected to say that it has not governed the island in modern times.</p>",

  "<p>The Club World Cup has never stimulated universal enthusiasm. \u201cThe whole case goes to show how undesirable such events are from a sporting point of view, and what a prostitution of titles they are,\u201d raged the <em>Edinburgh Evening News</em>, but that was 1895 and it wasn\u2019t talking about the soft-power festival of greed that, in the distant days before the virus, was supposed to be taking place in China in the summer of 2021.</p> <p>Rather it was talking about the first meeting of league winners of England and Scotland, of the match played 125 years ago on Monday, in which Sunderland became world champions.</p> <p>There had been two \u201cworld championships\u201d before but they, in theory at least, pitted cup winners against each other. As it turned out, in 1887, England\u2019s representatives were Preston North End, who had gone out in the FA Cup semi-final. They lost, 2-1, to Hibernian (although the Cup winners, Aston Villa, did beat Hibs 3-0 in a friendly).</p> <p>The title stayed in Scotland as Renton hammered West Brom the following year. And there it remained, uncontested, until in 1895 Hearts, flush with their first league success, invited Sunderland, who had just won a third English title in four years, to dispute the world crown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/04/the-english-game-netflix\">The English Game's few charms lie in the background, not centre stage | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hearts\u2019 success owed much to two new signings, the full-back pairing of James Mirk and Barney Battles, who implemented an offside trap so effective that Hearts conceded eight goals in 18 league matches that season, eight fewer than anybody else.</p> <p>Sunderland, meanwhile, were an aggressive, attacking side, one that had dominated English football since beating Aston Villa 7-2 in a friendly in 1890. That game had led the Villa chairman, William McGregor, to describe Sunderland as a team with a \u201ctalented man in every position\u201d and the \u201cTeam of All Talents\u201d duly became the first club from outside the north-west and Midlands to be admitted to the league later that year.</p> <p>If their remoteness \u2013 Burnley, 110 miles away, were their nearest rivals \u2013 hampered them on away trips, Sunderland reaped the benefits at home, losing three games at their Newcastle Road ground in their first six seasons in the league \u2013 and two of those in their first season. But even more crucially, they were situated a lot closer to Scotland than any other league club.</p> <p>Between the first international fixture in 1872 and 1888, England won two of 16 matches against Scotland. The Scottish game, exploring the potential of passing, was more advanced than England, where the outmoded dribbling and charging traditions lingered. By 1890, English football had learned its lesson, but Scotland remained the heartland of the passing game. Naturally, once clubs began, first under the counter and then, after 1885, legally, to pay players, Scottish players were in demand. Sunderland who, before being admitted to the league, had existed largely on a diet of friendlies, many of them against Scottish sides, were ideally placed to take advantage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/14/my-favourite-game-sunderland-v-chelsea-1992-fa-cup-replay\">My favourite game: Sunderland v Chelsea, 1992 FA Cup replay | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The traffic in players, understandably, was resented by Scottish fans, which made scouting a dangerous pursuit. For that reason Samuel Tyzack, a wealthy mine owner who, along with the shipbuilder Robert Turnbull, funded Sunderland\u2019s rise, used to don a dog collar and pretend to be a priest while on the trail of potential targets. He was evidently skilled in recruitment: every one of Sunderland\u2019s starting XI against Hearts was Scottish \u2013 as were all the Hearts players.</p> <p>So, too, were Sunderland\u2019s three major absentees, their captain, Hughie Wilson, whose long one-handed throw-ins caused such chaos they led to the law being changed, the winger John Scott, who was fit enough to serve as linesman, and the defender Andrew McCreadie. Hearts were also without two key players: the captain, Isaac Begbie, and their top-scorer, Johnny Walker.</p> <p>Despite that, and heavy drizzle, a record crowd of 12,000 had packed into Tynecastle by kick-off. They saw Hearts begin the brighter but be thwarted by a series of blocks from Sunderland\u2019s renowned goalkeeper, Ned Doig, who wore his trademark cap to disguise a receding hairline. Twice, though, the visitors struck from corners, first through the left-half Harry Johnston and then through the prolific John Campbell, who remains the club\u2019s fifth-highest goalscorer. It was 2-0 at half-time, by which point the crowd had swelled to 15,000.</p> <p>Hearts continued to dominate, and at last got their reward. The right-winger, Willie Taylor, pulled one back and Robert McLaren levelled with a deflected free-kick. A quick counter then left George Scott clear and, as Doig appealed fruitlessly for offside, the inside-right put Hearts ahead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/11/pivotal-pivatelli-how-random-events-helped-elevate-two-great-milan-sides\">Pivotal Pivatelli: how random events helped elevate two great Milan sides | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Sunderland\u2019s Jimmy-James-John-John-Jimmy frontline was also dangerous when it had space to run into \u2013 a feature of the organisation instilled by the former tobacconist Tom Watson, who was arguably the first manager in anything approaching the modern sense of the term \u2013 and Hearts kept attacking. Jimmy Millar levelled from Campbell\u2019s pass with 10 minutes to go. Jimmy Hannah led a counter after counter, one of which led a free-kick. Robert McNeill took it, and Campbell\u2019s glancing header put Sunderland ahead again. John Harvey rounded off a 5-3 win.</p> <p>The Scotsman, far more impressed than the Edinburgh Evening News, hailed a match \u201cfull of excitement and fast play\u201d, while the Sunderland Echo insisted Sunderland had proved themselves \u201cthe premier football team of the globe\u201d. But an ageing side finished fifth the following year and Watson left, lured away by Liverpool where he established their first title-winning side.</p> <p>What is perhaps most striking now is how familiar so many of the themes remain, 125 years on. The game was clearly thrilling, and yet there was unease, doubts about the influence of money, about the import and export of players, about fixtures arranged under the guise of a new competition but essentially to generate income.</p> <p>There is a sense of impermanence, too, of the transient nature of glory, as a great team reached the end of its cycle, undone in the end by the departure of a manager they had perhaps never fully appreciated as he sought new challenges and better prospects elsewhere.</p> <p>Football has got bigger and these issues are now played out on a global scale but the fundamental tension remains: this is a sport, about fair competition and excitement, but it is also a business, about generating revenue, buying a great team and burnishing the reputation of businessmen and their homes.</p>",
  "<p>It was the least fitting of finals: after a tournament that had featured a net-busting 106 goals in just 18 matches when the best players met there were just two in the final, shared between Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota, with the latter eventually winning after 68 impossibly tense, albeit sped-up minutes of golden-goal extra time. Still, after the events of the last few weeks the merest glimpse of the word \u201clive\u201d in the corner of a Sky Sports screen must have been enough to make action-starved fans quite emotional.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/11/esports-ride-crest-of-a-wave-as-figures-rocket-during-covid-19-crisis\">Esports ride crest of a wave as figures rocket during Covid-19 crisis | Scott Heinrich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that the games were being played on PlayStations was a drawback, but the action was almost frantic enough to make up for it and even if the goals were virtual they were created by actual footballers. The ePremier League Invitational started with 18 players and two celebrity hangers-on, and after four days of competition the decisive matches began at the nostalgia-inducing time of 3pm on a Saturday afternoon.</p> <p>In purely sporting terms, while obviously being more console-reliant than ideal, the competition did not want for excitement and upsets. Form was fickle: Norwich\u2019s Todd Cantwell was the pre-tournament favourite but he was thrashed 6-2 by Sheffield United\u2019s Lys Mousset, who was in turn thumped 5-2 by pleasingly full-match-kitted Jota in the quarter-finals.</p> <p>Chelsea\u2019s Reece James was thrashed 8-0 by Andr\u00e9 Gomes in round two, with the Everton midfielder adding insult to insult by insisting afterwards: \u201cI never play Fifa. Never. I didn\u2019t touch the PlayStation until maybe one week ago.\u201d Gomes went down 4-2 to Raheem Sterling in the next round, and Sterling then lost to Alexander-Arnold in a thrilling if lag-affected semi-final, the Liverpool player coming back from 2-0 down and riding quite a lot of luck to win 3-2 with another golden goal.</p> <p>There was interest beyond the action, with the tournament doubling as a pound-shop <em>MTV Cribs</em>, a corner-shop <em>Through the Keyhole</em>, except filmed by extraordinarily short and completely static cameramen: you got a peek inside the homes of the rich and famous, but from an absolutely terrible and largely unchanging viewpoint. Much of the d\u00e9cor we did manage to glimpse was unexceptional: Newcastle\u2019s Christian Atsu was the epitome of this, providing a camera angle that afforded prime viewing only of his chin, with a completely bare, white wall behind.</p> <p>This was probably wise, as any genuinely revealing decor was always likely to be seized upon by journalists desperate for things to be sarcastic about. Burnley\u2019s Dwight McNeil, for example, played in front of an arrangement of ragged-looking peacock feathers and a schmaltzy romantic art print in shades of brown, rust and ochre (the colours were such that an attempted image search returned thousands of photographs of laminate wood flooring), though as the 20-year-old still lives with his parents none of it was likely to be of his choosing. Elsewhere we learned that Leicester\u2019s Wilfred Ndidi has one of his own shirts framed in his living room, that Tottenham\u2019s Moussa Sissoko has a large photograph of himself on the wall, and that Everton\u2019s Gomes owns a sofa with really astonishingly deep seats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-esports-england-football-fifa-virtual-gaming\">Sancho v Rashford on Fifa: Shutdown gives esports mainstream moment | Paul MacInnes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His furniture would probably suit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/26/liverpool-right-back-playmaker-trent-alexander-arnold-leicester\">Alexander-Arnold</a>, who in both the literal and metaphorical senses was the most laidback person in the competition.

He wasn\u2019t kidding: at this stage the only clue that he wasn\u2019t actually unconscious was that his mouth was moving.

The most controversial moment of the tournament came in his earlier match against Wilfried Zaha, when he established a 4-3 lead with a goal that Zaha described as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s all about winning,\u201d fist-pumped Sterling. \u201cThat\u2019s the number-one rule when you go into a competition: do anything to win.\u201d</p> <p>Sadly Sterling couldn\u2019t do anything to stop Alexander-Arnold, while Jota stormed through to a 4-1 semi-final win over McNeil. Perhaps a McNeil victory in that one would have been more appropriate \u2013 he and Alexander-Arnold should have met on Saturday afternoon anyway, given that Liverpool would have been playing Burnley at real-world football had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/premier-league-clubs-discussing-early-end-to-season-amid-growing-concerns-health-safety-covid-19\">coronavirus not intervened</a> \u2013 but these are not ideal times and this was, all things considered, a pretty decent distraction from them.</p>",
  "<p>The global toll from Covid-19 passed 200,000 on Saturday, with over 2.8 million people infected, as the WHO warned against issuing \u201cimmunity passports\u201d because there is no evidence people who recovered from the disease are protected against a second infection.</p> <p>It took more than three months after the coronavirus first emerged for deaths from the disease to pass 100,000, a grim milestone that was reached on 10 April. It took just over two weeks for that toll to double, and worldwide the number of confirmed infections is creeping towards 3 million.</p> <p>Pressure is mounting on authorities to bring socially and economically costly lockdowns to an end, but most governments are acting only after they believe the virus is under control in their territory.</p> <p>India, Greece and Belgium were the latest countries to announce a tentative easing of restrictions, but said these first steps can be reversed if cases start to rise again.</p> <p>The Belgian prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, said it was \u201ctime to look to the future\u201d as she announced that outdoor sports will be permitted and certain shops including garden centres will be allowed to lift the shutters from 4 May.</p> <p>A week later, all shops will reopen and some school classes will recommence, with the wearing of masks will be mandatory on public transport. If the country has avoided a second wave of coronavirus infections, restaurants could open in June.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do (this) because the figures show that we were able to slow down the spread of Covid-19 in Belgium. But the virus hasn\u2019t disappeared yet. It\u2019s still present and dangerous for the population,\u201d Wilm\u00e8s said.</p> <p>In Greece reopening is expected from Monday 4 May, when small shops, hairdressers, barbers and beauticians will be to go back to work again. \u201cThe objective of the confinement measures is not to remain in a glass bowl,\u201d government spokesman Stelios Petsas said earlier this week. \u201cThe objective is to take back our lives.\u201d</p> <p>The centre right administration took a \u201chard and early\u201d approach to enforcing restrictions, amid fears of Greece\u2019s austerity-hit health system being quickly overwhelmed. As a result Greece, to date, has had a sum total of 2,490 confirmed coronavirus cases and 130 fatalities.</p> <p>However, Hong Kong\u2019s top epidemiologist has warned against easing lockdowns in Europe too soon, saying \u201cyou need a sledgehammer\u201d to bring down the rate of infections first.</p> <p>Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, told Der Spiegel that lockdowns will be \u201ca marathon, not a sprint\u201d, and that the world needs to learn to live with the coronavirus, tightening and easing restrictions as outbreaks emerge.</p> <p>\u201cContainment has failed everywhere,\u201d Leung said. \u201cWhat we need is suppression, or better: cycles of suppression and lift, probably many of them,\u201d he said. He added that measures needed to be tuned to the \u201csurge capacity\u201d of national health systems.</p> <p>One region that appears to have been relatively successful so far in containment efforts is Africa, with strict lockdowns across the continent apparently halting the spread of the virus and staving off a feared spike in infections.</p> <p>South Africa will begin lifting lockdown restrictions from 1 May although people will have to wear face masks in public when they go out. Nigerian state governors have also asked President Muhammadu Buhari to approve the compulsory use of face masks in public as confirmed cases rise.</p> <p>South and Central America by contrast are experiencing a significant crisis, with Brazil emerging as a major epidemic hotspot. Cases of Covid-19 are overwhelming hospitals, morgues and cemeteries, even as President Jair Bolsonaro insists it is a relatively minor disease.</p> <p>Medical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse, or already too overwhelmed to take any more patients, the AP reported.</p> <p>In Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, officials said a cemetery has been forced to dig mass graves because there have been so many deaths. Workers have been burying 100 corpses a day, triple the pre-virus average of burials.</p> <p>After global incredulity at US President Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that ingesting or injecting bleach could prevent or cure coronavirus, which he later disowned as \u201csarcasm\u201d, the search for cures or prophylactics continues.</p> <p>The French government is limiting the sale of products containing nicotine after reports from a Paris hospital that it may reduce the risk of catching the coronavirus.</p> <p>Described by the French health authorities as \u201cjust a hypothesis\u201d, clinical trials of nicotine patches are to be carried out, but in order to prevent people self-medicating a new decree declared that pharmacies were instructed to limit the sale of products containing nicotine - patches, chewing gum and lozenges - to one month\u2019s supply.</p> <p>As the international debate about the origins and spread of the virus continues, Reuters has reported that China sought to block a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>The report was eventually released, albeit just before the start of the weekend Europe time and with some criticism of the Chinese government rearranged or removed, a sign of the balancing act Brussels is trying to pull off as the coronavirus outbreak scrambles international relations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/brett-crozier-us-navy-seeks-to-reinstate-captain-demoted-over-covid-19\">Brett Crozier: US navy seeks to reinstate captain demoted over Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>   <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-leader-group-peddling-bleach-cure-lobbied-trump-coronavirus\">Revealed: leader of group peddling bleach as coronavirus 'cure' wrote to Trump this week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In other coronavirus developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/brett-crozier-us-navy-seeks-to-reinstate-captain-demoted-over-covid-19\">The US navy is seeking to reinstate the fired captain of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt</a>, whose crew hailed him as their hero for risking his job to safeguard their lives from coronavirus, officials have said.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Nearly 60 new cases of coronavirus infections have been confirmed in Nagasaki among crew members of an Italian cruise ship docked there for repairs, Japanese domestic media has reported.

(There\u2019s little real about it, I should add.) YouTube said it had no truck with \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and did the same.</p> <p>They weren\u2019t serious. If they had been, they would have banned Icke and his imitators. As it was, Facebook and YouTube did not say they could no longer tolerate Icke on their platforms. They gave him the aura of being a free speech martyr by removing one interview, which he gratefully <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB4TZ8vMFuE\">exploited</a>, then allowed him to carry on as before. At the time of writing, close to 500,000 had watched a recent Icke video entitled \u201cIs There a Virus?\u201d that YouTube had not taken down. Icke\u2019s jowls bubble with suppressed fury. \u201cThey\u201d were \u201credesignating\u201d deaths from flu and from 5G waves as deaths from Covid-19, he explains.

The legacies of religious, fascist and communist antisemitism are invisible forces propelling them forward to the irresistible conclusion that only one people had the occult power to fool and impoverish the whole wide world without anyone except the wised-up Icke and his kind noticing. Who are his \u201cthey\u201d? Where can we find \u201cthem\u201d? They are the 1%, Icke explains. Specifically, an \u201cultra-Zionist billionaire\u201d.</p> <p>I spoke to Google, the owner of YouTube, and asked why, if it meant what it said, it had not closed Icke down. Apparently most Icke content was still within its guidelines and would not be censored, I was told, an answer that leads us into a swamp.</p> <p>I can\u2019t think of a subject more saturated with dishonesty than freedom of speech. Opponents say it does not matter if a social media platform or a university bans speakers. Private organisations deciding for themselves who they wish to be associated with cannot be compared to state censors. They refuse to acknowledge that if a feminist academic is deemed transphobic and cannot talk in universities, there are precious few other venues open to her. Nor that many public figures are heard on social media or not heard at all. In the past decade, to cite the case of an almost forgotten figure, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/milo-yiannopoulos-nazi-salutes-video-karaoke-richard-spencer-white-nationalists-karaoke-bar-a7987486.html\">the far-right fop</a> Milo Yiannopoulos was a social media celebrity feted and hated in equal measure.

The liberal, as distinct from the libertarian, argument is that only speech that directly incites crime should be prohibited, a demagogue whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment outside a mosque, for instance. Since the 1970s supposed \u201cliberals\u201d have wanted offence to be included as a harm. No one should deny that words are weapons that can hurt more than a blow. Unfortunately, no one can measure the psychic wounds that an offended person feels with the accuracy of a doctor measuring physical wounds on a victim of crime. The woolliness of their \u201chate speech\u201d laws all but guarantees that they will punish the innocent.</p> <p>Yet, in the case of Icke, there is no need for debates about whether the harm is real or whether it is just hurt feelings. Knuckle-dragging fantasists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/06/at-least-20-uk-phone-masts-vandalised-over-false-5g-coronavirus-claims\">physically attacked phone masts</a>. Daniel Allington and his colleague Nayana Dhavan at King\u2019s College London have shown that Ickean conspiracy theories pose <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/127048253/Allington_and_Dhavan_2020.pdf\">a physical risk to public health</a>. Conspiracists put their own lives and, crucially, the lives of those around them at risk. Because their gurus have persuaded them that health advice is a giant lie, they see no need to stay at home, wash their hands or observe social distancing. YouTube and the social media companies are complicit, because they want the audience and revenue that crank celebs bring.</p> <p>They can pocket it because of a legal absurdity. Television broadcasts are regulated. Last week, Ofcom <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/features-and-news/david-icke-and-eamonn-holmes-decision\">sanctioned a tiny TV station</a> called London Live because it broadcast Icke \u201ccasting doubt on the motives behind official health advice to protect the public from the virus\u201d. Yet it has no power to regulate YouTube when it broadcasts Icke saying that health workers and governments were responsible for deception on a supernatural scale.</p> <p>Parliament should have intervened in 2016 when the extent of Russian manipulation of social media was made painfully clear. There is a stronger argument for forcing the tech companies to live by their pious words now that so many are suffering. Liberals should always defend freedom of speech.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global confirmed death toll nears 200,000</h2> <p>According to researchers at <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, at least 199,874 people are confirmed to have died worldwide, while at least 2.84 million are known to have been infected.</p> <p>The figures for infections are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. Death toll figures are also controversial, with some countries reporting deaths as confirmed Covid-19 cases on the basis of symptoms and in the absence of a positive test, while others are not including them.</p> <h2>UK hospital Covid-19 death toll passes 20,000</h2> <p>Britain has become the fifth country in the world to reach the grim milestone of exceeding 20,000 coronavirus-related deaths.</p> <p>Government figures released on Saturday showed that a further 813 people died in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the country\u2019s total to 20,319. These figures do not include the thousands of more deaths known to have taken place in care homes.</p> <p>It comes almost six weeks after the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said that keeping the toll under 20,000 would be \u201ca good outcome in terms of where we would hope to get\u201d.</p> <h2>South Africans must wear face masks after lockdown eases</h2> <p>The South African government has ordered citizens to wear face masks from 1 May when coronavirus lockdown restrictions will begin to be eased.</p> <p>\u201cIt is going to be mandatory to use a cloth mask as you step out of your home,\u201d the traditional affairs minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, told a press conference in Pretoria. She added that people could use a scarf or T-shirt if they do not have a mask. South Africa has been on lockdown since 27 March.</p> <h2>Far right hijack coronavirus crisis to push agenda and boost support</h2> <p>Far-right groups in the UK, US and EU are exploiting the coronavirus crisis to push their anti-minority agendas and win new support, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/far-right-hijack-coronavirus-crisis-to-push-agenda-and-boost-support\">Jamie Doward reports.</a> A report by the Zinc Network, <a href=\"https://zincnetwork.com/\">a communications agency</a> that tracks disinformation and propaganda, suggests there has been a clear pivot among far-right movements to \u201cutilise the pandemic to bring new relevancy, attention and support for their key grievances\u201d.</p> <h2>Doctors and nurses in Pakistan launch hunger strike over lack of PPE</h2> <p>Dozens of doctors and nurses in Pakistan have launched a hunger strike over a lack of protective masks and other equipment for treating patients with Covid-19. More than 150 doctors in Pakistan have tested positive for coronavirus and several have died, according to the Young Doctors Association in Punjab, the country\u2019s worst-hit province.</p> <p>Salman Haseeb, head of the Punjab\u2019s Grand Health Alliance, said about 30 doctors and nurses in Punjab were on hunger strike. \u201cWe do not intend on stopping until the government listens to our demands.

  "<p>In December 2006, the Indonesian authorities refused to hand over samples of the bird flu virus without guarantees that it would benefit from any vaccine produced from them. Amid the swine flu outbreak in 2009, the Australian government ordered a vaccine manufacturer to meet its demand before fulfilling orders overseas. That November, after several rich nations had secured vaccines, officials from the World Health Organization aired concerns that disaster could lie ahead.</p> \n<p>\u201cThings would be much worse if the pandemic had been more severe, and it would be more difficult to create some fairness in the distribution of vaccine,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2009/11/challenge-getting-swine-flu-vaccine-poor-nations#\">Marie-Paule Kieny</a>, the then head of the WHO\u2019s initiative for vaccine research. \u201cGovernments might be less inclined to share the vaccine that they have.\u201d</p> \n<p>With vaccines seen as one of the few real routes out of the coronavirus crisis, fears of \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d are already increasing. Each step of creating, testing and mass-producing a vaccine is an epic challenge \u2013 but the political and ethical decisions around its subsequent distribution pose another. Governments, including in the UK, are being questioned about how they will get to the front of the queue. How will any eventual vaccine be shared out? Who decides? Will supplies go to the highest bidder? Are rich nations buying up potential vaccines already? And what will stop governments from simply seizing vaccines made in their country?</p> \n<p>According to experts and industry, it will take at least a year to vaccinate the world from the moment vaccines become available. That\u2019s a 12-month queue, if things go well \u2013 after a vaccine is found. \u201cThe reality is that there is no process established for this,\u201d says Steven Jones, a Canadian member of a team that created a successful Ebola vaccine.</p> \n<p>The potential problems have been spotted. On Friday, a parade of world leaders, charity bosses and industry chiefs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/us-stays-away-as-world-leaders-agree-action-on-covid-19-vaccine\">including French president Emmanuel Macron</a>, German chancellor Angela Merkel and philanthropist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/melinda-gates\">Melinda Gates</a>, united to back a WHO initiative to ensure any treatments and vaccines are shared equitably around the world.

However, some are blunt about the hopes of centrally-managed global cooperation. \u201cCan you imagine the WHO telling Donald Trump that he can only have one tenth of the vaccine that he wants,\u201d says David Salisbury, the former director of immunisation at the Department of Health. \u201cSurely, he\u2019s going to look to see who can make a vaccine in the quantities needed in America, and he\u2019s not going to let the vaccine out. That will happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jones is also pessimistic. \u201cThe WHO can try to take a leadership role but they are in a difficult situation. They can try to apply moral and ethical guidelines.\u201d</p> \n<p>UK ministers, too, have already been under pressure to guarantee that Britain will benefit first from vaccines discovered here. Matt Hancock has said he is \u201censuring the UK is both contributing to and benefiting from efforts around the globe\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is inevitable that some nations will try to use \u201cadvance purchase agreements\u201d to secure supplies, paying potential vaccine producers on the off-chance that their product works. Such agreements provide funds for research, but there is no system for policing their impact on fair distribution.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, a vaccine queue is inevitable. Making billions of doses, rather than millions, adds another order of difficulty. Hence, Weller told a briefing last week: \u201cFor at least a year after the Covid-19 vaccine becomes available, it is very likely that there\u2019ll be insufficient supply to meet the global demand of billions of doses.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"Thomas%20Breuer,%20chief%20medical%20officer%20of%20GSK%20Vaccines\">Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines</a>, paints an even starker picture.

Peters presents beautifully, and I forgive him for being the standard \u201dreads out what\u2019s in front of you\u201d actor host, because he has a long connection with UK music (through <em>Five Guys Named Moe</em>), because he was Lester Freamon in <em>The Wire</em> and because, well, he does his job so well. </p> <p>But, as ever, the true credit should go to the producer; this time, Tom Woolfenden from Loftus Media. It was Woolfenden who found the relevant archives, whether that be Neneh Cherry talking in 2011 about her father, the jazz musician Don Cherry; Martin Simpson, in 2005, explaining the Moroccan way of tuning a guitar; John Craven doing a <em>Newsround</em> round-up of the 1975 decolonisation of Suriname. And it was Woolfenden who did the interviews: with Johny Pitts, the British writer of <em>Afropean</em>; Surinamese flute player Ronald Snijders in the Netherlands; Patrick Bebey, son of Cameroonian guitarist and composer Francis Bebey; Janet Kay, of Silly Games fame\u2026 So many excellent interviews: informative and detailed, well edited, revelatory. They underpin these shows.</p> <p>The story, this series, is of post-colonialism, and how the people of former British, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch and Belgian colonies used their newly given freedom (after the second world war, many colonial countries waived restrictions on visitors from colonies) to come to Europe. Many stayed. And over and over again, those that did stay explain how it\u2019s this consequent mix of cultures that results in their brilliant music. They make us understand that it\u2019s not just the bumping up of different musical techniques, but how the new arrivals\u2019 optimism and hope were muddied and muddled with the racism that they encountered, and how they eventually reclaimed their musical heritage to show it off to Europe. It\u2019s this musical melange that creates the gorgeous soundtrack that we hear throughout the shows. And, in the background, the political culture is creaking. General Franco and Eric Clapton make passing appearances, as baddies.</p> <p>A lot of work has gone into this series and it shows. When a flamenco dancer walks into a Spanish studio, we hear her footsteps; her voice is beautifully recorded. The levels of music and speech are impeccable, the sound moving from ear to ear in your headphones, but remaining clear at all times. It\u2019s all lovely stuff. There\u2019s a list of the tracks played on the show\u2019s website: the BBC should make it into a playlist and put it up on Sounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca85b382f4f6fed2efb938fdac6d3cc245dd294b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca85b382f4f6fed2efb938fdac6d3cc245dd294b/0_0_3008_1960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil MacGregor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil MacGregor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a different angle on colonialism, Neil MacGregor\u2019s classic series <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nrtd2/broadcasts/upcoming\">The History of the World In 100 Objects</a></strong> is being repeated, reassuringly, on Radio 4. We\u2019re just in the early stages \u2013 last week we had objects 6 through to 10 \u2013 so a nice long way to go. Colonialism is relevant throughout the series, of course, with MacGregor\u2019s none-more-educated, mellifluous voice telling the stories of far-flung objects that somehow, through Britain\u2019s immensely mixed history, have ended up in London.</p> <p>An interesting new documentary series on Resonance FM: <strong><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/prison-bag-epiosde-1-15-april-2020/\">Prison </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/prison-bag-epiosde-1-15-april-2020/\">Bag</a></strong>. Josie Bevan, who writes a blog with the same name, is our host: she\u2019s telling the story of what it\u2019s like to be a prison wife. Middle-class and a bit naive, Bevan confesses that, after her husband Rob was sentenced to nine years (for tax fraud), she expected a phone call from someone \u2013 social services? The police? The prison system? \u2013 asking her if she was OK. There was no phone call. There is not much help for anyone wanting to support their partner in prison. \u201cI spend my life trying to get <em>into</em> prison,\u201d she says, early on in the programme.</p> <p>Bevan talks to Lisa, a university lecturer who has experience of addiction and prison. They are different, but connected. \u201cI talk about this stuff in front of a lot of people,\u201d says Lisa, \u201cbut I feel\u2026 overwhelmed and tearful.

  "<p>Far-right movements are exploiting the coronavirus crisis to push their anti-minority agendas and win new support.</p> <p>A report by Zinc Network, <a href=\"https://zincnetwork.com/\">a communications agency</a> that tracks disinformation and propaganda, suggests there has been a clear pivot among far-right groups in the UK, EU and US to \u201cutilise the pandemic to bring new relevancy, attention and support for their key grievances\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence we\u2019ve uncovered shows that far-right groups in the UK are using Covid-19 to promote a British form of fascism,\u201d said Louis Brooke, executive director of research and strategy at Zinc Network.</p> <p>\u201cTheir tactics are sophisticated, and their activity is becoming more difficult to monitor, partly due to the use of private messaging apps to share disinformation and propaganda. We\u2019re seeing the dissemination of material claiming that immigrants spread coronavirus, and that authoritarian regimes outperform western liberal democracies in tackling the health crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Zinc Network said British far-right groups such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/28/britain-first-far-right-members-5000-have-joined-tories\">Britain First</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/11/how-britains-extremist-bloggers-helped-the-alt-right-go-global\">Knights Templar International</a>, as well as the BNP\u2019s former leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/01/nick-griffin-expelled-from-bnp\">Nick Griffin</a>, have used the crisis to promote themselves as supporters of the community during the lockdown. Griffin has posted images of himself on social media distributing food parcels.</p> <p>Zinc Network, which in the past has attracted scrutiny for its work promoting the Home Office\u2019s anti-radicalisation strategy, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97976/prevent-strategy-review.pdf\">Prevent</a>, studied social media posts, photos, videos, journals, official records and media reports to produce the analysis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Their tactics are sophisticated and their activity is becoming more difficult to monitor</p> <footer> <cite>Louise Brooke, Zinc Network</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It said one key narrative being pushed by the far right is that the spread of coronavirus is the consequence of illegal immigration. Allied to this is the claim that nations with tightly-controlled borders are better prepared to deal with the pandemic. Another is the premise that modern liberal states are on the verge of collapse, and that their fall can be accelerated through armed action or by a major crisis.</p> <p>The promotion of survivalist material by far-right groups is also becoming a trend. Zinc says neo-Nazi publisher Arktos has been publishing updated and expanded editions of far-right survivalist texts.</p> <p>A favoured tactic among far-right groups is to put fake documents into circulation, designed to look like real medical or government communications. According to Zinc\u2019s monitoring, far-right Telegram channels have been instrumental in circulating a fake scan of a positive Covid-19 test for the former vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/joe-biden-donald-trump-delay-election\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <p>The same channels have also been distributing government pandemic response documents with a view to helping would-be attackers plan their actions.</p> <p>Some far-right organisations are using the crisis to impersonate other groups, Zinc claims. Fake Extinction Rebellion flyers have been found in several cities in the UK proclaiming \u201cCorona is the cure \u2013 humans are the disease\u201d.</p> <p>Most of the leaflets condemn immigration, with some calling for the public to \u201clearn about the JQ\u201d \u2013 the \u201cJewish question\u201d.

  "<p>The US shale industry was forecast to deliver record high oil production this year.

  "<p>Repeat after me: there is no magic bullet for getting us through this pandemic. And smartphone-based proximity-sensing is definitely not that bullet, though it might be useful if two conditions are met. One is that it\u2019s perceived by citizens to be trustworthy and protects their privacy; the other is that it\u2019s deployed in conjunction with a massive increase in state capacity for testing and treatment. Neither condition will be easy to satisfy.</p> <p>There are clear indications that the UK government is now actively considering use of the technology as a way of easing the lockdown. If this signals an outbreak in Whitehall of <a href=\"http://bostonreview.net/books-ideas/whats-wrong-technological-fixes\">tech \u201csolutionism</a>\u201d \u2013 the belief that for every problem there is a technological answer \u2013 then we should be concerned. Tech solutions often do as much harm as good, for example, by increasing social exclusion, lacking accountability and failing to make real inroads into the problem they are supposedly addressing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/france-apple-google-privacy-contact-tracing-coronavirus\">France urges Apple and Google to ease privacy rules on contact tracing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The technology involved, though complex, in essence provides a way of automating what has been a way of dealing with plagues since at least the 1600s: find those infected, lock them away or treat them and then trace everyone with whom they\u2019ve been in contact and quarantine them too. This is a very labour-intensive task that is not feasible in a society such as the UK\u2019s. But many smartphones have low-energy Bluetooth sensors that automatically register the proximity of other similarly equipped phones, while most smartphones also log their location using GPS signals. So in principle we could use smartphones to do contact-tracing on a large scale.</p> <p>That\u2019s the principle. In practice, there are various ways of using these capabilities in the Covid-19 context. Centralised models involve phones equipped with an app to relay their data, supposedly anonymised, to a central server run by a government health authority. This may make things simple for the government, but it\u2019s a nightmare in terms of state surveillance especially if the authorities try to make installation of the app compulsory.</p> <p>Decentralised models involve keeping most of the data on your phone and only broadcasting to all the phones to which you\u2019ve been close via a secure relay server if you\u2019ve been diagnosed. All of your contacts\u2019 phones will then inform their owners that they\u2019ve been in contact with a diagnosed case of Covid-19. And of course all of the communications implied by this are encrypted by default. Because the individuals involved are notified immediately as soon as someone in their proximity is diagnosed, this method shortens exposure risk and enables health providers to suppress the virus rapidly. It restores agency to the individual, lessens the risks of state surveillance and better protects users\u2019 privacy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Smartphone contact-tracing would mark a step-change in state surveillance capabilities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You don\u2019t need to be a rocket scientist, let alone an IT expert, to realise that there are legions of devils in the details. (Harvard\u2019s Safra Center for Ethics has a <a href=\"https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/white_paper_5_outpacing_the_virus_final.pdf\">very good guide</a> to some of them.) Who tells your phone that you\u2019ve been diagnosed, for example? Given the possibility that \u2013 in a post-lockdown scenario \u2013 individuals with Covid-19 might be subjected to stigma, harassment or dismissal, they might be understandably reluctant to broadcast the fact.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the problem that not everyone has a smartphone, even though it\u2019s commonly supposed in tech circles that they do. The pandemic has revealed that a significant minority of the population (mostly older people) still relies on olde-worlde feature phones. Moreover, it turns out that not all smartphones are created equal: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/2-billion-phones-cannot-use-google-and-apple-contract-tracing-tech/\">one estimate</a> is that 50% of all smartphones can\u2019t use the proximity-sensing systems being developed by Apple and Google. Given that any proximity-sensing system would probably have to cover at least 60% of the population to be truly effective, does this mean that Matt Hancock is going to be giving out Huawei handsets like Smarties to the Nokia-using poor?</p> <p>I could go on but you get the point. The problem with magic bullets is that they sometimes miss their target. The biggest issue of all with smartphone contact-tracing, though, is that it would mark a step-change in state surveillance capabilities. Such a momentous decision cannot be left to Matt Hancock and his colleagues in their Downing Street bunker. This is a central point in a <a href=\"https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/exit-through-the-app-store-how-the-uk-government-should-use-technology-to-transition-from-the-covid-19-global-public-health-crisis/\">landmark review</a> of the issue conducted by UK research group the Ada Lovelace Institute. A decision to deploy mandatory proximity-sensing technology, says the institute, is too important to be left to technocrats. There has to be proper parliamentary scrutiny and primary legislation with real sunset clauses. No fudging with orders in council by frightened ministers. I agree. If we get this wrong, not only will we not succeed in easing the lockdown, but we might also be kissing goodbye to the shrivelled democracy we still possess.

  "<p>Supergiant oil tankers are floating outside the world\u2019s largest shipping ports with enough oil to meet the world\u2019s daily demand twice over. Only months ago these vessels criss-crossed the globe laden with up to 2 million barrels. Today they stand motionless and bloated with crude that no one will buy.</p> <p>The record volume of stranded crude cargo illustrates a deepening crisis in the global oil industry. Demand for oil has fallen so severely, and at such pace, that there is little space left on land to store the crude made redundant by the coronavirus crisis. At least 160 million barrels are now<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/19/supertankers-drafted-in-to-store-glut-of-crude-oil-coronavirus\" title=\"\"> stored at sea,</a> outside global shipping ports from Singapore to Suffolk and along the US gulf coast as oil traders brace for storage facilities to reach capacity imminently.</p> <p>Market forecasts suggest that the world\u2019s conventional oil storage \u2013 which can hold about 3.4 billion barrels \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/oil-price-may-fall-to-10-a-barrel-as-world-runs-out-of-storage-space\" title=\"\">will be filled to its limits within the next month</a>. In the meantime, oil traders are turning to alternative storage options: supergiant tankers, rail freight carriages and even underground salt caverns have become sought-after havens to stash millions of barrels of surplus crude.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like high noon on oil markets,\u201d says Norbert R\u00fccker, an analyst at private banking group Julius Baer. \u201cStorage close to capacity limits, rapidly filling up, creates a blistering tension filled with fear about an overflowing oil market.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-24T17:35:09/embed.html\" data-alt=\"WTI price chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-24T17:35:09/embed.html\">WTI price chart</a> </figure>  <p>The market fear has driven global oil prices to lows not seen since 1999. The price of crude for delivery next month in the US oil market, known as the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/over-a-barrel-how-oil-prices-dropped-below-zero\" title=\"\">turned negative for the first time in history</a> last week. Oil producers without access to local storage facilities were forced to pay buyers to take their supplies as market prices fell to almost -$40 a barrel.</p> <p>Chris Midgley, head of analytics at data provider S&amp;P Global Platts, believes the US\u2019s largest oil storage facilities at Cushing in Oklahoma are already two-thirds full and the remaining space has been bought by oil traders and brokers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably the same case for storage around the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s where we come to floating storage. For many in the oil industry, the only option is to get a ship and put oil in it for one to two months. If you can\u2019t find a buyer or a ship, you\u2019re left with the last option to shut in [suspend] production.\u201d</p> <p>In the US and Canada, where the cost of transporting oil from landlocked oilfields is higher than in regions with offshore rigs, oil producers have taken the difficult decision to shutter their wells.</p> <p>There are heavy costs involved in shutting down production, and there is a chance that a forced shutdown could cause irreversible damage to oil wells, which may not produce the same volumes once they are restarted. The risk of a sudden shutdown must be weighed against the risk of continuing to pump crude.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, the oil market may have already passed a tipping point, according to analysts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A major shock is brewing \u2026 unless there is a firmer response, we will soon be discussing the greatest energy crisis in history</p> <footer> <cite>Bj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets, RystadEnergy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The coming weeks are expected to bring the most severe overhang of crude ever seen.

Not having enough storage is not only a theoretical problem but a practical one.

A major shock is brewing for producers and unless there is a firmer response from their side to voluntarily slash output, we will soon be discussing the greatest energy crisis in history.\u201d</p>",

Last week, Adam Tschorn, deputy fashion editor of the <em>LA Times</em> , <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2020-04-17/working-from-home-regular-work-wardrobe-dress-up\">wrote an impassioned plea</a> against the rise of the tracksuit bottom in our work-from-home environment. \u201cPlease, can we put away those sweatpants, ratty, grey, decades-old collegiate sweatshirts and obscure minor league baseball caps, and start our workdays looking like we deserve the pay we\u2019re lucky enough to be earning while the world around us burns?\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps he was recalling the last time sweatpants were popular \u2013 in the early 2000s, with the rise of brands like Juicy Couture, and celebrities such as Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Amy Poehler (as the naff \u201ccool mom\u201d in <em>Mean Girls</em>) and Paris Hilton (she<a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2019/10/29/paris-hilton-says-she-owns-100-juicy-couture-tracksuits/\"> infamously said</a> she owned 100 pairs), wearing them as loungewear.</p> <p>The popularity of the jogging bottom has prompted questions about our post-coronavirus workwear: will we be trading our pencil skirts and chinos for something with an elasticated waist? \u201cI was wondering that myself,\u201d says Sofia Prantera, the designer behind label Aries Arise, whose No Problemo tie-dyed tracksuits have become a cult favourite. </p> <p>\u201cI think there are two outcomes: \u2018I never want to see sweatpants ever again\u2019 or \u2018how will I ever be comfortable in fixed-waist trousers?\u2019 Hopefully for us the latter.\u201d </p> <p>Rees says: \u201cWe\u2019ve moved a long way (forward) with office attire. There\u2019s absolutely a place for them in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>But, cautions David Telfer head of design at <a href=\"https://info.sunspel.com/latest-from-sunspel/made-in-britain-the-road-trip\">Sunspel</a>, \u201cit is about what you feel socially comfortable going to work in\u201d.</p> <p>Are joggers indicative of a bigger change? A hitherto previously unexplored era where all areas of our lives are inextricably mixed? Kim Toffoletti, associate professor of sociology at Deakin University in Australia, thinks so. \u201cTheir popularity at the moment might precipitate a move away from more formal attire, an emphasis on looking \u2018professional\u2019 at work, and more flexibility between boundaries of living and working,\u201d she says.</p>",

  "<p>Right now, Bruce Kerr is fretting about the shape of a certain curve \u2013 but not the one relating to the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>Kerr is an asparagus farmer in east Suffolk.

Admittedly, there is still time. The main fruit and vegetable picking season does not begin until late May but the clock is ticking.</p> <p>A spokesman for Angus Growers, a soft fruit producer on Scotland\u2019s east coast, the heart of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/scottish-fruit-farmers-recruit-thousands-locals-save-harvest\">country\u2019s berry industry</a>, said its recruitment drive has received more than 4,700 applications from 2,714 individual applicants. But, to date, only 141 had accepted a job and were in post, a conversion rate of around 5%.</p> <p>\u201cWe do appreciate that berry picking is very hard work,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very physical job, and due to the nature of the industry, skill and speed are required in order to harvest berries quickly and efficiently once the fruit ripens. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/british-workers-reject-fruit-picking-jobs-as-romanians-flown-in-coronavirus\">reasons given for declining the roles</a> are varied, but include the long hours, early starts, and the fact that these roles are contracted for a specific period of weeks which are not flexible.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://hopslaboursolutions.com/feed-the-nation/\">Feed the Nation</a>, a drive to recruit British-based workers launched by the Alliance of Ethical Labour Providers, received nearly 50,000 applications of interest.

Many of his workers from eastern Europe arrived over the winter and avoided the lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cBut talking to the rest of the industry, it\u2019s a little bit mixed,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cA lot of people live in the south-east and if you are a sous chef you might think maybe this is all right for a few months. If you live in some of the more rural areas, then maybe they don\u2019t have access to the same number of people.\u201d</p> <p>Other farmers face a different problem: their markets have disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cWe normally harvest between 10 and 12 tonnes per year,\u201d said Richard Morritt, who has been growing asparagus at Sand Hutton in Yorkshire for 21 years.</p> <p>\u201cMost of that harvest goes into the restaurant and hospitality trade. With a potential drop in sales, I may have to think about harvesting to what the demand is from my customers. Some fields I may not harvest this year. At least with asparagus, it being a perennial crop, the spears will develop into fern and grow out for this season. It will still be there next year to harvest again. If I\u2019m standing still this year, it\u2019s been a great year.\u201d</p>",

Although I know many other people have already recommended this, resistance is futile. I can only watch one episode a day, as it\u2019s like eating a very, very rich cake. In these very crazy scary times, it depicts an equally intense, yet different, universe. It so fills my attention that, for an hour a day, the virus is pushedto the back of my mind.</p> <h2><strong>6.

Paradoxically, viewing the vibrant painted images from inside the tomb made me think not of death, but of beauty \u2013 farming, fishing, wildlife \u2013 things which we are missing and becoming more mindful of. In depicting their imagined afterlife, the artists have succeeded in creating a world in which you think about life and living fully, rather than loss and tragedy.</p>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s wildlife may be thriving during the current lockdown but its long-term future is looking bleak, according to leading conservation organisations.</p> <p>Nikki Williams, head of campaigns at the Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThe current crisis means nature is losing out, because many organisations are having to scale back important work caring for special places, which they usually do with the vital help of thousands of volunteers.\u201d</p> <p>Just one example, she said, was the continual battle with the invasive plant <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/himalayan-balsam\">Himalayan balsam</a>, which smothers riverbanks and out-competes native wildflowers. If left to its own devices over the summer, this plant will be even harder to eradicate next year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, valuable habitats, such as lowland heaths in southern England and East Anglia, need continual management to ensure they do not turn back into scrub, reducing the opportunities for specialised creatures such as the Dartford warbler, sand lizard and smooth snake.</p> <p>While staff and volunteers are unable to do the majority of conservation work, they are still able to carry out surveys, for example of breeding birds, many of which are run by the British Trust for Ornithology.</p> <p>One noticeable phenomenon of late has been the daily chorus of birdsong, especially in the heart of our cities.</p> <p>According to the BTO\u2019s Paul Stancliffe, the current lack of noise might indeed be helping singing birds to be heard by potential mates and rivals, thus increasing their breeding success. He said we wouldn\u2019t know if that was the case unless crucial survey work continued. This is why the BTO has offered free membership of its <a href=\"https://www.bto.org/our-science/projects/gbw?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn6CSqMOB6QIVkuvtCh36YAjnEAAYASAAEgIlmfD_BwE\">Garden BirdWatch scheme</a>, signing up more than 5,000 new observers, many of whom have urban gardens, whose birdlife often goes under-recorded.</p> <p>Mathew Frith, of the London Wildlife Trust, said: \u201cMany of our birds, such as the robin, wren, chiffchaff, skylark and meadow pipit, nest on or close to the ground, and so are easily flushed by dogs. With parks so much quieter than usual, these species may do well this spring.\u201d</p> <p>The RSPB also notes that the lack of people visiting the seaside will help shore-nesting species such as little terns and ringed plovers, which are especially prone to being disturbed by holidaymakers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"157a5f8de1ca1e792f274a4b12913ee652e81a68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/157a5f8de1ca1e792f274a4b12913ee652e81a68/0_176_5271_3163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People pass a herd of fallow deer grazing on the lawns of a housing estate in Harold Hill in east London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grazing fallow deer are unfazed by passers-by in Harold Hill, east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as the possible benefits to birds of the current reduction in noise and disturbance, some animals also appear to be flourishing.

Any short-term gains made by wildlife may vanish once people, traffic and other aspects of daily life returned to some kind of \u201cnormal\u201d, but if our habits do permanently change, as many people are hoping, nature might reap the benefit.</p> <p>But that will also depend on pushing through recent shifts in government policy, as the Wildlife Trusts\u2019 Williams points out. \u201cWhen the crisis ends, wildlife will still be in decline. The only way to ensure its recovery is to create strong agriculture and environment bills, which put nature, and all the benefits it brings, at the heart of policy and our daily lives.\u201d</p>",

These rallies, orchestrated by a network of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/far-right-coronavirus-protests-restrictions\">far</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/far-right-coronavirus-protests-restrictions\"> right and extremist groups</a>, have also seen rightwingers hold up signs with pro-choice slogans like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/protesters-wave-signs-branded-dumb-ignorant-1498873\">my body, my choice</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Do these protesters not understand the irony here? Do they not understand how hypocritical it is to fight against a woman\u2019s right to choose while simultaneously fighting for their own right to do whatever they like? Do they not understand how you can not possibly be \u201cpro-life\u201d if you\u2019re flouting lockdown laws to participate in dense protests that could cause a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/us-protests-lockdown-coronavirus-cases-surge-warning\">surge in coronavirus cases</a>?</p> <p>It\u2019s always been clear than anti-abortion extremists aren\u2019t actually pro-life, they\u2019re just pro-controlling women. They have always been shamelessly hypocritical. However, their hypocrisy has become particularly brazen during the coronavirus crisis. On Monday, for example, Dan Patrick, the <a href=\"https://rewire.news/ablc/2020/03/25/texas-covid-19-response-ban-abortion-kill-grandma/\">virulently </a><a href=\"https://rewire.news/ablc/2020/03/25/texas-covid-19-response-ban-abortion-kill-grandma/\">\u201cpro-life\u201d</a> lieutenant governor of Texas, called for the reopening of the country, saying there are \u201c<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/493879-texas-lt-governor-on-reopening-state-there-are-more-important-things\">more important things than living</a>\u201d.</p> <p>This is the same guy, by the way, who went on Fox News last month and said \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/older-people-would-rather-die-than-let-covid-19-lockdown-harm-us-economy-texas-official-dan-patrick\">lots of grandparents</a>\u201d would rather die than see the US economy suffer.

This is the same guy who seems to see no disconnect between sacrificing old people and sermonizing about the rights of foetuses.</p> <p>I could go on and on about the hypocrisy of the anti-abortion brigade but it\u2019s pointless to do so. Politicians like Patrick (who is an evangelical Christian) don\u2019t respond to logic or reason; many of them are simply fanatics, intent on turning America into a theocracy.</p> <p>Logic and reason, more broadly, seem to have little place in American politics anymore. I mean: on Thursday Donald Trump suggested that injecting yourself with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">disinfectants might cure coronavirus</a>. We\u2019ve reached a stage where the president of America has become so unhinged that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/trump-lysol-injection-claim-maker-hits-back\">manufacturers of Lysol</a> have to urge the public not to inject themselves with household chemicals. We\u2019ve reached a level of dystopia that I\u2019m not sure even Margaret Atwood could have imagined.</p> <h2>Former Labradoodle breeder led coronavirus task force</h2> <p>Continuing the theme of \u201cAmerica has become a bizarre dystopia\u201d: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-hhschief-speci/special-report-former-labradoodle-breeder-tapped-to-lead-u-s-pandemic-task-force-idUSKCN2243CE\">Reuters reports</a> that a senior lead on the Health and Human Services (HHS) coronavirus task force is a former labradoodle breeder with little public health experience.

But other times, these behaviors \u2026might signal that children view women in a negative light, as weak, incompetent, and unable to survive or thrive without a man\u2019s help. The study, which examined the attitudes of more than 200 children, aged five to 11, also found that benevolent sexism decreased with age only for girls. \u201cBoys may be less likely to recognize that their benevolent attitudes toward women are, in fact, patronizing.\u201d</p> <h2>Texas will allow abortions to resume</h2> <p>Abortion services have been largely unavailable for over a month after Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s 21 March executive order suspending \u201cnon-essential\u201d medical procedures. After a long battle the state has finally agreed that <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-abortion-ban-over/\">abortions can continue</a>.

The group now hopes to turn the anti-lockdown protests into a movement which could help re-elect Trump in November.</p> <p>The Tea Party Patriots, another group forged amid the Tea Party movement of 2009, has also weighed in, promoting the rallies to its 3 million members nationwide, while a group of gun-enthusiast activist brothers bought up webpages in an effort to further the movement\u2019s aims.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tea-party-supporters-who-they-are-and-what-they-believe/\">The Tea Party</a> supported lower taxes, but was also accused of representing a racist reaction to the election of the first black president.

Wall, at FreedomWorks, was also keen to stress it did not organize events, but the organization\u2019s ability to reach its 5 million members is hardly a small matter in promoting the events.</p> <p>In any case, the protests and the fawning news coverage by the rightwing media serve as a handy shot in the arm for less-publicized work both organizations are doing behind the scenes.</p> <p>FreedomWorks and Tea Party Patriots have joined with <a href=\"http://v\">the American Legislative Exchange Council</a>, a controversial rightwing network that pushes policies by creating model legislation, to create a \u201cSave Our Country\u201d coalition, which is quietly lobbying Trump to reopen the economy.

  "<p>Can a man who is both head of state and chief executive somehow not be the center of attention during a national crisis? All eyes remain on Trump.

Others are debating whether the networks and cable channels should carry Trump\u2019s daily briefings at all.</p> <p>There is an important lesson to be learned here from a very different period in history. I mean the strategies adopted by the central European dissidents of the 1970s and 1980s (which is not to equate authoritarian state socialism with the US today). After the failure of many reform efforts, Adam Michnik and other intellectuals concluded that the oppressive regimes were never going to change. The dissidents stopped talking to state leaders and resolved instead to \u201ctalk past them\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292994/postwar-by-tony-judt/\">as the historian Tony Judt put it</a>), trying to reach as many citizens as possible in spite of restrictions on speech. They also started to create what V\u00e1clav Benda called a <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781349111190\">\u201cparallel polis\u201d</a> \u2013 a world in which one tried to act as if one was already free. These civil society initiatives undermined the regimes without ever confronting them head-on.</p> <p>What is the lesson? There is no point talking to Trump, because he will not change; every seemingly sober presidential moment \u2013 cheered by centrist observers \u2013 is followed by 10 puerile performances of ranting and raving. There will never be a Gotcha moment, because Trump\u2019s \u201cbase\u201d is apparently committed to him no matter what; even his diehard fans\u2019 most basic interests \u2013 such as not dying (never mind their economic interests) \u2013 will apparently not detract from their identification with a figure who, if nothing else, looks like a trustworthy general in the culture war.</p> <p>It is possible, to pick up an idea from the media critic Jay Rosen, <a href=\"https://pressthink.org/2020/04/five-improvements-in-the-design-of-coronavirus-coverage/\">to \u201cdecenter\u201d Trump</a>. True, he is the president, but he has basically informed the country that he is abdicating responsibility for the Covid-19 crisis and turning to polit-entertainment. The governors are supposed to \u201ccall the shots\u201d. The rest of the world already got the message that the United States is no longer interested in cooperating to address global challenges.</p> <p>Concretely, this means the Democrats should start doing nightly briefings and propose plans (wasn\u2019t there once someone in the primaries who was particularly good at drawing up plans?); governors could turn the fact that Trump has \u201cauthorized\u201d them to do what they want into a mandate for building a parallel polis with better policies, some of which could eventually be scaled up nationally. The fact that some do not have the resources, because Mitch McConnell would rather <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/22/mitch-mcconnell-bankruptcy-route-201008\">have blue states go bankrupt than save lives</a>, should be exposed as further proof that the Republicans have comprehensively turned into the party of cruelty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Democrats may worry that providing alternative leadership is seen as divisive.

When Andr\u00e9s<em> </em>Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador contested the outcome of the 2006 election in Mexico (which he narrowly lost), he declared himself the \u201clegitimate president of Mexico\u201d and had his followers camp out to protest in the middle of Mexico City. And in the weeks after the shock of November 2016, plenty of Americans declared Trump \u201cnot my president\u201d. That is a dangerous move, and mirrors Republicans who already in the 1990s referred to Bill Clinton as \u201cyour president\u201d, denying the legitimacy of their political adversaries. Trump, alas, <em>is</em> our president \u2013 he\u2019s just not acting like it.</p> <p>Democrats may worry that assertively providing alternative leadership is seen as \u201cdivisive\u201d or as \u201cpoliticizing\u201d the crisis. But like it or not, we are already in the campaign; Trump is being as divisive as ever; and, most important, an opposition ready to provide comprehensive alternatives is the heart of representative democracy. This is more obvious in parliamentary systems; think of how the leader of the opposition in the House of Commons is supposed to rise immediately after the prime minister and start rebutting.</p> <p>Some commentators have suggested Joe Biden put together a <a href=\"https://saraacarter.com/msnbc-host-suggests-biden-form-a-shadow-government-to-counter-trumps-covid-response/\">\u201cshadow cabinet\u201d</a>, following the UK example. Others have argued that Democrats should not have one spokesperson going up parallel to Trump, but instead feature <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-how-democrats-can-counter-program-trumps-coronavirus-propaganda?\">a revolving set of politicians both charismatic and competent</a> (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would be a natural choice). What is most important is creating a sense that the opposition, in a time of crisis, is both criticizing the administration <em>and</em> offering something constructive.</p> <p>It is true that elections are today often decided <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/opinion/negative-partisanship-democrats-republicans.html\">more by \u201cnegative identity\u201d than by positive visions</a>; citizens vote less for something, than against someone. Many Americans have made up their mind about Trump by now; those who haven\u2019t are more likely to be impressed by his Kabuki shows of leadership and get the feeling that nobody else has a plan.

The only thing that comes close is a hug from Kingsley\u2019s mascot wife, Queensley. Do not ask why a mascot needs a mascot wife, because I cannot explain that in any meaningful way. Mascots intersect society at the exact same angle as cereal box characters: we never question why they are there, what they mean, or why they never blink; but we do demand complicated backstories for them, and extended family trees.</p> <p>Before all this happened \u2013 before the lockdown and the boarded-up pubs, and the groups of no more than two, and the two-metre distancing and the isolation and the ransacked supermarkets, and most crucially the suspension of every single sport on the planet, all at once \u2013 I became obsessed with mascots. There they were: jiggling, expressionless monoliths made of felt, pacing up and down the touchline, a seen-but-unseen aspect of modern sport, ever-present and never questioned. In the current void, you could be forgiven for forgetting all about them; but they are just as crucial to the matchday experience as the people kicking the ball, and the other people running after it, as crucial as being one 60,000-throated voice, shouting them all on, as crucial as the pies and the scarves and the long winding walk to the stadium, the urinal queues and the matchday programmes. And there, look: there\u2019s a person in a bumblebee outfit, waving at you. Who are they? What are they for?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7f7502cb88d6fb0612b1e0a71fadf713fc78b6d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f7502cb88d6fb0612b1e0a71fadf713fc78b6d5/1206_0_3324_4472/743.jpg\" alt=\"Partick Thistle\u2019s abstract yellow monster mascot designed by artist David Shrigley.\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Partick Thistle\u2019s mascot designed by artist David Shrigley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a wet weekend before lockdown, I went walking through the labyrinthine corridors that make up the backstage of Reading\u2019s Madejski Stadium, trying to find out. Kingsley (a lion, who shouldn\u2019t be confused with Kingsley the Partick Thistle mascot, the abstract yellow monster designed by artist David Shrigley) has been a Reading FC fixture since 1997. Kingsley has the dubious honour of being one of the few mascots in sport to receive a red card (for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/11/the-most-obscure-person-sent-off\" title=\"\">straying too close to the pitch</a> in 2007). But when I visited him, he was behaving himself, warming up the crowd before a vital 3\u20130 win over Luton. Spirits had been low in previous weeks, with a faltering run of form and a recent managerial change, but mascots cannot sit these periods out: rain or shine, good form or bad, they are pitchside, dancing and pointing.</p> <p>I stood behind the king and queen, Kingsley and his wife, like a page as they waved at their subjects. I held doors open for them to squeeze through while they smiled at the various birthday parties they had wafted into. I basked in the reflected glory as they shimmied through the pre\u2011match bar. Everywhere Kingsley and Queensley went, people responded with joy. Children whisper-shouted their names to each other when they spotted their lion eyes glimmering through a door window. Unsmiling, 50-year season ticket holders went mushy as they shook Kingsley\u2019s royal paw.</p> <p>\u201cYou just have to be yourself in there,\u201d Kingsley\u2019s actor, Craig Peters, told me, headless, when we spoke in the staff kitchen an hour before the game. \u201cAnd I would also say: don\u2019t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to say where mascots began, exactly. History is written by the winners, and the winners rarely stop to write, \u201cOh yeah, bit of a weird one: we took a pig to a football game today. Won. Might do it again, every match, for ever.\u201d </p> <p>Yes, mascots bring happiness, but who allowed them to happen? They skim into the arena on a zipline. They cover their big unblinking eyes with their hands when an eight-year-old skies a half-time penalty. We accept all this. We look at Manchester United\u2019s cuddly devil mascot, Fred the Red, and think: <em>I\u2019m completely OK with the fact that a demon sent</em> <em>to punish us for our sins is</em> <em>standing on the halfway line right now,</em> <em>having physical banter with Bruno Fernandes</em><strong>.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ff3aad91890cf535d525e699173d6aa0122383c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff3aad91890cf535d525e699173d6aa0122383c/0_621_8256_4951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joel Golby as football mascot Bertie the Beaver with fans at Hampton & Richmond Borough FC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joel Golby as Bertie the Beaver: \u2018Mascots are just as crucial to the matchday experience as the people kicking the ball.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Muir Vidler/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baseball, a game riddled with superstition, pioneered the US mascot, though they were mostly just children, rather than adults in animal suits. The first recorded use of the term in sport, in 1883, described a young batboy called \u201cChic\u201d, who the Pottsville Anthracites considered a good luck charm, as well as being the grunt they got to hand out bats and uniforms to the team. By the late 19th century, the mascot had moved into other sports: Yale\u2019s Handsome Dan (a bulldog belonging to student Andrew Graves) played an essential role in the ceremonial pomp that preceded the college\u2019s American football games.</p> <p>Live-animal mascots also made their way to Britain. Manchester United, newly minted from the ashes of Newton Heath, replaced Major the St Bernard with Billy the Goat, an animal belonging to half-back Charlie Roberts. Billy was paraded at Old Trafford before games, but his time came to an abrupt end following the 1909 FA Cup final win over Bristol City when, as United Museum curator Jon Sutton <a href=\"https://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/art79594\" title=\"\">writes</a>, \u201cBilly sadly died of alcohol poisoning after taking part in the post-match celebrations.\u201d</p> <p>I talked to Nick Miller, the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dance-like-everybody-s-watching-9780008356828.html\" title=\"\">Dance Like Everybody\u2019s Watching!: The Weird </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dance-like-everybody-s-watching-9780008356828.html\" title=\"\">And Wonderful World </a><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dance-like-everybody-s-watching-9780008356828.html\" title=\"\">Of Sporting Mascots</a>, for which he studied mascots from Australia, Japan, the US and the Olympic Games, as well as West Bromwich Albion\u2019s baffling Boiler Man, a combi-boiler with arms and legs, but no eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand why a lot of these mascots can\u2019t just be nice and cuddly, or why they have to go down the nightmare route,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be for kids, really.\u201d</p> <p>Mascots graduated from dogs and small children to more haunting cartoon characters with the introduction of the New York Mets\u2019 Mr Met in 1964. The body of a man with the head of a gigantic baseball, Mr Met debuted the year before as a drawing on the front of a matchday programme, but took corporeal form at the opening of the team\u2019s then-new home, Shea Stadium. His pre-match shtick proved popular: by the 1970s he was joined by Mrs Met (becoming, arguably, the first mascot power couple) and then three little Mets \u2013 all nameless, all with eerie baseball heads.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The inside of the head smells of fresh grass and old sweat. Bertie the Beaver, like a demon devouring my soul, takes over</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the next decade, the Mets\u2019 Major League baseball rivals rushed to catch up. In 1974, the San Diego Padres introduced the San Diego Chicken, heralding a frenzied period of invention in the US, climaxing with San Francisco Giants\u2019 Crazy Crab. The crab was designed as a sort of \u201canti-mascot\u201d, who deliberately got the crowd so riled that they pelted him with beer bottles and batteries (actor Wayne Doba had to wear protective equipment inside his soft outer shell). In 1984, Crazy Crab was tackled by two of the San Diego Padres, leaving Doba incapacitated for the last two games of the season. Crazy Crab was quietly retired in 1985.</p> <p>Mascots don\u2019t share an overarching aesthetic. They can be fuzzy, furry, hairy or slick; they can be aliens or monsters or animals. But the one recurring theme is that they have someone inside them, most often someone who already works for the team, who has acquired the job because, put simply, they were there. \u201cIt was a pre-season game against Bournemouth, actually,\u201d Peters tells me. \u201cMy intention was to go and just watch the game.\u201d Peters also works for Reading\u2019s community outreach programmes. \u201cAnd then my colleague said, \u2018What are you doing? Do you want to be Queensley with me?\u2019 So I did it. Then they said they didn\u2019t have a Kingsley for the upcoming season and that\u2019s when I thought, you know what, I enjoyed that.\u201d Peters says he wears \u201cjust boxers\u201d when he is Kingsley; there is no protective clothing necessary.</p> <p>Miller has spoken to more mascots than anyone else alive, and tells me he has noticed a pattern. \u201cYou don\u2019t get many careerist mascots. The origin story is always, \u2018Oh, you know, the previous guy was ill, or they needed someone, anyone, to prance around in this thing. I was there.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not to diminish the role: on a good day, the mascot becomes an extension of the crowd, urging the ball towards the net; on a bad day, they are a focal point for anger, the home crowd\u2019s howling after going 3-0 down. And on a terrible day, they might get into a fight: famously, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/nov/15/mascots-murder-mayhem-wigs-football-anecdotes#maincontent\" title=\"\">Swansea\u2019s Cyril the Swan went head-to-head </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/nov/15/mascots-murder-mayhem-wigs-football-anecdotes#maincontent\" title=\"\">with Millwall\u2019s Zampa the Lion</a> during a heated match in 2001.

It is the March weekend when the Football League abandons games because of coronavirus, but when the lower leagues are still playing. Without competition from the bigger games, there is a capacity local crowd to watch the team face their Vanarama National League South rivals, Oxford City.</p> <p>To truly understand the psyche of the person inside the suit, I have agreed to be Hampton &amp; Richmond\u2019s mascot, Bertie the Beaver. I retire to the female officials\u2019 changing room to become Bertie in a shower cubicle. This, I imagine, is much like any complicated, ceremonial dressing routine \u2013 buttoning up a suit on the morning of your wedding, pulling a graduation gown over your clothes \u2013 in that it slowly transforms you into a different person, with a different demeanour. When I nestle a gut-sized wad of cotton between my thighs and my stomach to give Bertie his signature belly (and, more practically, to stop rowdy children absolutely hammering me in the testicles), I feel nothing. When I clamber into a fleece bodysuit, I feel sturdy and hot. But slowly the picture comes together: I pull two paw-shaped loops over my shoes and Velcro them to my legs, then draw three-fingered gloves over my own hands. I can no longer walk unassisted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's interesting to see how crowds react to you when you\u2019re a large, clumsy beaver who can\u2019t get through a door properly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Wearing an XXL-sized Adidas shirt over my enormous new frame, I am in matchday mode. And then, finally, the head: like a huge, padding-lined, low-visibility crown, it is Velcroed to the neck of my bodysuit by my minder, Tanc. I am now eight feet tall. My vision is reduced to a small gauze window hidden in Bertie\u2019s mouth; all audio is fuzzed out by the fleece around my ears. The inside of the head smells of fresh grass and old sweat. I have to heave each leg high off the ground in order to plant it safely in front of me. I am surrounded by cotton and darkness.

  "<p>Fringe climate science deniers who spread online disinformation are now downplaying the seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new analysis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/anti-lockdown-protests-trump-right-wing\">The 'anti-lockdown' protests are about more than just quarantines | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>DeSmog, a blog and organization that tracks the culprits behind false information about the climate crisis, identified about 70 individuals and groups questioning the deadliness of the coronavirus and pushing for an end to social distancing, along with protesters who have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/stay-at-home-order-protest-lockdown-maryland-texas-ohio\">encouraged</a> by Donald Trump.</p> <p>From the conservative conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to the US-based Heartland Institute and UK-based James Delingpole, the review concludes that the same influencers trying to make the public question the severity of global heating are also discounting the science surrounding Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThe climate war has largely been about confusing the public and making people trust in science and government less,\u201d said DeSmog\u2019s executive director, Brendan DeMelle. \u201cAnd here we are in a pandemic where science and global cooperation are critical, and that\u2019s a threat to the ideology of a lot of these \u2026 organizations.</p> <p>\u201cYou end up with this conspiracy theory about big government taking over our lives, taking away our freedoms, subjecting us to stay-at-home orders that we have to liberate ourselves from,\u201d DeMelle said.</p> <p>DeSmog also identified fossil fuel and chemical industry aligned interests <a href=\"https://www.desmogblog.com/covid-19-plastic-promoters\">touting single-use plastics</a> in personal protective gear, food packaging and grocery bags.</p> <p>John Cook, who studies climate denial at the center for climate change communication at George Mason University, said he expected the overlap but was surprised by the extent of the parallels.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who are politically conservative and who value individual rights over collective responsibility are less supporting of social distancing policies and also just have a lower understanding of the dangers of Covid-19,\u201d Cook said, citing emerging polling data.</p> <p>Cook outlines five <a href=\"https://skepticalscience.com/history-FLICC-5-techniques-science-denial.html\">techniques</a> of science denial that people should watch for, including the cherry-picking of data.</p> <p>\u201cThe latest argument that we should relax social distancing because the curve [of cases] is flattening is very much an example of cherry-picking,\u201d Cook said.</p> <p>In the US, some of the same groups that have petitioned the Trump administration to debate human-caused climate disruption and to roll back climate standards are sowing distrust of epidemiological research.</p> <p>Jay Lehr, the former science director of the Heartland Institute who now works for the Canada-based International Climate Science Coalition, on 30 March said people have been \u201cbarraged on the 24/7 news cycle for years\u201d about climate change and now \u201cface a more realistic fear of the most contagious virus any of us have ever experienced\u201d but \u201cboth, however, suffer from questionable statistics and predictions that make us wonder what is real and what is someone\u2019s best guess\u201d.</p> <p>Heartland\u2019s communications director, Jim Lakely, in a podcast about the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d on 15 March compared the virus to a bad flu season and said that while \u201cthe panic is definitely more dangerous than the flu \u2013 this has to be put in perspective.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to think about the economic damage this is doing to the country. This is incalculable,\u201d Lakely said.</p> <p>The Heartland Institute also posted a piece by economics professor Daniel Sutter arguing that alternative strategies to social distancing \u2013 like sheltering vulnerable populations \u2013 \u201ccould have mitigated the human toll at a significantly lower economic and social cost\u201d.</p> <p>The Manhattan Institute, which calls itself a free-market thinktank, ran an article from Heather MacDonald in which she wrote: \u201cEven if my odds of dying from coronavirus should suddenly jump ten-thousand-fold, from the current rate of 0.000012 percent across the U.S. population all the way up to 0.12 percent, I\u2019d happily take those odds over the destruction being wrought on the U.S. and global economy from this unbridled panic.\u201d</p> <p>The Media Research Center in a video said: \u201cThis is exactly how they incite mass panic: through lies and deception and exploiting ignorance. It\u2019s how they convince people that we\u2019re all going to die because Trump doesn\u2019t believe in science or something.\u201d</p> <p>Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who founded Infowars, has called the virus a \u201choax\u201d and appeared at a \u201cYou Can\u2019t Close America\u201d rally in Austin on Saturday, where he shook hands with unmasked supporters.</p> <p>Fossil fuel supporters have also capitalized on the pandemic to warn of the costs of climate action.</p> <p>Alex Epstein, the founder of the Center for Industrial Progress which DeSmog cites as associated with various groups connected to the rightwing billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, called the current recession a \u201cmild preview of the Green New Deal\u201d, and said that \u201cour biggest ally in the fight against coronavirus is the fossil fuel industry.\u201d</p> <p>The links between climate science denial and Covid-19 downplaying reach outside the US. In the UK, Delingpole, a rightwing commentator, has reposted calls to rapidly return to regular life.</p> <p>In a recent podcast, he called doubters of quarantining measures \u201clockdown skeptics\u201d, and referred to those who support social distancing as \u201chysterical bedwetters\u201d. He accused the media of promoting panic in \u201chysterical tabloids\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>We have always given each other strange advice in times of plague. During the yellow fever outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793, it was thought you could purify the air by firing muskets, both indoors and out, and for a while it became impossible to go for a walk without some earnest citizen shooting you in the ear. In London in 1665, it was said that powdered dried toad would protect against the terrifying sweep of death. Tobacco was used to ward off bubonic plagues, with toddlers puffing at pipes at the kitchen table.</p> <p>But there has been good advice, too, and that advice is more constant across history: we have always told each other to tell stories and try not to despair. Tomaso del Garbo, a Florentine physician working during the 14th-century Black Death, wrote that those who could not \u201cflee the pestilence\u201d must \u201cuse songs and games and pleasant stories that do not exhaust the body\u201d. Writing at the same time, Nicholas de Burgo urged that people \u201ctake care to be able to be joyful \u2026 listen to lullabies, stories and melodies\u201d. A 15th-century revised edition of Aldobrandino of Siena\u2019s <em>R\u00e9gime du Corps</em>, which circulated widely during epidemic outbreaks, told its readers to \u201cread joyful and strange things\u201d.This prescription was down, in part, to the ancient Galenic idea that fear and sorrow could alter the temperature of a person\u2019s body and thereby render them more prone to sickness: but it was also a sense that, in the midst of horror, we need to be transported.</p> <p>I am not in the Galen camp: I don\u2019t believe stories will protect us against Covid-19, any more than would strength of character or moral probity. The solutions lie with science and the radical global cooperation of governments, but we will need the stories, even so. Tales of transformation and of emancipation, both real and fictional, can be a set of stars and maps. They point us both towards action and hope. Real hope, I think, is not the promise that everything will be all right, but a sense that the world has so many complexities and possibilities that despair is misplaced; that we still live in a universe shot through with the unexpected. There has never been a decade when we have not taken ourselves by surprise: we have never yet exhausted our capacity for change. I struggle with optimism, but nor am I a pessimist; I tell the children I write for that I am a possibilityist. I truly believe in the potential for human transformation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The world has so many possibilities that despair is misplaced \u2013 our universe is shot through with the unexpected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So a few weeks ago, in search of that defibrillation for the imagination that happens when the right reader meets the right story (and in truth, in part to fight back at my own sadness and fear), I emailed some of the children\u2019s writers and artists whose work I love most. I asked them to write something, or draw something, anything, that would offer that galvanic sense of possibility even in darkness. The response was glorious, which shouldn\u2019t have surprised me. So many children\u2019s writers and illustrators are themselves already hunters and gatherers of hope; manufacturers and peddlers of wonder.</p> <p>Now, a few weeks later, the pieces have been collected into <em>The Book of Hopes</em>. The stories and essays and images aren\u2019t explicitly about hope: rather, they aim to create it, through delight or comfort or new ideas, ridiculous jokes, wild heroic tales. There are true accounts of cats and hares and plastic-devouring caterpillars, there are doodles and flowers, revolting and beautiful poems, there are stories of space travel and new shoes and dragons. They are designed to be dipped into: you can eat one with your breakfast and another at midday. The psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott believed that during times of privation, the imagination can be a place of shelter for children. I hope that <em>The Book of Hopes</em> might help, even if only a little.</p> <p>The collection is a free downloadable PDF, hosted on the website of the <a href=\"https://literacytrust.org.uk/\">National Literacy Trust</a>. It\u2019s dedicated to the doctors, nurses, carers and all those working in hospitals to protect us: they are the stuff that wild, heroic tales are made of.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Katherine Rundell\u2019s fee for this feature has been donated to <a href=\"https://www.nhscharitiestogether.co.uk/\">NHS Charities Together</a>.

He sits on his branch and listens.</p> <p>It was blackbird\u2019s idea. He sang out this morning at dawn from his treetop in the garden, to fox half asleep behind the garden shed. She thought it a good idea too. It was a wake-up call. Fox was on her feet at once, and trotting through Bluebell Wood, where she barked it to deer who ran off across the stream. Kingfisher was there, otter and dipper too. They heard, and piped it on, and swallow swooped down over the meadow, and passed it on to cows waiting to go into their milking, and to sheep resting quietly under the hedge with her lambs in the corner of the dew-damp field.</p> <p>And they all agreed, bleating it out to bees already busy at their flowers, to weaving spiders, and grasshoppers, and scurrying mice. Trees heard sheep calling too, the whole flock of them, and waved their budding leaves in wild enthusiasm; and high above, the clouds wandered through the skies driven by wind, and wind took blackbird\u2019s idea over the cliffs across heaving seas, where gulls and albatross cried it out, and whales and dolphins and porpoises heard it, and wailed and whooped it down into the deep, where turtles listened, and they too loved the idea. So did plankton and every fish and crab and sea urchin and whelk, they all whispered that it was a fine notion, the best they ever heard.</p> <p>And the whisper went over the sea on the curling waves to the shores of Africa, where lions roared their approval, and elephants trumpeted it, leopards yawned it, water buffalo belched it, wild dogs yelped it. Wildebeest murmured it out across the savanna; and storm lifted the idea up over rainforests, where rain took it and poured it down on gorillas in the mist, on chimpanzees in their sleeping nests. Howler monkeys and gibbons echoed their calls loud over all the earth \u2013 they are that loud; and then from far up high, sun heard it too and shone it down over deserts where oryx stamped her foot impatient to be getting on with it and doing it \u2013 she loved the idea that much. Even camel, who rarely joined in anything, thought this was the best and most beautiful idea he had ever heard.</p> <p>Back in the garden, blackbird waited till everyone was ready. And then he began to sing. And the whole carnival of animals, every living thing on this good earth joined in, until the globe echoed with the joy of it.</p> <p>And blackbird was very pleased.</p> <p>But I was still lost in sadness, as I heard the earth singing around me. It was a song of forgiveness. I knew that. So I asked blackbird if I could join in. And he sang his answer back to me.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you think we are doing this, you silly man? We want you and yours to be happy again. Only then will you treat us and the world right again, as you know you should. Only then will all be well. Sing, silly man, sing, sing. Our song is your song, your song is our song.\u201d</p> <p>So I sang, we all sang, sang away our sadness. In every house and flat and cottage, we clapped and sang, in every hut and tent, in every palace and hospital and prison. And they heard and we heard our song of gladness echoing all together, in glorious harmony across the universe.</p> <p>\u00a9 Michael Morpurgo 2020<br>\u2022 <em>Michael Morpurgo</em> <em>founded the <a href=\"www.farmsforcitychildren.org\">Farms for City Children</a> charity.</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Peanut<br></strong><em>by Rob Biddulph</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97ccaf2f2ed23fd17f16e7c59c3ef9fcda4407bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97ccaf2f2ed23fd17f16e7c59c3ef9fcda4407bc/0_690_4134_4131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rob Biddulph.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em>Rob Biddulph is the illustrator of books including Blown Away, GRRRRR! and Odd Dog Out (HarperCollins Children\u2019s Books).</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>HOPE<br></strong><em>by Chris Haughton</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6ce77ff717277ce6e9ffa057388af2e406abff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ce77ff717277ce6e9ffa057388af2e406abff5/0_1228_7441_9296/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Haughton\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em>Chris Haughton is the illustrator and author of Oh No, George! and A Bit Lost (Walker Books).</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Care of Exotic Pets: Number 1.<br>The Axolotl at Bedtime <br></strong><em>by Catherine Johnson</em></h2> <p>Never give your axolotl chocolatl in a botl<br>Serve it in a tiny eggcup, not too cold and not too hotl.<br>Make him sip it very slowly, not too much, never a lotl.<br>After all, he\u2019s just a sleepy, snuggly, bedtime, axolotl.<br><br>Then tuck him \u2013 very gently \u2013 in his hand carved wooden cotl.<br>Turn the light out, seven thirty, never later, on the dotl.<br>Sing him songs of salamanders, give it everything you\u2019ve gotl<br>As there\u2019s nothing like a tune to serenade your axolotl.</p> <p>Brush his gills out on the pillow, never mind the whys or whatl.<br>Once he\u2019s deeply all a-slumber, sweetly snoring, off you trotl.<br>Think of him, snug in his dreamland, flying kites or sailing yachtl.<br>Then you\u2019ll sigh, you\u2019ve done your duty, time to clean the pans and potl.<br>Come tomorrow he\u2019ll be one fresh, keen as mustard, axolotl.<br><br>\u00a9 Catherine Johnson 2020<br><em>Catherine Johnson\u2019s latest books are Race to the Frozen North (Barrington Stoke) and Freedom (Scholastic).</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Everything Crossed<br></strong><em>by Steven Lenton</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0da6af7bada70faa4f4800017503039d85f9ccb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0da6af7bada70faa4f4800017503039d85f9ccb4/0_371_2480_3137/791.jpg\" alt=\"Everything Crossed (c) Steven Lenton\" width=\"791\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em>Steven Lenton is the illustrator of Shifty McGifty and Slippery Sam by Tracey Corderoy (Nosy Crow), as well as books by David Baddiel and Frank Cottrell-Boyce.</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Fake a smile<br></strong><em>by Jim Smith</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78ef512f308571a91a92a13663ad8caa770c6759\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78ef512f308571a91a92a13663ad8caa770c6759/0_0_2480_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"jim smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em>Jim Smith is the illustrator and author of the Barry Loser series and the Super Weird Mysteries series (Egmont).</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>New Boots <br></strong><em>by Jacqueline Wilson</em></h2> <p>There\u2019s a huge hole in my right boot and the sole flaps madly on my left.

Someone has arranged a pair of scarlet kid boots beside the deep blue hem, the perfect touch.</p> <p>I am here to buy flour and cheese and a dozen eggs because our old Henny Penny\u2019s stopped laying, but now I have the groceries I must have one more look at the dazzling gown.</p> <p>But when I glimpse the Draper\u2019s window the dress is missing! Has someone purchased my beautiful gown? I rush to see, and the sole on my left boot catches on a pebble. I stagger and land on my knees, juggling flour and cheese and eggs.</p> <p>The lady from the Draper\u2019s shop dashes out and picks me up.</p> <p>I burst into tears, and then duck my head, ashamed.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, child! You\u2019ve saved every single egg! But oh dear, look at the state of your boots!\u201d she says.</p> <p>The sole has torn right off, and my bare foot is touching the ground now.</p> <p>\u201cAre these your only pair?\u201d she asks gently, and I nod.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really stock children\u2019s boots. The only footwear I have in my shop are scarlet boots to go with an evening gown, but the lady who bought it didn\u2019t care for the ensemble. They\u2019re ridiculously fancy and probably far too big for you, but you\u2019re welcome to try them,\u201d she says.</p> <p>They\u2019re a perfect fit for my big feet! The kid feels soft as a glove but the sole is stout.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re the most beautiful boots in all the world \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t possibly afford them,\u201d I say, sniffing.</p> <p>The lady looks at me. She looks at the boots.</p> <p>\u201cTake them, dear,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you start earning you can come and pay me. How about that?\u201d</p> <p>Oh joy! When I am a lady I shall buy <em>all</em> my gowns and boots from her! And though I\u2019m still an ungainly girl in a brown dress I feel like a queen.

At one hospital, even a pregnant woman was denied access. In a department store, an African woman was stopped at the entrance while her white friend was allowed in. In a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/mcdonald-s-apologizes-after-restaurant-china-bans-black-people-n1184616\">a notice was put up</a> saying \u201cblack people cannot come in\u201d. </p> <p>The widespread racism has caused a huge public outcry across Africa, shared on social media under the hashtag <a href=\"https://chinaafricaproject.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=de6c715223b42ee6c619dbe2f&amp;id=39486344a4&amp;e=c1363e0aab\">#ChinaMustExplain</a>.

The global African diaspora has put pressure on African embassies and institutions to act. Last weekend the Kenyan government announced plans to allow its citizens stranded in China to be evacuated.</p> <p>The official Chinese responses were at first silence or denial. State media such as Global Times and Xinhua failed to report the story in the first few days after the news broke in African news outlets. Later, the Chinese authorities began to recognise the reports of racism as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/chinese-official-claims-racial-targeting-reasonable-concerns\">reasonable concerns</a>\u201d, though migrants continue to feel unsafe.</p> <p>To outsiders, this horrendous racism may appear \u201cunprecedented\u201d. But ethnic minorities in China would find it all too familiar. In Shaoguan, not far from Guangzhou, the racist murder of two Uighur workers in 2009 triggered a series of events, such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2009_%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi_riots\">\u00dcr\u00fcmqi Inciden</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2009_\u00dcr\u00fcmqi_riots\">t</a>, which led to further repression in the north-western region of Xinjiang.</p> <p>The ideology of \u201crace\u201d in China goes back a long way. In the late 19th century, Qing imperial reformers searched for an \u201canswer\u201d that could revive China in face of European and Japanese colonialist expansion. \u201cRace\u201d, \u201cnation\u201d and nationalism have since been embedded into Chinese republicanism in the early 20th century, and then into the establishment of the Chinese Communist party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dannydvincent/status/1251810427123580928\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My report on allegations of &#39;arbitrary detention&#39; of Africans in the Chinese city of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Guangzhou?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Guangzhou</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCWorld?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@bbcworld</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCAfrica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BBCAfrica</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/63lODEuBIF\">pic.twitter.com/63lODEuBIF</a></p>&mdash; Danny Vincent (@dannydvincent) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannydvincent/status/1251810427123580928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 19, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Nationalism has taken deeper root in the four decades since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/18/globaleconomy-economics\">Deng Xiaoping\u2019s</a> economic reforms. National revival has been a key ideological driver behind modernisation. </p> <p>Today, assimilationism is at the centre of the concept of nation. <em>Minzu</em>, a key term used interchangeably for both ethnic group and nationality, refers to a group of common descent, with a distinct culture and territory.</p> <p>In 2012, Xi Jinping began his rule by saying: \u201cThe China dream gathers Chinese aspirations and wishes for generations and manifests the interests of the whole Chinese nation (<em>zhonghua minzu</em>) \u2026\u201d The \u201cChina dream\u201d became the political-economic programme for \u201cthe realisation of the great revival of the Chinese nation\u201d.</p> <p>This century is the \u201cChinese century\u201d, Xi said. His multibillion-dollar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\">Belt and Road Initiative</a> was launched in 2013 as a massive global investment programme. From 2013 to 2018, the Chinese state invested nearly $614bnin developing countries. China\u2019s foreign investment campaign is seen by some in Africa<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2018/10/01/china-is-investing-greatly-in-developing-countries-what-is-it-really-up-to/\"> as colonialism</a>, as the nations involved risk losing control of their essential infrastructure and natural resources, with their debt burden increased. China now holds <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2018/04/16/competing-in-africa-china-the-european-union-and-the-united-states/\">14% of the total debt stock</a> in sub-Saharan Africa and has become the largest owner of public debt in Africa.</p> <p>China\u2019s growing presence brought with it labour migration from African countries from the late 1990s. People from Nigeria, Mali, Kenya, Senegal, Ghana and other west African countries came for work opportunities, mostly in the metropolis of Guangzhou. Many work in the city\u2019s wholesale markets as other types of employment, including factory work, are closed to them. It\u2019s commonly said by them that Africans are often \u201caccepted as traders but discriminated against as people\u201d. There are currently more than 15,000 African migrants with formal immigration status living in Guangzhou.</p> <p>Although China has the lowest immigration in the world (migrants account for just <a href=\"https://qz.com/1163632/china-still-has-the-smallest-share-of-incoming-migrants-in-the-world/\">0.07% of the population</a>), the authorities impose harsh \u201cmigrant management\u201d. African migrants can often be criminalised in a similar way to the internal migrants from the countryside. Apart from immigration checks and crackdowns, the authorities consistently discourage migrants from living in certain neighbourhoods. There is no legal protection against racial discrimination.</p> <p>The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted this longstanding anti-African racism. With all the damage this pandemic has done to the economy and people\u2019s livelihoods, scapegoating and hostility towards an imagined outside threat clearly helps to divert domestic frustration away from the ruling elite \u2013 a trend we are all seeing worldwide. As Asian communities in Europe and the United States become victims of racism during this pandemic, Africans in China are crying out, \u201cWe are not the virus!\u201d To resist racism, we need to see it for what it is, wherever it occurs.</p> <p>\u2022 Hsiao-Hung Pai is a journalist and the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/26/scattered-sand-china-pai-review\">Scattered Sand: The Story of China\u2019s Rural Migrants</a></p>",
  "<p>Given that my response to the start of the Gulf war was to write that night in my diary, \u201cRenewed my membership to the New Kids On The Block fanclub!!!!\u201d, I am very familiar with being accused of caring too much about frivolity in times of gravity. The day Diana died, I made the schlep to Kensington Palace to see the flowers; but I also stopped in at Tower Records afterwards to buy an album (Backstreet Boys by the Backstreet Boys: Diana would have approved). Even now, when I know I should be spending every spare minute studying a long read about contagion/China/capitalism, I am instead reading Craig Brown\u2019s ridiculously enjoyable new biography of the Beatles, One Two Three Four. Because, sure, we\u2019re living through history. But did you know that Ringo once tried to save money on house repairs by buying his own building company?</p> <p>At the time of writing, the British lockdown has lasted a month and, initially, it was pretty much all I could talk about: the fear, the weirdness, the uncertainty. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d my friends and I would sigh down the phone to each other, because when you have no idea what to say but think you need to say <em>something</em>, you turn into an Alison Steadman character. But after a certain point, there isn\u2019t \u2013 if you\u2019re lucky \u2013 much else to say. If you and your family are well and have enough to eat, what\u2019s your conversation going to be? \u201cYup, still inside. Still washing my hands. Doing the same tomorrow \u2013 catch up then?\u201d If the lockdown experience was a movie, even Terrence Malick would be thinking, \u201cYou know what? This story really needs some plot.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly, we have started talking about other things: celebrity gossip, sharing photos of outfits and hair experiments \u2013 things that have nothing to do with the virus. \u201cSorry for mentioning this <em>now</em>\u2026\u201d a friend will begin, a version of a sentiment you see a lot on social media, usually in relation to any article that dares to be about something other than the virus. \u201cDoes this writer not know <em>people are dying</em>?\u201d is the traditional format. It\u2019s always tempting to respond, \u201cNo, they totally didn\u2019t! Thank God you\u2019ve let them know \u2013 they thought the whole world was doing a re-enactment of Shaun Of The Dead!\u201d</p> <p>I may have mentioned this once or a million times, but I recently published a book about my family\u2019s lives through the 20th century, including during the second world war. I don\u2019t have much time for politicians who make the link between all of us having to stay inside and our grandparents trying not to be bombed, but one of my favourite discoveries while researching the book has been on my mind recently. Throughout the war, despite being in hiding in Poland and France, my relatives somehow managed to write to one another. They were in enormous danger, and yet their letters were only occasionally about the conflict. Instead, they mainly complained: which daughter-in-law wasn\u2019t showing enough respect, which father snored too loudly. I loved all this, not just because it confirmed that I come by my pettiness naturally, but because it proves that human nature will always reassert itself, like weeds re-growing on a charred landscape after a natural disaster.</p> <p>For this reason, I would argue very strongly in defence of thinking, talking and writing about extremely stupid stuff that has nothing to do with the current hellishness. I don\u2019t mean posting twee photos of just-baked bread, or attempting to read Finnegans Wake. You are only doing those things because of the virus; they are coronactivities, and therefore do not count.

I\u2019m talking about falling asleep thinking about what colour you\u2019d like to repaint the kitchen. I\u2019m talking about the stuff of real, normal life.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just about giving yourself a break from thinking about the coronavirus, although God knows we could all do with one.

Instead, it\u2019s about giving yourself permission to still be a human being, because human beings are capable of being very concerned about one thing (a global plague), and also quite interested in something else (<a href=\"https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/mother-and-baby/2020041588013/cameron-diaz-baby-raddix-routine-revealed-rare-interview/\" title=\"\">Cameron Diaz\u2019s new baby</a>).</p> <p>When I watch people picking fights with one another online about Rishi Sunak\u2019s latest announcement, or hear them griping about how <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ameliagentleman/status/1249763305817804801?s=20\" title=\"\">their neighbours aren\u2019t sufficiently socially distant</a>, what I\u2019m really seeing are people who desperately want to think about something else, but who don\u2019t feel allowed to do so; when you suppress this natural desire, it curdles and twists. Then, before you can say, \u201cSomeone, please, get me a copy of Grazia,\u201d you\u2019re falling out with a colleague online over the government\u2019s withdrawal plan.</p> <p>Free yourselves: talk for hours about how you reckon Harry and Meghan are coping.

  "<p>Research to find a cure and effective treatment for Covid-19 is well under way, with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01010-7\">hundreds of trials</a> already announced. But very few involve African researchers, and this is a mistake.</p> <p>Although Africa has yet to feel the full force of the coronavirus, preventing severe cases is a higher priority than it is elsewhere. Africa needs research that is tailored to our reality.</p> <p>Even hospitals in New York are overwhelmed; hospitals in many African countries barely have enough ventilators to fill one room. So research needs to be directed towards preventing hospitalisations, potentially though treatment of mild cases as early as possible.</p> <p>If research is not conducted in Africa, potential life-saving innovations will be delayed, not least because regulatory authorities in Africa will require local data on Covid-19 patients to register any new drug.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Local researchers are also more likely to maintain the trust of the population. Outrageous <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52151722\">comments made recently by two French researchers</a> about using Africa as a testing ground for vaccines have sparked fury throughout the continent. The indignation is understandable: just because there is a health crisis does not mean research ethics can be violated.</p> <p>Such careless talk threatens to undermine years of work by African scientists to gain trust among people.</p> <p>I am an infectious diseases researcher in Nairobi and a medical doctor. I have dedicated my career to developing better treatments for kala-azar, the \u201cblack fever\u201d, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/may/18/hope-in-battle-against-deadliest-disease-youve-never-heard-of\">deadly parasitic illness</a> that affects the most vulnerable people across eastern Africa. Too many patients \u2013 especially children \u2013 die because of the lack of effective tests and treatments for this disease.</p> <p>I see doctors on the news in New York and Milan telling their harrowing experiences of battling for patients with Covid-19 in the absence of a cure. As it knocks on our doors, I see their helplessness as a mirror of my own: when the treatment you need to save a life simply does not exist.</p> <p>I believe that our response to Covid-19 can be informed by our experience with kala-azar research.</p> <p>To find an effective treatment, I have travelled to the remotest areas of Kenya to sit with local leaders and gain their trust \u2013 explaining why clinical trials are vital to their communities. They have welcomed us as African researchers. As the Covid-19 threat looms, I feel this goodwill is at risk.</p> <p>In 2003, scientists, doctors and ministries of health from Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia and, eventually, Uganda, decided that we needed to set our own research priorities for kala-azar. Collectively, we ran large multi-country clinical trials to improve the toxic, ineffective, burdensome treatment options for kala-azar at the time.</p> <p>It was not easy \u2013 clinical sites were in areas marked by conflict and extreme poverty. But we endured, bringing clinical trial sites up to international standards, and together delivered an effective, shorter-course treatment that is now recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p> <p>We need to now come together in the same spirit to develop adapted solutions for Covid-19 in Africa.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments\">Solidarity</a> trial being run by the WHO has begun to include African countries, which is a good sign.

The whole thing was of course less of a spectacle as a result \u2013 with not as much to see and hear to distract us from the fact that watching a bloke talk evasively is not in itself particularly exciting \u2013 but also more instructive.

For now, though, we can only watch in horror at a situation akin to a wedding disco from which all the music and all the lithe, young bodies have disappeared, leaving the awkward, ugly movements of those usually glimpsed only on the edge of the dancefloor. The hope from here is that we don\u2019t take too many elbows in the face before someone gets the music going again.</p>",
  "<p>Every technological innovation both changes its human users and uncovers something new about our nature. In this ingenious novel, Argentinian author Samanta Schweblin conducts an unnerving thought experiment: if an individual could be virtually inserted into the life of a random stranger, anywhere in the world, what effects would that have on them both? And what hidden truths would be revealed?</p> <p><em>Little Eyes</em> follows her gripping 2017 novella <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/24/fever-dream-by-samanta-schweblin-review\">Fever Dream</a></em>, a destabilising parable about GM farming and maternal anxiety, and a story collection of domestic surrealism, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/09/mouthful-of-birds-by-samanta-schweblin-review\">Mouthful of Birds</a></em>; all three books have been long- or shortlisted for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/man-booker-international-prize\">International Booker</a>. In her new novel the gadget that\u2019s sweeping the globe is called a kentuki. It\u2019s not much more, says one character, than \u201ca cell phone with legs\u201d, but the camera and speaker are housed within the felt-covered, remotely propelled body of a toy animal \u2013 rabbit or panda, dragon or crow, the buyer or \u201ckeeper\u201d decides. What the keeper can\u2019t choose is who the \u201cdweller\u201d connecting with the robot and watching online is, while dwellers have no control over where, and with whom, they \u201cwake up\u201d. As with a human life, the stakes are high; there is one connection per kentuki, one mind per body. When the keeper destroys their pet or forgets to charge its batteries, or the dweller disconnects, it\u2019s game over, no replays. If death is what gives life reality, the life of a kentuki is real.</p> <p>Schweblin familiarises the reader by artful degrees, introducing us to dwellers and keepers around the world, all reacting differently to the new gizmos. For Emilia in Peru, globalisation has meant profound loss; her grown-up son has been \u201csnatched away\u201d to Hong Kong for a glittering career. When he gives her a connection, she turns on her computer and wakes up in a flat in Germany, where she enjoys being a pet bunny for a young woman: attention at last, and day-to-day intimacy. In Mexico, purposeless Alina finds herself choosing between a crow and a dragon for \u201cthe miraculous distraction\u201d of unboxing a new product. In Antigua, a stifled little boy called Marvin who is grieving for his mother wakes up at the top of the globe and goes looking for snow: \u201cAt least in this other life, he wouldn\u2019t let himself be locked up.\u201d Italian Enzo falls into easy companionship with the mole that follows him around his greenhouse. And the consequences of capitalism never stop evolving: in Zagreb Grigor starts a business buying and tending connections through multiple tablets, so he can offer tailor-made experiences to those who want more consumer choice than the market officially offers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Alina wants to keep her crow as a toy, but gradually it becomes the conduit and eventually target for her rage and shame</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There has always been a tinge of horror to Schweblin\u2019s work, and here she gets full effect from violent interludes where the connections go sour. That hoary staple of an inanimate object coming alive can be just as frightening when you\u2019ve paid for it to happen \u2013 even, or perhaps especially, when it\u2019s a cuddly panda rolling closer with unknown intent. But as she works through the implications of her premise in a nimble, fast-moving narrative, what\u2019s most impressive is the way she foregrounds her characters\u2019 inner hopes and fears.</p> <p>The kentuki can hear and translate speech, but only respond with animal-appropriate squeaks or purrs, so the first issue is always communication: whether dweller and keeper will connect in the wider world. For Alina, the relationship is about control. She wants to keep her crow as nothing more than a toy, but gradually it becomes the conduit and eventually target for her rage and shame. Marvin finds he has more power and agency when negotiating the world as a kentuki: \u201cMarvin was no longer a boy with a dragon; he was a dragon with a boy inside him.\u201d When the characters happen by chance to glimpse their kentuki selves, they feel an overwhelming tenderness for the ball of plastic and felt that is the vessel for their consciousness. In a disassociated world, they are seeing themselves at last.</p> <p>Like Mohsin Hamid\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/02/exit-west-mohsin-hamid-review-andrew-motion-migrants\">Exit West</a>, in which magical doors act as portals out of conflict zones, <em>Little Eyes</em> has much to say about connection and empathy in a globalised world. On a personal level, its investigation into solitude and online experience becomes only more poignant in a global lockdown. Marvin has never seen snow; he longs to roll his little dragon into an untouched snowbank, to leave his mark. It would be \u201cjust like touching the other end of the world with your own fingertips\u201d. If a virtual reality is all we can have, we will still reach out to explore its limits.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Little Eyes by Samanta Schweblin, translated by Megan McDowell, is published by Oneworld (RRP \u00a314.99).

  "<p>The first time poet Craig Santos Perez encountered a bird native to his homeland of Guam it was in a cage at San Diego zoo.</p> <p>Growing up on Guam in the 1980s and 90s, Perez, a native Chamorro, had learned about the island\u2019s lost birds at school.

Just two narrowly escaped its jaws: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/10/previously-extinct-guam-rail-saved-in-rare-conservation-success-aoe\">Guam rail</a> and an endemic subspecies of the Micronesian kingfisher, which the Chamorro call <em>sihek</em>.</p> <p>In the late 1980s, the last siheks were taken off the island to be reared in captive breeding programmes at zoos on the American mainland. Though there are now <a href=\"https://www.zsl.org/conservation/species/birds/conservation-translocation-planning-for-sihek\">plans</a> to release some on Guam, they are still considered extinct in the wild.</p> <p>That day at the zoo, Perez finally came face to face with a real-life sihek, its gold-and-turquoise feathers shining behind the bars. \u201cIt was very profound, very touching \u2013 I talked to it, and started crying,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"279b8973621f969bb36f3d4f517c9c1195b06794\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/279b8973621f969bb36f3d4f517c9c1195b06794/0_3_2244_1346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The current population of invasive brown tree snakes on Guam is approximately 1-2 million.

We lose our cultural connection to these important species, and we lose the deep meaning that they added to our lives.\u201d</p> <p>The site is the brainchild of Thom van Dooren, an Australian environmental philosopher at the University of Sydney. He hopes it will be a way of creating space for others \u2013 especially the Pacific\u2019s indigenous peoples, but anyone is welcome to contribute \u2013 to share their tales of love and loss. A storytelling competition will be held later in the year.</p> <p>As the sixth great extinction gathers pace, stories are more important than ever, van Dooren says. \u201cFocusing on stories is about moving away from the simple listing of endangered species.</p> <p>\u201cMultiplying voices and diverse perspectives from around the world helps us to see the significance of extinction as it actually touches down in particular lives and places.\u201d</p> <p>In Indonesia\u2019s West Papua province, it is the disappearance of the sago palm that is causing heartbreak for the indigenous Marind people.

It includes a translation of a song sung to the plant by a Marind elder: \u201cFrom eating sago, we grew bone; from eating sago, we knew home.\u201d</p> <p>Marind call themselves \u201csago people\u201d, and the palm entwines with every aspect of their life, Chao says. Children are said to grow best in the company of sago, and particular palms are named after children that came into the world at the same time. Those babies are often carried in bags made from the fronds of their namesake palm so that, as one young mother told Chao, \u201csago and Marind can follow each other\u2019s lives\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5170f8d3290b9d33c4cb4438f063708155ccb8c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5170f8d3290b9d33c4cb4438f063708155ccb8c1/0_0_850_478/500.png\" alt=\"For the Marind, humans, animals and plants all participate in making the forest a place of life and movement.\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For the Marind, humans, animals and plants all participate in making the forest a place of life and movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Chao</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People also talk about being \u201cgood food for sago\u201d, Chao says.

  "<p>The vast illegal wildlife trade and humanity\u2019s excessive intrusion into nature is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading US scientist who says \u201cthis is not nature\u2019s revenge, we did it to ourselves\u201d.</p> <p>Scientists are discovering two to four new viruses are created every year as a result of human infringement on the natural world, and any one of those could turn into a pandemic, according to Thomas Lovejoy, who coined the term \u201cbiological diversity\u201d in 1980 and is often referred to as the godfather of biodiversity.</p> <p>\u201cThis pandemic is the consequence of our persistent and excessive intrusion in nature and the vast illegal wildlife trade, and in particular, the wildlife markets, the wet markets, of south Asia and bush meat markets of Africa\u2026 It\u2019s pretty obvious, it was just a matter of time before something like this was going to happen,\u201d said Lovejoy, a senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation and professor of environment science at George Mason University.</p> <p>His comments were made to mark the release of a report by the Center for American Progress arguing that the US should step up efforts to combat the wildlife trade to help confront pandemics.</p> <p>Wet markets are traditional markets selling live animals (farmed and wild) as well as fresh fruit, vegetables and fish, often in unhygienic conditions. They are found all over Africa and Asia, providing sustenance for hundreds of millions of people. The wet market in Wuhan believed to be the source of Covid-19 contained a number of wild animals, including foxes, rats, squirrels, wolf pups and salamanders.</p> <p>Lovejoy said separating wild animals from farmed animals in markets would significantly lower the risk of disease transmission. This is because there would be fewer new species for viruses to latch on to. \u201c[Domesticated animals] can acquire these viruses, but if that\u2019s all there was in the market, it would really lower the probability of a leak from a wild animal to a domesticated animal.\u201d</p> <p>He told the Guardian: \u201cThe name of the game is reducing certain amounts of activity so the probability of that kind of leap becomes small enough that it\u2019s inconsequential. The big difficulty is that if you just shut them down \u2013 which in many ways would be the ideal thing \u2013 they will be topped up with black markets, and that\u2019s even harder to deal with because it\u2019s clandestine.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic will cost the global economy $1tn this year, according to the World Economic Forum, with vulnerable communities impacted the most, and nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. \u201cThis is not nature\u2019s revenge, we did it to ourselves. The solution is to have a much more respectful approach to nature, which includes dealing with climate change and all the rest,\u201d Lovejoy said.</p> <p>His comments echo those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/08/human-impact-on-wildlife-to-blame-for-spread-of-viruses-says-study-aoe\">a study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B</a> earlier this month that suggested the underlying cause of the present pandemic was likely to be increased human contact with wildlife.</p> <p>Experts are divided about how to regulate the vast trade in animals, with many concerned the poorest are most at risk from a crackdown. Urgent action on the wildlife trade is clearly needed, said Dr Amy Dickman, a conservation biologist from the University of Oxford, but she was \u201calarmed\u201d by calls for indiscriminate bans on the wildlife trade.</p> <p>She is one of more than 250 signatories of an open letter to the World Health Organization and United Nations Environment Programme saying any transition must contribute to \u2013 and not detract from \u2013 the livelihoods of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, many of whom depend on wild resources for survival. Other signatories include representatives from the African Wildlife Foundation, the Frankfurt Zoological Society and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).</p> <p>The letter reads: \u201cCovid-19 is inflicting unprecedented social and economic costs on countries and communities, with the poor and vulnerable hardest hit. The virus\u2019s suspected links with a Chinese \u2018wet market\u2019 has led to calls to ban wet markets and restrict or end the trade, medicinal use and consumption of wildlife. However, indiscriminate bans and restrictions risk being inequitable and ineffective.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists and NGOs are concerned that over-simplistic and indiscriminate restrictions will exacerbate poverty and inequality, resulting in an increase in criminality. This could accelerate the exploitation and extinction of species in the wild, authors of the letter warn.</p> <p> \u201cPeople often seem more willing to point the finger at markets far away, as bans there will not affect their everyday lives \u2013 although they will often affect the rights of extremely vulnerable people,\u201d said Dickman.</p> <p>There are also concerns about the impacts of an outright ban on a number of indigenous populations, such as tribes in Orinoquia and Amazonia, with representatives describing it as an \u201cattack\u201d on their livelihoods.</p> <p>Mama Mouamfon, who is based in Cameroon and directs an NGO called Fondation Camerounaise de la Terre Vivante (FCTV), said banning the trade would damage livelihoods: \u201cBush meat is very important for people in the forest because it\u2019s one of the best ways to get animal protein. With this issue of poverty and people living in remote areas, it\u2019s not easy for them to look for good meat,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes people take decisions because they are sitting in an office and are very far from reality. If they knew our reality they would not take that [same] decision.\u201d</p>",

Mass public hygiene measures were rolled out, including disinfecting public areas and buildings.</p> \n<p>In all, Taiwan adopted 124 control and contain measures in weeks, making a full lockdown unnecessary. It has reported just six deaths, and is now dispatching millions of face masks to the worst-struck parts of the US and Europe. Tsai\u2019s warm, authoritative style has won her plaudits, even from political opponents.</p> \n<p> Norway, with 7,200 cases and 182 deaths, this week began relaxing its restrictions by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/nursery-but-not-as-they-knew-it-norway-adjusts-to-life-after-lockdown\">reopening kindergartens</a>. The prime minister, Erna Solberg, told CNN she had made a point of \u201cletting scientists make the big medical decisions\u201d, adding that she thought her country\u2019s early lockdown and thorough testing programme had been key.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Following an example set earlier by Frederiksen, Solberg also took the unusual step of directly addressing the country\u2019s children, telling them in two press conferences \u2013 from which adult journalists were banned \u2013 that it was \u201cpermitted to be a little bit scared\u201d and that she, too, missed being able to hug her friends.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Iceland, under the prime minister, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir\u2019s, leadership, has offered free testing to all citizens, not only those with symptoms, and has recorded 1,800 cases and 10 deaths. Some 12% of the population has taken up the offer, and an exhaustive tracing system has meant the country has not had to close schools.</p> \n<p>Finland\u2019s prime minister, Sanna Marin \u2013 who last year became the world\u2019s youngest head of government \u2013 also moved decisively to impose a strict lockdown, including a ban on all non-essential travel in and out of the Helsinki region. This has helped her country contain the spread of the virus to just 4,000 cases and 140 deaths, a per-million toll 10 times lower than that of neighbouring Sweden.</p> \n<p>Not all the women who have excelled in the corona crisis are national leaders. Jeong Eun-kyeong, the unflappable head of South Korea\u2019s centre for disease control, has become a national icon after overseeing a \u201ctest, trace, contain\u201d strategy that has made the country the world\u2019s coronavirus role-model, with daily infections in single digits and a death toll of less than 250.</p> \n<p>Jeong, a former rural doctor dubbed \u201cthe world\u2019s best virus hunter\u201d, <em><strong> </strong></em>has delivered no-nonsense daily press conferences, including demonstrating the ideal way to cough. While these have won praise, her work ethic \u2013 she has left an emergency operations bunker only for quick visits to a food truck \u2013 has prompted concern for her health.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"15ba1c07-a175-467d-89ed-756d44480b14\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kRNt8LQRWl4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Whatever conclusions we may draw from these leaders\u2019 performances during the pandemic, experts caution that while women are \u201cdisproportionately represented to a rather startling degree\u201d among countries managing the crisis well, dividing men and women heads of state and government into homogenous categories is not necessarily useful.</p> \n<p>Complicating factors may be at play. Kathleen Gerson, a professor of sociology at New York University, notes, for example, that women leaders are more likely to be elected in \u201ca political culture in which there\u2019s a relative support and trust in the government \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t make stark distinctions between women and men. So you\u2019ve already got a head start\u201d.</p> \n<p>In addition, it may be harder for men to escape \u201cthe way they are expected to behave\u201d as leaders, Gerson <a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/493434-countries-led-by-women-have-fared-better-against\">told The Hill</a> website. And since the very best leaders are both strong and decisive and capable of displaying feeling, women could, perhaps, \u201clead the way in showing that these are not competing and conflicting attributes, but complementary \u2013 and necessary for good leadership\u201d, she said.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 April 2020. An earlier version incorrectly described Sanna Marin as the world\u2019s youngest head of government.</p>",

Capacity for performing wellness checks on vulnerable residents will also be expanded. </p> \n  <p>Local agencies will begin distributing criteria on who qualifies for the program, but of highest priority are seniors who live below the poverty line and those with compromised immune systems. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThese programs will provide older, vulnerable Californians with access to nutritious meals in the safety of their homes and the opportunity to connect with someone who can listen to their concerns and make sure their needs are met. We are all in this together and we will continue to support older Californians who are more at risk during this public health emergency\u201d Newsom said in a press release.</p> \n  <p>The program, funded by the state and by <strong>FEMA</strong>, will provide three meals a day, seven days a week, with a daily cash value of up to $66. Newsom said the program could also mean relief for the restaurant industry and its workers. State and local governments will select which restaurants will be included in the program. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis will allow for restaurants to start rehiring people or keep people employed\u201d, he said. </p> \n  <p>Meantime, with warm weather expected in California over the weekend, Newsom reminded Californians that it\u2019s not yet time to greenlight the reopening of wide sections of society. </p> \n  <p>Yesterday California tallied 93 deaths, and the number of confirmed coronavirus cases ticked up 5% in the past 24 hours. Hospitalizations and admissions to ICUs, on the other hand, stayed largely flat. </p> \n  <p>California is a state but many parts, Newsom said, and the state will consider regional realities \u2014 like the number of cases and hospital capacity should outbreaks resurface \u2014 when deciding to ease stay-at-home orders. </p> \n  <p>In recent days, protestors have challenged stay-at-home orders in various states, including California.

Six current and former Trump advisors, including Miller, have ties to the group. </p> \n  <p>In a private call this week, Miller appeared to try and maintain restrictionists\u2019 favor by saying the ban was part of a long-term vision. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/stephen-miller-audio-immigration-coronavirus/2020/04/24/8eaf59ba-8631-11ea-9728-c74380d9d410_story.html\">According to the Washington Post</a>, Miller said of the executive order: \u201cIt is vital, it is necessary, it is patriotic and it deserves the full-throated support of everybody on this call.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The Trump administration has already made dramatic changes to immigration in the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/15/invisible-wall-trump-policies-have-curbed-immigration\">through policies big and small</a>. So, the vision is already in place. </p> \n  <p>This is why the ban, with its exceptions, was interpreted as a largely political move. To have it be criticized by the people it is meant to appease is a problem for Miller above all others. </p> \n  <p>In addition to the call, the far-right website <strong>Breitbart News</strong> had an exclusive story today saying the original ban was more expansive.

Medical experts, politicians and even disinfectant makers denounced the suggestion and warned the public against consuming the product.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, even as the US death toll topped 50,000, Trump tried to make what critics saw as a desperate and dishonest u-turn. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\u201d the president, sitting at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, told reporters as he signed emergency funding legislation.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen I was asking a sarcastic \u2013 a very sarcastic question \u2013 to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.\u201d</p> \n  <p>A video of the briefings demonstrates otherwise. </p> \n  <p>When Trump posed the question about the efficacy of disinfectant injections, he had turned to his right and was looking in the direction of <strong>Bill Bryan</strong>, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology, and <strong>Deborah Birx</strong>, the coronavirus task force coordinator.</p> \n  <p><strong>Reuters</strong> reporter <strong>Jeff Mason</strong> asked if Trump wanted to clarify that he was being sarcastic and ensure no one misunderstood him. </p> \n  <p>He replied: \u201cYes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But returning to the effect of sunlight, he added: \u201cI\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. But maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.\u201d</p> \n  <p>One more time, Mason gamely pressed: \u201cJust to clarify, you\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump: \u201cNo. Of course not. Interior-wise, it was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinarily hostile people, namely the fake news media.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Mason answered: \u201cSome doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump said: \u201cOf course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Mason shot back: \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t, sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Weijia Jiang</strong> of <strong>CBS News </strong>pointed out that Trump had been looking at Birx. Changing his story, Trump claimed: \u201cI was looking at Bill. I was looking at the doctor. I was looking at some of the reporters. I don\u2019t know if you were there. Were you there? </p> \n  <p>Jiang said: \u201cI was there and I watched you ask her.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump, who has clashed with Jiang in the briefing room, added: \u201cYou were there. You were there. You I never forget.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The jumbled, inaccurate assertions are likely to have the opposite of the desired effect, only deepening concerns about Trump\u2019s embrace of flawed science that could endanger public health.</p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Gottlieb</strong>, Trump\u2019s former <strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong> director, told <strong>CNBC</strong>: </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think we need to speak very clearly. There\u2019s no circumstance under which you should take a disinfectant or inject a disinfectant for the treatment of anything, and certainly not the treatment of coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no circumstance in which that\u2019s appropriate, and it can cause death and very adverse outcomes, so people should not be doing that if that was an impression that was left by any of the reporting around comments that have been made in the last 24 hours.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea33b128f08e05690dc4319\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T19:19:03.758Z\">8.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Navy leader recommends reinstating fired captain</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Officials with the US Navy recommended the reinstatement of the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.</p> \n  <p>Roosevelt was fired after he pleaded for help with a coronavirus outbreak onboard.

Now disinfectant or doing this maybe on the hands would work. I was asking the question of the gentleman who was there yesterday, Bill [Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology], because when they say that something will last three to four hours or six hours, but if sun is out, or if they use disinfectant, it goes away in less than a minute. Did you hear about this yesterday?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: When I was asking a sarcastic \u2014 a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.</p> \n  <p> Reporter: But you were asking your medical experts to look into it.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: To look into whether or not sun \u2014 and disinfectant on the hands \u2014 but whether or not sun can help us. Because, I mean he came in yesterday and he said they\u2019ve done a big study. This is a study. This isn\u2019t where he hasn\u2019t done it. This is where they\u2019ve come in with a final report that sun has a massive impact negatively on this virus. In other words, it does not live well with humidity and it doesn\u2019t live well with sun, sunlight, heat. It doesn\u2019t live well with heat and sun and and disinfectant. And that\u2019s what I brought up, and I thought that was clear.</p> \n  <p> Jeff Mason [Reuters journalist]: Just to follow up on the comments from yesterday you said you were being sarcastic, but some people may have misunderstood you. Do you want to just clarify?</p> \n  <p>POTUS: I wish they [\u2026]</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Do you want to clarify to Americans if you don\u2019t want people to think that?</p> \n  <p>POTUS. Yes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do. So, he\u2019s going to check because a hard surface. This is a hard surface I guess maybe depending on whose hand you\u2019re talking about, right? But this is a hard surface and disinfectant, disinfectant has an unbelievable \u2014 it wipes it out. You saw it? Sun and heat, and humidity and you wipe it out. And this is from tests \u2014 they\u2019ve been doing these tests for a number of months. And the result \u2014 so then I said, \u2018Well, how do we do it inside the body or even outside the body with the hands and disinfectant I think would work.\u2019 He thinks it would work. When you use it when you\u2019re doing your hands. I guess that\u2019s one of the reasons they say wash your hands, but whether it\u2019s washing hands or disinfectant on your hands, it\u2019s very good. So, they\u2019re going to start looking at that. And there is a way of, you know, if light \u2014 if sun, sun itself that sun has a tremendous impact on or kills it like in one \u2014 it goes from what was it? Hours to like one minute instead.</p> \n  <p>So, I said you got to go back and look, but I\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. but maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Just to clarify: You\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: No. Of course not\u2026It was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinary hostile people. Namely, the fake news media.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Some doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments.</p> \n  <p>POTUS: Of course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you.</p> \n  <p> Jeff Mason: No you weren\u2019t sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.</p> \n  <p> Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: What\u2019s that?</p> \n  <p> Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: I was looking at Bill. I was looking at the doctor. I was looking at some of the reporters. I don\u2019t know if you were there. Were you there?</p> \n  <p>Weijia Jiang: I was there and I watched you ask her.</p> \n  <p>POTUS: You were there. You were there. You I never forget.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.</p> \n  <p>POTUS: You were not?</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: No sir.</p> \n  <p>POTUS: Yeah.

A further 10.8% of people caught the virus at hospital and 4.2% in the workplace. <br></p> \n  <p>Another team of Italian scientists has said the coronavirus may have reached Italy from Germany, not directly from China, in the second half of January. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T15:40:59.743Z\">at 4.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea301bc8f08fa2bdcb1adb5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T15:20:24.713Z\">4.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK reports 684 more deaths from Covid-19 in hospitals</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The UK has reported 684 more deaths in hospitals from Covid-19, bringing the total death toll in the country to 19,506, according to a daily report from health authorities. </p> \n  <p>Friday\u2019s update from the Department of Health and Social Care also showed an increase of 5,386 confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the UK total to 143,464. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1253688601637986304\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As of 9am 24 April, 612,031 tests have concluded, with 28,532 tests on 23 April. <br><br>444,222 people have been tested of which 143,464 tested positive. <br><br>As of 5pm on 23 April, of those hospitalised in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus, 19,506 have sadly died. <a href=\"https://t.co/ixQBaugnGh\">pic.twitter.com/ixQBaugnGh</a></p>\u2014 Department of Health and Social Care (@DHSCgovuk) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1253688601637986304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 24, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>For more detailed updates from the UK, click below: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/24/uk-coronavirus-live-warning-mass-vaccinations-covid-19-latest-updates\">UK coronavirus live: UK hospital death toll rises by 684 to 19,506</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea300bb8f0845d1c895d2f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T15:08:05.354Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the <strong>Netherlands</strong> rose by 806 to 36,535, health authorities said on Friday, with 112 new deaths.</p> \n  <p>The country\u2019s overall death toll is now 4,289, the Netherlands\u2019 Institute for Public Health (RIVM) said.

Currently there are typically more than 2,000 new infections every day.</p> \n  <p>According to the RKI, Germany has 150,383 confirmed cases, a rise of 2,337 from Thursday, and 5,321 people have died from the virus. </p> \n  <p>But due to a delay in the central collation of figures, the real number of cases is said by reliable health watchers gathering statistics on the L\u00e4nder level, to be more than 3,000 higher, and the number of deaths just under 300 more than the RKI\u2019s figures.</p> \n  <p>The current reproduction rate in Germany is 0.9 - which means every person with the infection is passing it on to one other person. This is up from 0.7 a week ago, but virologists consider one and under to be good.</p> \n  <p>Schaade said keeping the restrictions was necessary because in order to be able to keep the disease under control, health authorities around the country have to be in a position to be able to identify each case and trace their contacts, to place them in immediate isolation. If the number of new infections grows too quickly, the tracking and tracing process becomes too unwieldy a task, and the situation could quickly get out of control, he said.</p> \n  <p>He said unlike in Italy, France and Spain, there was so far no evidence of excess mortality in Germany - that is, a death rate higher than the usual average death rate for this time of year. This was, he said, due to the fact that Germany was able to tackle the illness early on, largely through testing, and dampen its spread, and therefore treated many coronavirus cases effectively, without lessening hospitals\u2019 ability to treat other illnesses.</p> \n  <p>Referring to the pressure being placed on authorities to relax measures, which he advised against strongly, Schaade said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is a paradox, that due to the success of the measures that have been taken ... these very measures are now being called into question.</p> \n   <p>That Germany has come through this epidemic comparatively well so far, is thanks to the measures we have taken. The number of cases has stayed at a level with which the health system has been able to cope, and it must stay that way. We cannot afford to become lax. With respect to the first relaxation of measures, this must not be allowed to lead to a landslide of other subsequent easing that could have serious consequences.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said quite simply, that more contact would automatically lead to more infections \u201cand when there are more infections a dynamic will develop again very quickly with rising infection rates which in the worst case, could bring us to a point where the epidemic is no longer manageable.</p> \n  <p>In short, Schaade said, his \u201cemphatic plea\u201d was for people to stick to the recommendations: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Stay at home, stay away from others, keep the 1.5 metre - or even better 2 metre distance, keep to the coughing and sneezing rules, and on public transport or shops, wear mouth-nose cover to protect others.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He recognised, he said, that \u201cmany people are running out of strength, and many are suffering from existential angst. Believe me, I\u2019d like nothing more than to tell you it\u2019s over...but unfortunately it\u2019s not over.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea2da8a8f08e05690dc3da5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:34:50.853Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While social distancing and national lockdowns have been credited with slowing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, governments and experts have said the only permanent way out is through a <strong tabindex=\"-1\">vaccine</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Vaccine development usually takes years, meaning that teams around the world are considering a range of risks and shortcuts to bring one to market in a much shorter time. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Hannah Devlin</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s science correspondent, has looked at four different approaches being taken by research teams around the world, ranging from classic weakened viruses, to genetically modified forms, to revolutionary approaches using DNA and RNA. </p> \n  <p>But, as she writes, there is a chance none of them will work, or that they may have serious unintended side-effects. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-perilous-and-uncertain-path\">The hunt for a coronavirus vaccine \u2013 a perilous and uncertain path</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:40:12.444Z\">at 1.40pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea2d58b8f08fa2bdcb1aaf1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T12:05:57.027Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Italy \"to ease lockdown\", local media reports</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Newspapers in Italy are reporting that the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, the longest and toughest in Europe, is to be eased over the next four weeks.

They point to the high number of coronavirus deaths in elder-care homes and Sweden\u2019s overall fatality rate, which is higher than that of its Nordic neighbours \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.svt.se/datajournalistik/the-spread-of-the-coronavirus/\">131 per million people</a>, compared with 55 per million in Denmark and 14 per million in Finland, which have adopted lockdowns.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What is striking, to me at least, is Tegnell\u2019s statement that we still do not know about coronavirus, the way it behaves or the way it spreads - in contrast to the UK government\u2019s insistence that \u201cwe are following the science\u201d.

We have looked at a number of European Union countries to see whether they have published any analysis of the effects of these measures before they were started and we saw almost none.</p> \n   <p>Closing borders, in my opinion, is ridiculous, because Covid-19 is in every European country now. We have more concerns about movements inside Sweden.</p> \n   <p>As a society, we are more into nudging: continuously reminding people to use measures, improving measures where we see day by day the that they need to be adjusted.

It has asked its citizens to avoid non-essential travel, work from home and stay indoors if they are over 70 or are feeling ill - but there has been no enforced lockdown.</p> \n  <p>The country has seen a higher death rate than its neighbours. Yesterday, the Public Health Agency of Sweden said it had recorded 16,755 confirmed cases, and 2,021 deaths with the coronavirus. And there has been anger in the country that older people have borne the brunt of the strategy, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">as reported by my colleague Richard Orange</a>. </p> \n  <p>Lena Einhorn, a virologist who has been one of the leading domestic critics of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus policy, told the Observer<em>. </em></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>They have to admit that it\u2019s a huge failure, since they have said the whole time that their main aim has been to protect the elderly. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Tegnall today said Sweden\u2019s strategy put it in a better place to deal with a second wave of coronavirus as the country\u2019s scientists estimated there was now around 15-20% immunity in the population \u2013 not enough for herd immunity, but enough to slow and control the spread of the disease. </p> \n  <p>Asked if the policy had worked, Tegnall said the aim had been to slow the progression of the disease so its healthcare system did not become overwhelmed. </p> \n  <p>It has worked in some aspects. The health service has been able to cope \u2013 20% of ICU beds have been empty and able to take coronavirus patients at all times. </p> \n  <p>In terms of death toll, Sweden had seen \u201cabout the same results as other countries\u201d, he said. </p> \n  <p>Asked about the fact that there are more deaths in Sweden than in other Scandinavian countries, he said that as many as 50% of deaths had come in care homes for the elderly \u2013 which have banned visitors. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how a lockdown would have stopped that,\u201d he said. Asked if the strategy had resulted in more deaths, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a difficult question and I don\u2019t think we have the answer and I don\u2019t know if we will ever get the answer. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Sweden estimates it passed the peak of the disease last week, and hopes it will be better placed to deal with any further outbreaks</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We hope this will make it easier for us in the long run. Other part of the reasoning is we want something sustainable, if we need mitigation we can go on doing this for a long time, if looks like going to get second wave in the fall we can easily continue doing what we are doing now. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T06:54:26.116Z\">at 7.54am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea281f48f08163fabe47a2c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T06:08:52.864Z\">7.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m handing over the blog to my colleague in the UK, Alexandra Topping.

As an introvert, I am really looking forward to spending this month focusing inwards, without the burden of social responsibility.</p> \n   <p>Ramadan in 2020 means no communal gatherings in mosques for \u201ctarawih\u201d night prayers, no large \u201ciftar\u201d dinners with family and friends at sunset to break the day\u2019s fast,and, sadly, restrictions on celebrating Eid, the biggest social holiday for Muslims signalling the end of Ramadan.</p> \n   <p>In this time of physical distancing, as Muslims we will be forced to reconnect to our God and the Qur\u2019an on a deeply intimate level. Interestingly enough, this is the authentic practice of Prophet Muhammad. He would isolate himself for days in a cave at the top of a mountain to introspect, reflect, worship and connect with God. During each of the 10 days of Ramadan, he was known to self-isolate in a spiritual seclusion practice known as \u201citik\u0101f\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/ramadan-during-coronavirus-may-seem-disheartening-but-its-the-ideal-time-for-reflection\">Ramadan during coronavirus may seem disheartening but it's the ideal time for reflection | Heba Shaheed</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T03:55:57.153Z\">at 4.55am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea25a498f082ab274335cfd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T03:22:39.222Z\">4.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e659c15540987049599987a1811d4086f6c9e57\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e659c15540987049599987a1811d4086f6c9e57/0_108_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"About 90 people onboard the cruise ship Costa Atlantica have tested positive for the coronavirus.
