class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>UK </strong>researchers have called for the use of additional coronavirus symptoms to detect new cases, reduce infections and save lives.</p> \n  <p>In a letter published in The Lancet journal, the King\u2019s College London team discussed how loss of taste and smell should form part of screening measures for the virus.</p> \n  <p>The researchers, led by Professor Tim Spector, previously reported that loss of smell and taste is a key predictor of Covid-19 in addition to the most established symptoms of a high temperature and a new, continuous cough.</p> \n  <p>On May 18, the symptoms were added to the NHS coronavirus symptoms list, weeks after experts first raised concerns that Covid-19 cases were being missed.</p> \n  <p>However, the importance of the symptom was disputed by some.</p> \n  <p>The researchers\u2019 additional analysis of the Covid Symptom Study app data and its 3.7 million users sought to quantify the clinical value of recording loss of smell in the population.</p> \n  <p>They said: \u201cAs countries slowly emerge from lockdown measures, it is imperative to correctly contact-trace infected individuals.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe believe that having added loss of smell and taste to the list of Covid-19 symptoms is of great value as it will help tracing almost 16% of cases that otherwise would have been missed.\u201d</p> \n  <p>From 76,260 people with symptoms who tested positive for coronavirus up to May 19, 28.5% never reported any fever or cough and 16% reported loss of smell but not fever or cough.</p> \n  <p>Researchers say the prevalence of loss of smell and taste was three-fold higher in individuals testing positive (65%) than in those testing negative (22%), the strongest single predictor of being infected.</p> \n  <p>They suggest this means people with loss of smell and taste should self-isolate for at least seven days or until they can be tested.</p> \n  <p>Prof Spector said: \u201cWe believe that loss of smell and taste is a very common Covid-19 symptom, and in fact occurs more often than fever and lasts longer (five days on average compared to only two for fever).</p> \n  <p>\u201cInfections could be reduced and lives saved now that this non-flu-like symptom is widely recognised and actions are taken.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The researchers suggest that policymakers should consider these findings and their implications for mass screening as part of other public health measures in key areas such as schools, hospitals, airports and care homes.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed976798f0831e23dc1967d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time

<strong>Brazil\u2019s</strong> indigenous populations with deaths caused by the disease increasing more than five-fold in the past month, according to data.</p> \n  <p> Many epidemiologists had hoped remote locations might protect the tribes, but the virus, which first took hold in state capitals of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, is increasingly devastating these far-flung communities where basic healthcare is often precarious.</p> \n  <p> Deaths among Brazil\u2019s indigenous populations rose to 182 by June 1, from 28 at the end of April, according to the Articulation of Brazil\u2019s Indigenous Peoples (APIB), a national umbrella association that brings together the country\u2019s 305 tribes.</p> \n  <p>In the village of Soror\u00f3 in southeastern Par\u00e1, tribesman

England from June 15.<br></p> \n  <p>However, face-covering measures can help prevent the spread of Covid-19 and \u201cshould not be restricted to public transport\u201d, according to BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul.</p> \n  <p>Dr Nagpaul said the risk of the virus would be \u201cmuch less\u201d if the public wears face coverings straight away instead of waiting for the mid-June start date.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cThe BMA recently advocated the wearing of face coverings by the public several weeks ago in areas where they cannot socially distance and believes it is right that people should be required to wear face coverings on public transport.</p> \n  <p>\u201cGiven there remains a considerable risk of infection, with thousands of new cases every day, wearing masks can reduce the spread of the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNot only will this afford greater protection to the public, importantly it will protect the lives of the staff working on public transport who, as evidence suggests, are at greater risk of infection.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese important measures should not be restricted to public transport but to all areas where social distancing is not always possible - the risk will be much less if the public adopts this now - not mid-June.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed96e038f0854eb54d99115\" class=\"block\"

The airline has since said that no one was found to be infected when they boarded the plane in Doha. </p> \n  <p>Speaking on Skai TV today, professor Nikolaos Sypsas, a member of the scientific committee that advises the government, said tourism would be \u201cthe first candidate\u201d for restrictive measures being reinstated in the event of a recurrence. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWith tourism comes imported cases. Despite the efforts underway to have the least possible danger, the risk remains.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Greek authorities, enforcing emergency health protocols, suspended flights to and from Qatar and quarantined all those on board - for 14 days in the case of those who tested positive, and an initial seven days for those who tested negative. If found to be clear at the end of a week those cleared of the virus will be free to go. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe incident has shown how complicated tourism is,\u201d said professor Sypsas. As of 15 June blanket testing of plane passengers will be replaced by random \u2018spot\u2019 testing, he explained, because Greece simply didn\u2019t have the capability of testing everyone flying in and the EU had decided against endorsing such a move. </p> \n  <p>\u201cPlaying with this virus is like playing with fire,\u201d the expert lamented saying it was vital that countries were separated into categories of risk. </p> \n  <p>Both Albania and north Macedonia, Greece\u2019s northern neighbours, had seen a rise in confirmed coronavirus cases as a result of relaxing precautionary measures, he noted. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe biggest danger, as far as the epidemic is concerned, is complacency.

In an attempt to bolster their narrative that they can run Afghanistan better than the struggling administration, the Taliban launched a campaign to tackle the virus in March.

  "<p>The Trump administration continued to weaken core environmental protections in the US by announcing a pair of policies to cut reviews for large infrastructure projects and downplay the health benefits of rules to curb pollution.</p> <p>Both changes could disproportionately hurt communities of color, which are far more likely to live with pollution because of decades of environmental racism. They come after a week of nationwide protests over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">police killings</a> of black Americans.&nbsp;</p> <p>The proposals could also make it easier for the government to ignore the climate crisis in making decisions.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the policies came as an executive order from Donald Trump instructing agencies to use emergency authorities to bypass bedrock environmental laws and speed federal approvals for highways and oil and gas pipelines. The order said it is meant to accelerate the recovery from the \u201cdramatic downturn\u201d in the economy and high unemployment from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIn light of this and other developments, I have determined that, without intervention, the United States faces the likelihood of a potentially protracted economic recovery with persistent high unemployment,\u201d the order said.</p> <p>\u201cA public health crisis is not an excuse to drill, mine and pave our public lands, and the American people won\u2019t fall for it,\u201d said Jesse Prentice-Dunn, policy director of the Center for Western Priorities. \u201cThis order will almost certainly increase environmental injustice across America..\u201d</p> <p>Research and history clearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/our-unequal-earth\">demonstrate</a> that pollution, ecological hazards and climate disasters have the worst impacts on people of color, indigenous Americans and the poor.&nbsp;</p> <p>Critics immediately questioned Trump\u2019s authority to implement the executive order, which aims to override the normal procedures under laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa), the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act.</p> <p>Joel Mintz, a former EPA enforcement and supervisory attorney, said: \u201cIt is far from clear that the president has the legal authority to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency chief, Andrew Wheeler, on Thursday also proposed new guidelines for how the agency weighs the costs that a regulation places on an industry and its customers versus the health benefits it provides to the public.</p> <p>The proposal applies to rules under the Clean Air Act. Wheeler said the agency intends to complete similar proposals for water, land and chemical rules within the next three years.&nbsp;</p> <p>The agency typically takes into account all the benefits of a regulation, even if they are unintentional. For example, a rule targeting mercury from coal plants also reduced particle pollution, as well as carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to the climate crisis. In deciding whether the rule was necessary, the agency tallied all the benefits of each reduction and stacked them up against the costs the industry would incur.</p> <p>Wheeler said the agency will still calculate and consider those co-benefits but will not use them to justify future regulations.</p> <p>Miles Keogh, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies \u2013 which represents state and local air regulators \u2013 said that as described by Wheeler, \u201cthe rule cuts out the most important factor to consider when the agency is trying to decide whether an action protecting public health is worth it, which is public health.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to decide whether to quit smoking based only on the price of a pack of cigarettes.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The government should cut taxes and overhaul the Bank of England\u2019s \u201crestrictive\u201d remit as part of a radical new pro-growth strategy to accelerate the recovery from the coronavirus crisis, according to a free market thinktank with close ties to the Conservative party.</p> <p>Policy Exchange, which was co-founded by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, warned ministers to take a relaxed view of rising levels of debt and use cheap credit to boost the economy and protect jobs.</p> <p>Amid widespread concern that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/what-will-coronavirus-mean-for-the-british-economy\">the coronavirus pandemic will push unemployment to levels last seen in the 1980s</a>, the thinktank said cheap borrowing costs would allow the Treasury to increase the deficit further to boost growth.</p> <p>It recommends a cut to VAT and stamp duty on house sales to boost consumer spending and kickstart the housing market.</p> <p>The chancellor is known to be concerned at the rising public spending deficit, which could top \u00a3320bn this year and push the UK\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio above 100%. He has come under pressure from some quarters of the Tory party to reveal what tax rises he would impose as part of an austerity package over the rest of the parliament to reduce the deficit.</p> <p>Policy Exchange is one of the most prominent free market thinktanks to accept that government cash should be used to rebuild the economy over the next few years, though others, including the Adam Smith Institute, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/thatcherite-thinktanks-back-increase-public-spending-in-lockdown\">have argued against a return to austerity</a>.</p> <p>Policy Exchange consultant Gerard Lyons, who was economic adviser to Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London, said the Bank of England should be forced to develop policies that achieve a GDP growth rate of 4% before inflation. This will allow it to be more aggressive in its stimulus programme.</p> <p>At the moment Threadneedle Street uses its firepower to keep inflation \u201canchored\u201d at about 2%, which critics, including Lyons, believe makes it more restrained in its actions. At the central bank\u2019s last meeting, seven members of its nine-strong interest rate setting committee voted against a \u00a3100bn increase in its financial stimulus programme, citing concerns of a long-term increase in inflation.</p> <p>Lyons said inflation was gong to remain low for a long time and so would interest rates. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/inflation-tumbled-uk-lowest-level-four-years-april-ons\">Inflation&nbsp;in April tumbled to 0.8%</a>, its lowest level in four years, as the demand for goods collapsed during the lockdown.</p> <p>Polling by Policy Exchange of public attitudes to debt and taxes showed there was no appetite for a return to austerity. A majority feared a rise in taxes to pay down the nation\u2019s debts.</p> <p>Only 16% of those polled&nbsp;support spending reductions that would impact public services, while 49% of the public said tax rises should be limited as the government seeks to deal with the coronavirus fallout.&nbsp;</p> <p>The thinktank said in its pro-growth economic strategy paper: \u201cThe low cost of debt means the UK should not attempt a fiscal consolidation post-crisis and let higher debt take the strain of higher spending and borrowing.</p> <p>\u201cCuts to spending, or increases in taxation, run the risk of undermining any recovery and make little sense in the current economic environment,\u201d it added.</p> <p>Warwick Lightfoot, the thinktank\u2019s head of economics and a co-author of the report, said: \u201cIn the present crisis, perhaps the most serious since the 1930s, when monetary&nbsp;policy&nbsp;is not available as an effective instrument of macro-economic stimulus, the costs for governments of using debt and fiscal&nbsp;policy&nbsp;are at their lowest in modern financial history.</p> <p>\u201cThe combination of very low inflation and a surplus of international savings has resulted in extraordinarily low interest rates and long-term government bond yields. This is not the time to hold back on borrowing.\u201d</p>",

The pollution peaked whenever the Chilean national football team played and people did not have work on the following day. The peaks could even be linked to the kick-off times. But they were not due to fans travelling to the stadium, they were caused by those who stayed at home.

The bakery chain Greggs has borrowed \u00a3150m, while Marks &amp; Spencers took \u00a3260m and fast fashion online retailer Asos has secured \u00a3100m. John Lewis and the luxury fashion house Burberry have each borrowed \u00a3300m.</p> <p>It is understood the loan to Burberry was undertaken as a contingency measure in the case of a protracted period of store closures. Asos said it had borrowed money as a precautionary measure to give it flexibility through an uncertain period. \u201cAt the same time, we raised capital from our shareholders to further support the business,\u201d it said in a statement.</p> <p>The construction firm JCB, owned by the billionaire Bamford family, who were prominent Tory donors and Vote Leave backers, has secured a \u00a3600m loan. The company described the loan support as insurance and \u201cprudent financial management\u201d.</p> <p>Others included Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur and the brewer Youngs.

This is from Mick Cash, general secretary of the <strong>Rail, Maritime and Transport</strong> union (RMT).</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The RMT has been campaigning for compulsory wearing of masks on public transport and this is long overdue, but we fear this announcement is being driven not by safety concerns but by the premature easing of the lockdown which is swelling passenger numbers and making social distancing on transport increasingly impossible</p> \n   <p>By themselves, face masks are nowhere near enough to protect passengers and worker safety on public transport. They need to be combined with preventing non-essential travel and compulsory enforcement of two-metre social distancing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is from Mick Whelan, the general secretary of <strong>Aslef,</strong> which represents train drivers.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is a sensible step by the secretary of state for transport. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain\u2019s train, and tube, network is done in a safe and controlled manner - to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing - for the safety of passengers and staff. The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And this is from Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the <strong>TSSA</strong> transport union.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is a welcome step by the government which will lower the transmission of this deadly virus among those using public transport in the weeks and months to come.</p> \n   <p>However, it\u2019s also important to stress that people must not interpret the use of a face covering as a licence to breach social distancing measures as lockdown eases. A physical distance of at least two metres between passengers and/or staff must be maintained at all times as this remains the most effective measure to control the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TSSAunion/status/1268578478393360391\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">TSSA General Secretary, Manuel Cortes, has backed the announcement from Government that face coverings will be mandatory across public <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/transport?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#transport</a> from Monday 15th June in England. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID%E3%83%BC19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID\u30fc19</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ZVbCycU7ZM\">https://t.co/ZVbCycU7ZM</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/NpobdIpAQB\">pic.twitter.com/NpobdIpAQB</a></p>\u2014 TSSA (@TSSAunion) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TSSAunion/status/1268578478393360391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 4, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T17:37:58.501Z\">at 6.37pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed91d4e8f0871ff85fc573d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T16:48:32.187Z\">5.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Scottish ministers are paving the way for cuts in the size and number of Scotland\u2019s universities and colleges after announcing a review of \u201cfuture provision and sustainability\u201d due to the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p>Richard Lochhead, the Scottish education minister, said he had commissioned the Scottish Funding Council to review the funding, provision and delivery of teaching and research across the higher and further education sectors.</p> \n  <p>He said the SFC, the government agency that funds and polices the country\u2019s colleges and universities, had forecast operating deficits of between \u00a3383m and \u00a3651m in the next academic year due to the lost income from overseas students, rental and research income and the costs of providing socially-distanced teaching. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/10/uk-universities-fear-huge-budget-holes-as-chinese-students-stay-home\">UK universities fear huge budget holes as Chinese students stay home</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>University executives had already expected the SFC to review of the affordability and size of Scotland\u2019s higher and further education sectors, before the pandemic shattered their funding model, with guarantees free tuition for Scottish and EU citizens.</p> \n  <p> The SFC does not fully fund the costs of Scottish and EU places, and expects universities and colleges to cross-subsidise those costs by attracting increasing numbers of overseas and rest of the UK students who are charged full tuition.</p> \n  <p> That overseas market is expected to collapse because of the coronavirus, while the UK government has announced it plans to cap the number of English students allowed to go to Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish universities.

The spokesman said that the meeting, like all meetings at No 10, was \u201cproperly socially distanced\u201d and that the participants stayed more than 2 metres apart. The spokesman said that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works#people-who-develop-symptoms-of-coronavirus\">the test and trace guidance </a>was \u201cnot as simple as saying if you have been in a room with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you are required to self-isolate\u201d. People have to self-isolate if they have had face-to-face contact, at a distance of less than 1 metre, with someone who tests positive, or if they have spent more than 15 minutes within two metres of that person. But the spokesman did not go as far as saying that he was confident that Johnson would not be asked to self-isolate if Sharma tested positive. Asked if Johnson would comply if he were asked to self-isolate, the spokesman said: \u201cWe would follow the advice given by the medical experts.\u201d The spokesman also said that the cabinet room was \u201cvigorously cleaned\u201d yesterday, but that that was usual practice and happened every day.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street is not reconsidering the government\u2019s move to abandon virtual sittings of the House of Commons in the light of Sharma\u2019s illness, the spokesman said.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to deny a report on Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches last night saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed638158f084df971c8e2ac#block-5ed638158f084df971c8e2ac\">Johnson told his Italian counterpart on 13 March that he wanted \u201cherd immunity\u201d.</a></strong> Asked about the report, the spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The position of the government is that herd immunity has never been its policy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the spokesman did not deny that Johnson had said the words attributed to him in the programme and, when asked if he was willing to clarify this directly with the PM, he suggested there was no need because he had made the position clear.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said 171,829 tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday.</strong> But the government had the capacity to carry out 220,213, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-tens-thousands-covid-19-tests-voided-decision-send/\">the Telegraph story (paywall)</a> saying that tens of thousands of coronavirus tests were returned void after being sent to a US laboratory for analysis.</strong> He said 67,000 tests had been sent to the US, and 29,500 were returned void.

That may be because some politicians are calculating that what the public really wants most at the end of all this is not change, but something approximating to what life was like before. Boris Johnson has said nothing at all about how the crisis could be a catalyst for progressive change.

The question today is whether it will be expanded or whether the central bank will hold fire until July.<br></p> <p>Many analysts expect the ECB to up buying by \u20ac500bn, as purchases at their current rate are expected to run out by October. <br></p> <p> <strong>Derek Halpenny</strong>, head of research at <strong>MUFG</strong>, an investment bank, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> We think today is the day in which the ECB needs to reinforce the perception of European authorities finally getting to grips with the scale of the Covid-19 hit with further QE action.</p> <p> A failure to act today would imply consideration is being given to only running the program until September which would result in considerable anxiety amongst investorsthat would result in an immediatetightening of financial market conditions. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Seema Shah, </strong>chief strategist at <strong>Principal Global Investors</strong>, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the ECB only having spent a third of the \u20ac750bn [Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme], anything less than a \u20ac500bn expansion will be a disappointment and could undo the recent weeks of market strength. Although equity markets seem to believe a V-shaped economic recovery is underway, the reality is that the euro area economy continues to struggle under the weight of the coronavirus crisis and the ECB cannot afford to delay additional stimulus. </p> </blockquote> <p>Focus is also on whether the bank will expand purchases to include \u201cfallen angels\u201d - companies that have lost their investment-grade ratings during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>That would give the ECB more room for manoeuvre and help parts of the economy that might need it more.<br></p> <h2>Thoughts on the eurozone\u2019s fiscal stimulus<br></h2> <p>The EU is wending its way towards a recovery fund to pull together governments across the bloc into a massive fiscal stimulus. But with sensitivities around the politics of risk sharing (opposed by some northern European countries), Lagarde has a delicate balance to strike.<br></p> <p><strong>Commerzbank </strong>told clients that the desire to keep pressure up on governments could lead to the ECB delaying its QE announcement:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will be a very close call with the hawks potentially swaying a consensus-minded President Lagarde to defer the announcement, also to keep pressure on the politicians to deliver on the EU Commission\u2019s \u20ac750bn Next Generation EU Fund. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul Donovan</strong>, an analyst at investment bank <strong>UBS</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ECB President Lagarde will be happy that someone is doing fiscal stimulus (as the pandemic is a problem for fiscal policy, not central bank policy). Today\u2019s meeting should continue to emphasise the need for quantitative policy to support financial markets and ensure sufficient liquidity in the economy. <br></p> </blockquote> <h2>Updated economic forecasts</h2> <p>Everyone and their dog knows that the eurozone economy is in recession, but the question is how deep is it. </p> <p>Lagarde has already dismissed the \u201cmild\u201d scenario of a 5% fall in output this year. That leaves a decline of between 8% and 12% in GDP - twice as deep as after the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>If inflation forecasts are also weak that would support the case for more stimulus from the ECB.<br></p> <h2>The German court ruling</h2> <p>Looming over the ECB\u2019s bond purchases is the German constitutional court ruling that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/jolt-to-eurozone-as-german-court-warns-against-central-bank-stimulus\">may have exceeded its mandate</a> by directly financing government spending. The Karlsruhe court said the ECB must carry out a \u201cproportionality assessment\u201d within three months in its 5 May ruling.<br></p> <p>Lagarde has insisted the ruling will leave the bank \u201cundeterred\u201d in battling the crisis. Acting now could make it less likely that any support is withdrawn at a later date.<br></p> <p>Principal\u2019s Shah said:<strong><br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Close attention will also be paid to any hints that that last month\u2019s German Constitutional Court ruling will tie the ECB\u2019s hands in future, with the euro\u2019s longest winning streak in six years at risk.

  "<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) broke the law in approving agricultural weedkilling products sold by Bayer and two other chemical giants, ignoring clear evidence that the new herbicides would cause widespread damage to crops, a federal court ruled on Wednesday.</p> <p>The decision by the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit invalidates the registrations for dicamba-based herbicides made by Monsanto, which is owned by Bayer AG,&nbsp;BASF and Corteva Agrisciences that are designed to be sprayed on genetically engineered soybeans and cotton. The court order effectively makes it illegal for farmers to continue to use the dicamba herbicides this summer as they tend to millions of acres of crops.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a stinging rebuke, the court said it had no choice but to cancel the EPA\u2019s approval of the herbicides because the agency had strayed so far from its duty to properly assess the dangers presented by the \u201cnew use\u201d of dicamba.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe EPA made multiple errors in granting the conditional registrations<a href=\"https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Court-decision-on-dicamba.pdf\">,\u201d the court said. </a>&nbsp;</p> <p>The petition seeking to overturn the EPA\u2019s approval was brought by the National Family Farm Coalition, Center for Food Safety, Center for Biological Diversity and Pesticide Action Network North America.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a massive win for farmers and the environment,\u201d said George Kimbrell of the Center for Food Safety, lead counsel in the case. \u201cIt is good to be reminded that corporations like Monsanto and the Trump administration cannot escape the rule of law, particularly at a time of crisis like this. Their day of reckoning has arrived.\u201d</p> <p>An EPA spokesman said the agency was currently reviewing the court decision and \u201cwill move promptly to address the court\u2019s directive\u201d.</p> <p>The issue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/epa-faces-court-over-backing-of-monsantos-controversial-crop-system\">at the heart of the court case</a> is a crop and chemical system designed by Monsanto, which was acquired by Bayer in 2018.&nbsp;The company said that soybean and cotton farmers could plant \u201cdicamba-tolerant\u201d versions of the crops and then spray new types of dicamba herbicides directly over the top of their fields to easily kill weeds. Previously, farmers used dicamba sparingly and were largely restricted from using dicamba during the growing season because the chemical can easily drift long distances, killing or injuring a wide array of crops and other plants it settles on.&nbsp;</p> <p>Monsanto, BASF and Corteva Agriscience told the EPA that their herbicides would have low volatility and if farmers followed instructions on the product labels, they could prevent drift. But since the introduction of the new dicamba crops and herbicides, farmer complaints have been filed with state agricultural officials, reporting dicamba damage across several million acres in at least a dozen states.</p> <p>The Guardian reported in March that Monsanto&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/monsanto-crop-system-damage-us-farms-documents\">predicted its dicamba crop system</a>&nbsp;would lead to thousands of damage claims from US farmers but pushed ahead anyway, and risks were downplayed to the EPA.</p> <p>The court found that the EPA \u201crefused to estimate the amount of dicamba damage\u201d, failed to acknowledge that restrictions it placed on the use of the dicamba herbicides would not be followed,&nbsp;and did not acknowledge evidence that the&nbsp;new use of dicamba herbicides would \u201ctear the social fabric of farming communities\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/monsanto-crop-system-damage-us-farms-documents\">Revealed: Monsanto predicted crop system would damage US farms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The court said it knew its decision could be costly for farmers who planned to use dicamba on their GMO soybeans and cotton fields, but said the EPA\u2019s failure to acknowledge and address risks to other crops left the court no choice.</p> <p>\u201cWe acknowledge the difficulties these growers may have in finding effective and legal herbicides to protect their (dicamba-tolerant) crops \u2026\u201d the ruling states. \u201cThey have been placed in this situation through no fault of their own.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Bayer,&nbsp;BASF and Corteva&nbsp;each&nbsp;issued statements saying their herbicides were important farmer tools that could be used safely and they disagreed with the court\u2019s decision.&nbsp;The&nbsp;companies said they were assessing options in response.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cIf the ruling stands, we will work quickly to minimize any impact on our customers this season,\u201d Bayer said.</p> <p>BASF called the court order \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said it \u201chas the potential to be devastating to tens of thousands of farmers\u201d.</p> <p>Farmers could lose \u201csignificant revenue\u201d if they are not able to kill weeds in their soybean and cotton fields with the dicamba herbicides, the company said.</p> <p>\u201cWe will use all legal remedies available to challenge this order,\u201d BASF said.</p>",

For the last few months, Covid-19 has been ruthlessly exposing fictions in the American ideal. All of a sudden, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/28/unemployment-claims-coronavirus/\">40 million</a> jobless Americans have no healthcare and the lie about \u201cchoice\u201d in the \u201cinsurance marketplace\u201d appears ludicrous. As wealthy, white Americans fled Covid-19 hotspots for their second homes, and low-income workers \u2013 the majority from communities of colour \u2013 bore the brunt of the death rate, the lie that the only difference between rich and poor is hard work and enterprise started to ring a little hollow.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">death of George Floyd</a>, in this context, cannot be readily absorbed into existing myths. There is a lot of talk about this time being different, which always feels like the first step towards ensuring it isn\u2019t. But I have lived in the US for more than 10 years, and this feels like the first time that the killing of a black man by police has not been met with equivocation and evasion. </p> <p>Six years ago, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/09/michael-brown-ferguson-death-black-men\">Michael Brown was shot dead </a>by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, there was instant scepticism in the conservative press and elsewhere. What had Brown been doing to excite police interest in the first place? Are we sure the officer was at fault? There was no video, that time. But in the same year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">the killing of Eric Garner</a> by police officers in Staten Island was captured on video. There were large-scale protests in the wake of these killings \u2013 but the protests were accompanied by a lot of chatter, not just on the right, about the deaths being at the hands of bad apple police officers, rather than an expression of systemic racial injustice.</p> <p>That is not happening now. No one who isn\u2019t on the white nationalist fringe is suggesting Floyd brought this on himself. It feels, this time, as if a line has been crossed and not only because Floyd\u2019s death occurred during a time of stark exposure of American inequality. It\u2019s that it followed on, in short succession, from the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">Ahmaud Arb</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">ery</a>, a black man gunned down by white vigilantes while going for a run in Georgia, and from a superficially trivial encounter in Central Park, in which a black man who asked a white woman to put her dog on the leash, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">watched as she called the cops</a> to say an African American man was \u201cthreatening\u201d her.

  "<p>Rubaiyat Hossain\u2019s latest film, Made in Bangladesh, opens with a scene of pure, visceral panic: young garment workers trapped in a burning factory.&nbsp;Alarms blare, women scream and smoke fills the stairwells.</p> <p>\u201cA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/08/bangladesh-factory-fires-fashion-latest-crisis\">fire</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/18/rana-plaza-collapse-murder-charges-garment-factory\">building collapse</a> is every garment worker\u2019s greatest fear,\u201d says Hossain.&nbsp;When filming the scene, the women seen desperately running for their lives didn\u2019t need much direction.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cMost of the extras we used were former garment workers who had lost their jobs so they had lived out this moment in their imaginations themselves many times when they were at work; it was a risk they all knew came with the job. The emotion they were conveying was very raw and very real.\u201d</p> <p>The factory floor of a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is the background for Hossain\u2019s third feature film, currently being <a href=\"https://ff.hrw.org/film/made-bangladesh\">screened online </a>as part of the Human Rights film festival.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f3705adb07072e9566cf9ddb8d94cca1bed3e09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f3705adb07072e9566cf9ddb8d94cca1bed3e09/0_0_3544_5000/709.jpg\" alt=\"Director Rubaiyat Hossain, who based the film on interviews with hundreds of garment workers.\" width=\"709\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Rubaiyat Hossain, who based the film on interviews with hundreds of garment workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Phillips/Getty Images for BFI</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It tells the story of Shimu Akhtar, played by Rikita Nandini Shimu, a young woman making clothes for western clothing companies whose indignation at the working conditions she is forced to endure leads her to try to unionise the factory.</p> <p>Akhtar\u2019s rage at the treatment of herself and her co-workers by a factory management that refuses to pay them, and the brands that make easy profits off their cheap labour, is the driving force of the film.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to show that if you grow up in a society where you are pushed and shoved around and told you are not enough, you are going to grow up very angry inside,\u201d Hossain says. \u201cAt some point that rage will come out but I wanted to show that it can be a driving force for change.\u201d</p> <p>Hossain is one of Bangladesh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3960381/\">few female film-maker </a>to have broken through to the international festival circuit. Made in Bangladesh, like her other work, focuses on the struggles and intimate relationships of Bangladeshi women pushing against the constraints of their domestic and public lives.&nbsp;Her first feature, Meherjaan, was banned in cinemas in Bangladesh for its critique of nationalism and anti-war narrative. Her second, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1220063257?playlistId=tt4163094&amp;ref_=tt_ov_vi\">Under Construction</a>, won international accolades for its depiction of the unravelling of a middle-class Bangladeshi marriage.</p> <p>When writing Made in Bangladesh, Hossain says she wanted to smash through the stereotype of the poor, exploited factory worker.&nbsp;\u201cI wanted to show that these women are active agents, fighting for their rights and demanding to be heard,\u201d she says.&nbsp;\u201cToo many people think of Bangladeshi women as victims sitting behind a sewing machine, but it is thanks to female garment workers that Bangladesh is now a middle-income country.&nbsp;And these young women are not victims, they are often feisty, young, spirited women who are fearless and brave. All that beauty and dignity had to be the starting point of this film.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Hossain based her film on the stories of hundreds of garment workers she interviewed over the three years she spent researching and writing the script.&nbsp;The character of Akhtar is based on the<a href=\"https://www.cphpix.com/news/meet-rubaiyat-hossain\"> life </a><a href=\"https://www.cphpix.com/news/meet-rubaiyat-hossain\">of Daliya Akhter</a>, one of the first women to start a garment workers\u2019 union in 2013.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uCtl_2nIyU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5uCtl_2nIyU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Made in Bangladesh trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cDaliya\u2019s story spoke in so many ways to the struggles women still face, both here in Bangladesh and across the world, to be treated and respected as workers,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hossain says that anger has been a defining element of her own life. \u201cI always remember that about being small, the feeling that being a girl wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom a young age me and my sister were always being asked when we would get a brother and become a proper family and the anger I felt at that only became clear when I started making films.\u201d</p> <p>Hossain used an almost entirely female crew when shooting Made in Bangladesh, including as many of her countrywomen as possible.&nbsp;\u2018There are few opportunities for women to make films, there are no fully equipped film schools, in meetings I\u2019m always the only woman in the room,\u201d she says.&nbsp;\u201cBut this is changing. For this movie I couldn\u2019t find a Bangladeshi woman director of photography but one day I will.\u201d</p> <p>Hossain\u2019s depiction of life as a Bangladeshi garment worker is also damning of the relentless downwards pressure exerted by the global fashion industry on the workers at the bottom of their supply chains.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a lot of effort made by fashion brands to distance themselves from the women who make their clothes,\u201d says Hossain.

There is recognition of the pressure on families, with a payment of \u20ac300 per child, extra incentives to buy electric cars, and grants worth \u20ac25bn for small businesses in those sectors, such as hospitality, that will take longest to recover from lockdown restrictions.</p> \n<p>All that will ensure Germany will be one of the first countries to get output back to its pre-crisis levels. Yet, the package also included \u20ac50bn for investment programmes, with a focus on making the transition to a greener economy.</p> \n<p>All this is a bit of a contrast to the UK experience.

An interesting list it is, too.</p> \n<p>For those a little confused by the blizzard of government schemes designed to keep business going through the pandemic crisis, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid </a>corporate financing facility (CCFF) allows a company to sell its short-term bonds to Threadneedle Street in exchange for cash.</p> \n<p>Few would quibble with the basic principle behind the CCFF. The government stopped planes from flying, football clubs from playing and shops from opening so it was obliged to give the likes of British Airways, Tottenham Hotspur FC and John Lewis a helping hand. The alternative was to turn Britain into a tumbleweed economy.</p> \n<p>So far, the Bank has lent \u00a316bn to more than 50 businesses. To qualify, a company need not be UK-owned. It merely has to have sizeable revenues in this country and be a sizeable employer. That explains why the German chemicals company BASF came to be the biggest borrower from the Bank under the scheme, with \u00a31bn outstanding, and that Nissan has borrowed \u00a3600m.</p> \n<p>Clearly, it would be foolish to deny a company help because it is foreign-owned, since all the evidence is that German, French, Japanese and US run companies are more productive than indigenous businesses.</p> \n<p>A much more serious criticism is that the money has been provided with no strings attached. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/ba-to-press-ahead-with-job-cuts-plans-despite-furlough-extension-willie-walsh-coronavirus-airline\">BA has announced 12,000 job losses</a> despite securing \u00a3300m from the scheme. EasyJet tapped the CCFF for \u00a3600m but said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/easyjet-plans-to-cut-up-to-30-per-cent-of-staff-because-of-covid-19-crisis\">it will axe 4,500 jobs</a> \u2013 30% of its workforce. The government appears not to have received or even asked for any job guarantees from companies, nor to demand that a quid pro quo for state support should be a reduction in the airlines\u2019 carbon footprint.</p> \n<p>All crises represent an opportunity as well as a threat. The opportunity here was for the government to use its financial leverage to change corporate behaviour for the better. That opportunity has been blown.</p>",

The audience erupts with laughter at the punchline, satiated by the clear ridiculousness of Britons marching for a problem that doesn\u2019t concern them.</p> \n<p>British solidarity with American victims of racial violence didn\u2019t seem so funny when thousands of protesters recently gathered in Hyde Park in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the crowd was much larger than expected \u2013 and much, much larger than in 2016. The visceral horror of George Floyd\u2019s slow public execution under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer has cut through the global consciousness in a way not seen since the police attack on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icZV1w5uLcE\">Rodney King</a> in 1991. BLM demonstrations have taken place in public squares from <a href=\"https://time.com/5846981/paris-protests-george-floyd-global/\">Paris</a> to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/06/02/photos-thousands-march-in-wake-of-george-floyds-death-from-amsterdam-to-tokyo/#3cb32c336843\">Amsterdam</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-take-place-in-cities-around-the-world#maincontent\">Auckland</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc37d49d-12ed-458a-b3d9-1fe4238a91f3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c9nEj6lN7s8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet in Britain, protesters still face criticism for supporting an issue that has supposedly <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-double-standards-of-the-london-protestors\">nothing to do with this country</a>. The idea that the issues BLM are protesting about are specific only to the US is farcical, as though race or policing are not global phenomena by their very nature; as though we don\u2019t see similar dynamics in Brazil, or Australia, or even Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Of course, there are certain force multipliers in the US that increase the scale of its problems; we do not have prisons the size of small towns or police officers walking around with AR-15s in Britain. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-video-report\">George Floyd</a> showed that police do not need guns to take life. Floyd\u2019s chilling final cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are not only the same words uttered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide\">Eric Garner</a> as he was being choked by police officers in New York in 2014, but also by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29998050\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> who in 2010 died on a plane on a Heathrow runway while being restrained by three immigration officers (an inquest into his death found he had been unlawfully killed, but the&nbsp;immigration officers were later acquitted of manslaughter). In 2017, 20-year-old <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/shine-a-light/death-rashan-charles-why-i-challenge-official-story/\">Rashan Charles</a> also lost his life, this time in Hackney, east London, after being restrained by a police officer and choking on a package of caffeine and paracetamol in his mouth. That same year, another young black man, 25-year-old father <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/edson-da-costa-death-inquest-police-restraint-drugs-black-men-a8948366.html\">Edson Da Costa</a>, died in very similar circumstances to Charles, just down the road in Newham. The inquests held into both Charles\u2019 and Da Costa\u2019s deaths ultimately cleared the arresting officers of responsibility.

That year, two Leeds city police officers were involved in the death of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-47946556\">David Oluwale</a>, a homeless British-Nigerian man who they had repeatedly targeted in an attempt to drive him out of the city. The officers had taken to abusing Oluwale whenever he was spotted, and famously wrote \u201cWog\u201d by his nationality on his arrest sheet. When Oluwale died after being in their custody, they faced charges of manslaughter. During the trial these charges were dropped to assault. The police officers were convicted and sentenced to just three years in prison. Half a century later, there has not been a single successful prosecution for anyone who died in police custody since.</p> \n<p>Though the numbers of deaths following police contact are thankfully not as bad in the UK as in the US, we should be anything but complacent when it comes to our own structural problems with racism or policing. Institutional racism<strong> </strong>exists at <a href=\"https://www.release.org.uk/publications/ColourOfInjustice\">every level of our criminal justice system</a>, from who gets stopped and searched, to who gets arrested, to who gets charged, to who gets convicted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/america-black-deaths-racism\">In America, Black deaths are not a flaw in the system.

  "<h2>WHAT A BUSINESS</h2> \n<p>It really wasn\u2019t meant to be like this. As June approached, Newcastle fans were brimful of optimism that the long, drawn-out sale of their club by one universally reviled, despotic, tyrannical owner to another would finally be completed. They would be free to dream of a brave new dawn, a happy future in which Neymar was banging them in for fun up front and they were spending endless hours on the internet angrily pointing out London-based media agendas, typing the words \u201cwhat about\u201d more often than is humanly necessary and unconvincingly arguing that war crimes, beheadings and human rights abuses aren\u2019t really anything to be concerned about if they are carried out in a way that doesn\u2019t really affect you.</p> \n<p>With no sign of the handover being completed, they remain on tenterhooks, the collective mood even more furious than usual as they accuse Newcastle\u2019s hierarchy of a \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d for something that does affect them: the club\u2019s ongoing refusal to loop them in on plans for season tickets and money already spent on them. With the remainder of the current campaign set to be played behind closed doors, card-holders understandably want to know if they\u2019ll be getting refunds for matches they have paid for but will be unable to attend, while the Newcastle United Supporters\u2019 Trust also wants season ticket payments for the 2020-21 campaign suspended.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/jun/04/the-life-and-times-of-barney-ronay-football-weekly-extra\">The life and times of Barney Ronay \u2013 Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWithout supporters, Newcastle United does not exist,\u201d it wrote. \u201cWe have previously contacted Newcastle United to express our concerns at the lack of action to assist its supporters in a time of need during this unprecedented global health and economic crisis. You have called on the fans of Newcastle United for support so often over the years and when we called for you to stand by your supporters, you did nothing.\u201d Unsurprisingly, considering the outright contempt in which Newcastle fans are held by the club\u2019s owner, no reply has yet been forthcoming, despite other top-flight clubs having reassured fans that they will be refunded one way or another for games they won\u2019t get to see.</p> \n<p>Newcastle supporters should perhaps be careful what they wish for, as their neighbours have made sure to keep fans well-informed about what will be happening with their season tickets, prompting further anger. The Basket Case club in whose direction other Basket Case clubs tug their forelocks, Sunderland announced they won\u2019t be refunding season ticket holders if the season isn\u2019t cut short and their three remaining home games are played behind closed doors. They will instead offer fans a pass to stream the matches at home, which is much the same as an airline refusing to refund that expensive ticket you paid for a now-cancelled flight to New York, but showing you some video footage of Central Park and the Statue of Liberty instead.</p> \n<p>In an astonishing show of contempt, Sunderland have also told fans who renew their season tickets for the next campaign there will be no refunds for behind-closed-doors then either, only the same offer of a streaming pass which at \u00a310 costs considerably less than a ticket. \u201cWhat about families who have three or four season tickets in the same household? It\u2019s nonsense,\u201d thundered supporters group chief Michael Ganley. Despite claiming to be \u201cin dialogue\u201d with fans, Sunderland have yet to provide any satisfactory answers, but may well suggest each family member watches on a different device to ensure everyone gets maximum bang for their buck.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cI mean, it was ridiculous.

  "<p>It is a wonderful thing to live next to a football ground. Every other week my road, bordering the Emirates Stadium, would become transformed and a palpable, fleeting feeling of community would blossom.

My Blackburn Rovers lost 7-1, with manager Steve Kean deciding a high line was a good idea against Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. It was a cold and miserable day in the away end.</p> <p>Those were particularly bad years to be a Rovers fan. Venky\u2019s had taken over, promises had been broken, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYwf2SBWa5o\">that</a></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYwf2SBWa5o\"> advert released</a>, as was a chicken on the pitch at Ewood.

So when we were drawn away at Arsenal in the FA Cup fifth round in February 2013, I\u2019m not sure why I was so desperate to go back.</p> <p>I had started at the Guardian just a few months previously and was enlisted to work in the office that Saturday, but my boss kindly allowed to me clock off early. I cycled from King\u2019s Cross and was at the Emirates for just after kick-off, where I bought the first ticket I could find; in the rafters, among the home fans \u2013 the away end, remarkably, was full.

As beneficiaries, it was a glorious watch, eyes and cameras flicking between the latest Scott Dann clearance and the image of the Frenchman in that black jacket on his haunches, like a dark, deflated Michelin Man. Rovers offered next to nothing for 72 minutes: 28% possession, five shots on target to Arsenal\u2019s 20. But then came the decisive moment. </p> <p>Walcott, thrown on by Wenger to win the game, failed to track a Martin Olsson run. The Swede optimistically shot from a tight angle and Wojciech Szczesny kindly spilled the ball out towards Colin Kazim-Richards. The former Arsenal academy graduate scuffed his effort into the ground, but it looped over Szczesny and in off the post.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ca407de00160ad28ad2e20204c701f0fe03570f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ca407de00160ad28ad2e20204c701f0fe03570f/0_0_2048_1347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Kazim-Richards bobbles his finish over Wojciech Szczesny to give Blackburn the lead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Kazim-Richards bobbles his finish over Wojciech Szczesny to give Blackburn the lead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerim \u00d6kten/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sitting opposite the away end, the sight of thousands of blue and white limbs flailing was a magnificent one.

  "<p>When the next pandemic hits \u2013 and it\u2019s a question of when, not if \u2013 it will be vital that we did all we could at this moment to learn the lessons taught to us by coronavirus.&nbsp;</p> <p>One key lesson has been the effectiveness of travel bans. Countries that managed to contain the virus effectively implemented immediate health screenings of new arrivals, 14-day quarantines for those entering the country and even full travel bans. Of the world\u2019s population, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/01/more-than-nine-in-ten-people-worldwide-live-in-countries-with-travel-restrictions-amid-covid-19/\">91%</a> live in countries with current travel restrictions, and 39% of people live in countries whose borders are completely closed to non-citizens and non-residents.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Travel bans were seen as only delaying the inevitable spread and thus not worth the disruption and economic cost</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In mid-March Australia noted that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-51969498\">80% of cases</a> being detected were linked to returning travellers. The government quickly introduced a border-closure policy in which only nationals were let into the country, who then needed to spend two weeks in mandatory quarantine in a hotel room.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/borders-to-stay-closed-travellers-urged-to-see-australia-first-once-curbs-ease-20200410-p54iw4.html\">Despite the cost to the economy</a>, roughly $4bn per month from international travellers and $5bn from domestic travellers, who are restricted from crossing state borders, the government felt it was imperative to get a handle on the number of new cases. This policy has paid off with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">complete crunching of the coronavirus curve</a>: Australia has had <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/australia/\">102 deaths</a>, and has only a handful of daily new cases. Life is slowly returning back to normal, with thethreat of coronavirus pushed beyond its borders. A similar story can be told about New Zealand, Greece, Iceland and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/vetinary-scientist-hailed-faroe-islands-lack-covid-19-deaths\">Faroe Islands</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>The UK is implementing its own restrictions, but what took us so long? To understand this delay requires a delve into the minutes of Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) that the government points to as evidence of it \u201cfollowing the science\u201d.&nbsp;On <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888770/S0371_Third_SAGE_meeting_on_Wuhan_Coronavirus__WN-CoV__.pdf\">3 February</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888787/S0386_Eighteenth_SAGE_meeting_on_Covid-19_.pdf\">23 March</a>&nbsp;travel restrictions were discussed by Sage but were seen to have a negligible effect. Modelling noted that \u201cif the UK reduces imported infections by 50%, this would maybe delay the onset of any epidemic in the UK by about 5 days; 75% would maybe buy 10 additional days; 90% maybe buys 15 additional days; 95% maybe buys a month.\u201d </p> <p>This fits with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/06/01/1591001732000/Making-sense-of-nonsensical-Covid-19-strategy/\">Sage\u2019s initial advice</a> from January to March to develop a strategy based on the 2011 Pandemic Flu Plan.

At the same time, passengers from countries such as Italy, Spain, the US, Brazil and Russia could arrive at Heathrow and take the tube straight into London with no checks, screening or monitoring. It is ironic that the government that ran on \u201ctaking back control of our borders\u201d was so reluctant to implement border controls when they were actually needed to protect its citizens and residents.</p> <p>The current <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/priti-patel-urged-to-publish-scientific-advice-behind-uk-quarantine-move\">UK plan</a> to quarantine all arrivals (except a small group of essential workers) for 14 days feels three months too late and too blunt an instrument. To stop the outbreak and limit the number of people exposed to the virus, the UK government should have moved quickly in late February/early March to implement border closure while moving to an early lockdown. This would have limited the number of imported cases, provided time&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/lockdown-buys-time-virus-mass-testing-coronavirus-uk\">to aggressively go after the virus through testing and tracing</a>&nbsp;anddrive down numbers to the dozens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/critics-round-on-no-10-over-ridiculous-rules-for-14-day-quarantine-coronavirus\">Critics round on No 10 over 'ridiculous' rules for 14-day quarantine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under the new plans, arriving passengers and crew must self-isolate at their homes or a specified location. They are only permitted to leave the house to buy food or medicine, attend funerals and court hearings, and to access public services. This will be monitored by unannounced visits and a breach would result in a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52907229\">\u00a31,000 penalty</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>While the overall idea to monitor importation of new cases is indeed a valid one that has been endorsed by the World Health Organization as countries exit lockdown, the implementation is problematic. It would make more sense if quarantine was mandated only for those arriving from countries with much higher rates of infection, and notthose that have a marginal number such as Greece, Australia, Norway, South Korea, Taiwan or Denmark. In addition, we should follow the example of countries such as Greece, Singapore, Hong Kong and Austria and test for Covid-19 on arrival.</p> <p>At this stage, minimising the number of imported cases should be a priority. But what should we do when the next pandemic hits? The key learning must be the need to halt the export of the virus at the early stage of the outbreak. In January 2020,&nbsp;China could have closed&nbsp;its borders once it became clear that coronavirus was spiralling out of control. The country clearly had sufficient resources, personal protective equipment, hospitals and health staff to manage the outbreak without external assistance. Instead, it delayed closing borders and as a result, coronavirus has infected more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51235105\">6 million people across 188 countries</a>. In a highly globalised economy closing borders may seem unpalatable, but perhaps we have now learned our lessons the hard way.</p> <p>\u2022 Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to New York, rather than the US, in a list of countries that passengers could arrive from.

  "<p>Just under a fortnight ago, council leaders across England received an email containing three attachments. It had been sent on behalf of Nadine Dorries, the health minister and former I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out Of Here! contestant.</p> <p>Official material related to Covid-19 has frequently been full of numerical scales, shaded shapes and perplexing diagrams, and so it proved this time. As well as the promise of \u201can integrated and world-class Covid-19 test-and-trace service\u201d, one of the documents featured four circles in different shades of green, and the words \u201ctest\u201d, \u201cenable\u201d, \u201ccontain\u201d and \u201ctrace\u201d.

Dido Harding, the former chief executive of the phone company TalkTalk, had been appointed to lead the test-and-trace effort. The outsourcing giant Serco and call-centre multinational Sitel were recruiting and training tens of thousands of people who would contact people by phone, while the smartphone app intended to be at the new system\u2019s core was being trialled in the Isle of Wight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c838201bbf856e019515e42d4d759ad41f0c20a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c838201bbf856e019515e42d4d759ad41f0c20a/0_362_7470_4485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dido Harding.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dido Harding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given that new local outbreaks of the coronavirus would inevitably demand the attention of people on the ground, there had been rising frustration about the apparent lack of a role for councils in the government\u2019s approach. Now, though, there was to be a \u201ccentral\u201d role for local authorities in \u201csupporting the new test-and-trace service across England\u201d, and an extra \u00a3300m from Whitehall to fund their new responsibilities.</p> <p>The following week, Matt Hancock said future flare-ups would be met with \u201clocal lockdowns\u201d, an announcement that came on the same day that the health secretary also heralded the early launch of the national test-and-trace system.</p> <p>But many of the local politicians and officials who will apparently play a key role in making everything work say hugely important questions remain unanswered. Nick Forbes, the Labour leader of Newcastle city council, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what this system looks like, we don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to cost, we don\u2019t know what money we\u2019re getting. The government is way behind the curve here. We\u2019ve only started to scratch the surface of what it all means.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I will accept the responsibility if they give me the powers\u2019</h2> <p>The new testing and tracing regime is branded with the logo of the NHS. It involves the government agency Public Health England, and official material on testing and tracing and local outbreaks identifies seven organisations and agencies that will also be involved, ranging from health protection boards and local strategic coordinating groups to outbreak engagement boards and local resilience forums. From the perspective of many people working at the grassroots, this is part of the problem. \u201cEverything feels so fragmented,\u201d one local government insider told me this week. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re trying to stick it all back together again.\u201d</p> <p>The basics of what testing, tracing and isolating entails are clear enough. If someone develops possible symptoms of the virus, they must self-isolate for at least seven days and register for a test. If that test comes back positive, leaving aside the possible operations of an app that will be introduced nationally \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d, they will then have to share detailed information with the authorities.</p> <p>This will include details of the people they live with, anyone they have been within 2 metres of for 15 minutes or longer, and places they have recently visited. In turn, people who have been close to anyone infected \u201cwill be told to begin self-isolation for 14 days from your last contact with the person who has tested positive\u201d.</p> <p>Linked to these complicated arrangements are proposals for what the government calls \u201clocal outbreak control plans\u201d, so far focused on care homes, schools&nbsp;and places such as sheltered housing developments, and what&nbsp;official documents term \u201cdormitories for migrant workers\u201d. This is one of the areas where local authorities will seemingly be crucial, along with \u201csupporting vulnerable people to get help to self-isolate\u201d.</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care is initially working \u201cintensively\u201d with 11 \u201cbeacon\u201d areas of England \u2013 including Leeds, Newcastle and Leicestershire \u2013 and has told local politicians and officials across England that they \u201cneed to develop local outbreak plans in June\u201d.</p> <p>Things seem to be moving. But inescapable truths hang over everything, not least that the lockdown has been loosened before many of the important elements of the testing, tracing and isolating system are in place.</p> <p>People in local government say they were encouraged by the appointment of Tom Riordan, the chief executive of Leeds city council, to a senior role in the testing and tracing system in mid-May. Nonetheless, big questions remain. Forbes says that as well as his uncertainties about local lockdowns (\u201cWe don\u2019t even have the power to close down a school at the moment, let alone lock down an area of a city\u201d), he has other worries.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a government which has tried to create a hostile environment. There\u2019s huge fear in many BAME communities that their data will be passed on. And if communities don\u2019t have the confidence to engage with the testing and tracing work, then it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2513abd17a158b73c27e809edabf4d4909d3ea97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2513abd17a158b73c27e809edabf4d4909d3ea97/0_136_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle council.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle council.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the other side of the River Tyne, Alice Wiseman is working flat-out in the borough of Gateshead, a coronavirus hotspot. She is a director of public health, and therefore charged by the government with defining how local authorities will \u201cidentify and contain outbreaks and protect the public\u2019s health\u201d. She too is still waiting for clarity on an array of issues.</p> <p>For weeks, Gateshead has run its own testing programme from labs in a local hospital. At the same time, a nationally run testing facility administered by the outsourcing firm Deloitte has been in operation \u2013 first from the car park of Gateshead\u2019s shuttered branch of Ikea, and then across the river in Newcastle. It has since been joined by a walk-in national testing centre three miles from the city centre.</p> <p>Wiseman says it has taken her eight weeks to access data from the nationally run testing system, and that even then the information is not detailed enough to be of much use. As of this week she can access information about Covid-19 infections across the whole of the north-east of England broken down by gender, age and some information about such \u201csettings\u201d as schools, hospitals and prisons. But she says she still has far too little information about cases in Gateshead from the national testing system, other than crude figures showing the number of people who have tested positive.</p> <p>She also says the testing results concerned are not available in anything like real time, which risks the virus spreading. Indeed, though the Department of Health insists that \u201capproximately 90% of people now receive a result within 48 hours of their test\u201d, she says she is still having conversations about results taking more than 72 hours to arrive with individuals, before they are then collated into official data. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a picture of the issues in our local area since the start, and we don\u2019t have one now.\u201d</p> <p>In Leicestershire, the Conservative leader of the county council is also awaiting answers. Nick Rushton says that when he has talked with ministers, a term he has heard is \u201clocal political accountability\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019ve got local accountability, I want local responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, for example, if I had an outbreak in a factory where there\u2019s a lot of people, I don\u2019t want to say: \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve got an outbreak and we need to shut the factory and isolate all those people,\u2019 and then have to phone up the secretary of state and ask them if I can do it. If they want me to do it, I will accept that responsibility if they give me those powers locally.\u201d</p> <p>In response to this point, the Department of Health said it \u201cwill shortly be issuing guidance on how local and national government can work to ensure local outbreaks can be contained\u201d.</p> <p>Rushton says Dorries \u201cseems very keen to help us, on a Zoom call. But we need to see the colour of her money. Because we don\u2019t know how much we\u2019re going to get to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Though the government has provided an extra \u00a33.2bn in emergency Covid-19 funding for councils, and the Department of Health insists they have the resources they need to \u201ctackle the immediate pressures they have told us they are facing\u201d, Rushton\u2019s authority has so far spent twice as much on the effects of Covid-19 as it has been given by ministers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely concerning. Hopefully they\u2019ll realise just how dire the situation will be next year. What you\u2019ll have to do is cut services, it\u2019s as simple as that. If you don\u2019t have the money \u2026 you just have to stop doing things.\u201d</p> <p>Rushton says Leicestershire has enough reserves to cope with any financial crisis, but scores of councils do not. And if the government insists that they take on all these new responsibilities but does not adequately fund them, the combination could tip many places into bankruptcy.</p> <p>In Leeds, the city council leader, Judith Blake, says the financial gap left by the virus on her finances will be around \u00a3160m. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very serious indeed,\u201d she says. She also expresses scepticism about whether she and her colleagues will be able to respond to crisis as they would like. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect that the government is going to be giving us the powers we need any time soon. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s in their DNA. It\u2019s a cultural issue.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The government doesn\u2019t seem to want to let go\u2019</h2> <p>A source within the new national testing and tracing system says the involvement of councils came \u201ctoo late, without a doubt\u201d, but that over the last few weeks the government\u2019s turn towards local authorities has made a \u201cpalpable difference\u201d.</p> <p>They speak with guarded optimism, but also say there is an ongoing tension between what ministers say in public and how people working locally have to put plans into practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cEvery night you hear from a secretary of state or the chancellor or the prime minister, and they want an announcement to make. So they almost manufacture things. If they consulted with people, they would still end up doing things, but at least there\u2019d be buy-in, and warnings to people on the ground,\u201d the source says.</p> <p>On Wednesday the Daily Telegraph reported that \u201ca shake-up in Downing Street will see the government\u2019s entire approach to the pandemic run by two centrally run committees\u201d. This was not the kind of news that people trying to get cities, counties and boroughs through this crisis wanted to hear.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we\u2019ve only recently been seen as a resource to help the country get through this crisis,\u201d says Forbes. \u201cAnd even now, the chains of centralisation are still being rattled. The government doesn\u2019t seem to want to fully let go.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Asked about these issues, the Department Of Health provided a statement. \u201cWe have now&nbsp;launched NHS Test and Trace which will help stop the spread of the virus and save lives \u2026 Eleven cross-party beacon councils have formed an advisory group to establish methods of best practice and to assist with the development and introduction of local outbreak plans which will be in place by the end of June,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cIn the meantime, local infection outbreak plans will be utilised where necessary. We\u2019ve made \u00a3300m available to local authorities, and are giving them support with Public Health England to fight infections in care homes and help tackle wider outbreaks in businesses and the community.\u201d</p> <p>Forbes says:&nbsp;\u201cThe virus is still real. We\u2019re not on top of it. We don\u2019t yet have the systems in place to know where it is. Nor do we have the mechanisms to deal with an outbreak, yet. But we\u2019ll move heaven and earth to try and do as much as we can.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen strongly to a new peak this year, despite the impact of the global effects of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere reached 417.2 parts per million in May, 2.4ppm higher than the peak of 414.8ppm in 2019, according to readings from the Mauna Loa observatory in the US.</p> <p>Without worldwide lockdowns intended to slow the spread of Covid-19, the rise might have reached 2.8ppm, according to Ralph Keeling, a professor at the <a href=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/\">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a>. He said it was likely they had played a small role, but that the difference was too small to show up against other factors causing year-to-year fluctuations.</p> <p>\u201cPeople may be surprised to hear that the response to the coronavirus outbreak hasn\u2019t done more to influence CO2 levels,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the buildup of CO2 is a bit like trash in a landfill. As we keep emitting, it keeps piling up. The crisis has slowed emissions, but not enough to show up perceptibly at Mauna Loa. What will matter much more is the trajectory we take coming out of this situation.\u201d</p> <p>Daily emissions of carbon dioxide fell by an average of about 17% around the world in early April, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/lockdowns-trigger-dramatic-fall-global-carbon-emissions\">a comprehensive study </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/lockdowns-trigger-dramatic-fall-global-carbon-emissions\"> last month</a>. As lockdowns are eased, however, the fall in emissions for the year as a whole is only likely to be only between 4% and 7% compared with 2019. That will make no appreciable difference to the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/steep-fall-emissions-during-coronavirus-no-cause-for-celebration\"> world\u2019s ability to meet the goals of the Paris agreement</a>, and keep global heating below the threshold of 2C that scientists say is necessary to stave off catastrophic effects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/index-html-9-zip/giv-3902eKmXhDb43n62/\" data-alt=\"The Keeling curve\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/index-html-9-zip/giv-3902eKmXhDb43n62/\">The Keeling curve</a> </figure>  <p>If emissions reductions of 20% to 30% were sustained for six to 12 months, then the rate of increase of CO2 measured at Mauna Loa would slow, according to the Scripps scientists.</p> <p>This year\u2019s rise is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/04/latest-data-shows-steep-rises-in-co2-for-seventh-year\">slightly weaker than last year\u2019s</a>, but matches the average annual rise for the past decade. The amount of carbon fluctuates based on various factors, including the effects of the El Ni\u00f1o weather system in the Pacific.</p> <p>Carbon dioxide tends to peak each year in late May, when the impacts of the northern hemisphere spring have yet to take effect, so the month\u2019s data is compared from year to year. Measurements have been taken continuously at the remote Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since 1958, providing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/05/why-the-guardian-is-putting-global-co2-levels-in-the-weather-forecast\">vital information for climate scientists</a>.</p> <p>The latest data comes from Scripps scientists at the University of California San Diego and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They found that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere first rose above 400ppm in 2014. The annual rate of growth in emissions has been speeding up.</p> <p>In the 1960s, the annual growth averaged about 0.8ppm, doubling to 1.6ppm a year in the 1980s and remaining steady at 1.5ppm in the 1990s. The average growth rate increased to about 2.0ppm a year in the 2000s, and has risen further to about 2.4ppm during the last decade.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners said the continued rise in emissions showed how urgently a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-green-recovery\">green recovery from Covid-19 crisis</a> was needed.</p> <p>John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, called on the British government to do more as hosts of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/uk-urged-to-tie-green-recovery-from-covid-19-crisis-to-cop26-summit\">next UN climate talks, Cop26,</a> now postponed until 2021. \u201cJust a few months of lower emissions were never likely to make a dent in the hundreds of billions tonnes of carbon that have built up over a century and a half of burning fossil fuels,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the drop in emissions caused by the pandemic&nbsp;will remain just a blip unless governments get serious about building a cleaner, healthier and safer world.\u201d</p> <p>Muna Suleiman, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201c It\u2019s clear that climate breakdown isn\u2019t a distant idea, it\u2019s here right now, and we have to treat it like the emergency it is.\u201d</p>",

So he was intrigued by the study, which was published on 14 April in a version known as \u201cpreprint\u201d, which means it was made available online before it had been peer-reviewed or accepted by a medical journal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d0057139de25a7e87f75868f2a1333f3024700a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0057139de25a7e87f75868f2a1333f3024700a5/0_452_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Carlos Chaccour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Carlos Chaccour says doctors latched on to the ivermectin study because they were desperate for something to treat Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ISGlobal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI saw the researchers had looked at this huge database \u2026 they included 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America and 1,900 Covid-19 patients seen by hospitals in those countries by 1 March,\u201d Chaccour says.</p> <p>The study methodology said its data had been obtained from Surgisphere. The Surgisphere website says it owns a data analytics system called QuartzClinical which monitors global healthcare in real time through data collection from 1,200 international hospitals. Promotional material says the database \u201chas led to advances in care for kidney failure, aneurysms, lymphedema, peripheral artery disease, colon cancer, and cardiovascular disease\u201d.</p> <p>The database sounded incredible.</p> <p>But as Chaccour and other researchers began to look more closely, they quickly found some concerning anomalies. Over the next weeks those doubts would only increase. Surgisphere itself came under greater scrutiny, culminating in two of the world\u2019s most prestigious medical journals reconsidering studies based on its data, an about-turn from the World Health Organization on research into a potential Covid-19 treatment, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine\">Guardian investigation that uncovered worrying inconsistencies in the Surgisphere story</a>.</p> <h2>\u2018It was so weird\u2019</h2> <p>Chaccour\u2019s first surprise was that the study had found 52 Covid-19 patients who had received ivermectin. At the time, ivermectin was not being widely discussed as a potential Covid-19 treatment. Yet the study said patients around the world had already been receiving it.</p> <p>The study also included data from three patients in Africa who, as of 1 March, were on mechanical ventilation and receiving ivermectin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/covid-19-surgisphere-who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine\">Governments and WHO changed Covid-19 policy based on suspect data from tiny US company</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut there were two patients in the entire continent alone at that time, let alone people on ventilators,\u201d Chaccour says.</p> <p>Chaccour, who has worked throughout Africa and knows African healthcare systems well, believes many hospitals there are not equipped with the electronic health systems required to be a part of such a database.</p> <p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re supposed to be connected to a fancy automatic thing that gives all this data to a corporation in the US?

The world had gone crazy</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Carlos Chaccour</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 2 May, two weeks after the study appeared online, a doctor in Peru wrote a white paper for the government about the use of ivermectin to treat Covid-19, heavily citing the preprint Surgisphere study as evidence. Peru&nbsp;reported its first&nbsp;Covid-19&nbsp;case on 6 March, but by the beginning of May it was in a state of emergency, having recorded 42,000 cases and about 1,200 deaths. Less than a week after the white paper was published, the Peruvian government included ivermectin in its national Covid-19 therapeutic guidelines. Projects involving ivermectin around the world received thousands of dollars in grants.</p> <p>Chaccour was concerned. He knew ivermectin well and was shocked at how quickly it was being adopted as part of treatment protocols without rigorous research to back up its use. He believes more studies should be done first, as<a href=\"http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0271\"> he wrote in an editorial in which he was lead author</a>, published on 16 April. He sent the lead researcher on the preprint paper an email with some questions and concerns about the data, which were forwarded to a co-author of the paper, the Surgisphere founder and chief executive, Dr Sapan Desai.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c6f85a0ccacf8831d5ec6e848e659940aaea9cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c6f85a0ccacf8831d5ec6e848e659940aaea9cf/79_0_2697_1618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Sapan Desai of Surgisphere\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Sapan Desai of Surgisphere talking on his Vimeo page.

The renowned Harvard University vascular surgeon Dr Mandeep Mehra was the lead author, Desai the second author. The study also based its results on the Surgisphere QuartzClinical database, including data from Covid-19 patients from 169 hospitals in 11 countries in Asia, Europe and North America. It found common drugs given for heart disease were not associated with a higher risk of death in Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>Chaccour thought this might explain his concerns about the ivermectin study. \u201cI thought, [maybe the ivermectin study] was just a side project while they were busy working on this big New England Journal of Medicine study. I didn\u2019t look closely at the study, because cardiovascular disease is not my area.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, another drug, an anti-malarial called hydroxychloroquine, a derivative of&nbsp;chloroquine<em><strong>, </strong></em>was gaining traction as a potential Covid-19 treatment<strong> </strong>in the US after Donald Trump described it as possibly \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,\u201d adding, \u201cit\u2019s not going to kill anybody\u201d. Soon after,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2020/03/23/man-dead-from-taking-chloroquine-after-trump-touts-drug-for-coronavirus/#739ef3ba72e9\">a US man died after he drank chloroquine found in fish tank cleaner because he was scared of getting sick</a>. Nigeria also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-21/nigeria-reports-chloroquine-poisonings-after-trump-praised-drug\">reported chloroquine poisonings</a>. Drug regulators around the world urged people not to attempt to source and ingest the drug, emphasising it was unproven as a Covid-19 treatment and came with potentially toxic side-effects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11fb40bcd6687dee7c6f77cd61236136d63ccd3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11fb40bcd6687dee7c6f77cd61236136d63ccd3a/0_0_5148_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US president Donald Trump tells reporters he is taking zinc and hydroxychloroquine to try to prevent illness from Covid-19\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US president Donald Trump tells reporters he is taking hydroxychloroquine to try to prevent getting ill from Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was a royal mess,\u201d Chaccour says. \u201cThere was huge political polarisation about hydroxychlorioquine, politics became mixed in with policy. So there\u2019s people defending hydroxychloroquine because they like Donald Trump, and people opposing it because they don\u2019t like Donald Trump. This should be about data, not opinions, and absolutely not about politics.

The ivermectin preprint paper had been downloaded more than 15,000 times, its abstract viewed 90,000 times. Bolivia went a step further than Peru, announcing on 19 May that 350,000 doses of the drug would be distributed. \u201cDemand goes up hugely, so much so that a blackmarket of ivermectin emerges,\u201d Chaccour says. \u201cSo ivermectin threatens to become the new hydroxychloroquine in Latin America.\u201d Researchers in Latin America who found hydroxychloroquine <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30383-2/fulltext#.XtCzFgjDxfs.twitter\">was not effective for Covid-19 began receiving death threats</a> after their findings <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2765499\">were published in a US medical journal</a>.</p> <p>On 22 May, the Lancet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">published a hydroxychloroquine study involving 96,000 patients around the world</a> which found the drug was associated with a higher risk of heart problems and death in those with Covid-19. The authors again included Mehra and Desai, and again, Surgisphere\u2019s QuartzClinical global database was used, this time to obtain the data from 1,200 hospitals. The study involved so many hospitals and people that its findings, to many, seemed definitive. Hydroxychloroquine did not work for Covid-19, and in fact could be dangerous in those patients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16385d5c007880719867c61630009f70308e4fe5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16385d5c007880719867c61630009f70308e4fe5/0_0_4466_2977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pharmacist holds a bottle of the drug hydroxychloroquine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pharmacist holds a bottle of the drug hydroxychloroquine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Margot/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Lancet study was published on a Friday. In less than 24 hours, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">the World Health Organization [WHO] had stopped the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial they\u2019re sponsoring</a>,\u201d Chaccour says. \u201cThis had massive consequences. There are 131 hydroxychloroquine Covid-19 trials registered. Many national funding agencies stopped or paused these trials. Many patients read the news about the study. Thousands of patients enrolled in these trials feel fear and anguish. How can you continue these trials now? When patients just read this drug is not good?\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, following growing concern from the medical community about the Lancet study and the database, the WHO reversed the decision to halt hydroxychloroquine trials. It too had reviewed the study, and found there was no reason to discontinue trials based on the data. However, WHO officials also reiterated there was as yet no evidence that hydroxychloroquine, or any drug, reduces the mortality in patients who have Covid-19.&nbsp;</p> <p>Chaccour was baffled that Mehra and Desai were publishing these large studies in prestigious journals every few weeks. It was research that would take months, at least, to write up, longer than the pandemic has been around.</p> <h2>\u2018I have serious concerns with the database\u2019</h2> <p>This time, Chaccour was not alone in his concerns. His questions about the paper were echoed<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-surgisphere-hydroxychloroquine-study-lancet-coronavirus-who-questioned-by-researchers-medical-professionals\"> by scientists around the world who had also identified serious and potentially fatal flaws in the study</a>.

Our healthcare data analytics services started about the same time and have continued to grow since that time.\u201d However, information about the database has appeared publicly only since 2019. Before that Surgisphere appeared to publish medical education tools, such as textbooks. Of the database, Desai said: \u201cWe use a great deal of artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate this process as much as possible, which is the only way a task like this is even possible.\u201d</p> <p>He did not explain how the artificial intelligence worked to gather the data, or how hospitals went about putting the system in place and feeding data into it.

We never receive any protected health information or individually identifiable information.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is more crucial than at any other point in modern history that results are transparent, fully assessable and accurate</p> <footer> <cite>Research scientist James Heathers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Chaccour had the same questions about Surgisphere. How was it collecting its data? And which hospitals were taking part? \u201cMy to-do list was completely on hold, for a week I looked at nothing else,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd as a result I have serious concerns with the database that I believe may have major flaws.\u201d He found race data was reported in the studies that used the database. \u201cIt is not clear how Surgisphere gets race data, since collecting it is uncommon in most countries, and illegal in some,\u201d Chaccour says. Surgisphere did not respond to questions from the Guardian about how race data was collected.</p> <p>It also surprised Chaccour that the company behind one of the largest and fastest hospital databases in the world had almost no online presence. Its Twitter handle had fewer than 170 followers when he checked it, with no posts between October 2017 and 2020; its LinkedIn page has fewer than 100 followers and six employees, which now appears to have reduced to three, with no posts before March 2020; its YouTube page has few subscribers, two videos, and no videos posted in the last decade.</p> <p>It is also unclear where the company is based. Its address is listed in Chicago\u2019s John Hancock Center. The privacy policy of QuartzClinical refers to a residential address in Illinois. Nor is its ethics policy transparent. Despite the Surgisphere database collecting patient data including lab data and physical exam findings, the study published in the Lancet said \u201cthe data collection and analyses are deemed exempt from ethics review\u201d.</p> <h2>A history of ambitious claims</h2> <p>But why do it? Why would Desai allow questionable data to be relied on by prestigious journals and run the risk that the errors would be picked up by editors, or by other researchers around the world once published?</p> <p>\u201cThis guy is flying high,\u201d Chaccour speculates. \u201cAnd he\u2019s enjoying the view from up there.

Eight years ago, he launched a crowdfunding campaign on the platform Indiegogo promoting a device called Neurodynamics Flow. The device, Desai wrote on the campaign page, \u201cis a next generation human augmentation device that can help humans achieve what was never thought possible. Unlock human creativity. With over a decade of research into fine-tuning the device, Flow\u2019s sophisticated microprocessor precisely stimulates various areas of the brain to create a higher level of function.\u201d</p> <p>For a donation of US$100, backers of the project were promised an exclusive, signed 8x10 fine art print of the blueprint for the actual prototype. For US$500 project backers were offered a \u201cNeurodynamics Flow in your choice of colour with suede microfiber carrying case and accessories. All electronics and microprocessor are sewn into a wearable device. Machine washable.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The campaign raised about US$300 of its US$10,000 goal. One of Desai\u2019s project backers asked on the website: \u201cWhat happened to the project? Where is my perk?\u201d There was no visible response on the site from Desai. It appears the device never eventuated.</p> <p>Surgisphere\u2019s <a href=\"https://surgisphere.com/research-tools/mortality.php\">Covid-19 \u201cMortality Prediction Tool\u201d</a> has also come under fire. Surgisphere claims that its tools are based on machine-learning algorithms and derived from real-time data. But when different ages are entered into the tool, it appears to simply divide them by 20 to get the predicted mortality, rounded up to the nearest 0.1%. For example, a 10-year-old would have a 0.5% risk of death, according to the tool.</p> <p>A senior London infectious diseases doctor concerned by the tool told the Guardian: \u201cWe know that this is not what happens in Covid-19, where there is an exponential relationship between age and mortality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c6e27d312f7ffc6aa172e2d894e862bad80af05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c6e27d312f7ffc6aa172e2d894e862bad80af05/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A health worker wearing a protective medical equipment extracts a blood sample from a patient\u2019s finger to make an antibody test for patients suspected of being infected with for the coronavirus (COVID-19) at the Center Health Teixeira de Freitas, in Niteroi, Brazil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A health worker wearing a protective medical equipment extracts a blood sample from a patient\u2019s finger to make an antibody test for patients suspected of being infected with for the coronavirus (COVID-19) at the Center Health Teixeira de Freitas, in Niteroi, Brazil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cUnfortunately Surgisphere\u2019s tool appears to be a public-facing shell without real data driving it,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the clear data flaws pointed out by many readers of the Lancet article, it is reasonable to conclude that that publication also suffers from the same fundamental problem.\u201d Desai did not respond to questions about the tool.&nbsp;</p> <p>Desai is also facing larger issues. In November 2019, two medical negligence claims were filed to the Cook County court. Desai said in <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/disputed-hydroxychloroquine-study-brings-scrutiny-to-surgisphere-67595\">an interview with the Scientist</a> that he deemed any lawsuit against him to be \u201cunfounded\u201d. He told the Guardian and the Scientist that he stands by the studies, but did not explain how hospitals join and sync their data.</p> <h2>\u2018There are definite doubts\u2019</h2> <p>James Heathers, a research scientist with Northeastern University in the US, said major results in large medical journals can affect medical policies in a matter of days, both at the level of changing local hospital practice and changing governmental health policy. That means it is critical that data is transparent and easy to clarify, especially amid a global pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIf serious problems are found with data in a paper such as this, apart from the potentially catastrophic consequences for the authors, it speaks to a problem with how we aggregate and understand evidence,\u201d Heathers said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is more crucial than [at] any other point \u2026 in modern history that results are transparent, fully assessable, and accurate.

The NEJM<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2020822?query=featured_coronavirus\"> issued a similar expression of concern stating</a>: \u201cWe have asked the authors to provide evidence that the data are reliable.\u201d</p> <p>Surgisphere data is used for retrospective observational studies, a type of study which can be problematic because of the presence of variables that were not controlled for, and selection bias.

Public donations had already fallen due to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/20/oxfam-boss-mark-goldring-apologises-over-abuse-of-haiti-quake-victims\">Haiti sex abuse scandal</a>, and its UK shops, which provided up to \u00a35m a month, have been shut due to coronavirus.</p> <p>The trade union Unite, which has 400 members at the organisation, described the threat to jobs as a \u201ctragedy in the fight against global poverty\u201d.&nbsp;It said it believed a third of the charity\u2019s 800 staff at its Oxford headquarters were at risk of losing their jobs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/21/the-issue-now-is-surviving-countries-react-with-shock-to-oxfam-withdrawal-coronavirus\">'The issue now is surviving': countries react with shock to Oxfam withdrawal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The job losses, part of a fast-tracked restructuring programme to cut costs by up to \u00a316m, are also expected to hit Oxfam offices in Scotland, Wales, Manchester and Newcastle, as well as the specialist warehouse in Bicester, which supplies water tanks. Oxfam GB currently employs 2,040 people.</p> <p>The charity\u2019s short-term plan is to focus on protecting communities from Covid-19 and help them recover from a crisis expected to push half a billion more people into poverty.</p> <p>Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam GB chief executive, said: \u201cThese strategic changes are long planned but I am sorry to be adding to the concerns of our dedicated and talented staff during this difficult time.</p> <p>\u201cThe financial reality \u2013 not least the ongoing and uncertain impact of Covid \u2013 requires us to act now to ensure we live within our means.

The union renewed its call for more government support for the not-for-profit sector.</p> <p>Unite regional officer Jesika Parmar said: \u201cThe threatened job losses at Oxfam are a tragedy in the global fight against poverty.

Oxfam should not be making redundancies while it can still use funding from the job retention scheme to pay for 80% of wages.</p> <p>\u201cYet they decided to keep on two directors who had already resigned and are advertising externally for roles that could be filled internally.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Deaths in St Petersburg cast doubts on Russian Covid-19 statistics</h2> <p>New mortality data from St Petersburg has reignited questions about whether the country\u2019s official tally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/st-petersburg-death-tally-casts-doubt-on-russian-coronavirus-figures\">has discounted thousands of deaths</a> tied to the coronavirus outbreak. Russia\u2019s second-largest city issued 1,552 more death certificates this May than in the previous year, a nearly 32% rise that indicates that hundreds of deaths tied to the pandemic are not reflected in the city\u2019s official coronavirus death toll for the month of 171. However, it is not clear how many of those people had tested positive for the novel coronavirus or were suspected to have been infected.</p> <h2><strong>Known Covid-19 cases worldwide exceed 6.5 million</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">According to Johns Hopkins University</a> there have been 6,530,067 coronavirus cases confirmed worldwide and 386,392 deaths reported.&nbsp;The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording regimes, as well as suspected under-reporting.</p> <h2><strong>UK leads G7 in fall in faith in handling of Covid-19 crisis</strong></h2> <p>An international survey has increasing scepticism over governments\u2019 handling of the coronavirus crisis in the world\u2019s richest countries, with the&nbsp;UK&nbsp;suffering the biggest slump in confidence,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/04/coronavirus-live-news-germany-reveals-major-stimulus-plan-as-global-cases-grow-by-100000-a-day?page=with:block-5ed8ca6d8f08cadb60400e39#block-5ed8ca6d8f08cadb60400e39\">Reuters&nbsp;reports</a>. In May, in the Group of Seven nations as a whole, 48% of respondents approved of how authorities had handled the pandemic, down from 50% in April and 54% in March, the survey published by polling firm Kantar showed. The UK saw the biggest drop - a sharp fall of 18 points from April to 51% - while in the US, Canada, Germany, France and Italy, the declines ranged between two and six points. Japan was the only country to show an increase.</p> <h2>Brazil looks to reopen despite record coronavirus deaths</h2> <p>Brazil registered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/04/coronavirus-live-news-germany-reveals-major-stimulus-plan-as-global-cases-grow-by-100000-a-day?page=with:block-5ed85ee18f082107f453a5e8#block-5ed85ee18f082107f453a5e8\">a record number of daily deaths</a> from the novel coronavirus for a second consecutive day, according to Health Ministry data released on Wednesday, even as city and state authorities move aggressively to open commerce back up.

  "<p>Google any list of the most successful public health interventions of this century or the last, and vaccines will be at the very top. Infectious diseases such as smallpox, measles, diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough) were once prevalent and killed indiscriminately. Smallpox is now eradicated, polio is on its way out, and measles, diphtheria, pertussis and a wide range of other preventable diseases have been decimated in places where proven vaccines are both affordable and accessible.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/global-report-new-clues-about-how-coronavirus-formed-as-us-severs-ties-with-who\">Global report: new clues about role of pangolins in Covid-19 as US severs ties with WHO</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Enter Covid-19, which has skyrocketed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/uk-hospitals-trial-five-new-drugs-search-coronavirus-treatment\">vaccines</a> to the top of the global agenda.&nbsp;Right now, we don\u2019t know how to beat this \u201cnovel\u201d virus that is cutting its swath through human populations for the first time in history.&nbsp;What we do know is that our best chance lies with the discovery of a vaccine. Every day brings a sliver of news \u2013 about a vaccine candidate that shows some promise in animal testing or one that could advance to human trials \u2013 and the world waits with bated breath in urgent hope that scientists and researchers will make the breakthrough that can save all of us from this disease that is devastating our communities and economies.&nbsp;</p> <p>It almost seems too much to hope for. Except that we have done it before.</p> <p>Under the leadership of the World Health Organization, smallpox, which is estimated to have <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-diseases/smallpox/\">killed 300 million people</a> in the 20th century alone, became the world\u2019s first eradicated disease \u2013 entirely through vaccination, combined with robust surveillance, community engagement and global coordination. We are on the cusp of <a href=\"https://www.who.int/features/factfiles/polio/en/\">eradicating polio</a> \u2013 an achievable goal that will not only fulfil a moral obligation to the world\u2019s most vulnerable, but reap cumulative <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/two-out-of-three-wild-poliovirus-strains-eradicated\">savings of $14b</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/two-out-of-three-wild-poliovirus-strains-eradicated\">n</a> by 2050 if we finish the job. Vaccines have contributed to cutting child and maternal mortality virtually in half since the year 2000 (53% and 44%, respectively) \u2013 mostly due to huge expansions in access to immunisation. Vaccines have been an uncategorical success, and millions upon millions of people are alive today because of them.</p> <p>This week, the UK government will convene key partners and countries from around the world at the <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/investing-gavi/resource-mobilisation-process/gavis-3rd-donor-pledging-conference-june-2020\">Global Vaccine Summit</a>. This gathering represents a critical moment to advance collective solutions for Covid-19-related vaccines and to redouble collective commitment and resources to the essential work of routine immunisation for other preventable diseases. During the summit and over the coming months, the following four issues should be kept foremost in mind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Vaccines have been an uncategorical success, and millions upon millions of people are alive today because of them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>First, vaccines work impressively well, but their gains can be reversed without sustained commitment. Even before Covid-19, the world was seeing a worrying resurgence of measles after being on a path towards elimination and saving&nbsp;<a href=\"https://measlesrubellainitiative.org/measles-news/more-than-140000-die-from-measles-as-cases-surge-worldwide/\">more than 21 million lives</a> in the last two decades alone. After Covid-19, measles now may come roaring back, with <a href=\"https://measlesrubellainitiative.org/measles-news/more-than-117-million-children-at-risk-of-missing-out-on-measles-vaccines-as-covid-19-surges/\">more than 117 million children</a> in 37 countries at risk of missing planned vaccines this year, according to the Measles &amp; Rubella Initiative. Similarly, wild poliovirus, which was present in only two remaining countries before Covid-19 began, may once again challenge us despite decades of hard-won progress. Indeed, one of the tragic, lesser told consequences of the pandemic is the interruption to immunisations that could leave millions of children at risk of disease and death from vaccine-preventable diseases.&nbsp;</p> <p>Second, simply developing a vaccine for Covid-19 won\u2019t be enough unless it is widely and globally accessible. We need to embrace the unprecedented scale of partnership between governments, business, international organisations such as the UN and WHO, non-profits, and scientists and researchers, that is necessary to tackle the access and equity challenge seriously. These types of partnerships are possible and have helped save lives at scale before \u2013 from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to the Global Fund, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The recent launch of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, globally coordinated by the WHO, is an important step that will help harness the power of global partnerships to accelerate equitable development of Covid-19 diagnostics, treatments and vaccines.&nbsp;</p> <p>We also need to take whatever ambition we muster for Covid-19 and extend it to other diseases and vulnerable populations. Whether these are families facing cholera in Somalia due to increased flooding, refugees in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, at risk of diphtheria, or thousands of children vulnerable to growing measles outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&nbsp;</p> <p>Third, we must make smarter choices about how we emerge from this crisis and rebuild better health systems. The window for action is short and diminishing by the day. As countries begin to transition out of lockdown, immunisation campaigns that were paused because of Covid-19 are likely to restart. This is a crucial period during which we can strengthen and rebuild the delivery systems necessary to distribute vaccines \u2013 from those that are currently available such as measles and polio, to those we hope are still to come.&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, leaders gathering virtually at the Global Vaccine Summit on Thursday 4 June need to show bracing ambition in pledging new funds for <a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/\">Gavi</a>, the Vaccine Alliance. At the UN Foundation, we are focused on finding innovative solutions to tackle collective challenges. Gavi, a unique public-private partnership between governments, key UN agencies, the vaccine industry, private sector and civil society, is a model of what works. It has been responsible for some of the most breathtaking health gains of the last generation \u2013 accelerating access to new vaccines and increasing immunisations in poor countries.&nbsp;Gavi has set a goal of at least $7.4 bn that is needed to save a staggering 7-8 million lives \u2013 overwhelmingly children under five \u2013 in the next few years alone.&nbsp;Some countries have already stepped up, including the UK, Norway, Canada, Spain, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand and Japan. Others need to follow.</p> <p>Now more than ever, we need world leaders to step up. By showing generous support of Gavi, they can demonstrate the collective values and leadership we need to secure a healthy future. Now is the time to double down on vaccines. Doing so will aid us in the collective fight against Covid-19, as well as our broader fight to make sure that every child, regardless of where they live, has the ability to grow up healthy and realise their fullest potential.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://unfoundation.org/who-we-are/our-board/gro-harlem-brundtland-norway-vice-chair/\" title=\"https://unfoundation.org/who-we-are/our-board/gro-harlem-brundtland-norway-vice-chair/\">Gro Harlem Brundtland</a> is former director-general of the World Health Organization and former prime minister of Norway</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://unfoundation.org/who-we-are/our-people/elizabeth-cousens/\" title=\"https://unfoundation.org/who-we-are/our-people/elizabeth-cousens/\">Elizabeth Cousens</a> is president of the UN Foundation</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

It\u2019s not an official figure, but comes from their own tally of arrest reports.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures show that Los Angeles has had more than a quarter of the national arrests, followed by New York, Dallas and Philadelphia. Many of the arrests have been for low-level offences such as curfew violations and failure to disperse. Hundreds were arrested on burglary and looting charges.</p> \n  <p>During the course of the protests it has been a common refrain from the authorities that \u201coutside agitators\u201d from out-of-town were responsible for the highly visible protests. Minnesota governor Tim Walz even went as far as to say that 80 percent of the participants in the demonstrations were from out of state.</p> \n  <p>The AP figures tell a different story. In a nearly 24-hour period from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon, 41 of the 52 people cited with protest-related arrests in Minneapolis had Minnesota driver\u2019s licenses, according to the Hennepin County sheriff.</p> \n  <p>Likewise, in the nation\u2019s capital, 86 percent of the more than 400 people arrested as of Wednesday afternoon were, according to AP, from Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.</p> \n  <p>Los Angeles Chief Michel Moore told the city\u2019s Police Commission Tuesday the bulk of the arrests, about 2,500, were for failure to disperse or curfew violations. The rest were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence. </p> \n  <p>The only other U.S. city with an arrest toll that comes close to Los Angeles\u2019 is New York, with about 2,000.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8a3848f082107f453a7bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T07:42:57.226Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>If you\u2019ve been following the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media you may have been surprised this morning by a sudden flood of Korean characters and the repeated phrase: \u201cWe stand against racial discrimination.

And in Seattle, demonstrations continued as the mayor announced that the curfew would be lifted.</li> \n   <li><strong>The former defense secretary, James Mattis, who quit over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria, condemned the president\u2019s handling of protests in DC and around the country. </strong>Mattis, like other former military and defense officials, excoriated Trump for having peaceful protestors gassed so he could pose for a photo. </li> \n   <li><strong>Additional charges were filed against the former police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. </strong>The<strong> </strong>Minnesota attorney general, <strong>Keith Ellison, </strong>said that the murder charge against <strong>Derek Chauvin </strong>had been elevated to second-degree murder, and three other officers had been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.</li> \n   <li><strong>Kayleigh McEnany signaled defense secretary Mark Esper\u2019s job may be in trouble. </strong>Asked during her White House briefing about whether the president still has faith in Esper, the press secretary said, \u201cAs of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper.\u201d The comment came after Esper said he would not support sending active-duty troops to states that have seen protests, as <strong>Trump </strong>has suggested.</li> \n   <li><strong>A prominent US police chief called for a nationwide ban on chokeholds </strong>in response to Floyd\u2019s death.<strong> </strong><strong>Cerelyn \u201cCJ\u201d Davis</strong>, the police chief of Durham, North Carolina, said on Good Morning America, \u201cThe emotions and feelings that we see expressed out on the streets of cities all across the country going way back are substantiated.

Instead, he tries to divide us. \u201d</p> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://medium.com/@HolocaustMuseum/the-nazi-plan-to-divide-and-conquer-the-us-army-296a3c97fb54\">a Medium post from 2017</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ushmm.org/\">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</a> elaborated on the Nazis\u2019 strategy and propaganda efforts. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.ushmm.org/outreach/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007679\">Nazis were virulent racists</a>,\u201d the post says, \u201c\u2026 they identified black people as an inferior, alien race that threatened the future existence of western society. But that didn\u2019t stop them from trying to exploit racial tensions among US forces to encourage desertion in the closing days of World War II. </p> \n  <p>\u201cCreating wedges between people had been a Nazi strategy since the party\u2019s inception.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Widely seen as one of the \u201cadults in the room\u201d who attempted to restrain Trump during his first years in office, Mattis resigned as defense secretary over the president\u2019s attempts to withdraw troops from Syria. </p> \n  <p>His dissatisfaction with the president was widely known, but in 2019 the retired marine published a memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/01/call-sign-chaos-review-james-mattis-trump\">Call Sign Chaos</a>, which only obliquely referred to his differences with Trump. Publicising the book, Mattis said he believed it would be inappropriate for him to criticise a sitting president. </p> \n  <p>It seems Trump\u2019s actions on Monday, when he ordered an assault on peaceful protesters outside the White House <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\">so he could stage a photo op at St John\u2019s church</a>, helped to change Mattis\u2019s mind.

He is heartened, he says, by seeing police and other officers who have engaged with the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n  <p>Obama discusses his <strong>task force on 21st-century policing</strong>, which was formed after the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014. </p> \n  <p>Its report, he says, \u201cshowcased a range of proven strategies and aims\u201d meant to be used for reforms. Most of the reforms needed should take place locally, Obama says. It is mayors and county executives that determine police practices, he says, and district and state attorneys decide whether to prosecute cases of police misconduct.</p> \n  <p>Obama says he has been hearing \u201ca little bit of chatter\u201d on the internet about \u201c<strong>voting vs protest</strong>\u201d, and that perhaps civil obedience is a better course of action to achieve change.

There is something different here, he says. Nowadays there is a far more representative cross-section of America, he says, out on the streets protesting, and a majority of Americans think the protests over George Floyd\u2019s death are justified.

Utah-based Nomi had also been serving as the general contractor for testing programs in Utah and Nebraska, where some local <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/04/30/this-is-potential-public/\">reports</a> cast doubt on the accuracy of testing. Iowa, before using Nomi-contracted testing, cross-checked results through its State Hygienic Laboratory. But until the TestIowa machines were vetted, Covid-19 samples had to be processed at Iowa\u2019s State Hygienic Lab, causing more delays.</p> <p><a href=\"https://khqa.com/news/coronavirus/testiowa-equipment-validated-gov-kim-reynolds-says\">Vetting</a> was completed by 14 May and, according to the governor, showed 95% accuracy for determining positive results and 99.7% for determining negative results.</p> <p>A spokeswoman from Nomi health said the company does not \u201ccollect, process, or provide clinical advice on test results\u201d and that sample collection, test administration and processing of tests are all carried out by its partners. </p> <p>Co-Diagnostics develops and manufactures the Covid-19 molecular diagnostics that Nomi uses, in addition to tests for other infectious diseases. It does not, according to its spokeswoman, collect, process or retain test data. Co-Diagnostics\u2019 Covid-19 test has received emergency use authorization from the FDA.</p> <p>\u201cThe accuracy of Co-Diagnostics\u2019 test has been demonstrated time and again in independent third party evaluations, including the recent validation in Iowa,\u201d Co-diagnostics told the Guardian in a statement. \u201cThe company continues to be surprised by reports that ignore this data and that parrot \u2018concerns\u2019 that were originally raised by a competitor and published by the Salt Lake Tribune.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Additional concerns</strong></h2> <p>Meanwhile, public health experts raised concerns about the design of the TestIowa portal, and accessibility of the testing sites. \u201cI have taken the TestIowa assessment and I felt as though the questions were designed by analysts and not people with expertise on infectious disease,\u201d said Lina Tucker Reinders, executive director at the Iowa public health association. The way the program is constructed, she argued, \u201ccould result in or exacerbate inequities\u201d.</p> <p>Nomi Health refutes these allegations and indicates that it collaborated with \u201cleading medical experts\u201d to create the assessment.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tucker Reinders pointed out that the platform\u2019s accessibility is affected by internet access \u2013 in a state with known broadband access issues, especially in rural areas. Only about 65% of Iowa\u2019s 216,007 census blocks have access to broadband internet at speeds of at least 25 mbps download and 3 mbps upload,<a href=\"https://wcfcourier.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/virus-exposes-iowa-s-broadband-weaknesses/article_ff84c089-0659-5871-8757-640badefdabc.html\"> according to 2019 data</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t own a computer, tablet or mobile phone with internet connection, they cannot access the TestIowa site independently,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are advised to have a family member or friend help them enter their data. This is inappropriate because the assessment asks personal medical information.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, the platform is only offered in English and Spanish, making it inaccessible to speakers of other languages common in the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/05/850964016/meatpacking-workers-are-struggling-to-protect-themselves-during-the-pandemic\">factories where Covid-19 is most prevalent</a> in Iowa, where immigrants from Mexico, Bosnia and Burma work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a471b679bc8ddf33f073d3a5dadaefeeefe333cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a471b679bc8ddf33f073d3a5dadaefeeefe333cd/0_0_1807_1205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iowa Department of Public Health workers administer coronavirus tests in a parking lot in Waterloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iowa department of public health workers administer coronavirus tests in a parking lot in Waterloo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Powers/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And residents have complained that the program\u2019s eight drive-through testing sites are hard to access by public transportation and are only open certain hours, mostly weekdays and during day time. Some Iowans have found their closest testing site is hours away.</p> <p>A spokesman for the governor said \u201cthe program also works directly with employers to overcome language barriers that exist\u201d for people who do not speak Spanish or English, and that TestIowa is just one tool individuals can use to get a Covid-19 test. \u201cThat being said, we have made significant improvements in this area and the governor has been a champion for expanding broadband access, especially in rural communities,\u201d the spokesman added. &nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Calls for an investigation</strong></h2> <p>Some health experts in the state have questioned the government\u2019s decision to award the testing contract to an out-of-state company. \u201cThe expertise of Nomi Health and their partners appear to be in the fields of data analytics and engineering, which are not the same as epidemiology,\u201d said Tucker Reinders.</p> <p>To Rossana Rosa, an infectious disease specialist based in Des Moines, it\u2019s clear when looking at the TestIowa platform that it was not made in partnership with the existing public health framework in Iowa. \u201cOf course we welcome any effort to expand testing in Iowa,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is a web-based platform without any relationship or integration with any of the healthcare systems. Patients get a lot of the burden of interpreting a test result or knowing what to do once they get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was surprised by the fact that instead of utilizing established public health entities, we went to a company that has never been involved in diagnostics before,\u201d said Megan Srinivas, an infectious disease physician at the University of North Carolina\u2019s Institute of Global Health and Infectious Diseases. \u201cIt is unusual to do in the setting of a pandemic when we really want to use resources that are reliable.\u201d</p> <p>A Nomi Health spokeswoman disputed the suggestion that the company lacked expertise, and said its co-founder and COO, Josh Walker, had more than 20 years of healthcare experience and the company has partnered with hospital systems, leading disease detection technologies, and other established healthcare entities.</p> <p>\u201cWhile Nomi Health may be a new company, our partners executing on these testing programs are not,\u201d she said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc4a86317a503c9be331829cf22f9f3c1b7dedce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc4a86317a503c9be331829cf22f9f3c1b7dedce/0_0_3600_2406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Healthcare worker test a resident at a drive-through Covid-19 testing site in Waterloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Healthcare worker test a resident at a drive-through Covid-19 testing site in Waterloo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Neibergall/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Iowa lawmakers, however, <a href=\"https://www.kcrg.com/2020/05/28/iowa-lawmakers-call-forinvestigation-of-test-iowa/\">are calling</a> for an investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that TestIowa failed to meet the goals outlined by Governor Reynolds. Iowa taxpayers are on the hook for $26m and they deserve to know whether their money is being spent wisely,\u201d representatives Ruth Ann Gaines and Chris Hall said in a letter last week calling for a government oversight investigation.</p> <p>\u201cWe trust what Iowans and local officials are communicating about their experiences with TestIowa. If Iowans can\u2019t get the answers they deserve regarding TestIowa, it may be time to cancel the contract,\u201d said the letter.</p> <p>Lawmakers are also concerned about the lack of transparency around how the TestIowa contract got awarded. A spokesman for the governor said decision was made in coordination with the Iowa department of public health and the state medical director and epidemiologist. He said Reynolds also spoke with the Utah governor, Gary Herbert, and his staff regarding its parallel program, TestUtah, before making her decision.</p> <p>Lawmakers in other states where Nomi Health is operating have called for similar reviews. In Utah, disease specialists have questioned the company\u2019s results after data showed far lower positive rates than those of other providers.</p> <p>And in Nebraska, the Journal Star <a href=\"https://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/senators-call-on-governor-to-end-test-nebraska-contracts/article_b2176fbb-bae2-5fbd-b372-df08e9208b4c.html\">reported</a> the TestNebraska initiative results were showing a 2% positive rate, which is \u201cwell below the 18% average positive rate for all other tests conducted in Nebraska since testing began in early March\u201d.</p> <p>Nebraska lawmakers have asked the state\u2019s governorto <a href=\"https://kutv.com/news/coronavirus/nebraska-lawmakers-want-to-terminate-27-million-contract-with-test-utah-companies\">terminate the $27m contract</a> with Nomi<strong>,</strong> saying the company has no prior experience with epidemiology. \u201cPerhaps not the best entity to be dealing with this massive project, considering they aren\u2019t a healthcare company and they admittedly don\u2019t know anything about lab testing prior to March of this year,\u201d the Nebraska state senator Machaela Cavanaugh wrote.</p> <p>Nomi Health said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that \u201csome politicians have decided to use their positions to target a community health program run by the state to serve their own political agendas in the midst of a crisis, instead of directing their energy toward taking meaningful action to help the State\u2019s COVID-19 response\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also clear these politicians don\u2019t understand our role or what it takes to pull together an effective testing operation like this so quickly with no defined playbook,\u201d the company added.</p> <p>A Nomi spokeswoman said the backlog of results in Iowa has been resolved and were a normal part of the program ramping up its capabilities during a health crisis. \u201cIt is a herculean effort to launch a state-wide assessment and testing program in record time in the midst of a pandemic with no precedent for doing so,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"317478b99942c8d46943a57d84643d774a7d6e76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/317478b99942c8d46943a57d84643d774a7d6e76/0_0_2244_1494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tyson Foods employee dons a second protective mask outside of the company\u2019s meat processing plant in Waterloo, Iowa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tyson Foods employee dons a second protective mask outside of the company\u2019s meat processing plant in Waterloo, Iowa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USA Today Sports/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Where TestIowa stands</strong></h2> <p>Despite the widespread concerns, Reynolds is<a href=\"https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/governor-stands-by-accuracy-of-testiowa-covid-19-tests\"> moving forward</a> with TestIowa, saying the state is approaching its original goal of 5,000 daily tests.

Nearly 60% of employees at one Tyson plant in Perry, Iowa \u2013 730 employees \u2013 reportedly were infected with the virus. Another Tyson plant, in Waterloo, Iowa, had 1,031 reported cases among about 2,800 workers.</p> <p>An additional outbreak was revealed in a news conference in May in Storm Lake where 555 of the plant\u2019s 2,517 employees have tested positive.</p> <p>In that announcement, the Iowa department of public health said it <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrynard/status/1265679868471148544\">would not be</a> publicly announcing continuing outbreaks at meatpacking plants unless directly asked by reporters. The Iowa department of public health and the governor\u2019s office declined to respond to questions about the number of coronavirus hotspots in the state, and whether those would be tracked by TestIowa.</p>",
  "<p>On 7 October 2001, the US men\u2019s national team carried the weight of a nation\u2019s grief on their shoulders. The crucial 2002 World Cup qualifier with Jamaica was the first national sports event since the 9/11&nbsp;attacks. And the galvanizing feeling of responsibility that the players shared that evening would prove a crucial ingredient in the team\u2019s eventual run to the World Cup quarter-finals eight months later.</p> <p>This is the story of an unlikely group \u2013 largely written off and ridiculed \u2013 who not only delivered an unforgettable accomplishment but exorcised some long-lasting tournament trauma, properly announced the team as a competitive force on a global stage and may have saved North America\u2019s flailing domestic league from extinction.</p> <p><strong>Tony Sanneh (defender):</strong>&nbsp;The Jamaica game was a little surreal. It was almost like coming home during war time.</p> <p><strong>Landon Donovan (forward):</strong>&nbsp;In the locker room before the game Bruce said we\u2019d just gone to war in Afghanistan. I didn\u2019t follow politics. I didn\u2019t know much about foreign policy. But that was a really sobering moment. You realized it was more than a soccer game.</p> <p><strong>Jeff Agoos (defender):&nbsp;</strong>It was very eerie. You were trying to give the country two hours of of peace in a time of turmoil.</p> <p><strong>Bruce Arena (head coach):&nbsp;</strong>We felt obligated to represent our country in the right way. We had a great win \u2013 Joe Max-Moore scored twice, the winner from a penalty. There were a bunch of unusual results elsewhere and things pieced together so that we qualified that day.</p> <p><strong>Agoos:&nbsp;</strong>Afterwards, the entire crowd was on the field with us and it was this symbiotic thing. And then it was just joy and incredible relief when they announced the other scores and we were through. To share that moment with those fans in that space and in that time was absolutely incredible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/great-satan-1-2-iran-the-most-politically-charged-match-in-world-cup-history\">Great Satan 1-2 Iran: the most politically charged match in World Cup history</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>With qualification secured, optimism still wasn\u2019t particularly high. The US were drawn in Group D alongside Portugal, co-hosts South Korea and Poland. An early exit was predicted, just like at the 1998 tournament. In France, Steve Sampson\u2019s team had lost all three group games, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/20/great-satan-1-2-iran-the-most-politically-charged-match-in-world-cup-history\">a high-profile, multi-layered defeat to Iran</a>. When the dust settled, there were inevitable recriminations and finger pointing. But for some veteran members of Bruce Arena\u2019s squad, the scar tissue went back even further.</em></p> <p><strong>Agoos:&nbsp;</strong>In \u201898, I made the squad but didn\u2019t play. That was very hard to take. But not making the team four years earlier was devastating. After I get the news, I go home. I look at my training gear and I\u2019m like, \u2018I never want to see this again\u2019. I had a fireplace and I said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s one way to do it\u2019. So I put the training gear in, put some papers under it and burned it. I needed a physical way to move on.</p> <p><strong>Pablo Mastroeni (midfielder):&nbsp;</strong>It was about turning the page and starting over for our group.</p> <p><strong>Bryan Chenault (communications manager, US Soccer, 1999-2005)&nbsp;</strong>Some personalities started to emerge. Clint Mathis came out of nowhere. People who followed MLS knew who he was but I don\u2019t think any of us thought he\u2019d end up on a cover of Sports Illustrated before the World Cup.</p> <p><em>By the time Mathis\u2019 issue hit the newsstands in late-May, the US squad were already in Korea where jetlag wasn\u2019t the only thing they had to get used to. South Korea\u2019s police chief declared the team a possible terror target and instigated a remarkable collection of security measures.</em></p> <p><strong>Donovan:</strong>&nbsp;There was a lot of fear, right? They shut down the airport when we came through. There were helicopters tailing us. There were some moments when you looked around and said, \u2018Jesus, I can\u2019t believe this is real\u2019.</p> <p><strong>Josh Wolff (forward):&nbsp;</strong>Our bus was surrounded by soldiers. There were three SUVs in front of us, three behind us. The choppers were overhead. You had air quality testing going on at our field because there was talk of chemical warfare.</p> <p><strong>Clint Mathis (forward):</strong>&nbsp;There were a couple of tanks on the tarmac when we arrived in Seoul. We\u2019d pull into stadiums and could see guys with those rocket cannons up in the hills. Security were everywhere, even in the elevators.</p> <p><strong>Sanneh:&nbsp;</strong>There wasn\u2019t a lot of rules except to make smart decisions. We were very relaxed. We had the right leaders. That was the difference between our World Cup and the one that followed in 2006. That team was even younger and it was like they were on a trip to Ibiza. It went nuts. There were different people in the hotel and they weren\u2019t mature enough to handle the freedom.</p> <p><em>It was a Monday morning when the team were made aware of the latest edition of the New York Times Magazine. Earlier that month, seven players had posed for photographer Mattias Vriens-McGrath.

Vriens-McGrath wanted something high-fashion, glamorous and provocative. Some embraced the concept, like Landon Donovan, who was captured <a href=\"https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2013/08/09/remembering-fondly-usmnts-2002-armani-esque-photoshoot-sideline\">seductively drinking from a water fountain</a>.

Meanwhile, Pablo Mastroeni straddled a low-rise beam in a pair of white linen pants and a $1,200 Roberto Cavalli \u2018turquoise-studded shirt\u2019.</em></p> <p><strong>Mastroeni:</strong>&nbsp;I enjoyed that shirt. The problem was the price tag.</p> <p><strong>Donovan:&nbsp;</strong>I was 20 years old and very naive. I think we were all a little taken aback. But we quickly realised there was a clear agenda by the magazine and the photographer that hadn\u2019t been explained to us. It was more funny than anything. At that point of our soccer history, any press was good press.</p> <p><strong>Agoos:</strong>&nbsp;I still ask Landon if he\u2019s thirsty.</p> <p><strong>Mathis:&nbsp;</strong>I was a part of that photoshoot but I wasn\u2019t straddling anything so I kinda got brushed aside on that.</p> <p><strong>Chenault:</strong>&nbsp;2002 was the best example of the men\u2019s team grabbing peoples\u2019 attention. At that point, people probably only knew Alexi Lalas and Cobi Jones. Now it was, \u2018Who\u2019s Clint Mathis?\u2019 and, \u2018Why have I heard of this Landon Donovan kid?\u2019 That bled into more mainstream media, which is what US soccer has always needed to get to the next level.</p> <p><em>For the World Cup opener against Portugal, the US were without injured captain Claudio Reyna. Arena started Mastroeni in midfield, and a pair of 20-year-olds in Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley.</em></p> <p><strong>Donovan:</strong>&nbsp;I walked out of the tunnel for the warm-up and peeked out at this full stadium. I shared this special, powerful moment with Beez. We didn\u2019t say anything. It was just a look. It was like we couldn\u2019t believe we\u2019d made it to this point. There was a belief, especially with the younger players. \u2018Why can\u2019t we beat Portugal?</p> <p><strong>Agoos:&nbsp;</strong>They didn\u2019t give us enough credit or respect. They felt they could just walk all over us. They didn\u2019t like pressure, tackles, 50/50s.</p> <p><strong>Mastroeni:&nbsp;</strong>At one point, I go to tackle [Luis] Figo. As I\u2019m sliding, he just lifts the ball up so I end up sliding under him.

We were looking around like, \u2018Shit, what do we do now?\u2019</p> <p><strong>Sanneh:&nbsp;</strong>When<strong>&nbsp;</strong>it went to 3-2, everything was running through your mind. We\u2019d had so many good games. There was that lingering question: did we know how to win? Or was this who we were? The team that played well but weren\u2019t able to see games out.</p> <p><strong>Mastroeni:</strong>&nbsp;When they took Rui Costa off, it was a testament of our commitment to overcome the opponent psychologically. That\u2019s what separated us from a lot of teams in that tournament.</p> <p><strong>Arena:&nbsp;</strong>I think of the 2006 World Cup group and the squad I inherited to try and qualify for 2018. None had the talent and the character this one had. It\u2019s not even close. In 2017, we said that if we managed to qualify we\u2019d have to make a lot of changes. Because some of the players were the kind of guys you can\u2019t depend on in tough moments.

Clint was racing around the field calling himself \u2018Luis Figo\u2019, in a sarcastic, sort-of pissed off way at Bruce. At one point, the ball came to him. He just picked it up and booted it, as far as he could, into the stands. For no reason. In the middle of training.</p> <p><strong>Arena:</strong><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>We were concerned about [Mathis\u2019s] fitness but he could score goals. When you look back at 2014, you\u2019d say that if it wasn\u2019t for Tim Howard then the US doesn\u2019t get a result in any game. In 2002, you couldn\u2019t point to any individual. You could point to 15 guys as the reason the US was successful. Clint fit right into that.</p> <p><strong>Mastroeni:</strong>&nbsp;Clint wanted a mohawk so I told him I\u2019d wing it and do my best. He liked it. We took a quick nap but ended up sleeping through our alarm for the pre-game meal.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Mathis</strong>: Oh my God. To show up late with a mohawk? You can probably imagine the fury going through Bruce\u2019s blood.</p> <p><em>After 24 minutes,</em>&nbsp;<em>Mathis got his moment. Teed up by an exquisite pass from John O\u2019Brien, he took one touch and then drove the ball into the bottom corner.</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctBKzj6HUSk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ctBKzj6HUSk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Mathis:&nbsp;</strong>I made a little run and with pinpoint accuracy Johnny played an unbelievable ball over the top. Instinct set in. It\u2019s about timing. A split-second after I released the shot, the defender hit me. I\u2019ll never forget that goal.</p> <p><strong>Arena:&nbsp;</strong>We had three players that played 90 minutes in our five games: Friedel, Sanneh and John O\u2019Brien. John was as good as any player in that World Cup. He\u2019s as talented as anyone who\u2019s ever worn a US shirt. He was simply an outstanding player.</p> <p><strong>Sanneh:&nbsp;</strong>I think we scored too early and it let us relax. We started to believe in ourselves too much and allowed Korea back in the game.</p> <p><em>With 12 minutes remaining, the South Koreans scored and the game ended 1-1. Still, a point from their final fixture against Poland four days later would ensure USA\u2019s progress to the knockout round.</em></p> <p><strong>Sanneh:&nbsp;</strong>One of my team-mates [at Nurnburg] was&nbsp;Jacek Krzyn\u00f3wek. We were chatting before the game and he was saying, \u2018We\u2019ve disgraced our country. Everyone\u2019s mad. We\u2019re playing all our reserves because our coach is pissed off\u2019.</p> <p><strong>Arena:</strong>&nbsp;Poland were already eliminated. When we got their team, we knew nothing about the players. I remember talking to our scout, a Polish-American, on the phone in the locker room asking about some of their guys. We got beat up. A couple of our players made some huge mistakes that hurt us dearly. But, in these competitions you need a bit of luck along the way. We certainly got it that day.&nbsp;Sometimes it\u2019s a complete crapshoot.</p> <p><em>Midway through the second half, the US trailed 3-0 and were heading for elimination. But then a lifeline. Two hours north in Incheon, Park Ji-sung gave South Korea a lead against Portugal they never surrendered. Despite a 3-1 loss, the US finished second in Group D and were through to face Mexico in the last-16. With the team\u2019s profile on the rise and an intense derby ahead, a phone call with president George W Bush was arranged before the game.</em></p> <p><strong>Mastroeni:</strong>&nbsp;All of a sudden, we were important and people cared about us. We were all huddled around the phone. I remember him vividly saying, \u2018I have a bet with my amigo, President Vicente Fox, so boys ... let\u2019s go get \u2018em. Don\u2019t let me down.\u2019</p> <p><em>Mexico were runaway favourites after impressively topping a group featuring Croatia, Italy and Ecuador. With Agoos injured and Frankie Hejduk suspended, Arena switched to a 3-5-2 for the battle in Jeonju.</em></p> <p><strong>Arena:&nbsp;</strong>I\u2019ve coached well over a hundred games for the US and it\u2019s by far the most talented roster the country has ever put together. We could adapt. We could adjust to things. It wasn\u2019t an issue and nobody blinked an eye. Everyone was prepared to play a role, whether they were in the starting lineup or not.</p> <p><strong>Donovan:</strong>&nbsp;In 2001, we had finally flipped the script and beat Mexico at home. For so long we didn\u2019t beat them anywhere. And miraculously, we get this opportunity at a World Cup.</p> <p><strong>Sanneh:&nbsp;</strong>There was no home-field advantage. It was a case of, \u2018Let\u2019s do this once and for all\u2019.</p> <p><em>Arena\u2019s team selection and tactical tweaks worked superbly. After eight minutes, Reyna \u2013 pushed into a wing-back role on the right \u2013 broke down the flank. Wolff darted to the near post to pick up the cross and flicked a pass into the space behind him. McBride, left all alone, did the rest.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11813e26b84a2f36ab98713d4db8bc0f38f197a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11813e26b84a2f36ab98713d4db8bc0f38f197a4/0_7_2048_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brian McBride scores the opener against Mexico\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brian McBride scores the opener against Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oleg Popov/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Wolff:&nbsp;</strong>There was a comfort playing alongside Brian. I stretched the line and he got on the end of things. I played in half-spaces and drew people in. And the goal was just like that. We knew it was gonna be a war, a bloodbath. But once it started, we matched their intensity.</p> <p><strong>Donovan:&nbsp;</strong>At one point, me and Luis Hernandez were getting into it. He told me he was gonna kill my mother. I was such a punk little kid and probably deserved some form of abuse, maybe not to that extreme.</p> <p><em>A combination of Friedel saves and the woodwork kept Mexico at bay and then, midway through the second-half, Lewis raced clear and crossed for Donovan to head home.

It\u2019s the one that got away but Germany knew how to win. There\u2019s a lot of woulda, coulda, shouldas.</p> <p><strong>Donovan:&nbsp;</strong>It was by far our best performance.

I do. There was one guy, Oliver Kahn, who had an absolute blinder.</p> <p><strong>Mastroeni:&nbsp;</strong>After the game,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I was selected for doping and so was Kahn. He\u2019s in the hallway and just smoking cigarette after cigarette after cigarette. I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u201cI can\u2019t believe this guy\u201d. Celebratory smokes, I guess.

And we sat there for, like, three hours \u2013 just looking at each other - because he couldn\u2019t pee.</p> <p><strong>Mathis:</strong>&nbsp;I\u2019ll never forget being on the bus back to the hotel. At first it was a little quiet, a few speeches. Then Earnie gets up and belts out Frank Sinatra\u2019s My Way...</p> <p><strong>Wolff:&nbsp;</strong>That captured everything. The journey, the story.</p> <p><strong>Mastroeni:</strong>&nbsp;It was a really profound moment. What everyone had bought into, the belief we had in each other and how we went about it ... that was \u201cour way\u201d.</p> <p><em>If the US had beaten Germany, only South Korea would have stood between them and a place in the World Cup final. But even a defeat in the quarter-finals had a huge effect on soccer\u2019s standing in the US.</em></p> <p><strong>Arena:&nbsp;</strong>I think if we failed miserably at the 2002 World Cup, the way the league was going at the time maybe it wouldn\u2019t be here today. I think it went a long way to keeping MLS around.</p> <p><strong>Donovan:</strong>&nbsp;Soccer after \u201898 had taken a beating. I don\u2019t want to go so far as to say soccer would\u2019ve failed without it but 2002 definitely was a catalyst to help us get better. And it certainly put MLS on the map because half our roster played there.</p> <p><strong>Sanneh:&nbsp;</strong>We came out of this thinking, \u2018We no longer have to play second fiddle\u2019. The idea of the US team being a bunch of good athletes who just park the bus was gone.</p> <p><strong>Mathis:&nbsp;</strong>It gave credibility to the US soccer player.</p> <p><strong>Mastroeni:&nbsp;</strong>We\u2019d been in an arena with the giants and held our own.

  "<p>To drive growth, businesses know they need to embrace digital transformation. One of the ways to make the leap is by training staff to use modern technology in order to boost efficiency and drive up production.</p> <p>However, according to recent <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/pwc-global-upskilling-survey.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">research</a> by PwC, though three in four (73%) UK workers are eager to learn new digital skills to better understand technology, only half of the workforce (49%) are being given the opportunity to develop those skills outside their normal role. Among the 11 countries surveyed, the UK stands out as the worst offender for employers not empowering staff to develop their digital potential.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology-at-pwc-our-human-story/2020/apr/14/how-an-online-hub-upskills-job-seekers-it-shows-you-what-the-new-world-looks-like\">How an online hub upskills job seekers: \u2018It shows you what the new world looks like\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The findings underline the importance of a business developing its people, and PwC stresses this should not only be applied to top and middle levels of seniority but also junior staff.</p> <p>There are two reasons to ensure young people are developed. First of all, it helps them to understand technology better and, second, it allows them to pass on their skills through reverse mentoring. The result is that younger generations of employees learn new skills, grow in confidence and develop leadership skills as they share their knowledge with others across the organisation.</p> <p>That has certainly been the experience of Danielle Quinlan, who uses skills she has learned on PwC\u2019s Digital Accelerator programme to guide and upskill colleagues. While this programme is not available to everyone in the firm, it does include people of all grades.</p> <p>Quinlan recently took part in a panel discussion on a firm-wide webcast on PwC\u2019s upskilling agenda to its 20,000 UK employees, and she featured alongside UK chairman Kevin Ellis in an internal video on the subject.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing how, as part of the programme, we\u2019ve been given a platform to drive change and innovation in the firm, regardless of grade and experience, which means passing on our knowledge and skills to those more senior as well as our peers.</p> <p>\u201cThe programme starts with leadership training before expanding to cover new technologies. So we started out by learning new ways to approach problems and how to lead teams. I loved the way people from all different business areas were grouped together on the course. We\u2019ve always recognised that diverse groups of people allow you to learn to think in new ways that you might not have done otherwise, and that really showed throughout the programme.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"43e7f0c0112e05752c09a1002704b656f17c42ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43e7f0c0112e05752c09a1002704b656f17c42ed/0_43_3811_4760/801.jpg\" alt=\"Danielle Quinlan\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danielle Quinlan: \u2018Diverse groups of people allow you to learn to think in new ways.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bethany Lavin Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quinlan joined the company on its Flying Start programme, which saw her combine a four-year accountancy degree at the University of Reading with regular work placements at PwC.</p> <p>\u201cThe beauty of being on the Flying Start programme is that you have already had a term\u2019s worth of work experience at PwC for every year of study, so I\u2019d effectively worked for a year by the time I joined,\u201d she explains.</p> <p>\u201cThat meant I could join as a senior associate, rather than an associate, which has put me a year ahead of where I\u2019d have been if I\u2019d not been part of the programme.\u201d</p> <p>For Quinlan, the big surprise has been the level at which she has been trusted to work, both when on work placement as a student and then in her first couple of years as an employee.</p> <p>Quinlan has senior members of staff she can look to for support, and she has a close working relationship with Matthew Hall, office senior partner at PwC\u2019s Gatwick office, giving her input and passing on digital skills, for example. He believes that developing and then learning from younger employees, as he has from Quinlan, is an effective way to encourage diversity and ensure skills are shared between people of all ages and pay grades.</p> <p>\u201cWe operate in a rapidly changing world where technology offers huge opportunities to change how we support our clients and work with each other. This requires us to adapt and change.</p> <p>\u201cAs a firm we employ a large number of people with diverse skills and backgrounds, and through fostering a collaborative culture we create an environment where we get the benefit of everyone\u2019s unique skills and experience. Empowering our more junior people to have an active role in how we adopt new technologies is a great way of using their skills, supporting their development and accelerating our own digital transformation,\u201d says Hall.</p> <p>He believes the Digital Accelerator programme, which equipped Quinlan with the skills she has passed on, is vital. It provides proof of the firm respecting the knowledge and capabilities of all its people, no matter their grade, and it recognises young members of the company as its future leaders, he says. The programme not only encourages the business to embrace change and new technologies, it plays a central role in equipping the organisation\u2019s staff with the skills they will need to lead the organisation in the future.</p>",
  "<p>International flights taking off from the UK must be taken into account in the government\u2019s calculations on reaching net zero emissions as part of a \u201cgreen\u201d recovery for the airline industry, a transport thinktank has urged.</p> <p>The government has given loan bailouts to airlines totalling \u00a31.5bn since the coronavirus outbreak, with no environmental conditions attached.</p> <p>Ryanair is the latest company to secure a \u00a3600m loan from the scheme, despite its chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s outspoken condemnation of such bailouts across Europe as uncompetitive state aid. British Airways secured a \u00a3300m loan and EasyJet received \u00a3600m.</p> <p>The thinktank Transport and Environment calculates that more than \u00a330bn has been promised or given in bailouts to airlines across Europe due to Covid-19, and it said the recovery of the industry must be sustainable and tied to policies to cut carbon emissions.</p> <p>Among these, it said international aviation emissions must be included in the government targets to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. The Committee on Climate Change has <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-international-aviation-and-shipping/\">recommended</a> that emissions from international flights should be included in net zero calculations \u2013 at present they are not counted at all \u2013 but the government has yet to respond to the committee\u2019s letter.</p> <p>\u201cThe government should ensure international aviation and shipping emissions are including within the net zero target,\u201d said Greg Archer, the UK director of Transport and Environment. \u201cThe aviation industry is currently relying on buying cheap, unreliable offsets for its emissions. This is no solution to avoiding a climate catastrophe.\u201d</p> <p>He said the recovery of the industry had to have conditions attached, including new aviation taxes to manage growth, a moratorium on new runways and terminals and a mandate on airlines to buy sustainable aviation fuels.</p> <p>\u201cThe tragedy of the coronavirus pandemic provides an opportunity to reset the aviation industry\u2019s insatiable demand for fossil fuels and to place it on a sustainable future pathway,\u201d Archer said. \u201cRather than a return to business as usual, aviation must now \u2018build back better\u2019 and initiate a green recovery. Aviation&nbsp;bailouts must be&nbsp;exclusively focused on ensuring a green recovery and supporting employees.\u201d</p> <p>UK aviation emissions are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/06/aviation-q-and-a\">estimated to be 13-15%</a> of the UK\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions. These include from international flights departing from the UK, and non-CO2 emissions associated with these flights. By 2050, if demand is unchecked, passenger numbers are predicted to rise by 70% and aviation will become the largest emitter of greenhouse gases.</p> <p>International aviation emissions could be calculated by including emissions of planes that take off from the UK. Archer said the UK could be a global leader and take responsibility for its share of international aviation emissions.</p> <p>\u201cIt is now clear the coronavirus pandemic is transforming the way we travel,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pandemic similarly creates an opportunity for a reset in aviation and there should not be a return to business as usual but to create a recovery towards sustainable aviation.\u201d</p>",

As a result, we\u2019ve all been experiencing far better air quality, and many want this to continue.</p> <p>\u201cA precipitous fall in traffic on our roads has suddenly given British cities cleaner air and we must all realise that returning back to the norm is not an option,\u201d says Charlie Jardine, founder and CEO of EO Charging.</p> <p><strong>Autonomous vehicles and sharing<br></strong>Another way to cut emissions and congestion \u2013 as well as to reduce costs \u2013 is to use our vehicles far more efficiently. Most cars spend the majority of their lifespan parked on a driveway or street, and there are comparable inefficiencies in larger vehicles, too.</p> <p>Laurence Weir, technology lead at the engineering company Plextek, is among a growing number of experts predicting the growth of vehicle leasing on a \u201cper trip\u201d basis. Few of us will own cars, he suggests. Instead, we will take advantage of smart platforms that will match our journey needs with the appropriate autonomous vehicles.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us currently drive to work alone in a car with enough space for a five person family going on a week\u2019s holiday and, for a lot of the rest of the time, that car sits dormant on a driveway or in a work car park. It\u2019s clearly not the most efficient use of materials,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Autonomous vehicles would also be a real gamechanger for freight and haulage, Weir adds. \u201cThe haulage industry would be transformed. Currently, so much of the logistics and costs revolve around the driver and the availability of a vehicle large enough to make it efficient. Without the driver, goods could be moved around in smaller, discrete crates at the optimum time of day, therefore making the use of the road network much more efficient.\u201d</p> <p>Artificial intelligence is already changing the way vehicles are designed, says Holger Hampf, president of the BMW subsidiary Designworks. \u201cAI is more of an aid in efficiency rather than in the development of entirely new designs,\u201d he says. \u201cThe designer is becoming more like a conductor; setting directions and making decisions.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Apps and software</strong><br>Transport is moving away from being centred on ownership and is instead becoming a service you can access from your phone. The term \u201cMobility as a Service\u201d (MaaS) is now an industry buzzword and is suggestive of how much tech and transport are overlapping.</p> <p>Last year, the navigation app Citymapper unveiled a pass that enables users to pay for all London tubes, buses, bikes and even taxis via one payment card. Nearly everyone has a wallet and a phone and with those two items we\u2019ll soon all be able to rapidly access transport.</p> <p><strong>Pedal power </strong><br>Mark Hodgson, founder of Co Cars and Co Bikes, has embraced the all-electric theme with gusto, offering pedal power and engines to his club members. He describes short-term hire for an e-bike or electric car as a smart option.</p> <p>\u201cOur experience shows that there\u2019s huge interest in zero-emission travel,\u201d says Hodgson, adding that electric cars are the most popular part of his fleet, perhaps suggesting that, given the choice, people will pick the cleaner option. Meanwhile, he describes e-bikes as a credible, \u201cnon-sweaty\u201d, alternative to driving.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/plug-into-hybrid/2020/may/19/a-tipping-point-is-likely-in-2021-why-electric-vehicles-will-soon-dominate-uk-roads\">\u2018A tipping point is likely in 2021\u2019: why electric vehicles will soon dominate UK roads</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Car manufacturers are investing heavily in electric vehicles. As well as having a range of 10 plug-in hybrid vehicles, often the first step for consumers towards a fully electric car,<strong> </strong>BMW is planning on building its iNext model from 2021, describing it as \u201cfully networked, fully electric\u201d. These \u201ccars of the future\u201d, complete with a newly designed steering wheel, talking functions and increasing autonomy, are starting to resemble a certain car called Kitt, which for those old enough to remember was one of the stars of a 1980s TV show, Knight Rider.</p> <p>There are big challenges ahead for electrification. Converting planes from jet fuel to a battery-powered solution still appears to be some way off. But rapidly growing economies such as India and China do seem to be embracing electrification where it makes sense to do so.</p> <p>Mathias Lelievre, CEO of the sustainability consultancy Engie Impact, points to \u201cmammoth momentum\u201d in China, which is expected to have <a href=\"http://asiaresearch.daiwacm.com/eg/cgi-bin/files/China_New_Energy_Vehicles_Sector_161201.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">200,000-450,000 e-buses by the end of 2020</a>. Meanwhile, at the other end of the scale, in India the ancient rickshaw is receiving an electric makeover.</p> <p>\u201cIndia [is purchasing] about 11,000 new electric rickshaws every month \u2013 not because of government mandates or even sustainability goals but because they\u2019re cheaper than conventional rickshaws, which enables operators and drivers to make more money,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Finally, as lockdown restrictions begin to ease, many of us are taking advantage of home delivery services. Johan Herrlin, CEO of Ito World, ponders whether this could mean a rebirth of an EV that was once ubiquitous on British streets \u2013 the milk float.</p> <p>\u201cWhere milk delivery companies still operate, they are seeing very high demand,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps the local grocery home delivery market will undergo permanent change after Covid-19, and we might see a return to local electric vehicles making deliveries.\u201d</p> <p><em>Technology drives the world, and is the beating heart of every BMW.

  "<p>Love it or loathe the wasps and lack of toilets, the outdoors is where it\u2019s at this summer if you want to socialise in (relative) safety.</p> <p>Picnics are going to take on a greater significance, which \u2013 says Sam Herlihy, the co-owner of the quality sandwich outlet <a href=\"https://www.sonsanddaughterslondon.com/\">Sons + Daughters</a> \u2013 requires us to confront an uncomfortable truth: \u201cWe pretend \u2018the great English picnic\u2019 is in our DNA, but we\u2019re garbage at it.\u201d Which raises the question: how can we up our picnic game?</p> <h2>Streamline and strategise</h2> <p>\u201cTake as little as possible. That\u2019s the big mistake people make: too much kit,\u201d says Ali Ray, the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Picnic-Book-Ali-Ray/dp/0749581158\">The Picnic Book</a>. A picnic blanket is a sensible investment (\u201can old curtain won\u2019t protect you from a wet bum\u201d) or physically distancing friends could each bring a tote bag with a small cushion in it to sit on. But, seating aside, Ray suggests having a simple, compact picnic kit, stowed and ready to roll, consisting of a cool bag; sharp knife (folding, non-lockable with a blade less than 7cm long is advisable, legally); small chopping board; napkins; old scarf to lay food on; and, possibly, some forks and cheap melamine plates.</p> <p>Put the chopping board flat at the bottom of the cool bag to give it shape. Or roughly insulate a rucksack with two old newspapers and throw in an ice pack to create a cool bag. \u201cI\u2019ve also got one of those granny trolleys, which is spot on for loading everything in,\u201d says Ray.</p> <p>Foodwise, you don\u2019t need lots. But you do need items that combine well and can be easily served and eaten. Panic-buying at the local petrol station is likely to be more expensive and less satisfying than, for instance, investing in some decent bread and ham or spending an hour making a couple of salads and one key item (a frittata, coronation chicken or a hollowed-out and filled crusty picnic loaf).</p> <p>\u201cSanitiser and wet wipes are a must,\u201d adds Saima Khan, the chef-founder of <a href=\"http://thehampsteadkitchen.com/\">the Hampstead Kitchen</a>, which is now delivering picnics. \u201cDon\u2019t forget music and a portable charger.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"783bfa289fddbe8b0e658dd2a76fb2f3cafe9909\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/783bfa289fddbe8b0e658dd2a76fb2f3cafe9909/0_276_5800_3480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The perfect picnic spot only exists in movies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The perfect picnic spot only exists in movies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uwe Krejci/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Be decisive</strong></h2> <p>The perfect picnic spot, that immaculate glade by a clear stream, mainly exists in movies. You can waste a lot of time looking for it. Set up promptly. \u201cPeople get so grumpy walking too far, especially kids,\u201d warns Ray.</p> <h2><strong>Make sandwiches on site</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take sandwiches,\u201d says Herlihy. They may get squashed or clingfilm sweaty in transit. \u201cBuild them in situ. That\u2019s the move.\u201d</p> <p>Given the logistical challenges of keeping things consistently cold or warm mid-picnic (note: a cold scotch egg is a tragedy), use sandwich ingredients, such as cheese and charcuterie, whose flavours come alive as they warm. \u201cIn this country, people probably eat cheese too cold and have meats straight from the fridge. Warming them is not a bad idea,\u201d says Herlihy, who recommends using olive oil rather than butter to lubricate the bread. \u201cIt\u2019s practical, and butter feels weird if the sun\u2019s shining.\u201d</p> <p>If making sandwiches beforehand, Maria Whitehead, a co-owner of Cumbria\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hawksheadrelish.com/\">Hawkshead Relish</a> company, recommends using frozen bread, so that the sandwich defrosts, but stays cool for a period. Rick Toogood, chef-owner at Padstow\u2019s <a href=\"http://prawnonthelawn.com/\">Prawn on the Lawn</a>, transports filled baguettes in Pringles tubes. \u201cGuarantees a perfect sandwich.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Zero-fuss finger food</strong></h2> <p>From chef Vivek Singh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/home/recipes/recipe_directory/v/vivek-singh-s-punjabisamosas.html\">samosas</a> (\u201cThey work well hot or cold\u201d) to Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/16/yotam-ottolenghi-picnic-recipes\">harissa-spiced tuna picnic cake</a> (\u201cTuna mayonnaise, potato salad, boiled eggs, rolled into one\u201d), there are endless foods that, once made, are a cinch to serve at picnics. No plates. No cutlery. Pre-portioned. Self-service.</p> <p>Ryan Blackburn, chef-owner at Ambleside\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.oldstamphouse.com/\">Old Stamp House</a>, makes a \u201cwhat\u2019s in the fridge?\u201d kind of tortilla, frying chorizo, sliced onion and garlic, cubed potato and any suitable veg, before adding four beaten eggs and \u2013 just as it sets \u2013 cheese, and then bunging it under the grill. \u201cLet it go cold and slice into wedges, ready to cart off the next morning.\u201d</p> <p>Ravinder Bhogal, who runs the currently delivery-only London restaurant <a href=\"https://jikonilondon.com/\">Jikoni</a>, loves stuffed parathas on picnics. Hot or cold, they hit the spot. \u201cMy favourite stuffing of late is, untraditionally, kimchi and mature cheddar. The dough takes up the kimchi juices while the cheese mellows everything out, especially if you\u2019ve a feisty kimchi.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48044898dead80f8fd513a302dd701b78ebc41e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48044898dead80f8fd513a302dd701b78ebc41e4/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Picnic spread.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Strengthen salad</strong></h2> <p>Combine robust ingredients that, unlike a leafy green salad, retain their integrity and look appetising after being jostled in a container. Pasta, potato, grain and bean salads hold up, as do firm, non-watery vegetables such as fennel, radish, carrot, grilled courgette or cabbage. To avoid any unappetising sogginess, Ray brings her salad dressings in old screw-top spice jars and deploys them as she serves.</p> <h2>Essential extras</h2> <p>Travelling light is a relative concept. Good condiments are probably more essential than quality food. Like many people, Milli Taylor, the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/party-perfect-bites-9781788791571.html\">Party Perfect Bites</a>, is currently obsessed with Lao Gan Ma crispy chilli oil. \u201cIt\u2019s my picnic essential: a chilli oil like no other, which packs a big flavour spooned over potato salad, shop-bought hummus or cold soba noodles.\u201d</p> <p>From sweet chutneys to salsa verde, each has its picnic advocate. A step up is Khan\u2019s preference for packing toppings, such as crumbled feta, lemon zest and pomegranate seeds, which guests use to jazz up her lamb chops or grilled vegetables.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1f59f88fa7b5cbb1f1349bcbfac094544265ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1f59f88fa7b5cbb1f1349bcbfac094544265ecc/0_1296_4476_2685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The big mistake people make is too much kit.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The big mistake people make is too much kit.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dougal Waters/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Chilled-out drinking</h2> <p>Rather than lugging a cool box along, a cool bag or that improvised rucksack chiller should suffice. There are DIY workarounds, too. Foil wrapping (first layer reflecting in, second out), should keep a bottle of chilled white wine sufficiently cool for a couple of hours. Likewise, a six-pack of cold beers wrapped tightly in two carrier bags. On the beach, digging a beer hole will also help.</p> <p>Organised drinkers will have various \u201cwine sleeves\u201d in the freezer, ready to slip around a chilled bottle. Some, such as Vacu Vin\u2019s well-reviewed <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vacu-Vin-Rapid-Active-Cooler/dp/B00VK9KEC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8\">Active Cooler</a>, will chill warm bottles down (various stockists, about \u00a39).</p> <p>Currently leading virtual tastings at <a href=\"https://www.thewineworkshop.club/\">thewineworkshop.club</a>, the wine expert Jane Parkinson is precisely that sort of organised drinker. But in an emergency, she will pop an ice cube into a glass of white. \u201cIt\u2019s controversial \u2013 10 years ago I\u2019d have gone: \u2018Ridiculous!\u2019 But now I\u2019d rather have cold wine.\u201d Parkinson\u2019s other hack is to chill white wine to near freezing \u2013 don\u2019t shatter the bottle \u2013 before leaving, so it\u2019s still cold on an arrival. </p> <h2><strong>Wine choice</strong></h2> <p>By insisting on very cold white or ros\u00e9 at a picnic, are we making life hard for ourselves? Instead, should we be drinking lightly chilled red? Most red wine is served too warm and many \u201clow-tannin, fresh, juicy\u201d reds (beaujolais, other gamays, pinot noir, Austrian zweigelt wines) will be \u201cperked up\u201d by refrigerating them before you set out or sitting them in a stream while you drink. \u201cIf it\u2019s cooler than people are used to, that\u2019s no bad thing, as long as it\u2019s not some delicate old burgundy,\u201d says Parkinson. And if it warms up a bit over the day, it\u2019s not a disaster. \u201cOn temperature, red wine has the least chance of disappointment.\u201d</p> <p>Parkinson is a traditionalist on glassware. She loathes plastic cups, \u201cpaper is dodgy\u201d and carefully wraps stemless tumblers for picnics. \u201cTo me, glass makes a complete difference to how wine tastes.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Thermos cocktails</strong></h2> <p>Flasks keep liquids hot (Nina Matsunaga, chef at Sedbergh\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theblackbullsedbergh.co.uk/\">Black Bull</a>, mentions the \u201ctop picnic cheat\u201d of taking instant ramen noodles and a Thermos of hot water), but their ability to keep exciting things cold, such as cocktails, is less celebrated.</p> <p>You could batch, chill and transport negronis, says Sheffield cocktail ace Jack Wakelin, currently busy setting up a new bar-diner, Bench. \u201cUse equal parts gin, Campari and sweet vermouth to two parts water.\u201d Or try a \u201csimple, bittersweet, light\u201d americano. Take 125ml of Campari, 125ml of sweet vermouth and five halved peaches, microwave together for one minute and cool. Strain and add 750ml of chilled soda water. Refrigerate the americano for an hour before pouring it into a flask.</p> <h2>Disposable BBQ tips</h2> <p>Please grill responsibly (no scorched grass, no lit grills in park bins), and, if possible, invest in <a href=\"https://ecogrill-uk.com/\">EcoGrills</a> which, instead of plastic-wrapped, fuel-soaked charcoal in a throwaway aluminium pan, are made from 100% biodegradable alder wood and claim a 2\u00bd-hour cooking time (various stockists, from \u00a37.99). In contrast, says Jackson Bristow, chef and live-fire cookery expert at Cornwall\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nancarrowfarm.co.uk/\">Nancarrow Farm</a>, after the coals have turned white, cheaper disposables may offer just 20 minutes of \u201coptimum\u201d cooking time.</p> <p>Go for thinner and/or smaller cuts of meat, advises Bristow, minute steaks, butterflied chicken breasts or marinated meat skewers. Leave a third of the grill surface free, too, to maintain airflow. You could even steam fish on there. Seal the fillets in tinfoil tents with white wine, lemon, herbs and garlic, and, depending on the fillet\u2019s thickness, they should cook in 10 to 15 minutes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",

I really didn\u2019t want to see a recession ever again in Australia. And as a government, we worked so hard to bring the budget back into balance, to create one and a half million jobs. And there were many sacrifices that had to be achieved to get Australia\u2019s economy back on track and to see Covid-19 hit it like a torpedo is absolutely devastating.

They\u2019ve been hit by the same risks that we have. But Australia\u2019s resolve has been so much better and one of the reasons for that is that people were drawn together. As a government, we have brought people together. As a prime minister, I\u2019ve sought to bring people, the treasurer the same, all of my ministers in our federal cabinet, working with states, territories, industry, the various groups that are

date \u2013 and a definition \u2013 for eliminating Covid-19 from it\u2019s shores:</p> \n  <p>(via AAP)<br></p> \n  <p>New Zealand finally has a date for when it will achieve its lofty goal of elimination of Covid-19:<strong> June 15.</strong></p> \n  <p>After weeks of urging by public health experts and government wrangling, the country\u2019s Health Department has settled on a definition of elimination of the deadly virus.</p> \n  <p>New Zealand has followed an elimination policy path since the arrival of the virus, eschewing lighter approaches by countries including Australia.</p> \n  <p>The Kiwi approach, including a seven-week lockdown, is paying dividends.</p> \n  <p>On Thursday, health officials announced they had found no new cases of the virus for the 13th straight day, from thousands of tests.</p> \n  <p>Just one person in New Zealand has Covid-19, an Aucklander currently isolating who is due to be asymptomatic this week, should the virus follow a normal course.</p> \n  <p>Australia currently has 491 active cases.<br></p> \n  <p>However, the final Kiwi case is irrelevant to whether New Zealand has eliminated the disease.</p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Health now says elimination can be declared 28 days after the last case from a \u201clocally acquired unknown source\u201d, or community transmission, has completed their treatment and tested negative.</p> \n  <p>According to the ministry, New Zealand\u2019s last case of community transmission tested positive on 29 April, and was in isolation until 18 May.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs per the definition of elimination, the 28-day period would be counted from that person\u2019s exit from isolation,\u201d a department spokeswoman told AAP.</p> \n  <p>That means when director general of health <strong>Ashley Bloomfield </strong>holds his regular daily briefing on 15 June \u2013 28 days from 18 May\u2013 he will be able to say New Zealand has eliminated Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Of course, a subsequent discovery of another case of community transmission would restart the clock towards the elimination milestone.</p> \n  <p>The date has symbolic meaning but Bloomfield said it wouldn\u2019t stop the government\u2019s ongoing work to prevent new cases.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cElimination is an ongoing process,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt may well be there is no domestic onshore transmission or onshore infections of Covid-19. It would be great if we reached that point and it\u2019s increasingly looking like we are.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut our elimination strategy is ongoing because we clearly still have measures at the border and a desire to open up the border in a safe way.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf534f9bbe3cabf72871ef62ae131caae1e83ccd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf534f9bbe3cabf72871ef62ae131caae1e83ccd/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health and safety signage at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health and safety signage at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T02:13:40.762Z\">at 3.13am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed8509d8f082107f453a5ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T01:39:23.296Z\">2.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Services is also not thrilled with the homebuilder program:</p> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Service rejects the federal government\u2019s plan to provide large grants to home builders and renovators as a wasted opportunity to address the backlog of urgent social housing repairs and the shortfall in social housing stock. </p> \n  <p>Australian Council of Social Service CEO Dr <strong>Cassandra Goldie </strong>said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no argument that the construction sector needs a shot in the arm, but this money will not go where it is most needed.

The fall follows a rise of 8.5% in March 2020. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cCovid-19 continued to affect retail trade in April with many retail businesses closing their physical stores during April due to restrictions relating to social distancing,\u201d said <strong>Ben James</strong>, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThere were record falls in cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services (-35.4%), and clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing (-53.6%), as well as a large fall in department stores (-14.9%).\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Food retailing (-17.4%) led the falls in dollar terms this month following unprecedented demand in March. Spending in food retailing remains 5.1% above the level of April 2019, likely reflecting additional meals being consumed at home during April 2020. Other retailing (-14.4%) fell after a large rise in March, while household goods retailing (-0.1%) saw a minor fall in sales as falls from closures of some physical stores were offset by a rise in hardware, building and garden supply retailing. <br></p> \n  <p>In seasonally adjusted terms, there were falls in Victoria (-21.1%), New South Wales (-17.5%), Queensland (-15.7%), Western Australia (-16.8%), South Australia (-14.6%, Tasmania (-17.5%), the Australian Capital Territory (-14.9%), and the Northern Territory (-7.7%) in April 2020. <br></p> \n  <p>The closure of physical stores in some industries led to a rise in online retail turnover, which contributed 11.1% to total retail turnover in original terms in April 2020, up from 7.1% in March 2020. In April 2019, online retail turnover contributed 5.7% to total retail.

  "<p>My 100-zip black backpack, previously the logistical and geek centre of my life, now sits neglected in a corner, not needed since Covid-19 abruptly halted my near-constant travel schedule.</p> <p>Life went on \u2013 with limited disruption, if not quite as normal. After all, I have enough space, equipment and internet connectivity to work comfortably from home. In some ways, life has become more efficient. Less jet lag. More sanity.</p> <p>I\u2019m hardly alone in experiencing this. Those of us fortunate to have jobs we can do from home have tidied up our video conference backdrops and changed how we operate. Where they can, many children have adapted, more or less, to virtual classrooms and the need to compete for workspace with their parents.</p> <p>We keep in touch with loved ones via computer screens in ways we couldn\u2019t have imagined only three months ago, while the crisis has spawned myriad coping mechanisms \u2013 from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/shakespeare-pub-quizzes-and-rainbows-the-upside-of-lockdown\">boom in online quizzes</a>, art classes and workouts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/18/coronaviral-the-best-memes-tweets-and-cartoons-to-get-you-through-open-thread\">a golden age for memes</a>.</p> <p>And while many of us are cooped up indoors, we have seen examples of great collective endeavour and support: communities coming together to help each other and the most vulnerable, albeit keeping two metres apart.</p> <p>In all of these things, the web has been the critical unifying force, enabling work, school, social activity and mutual support. Always intended as a platform for creativity and collaboration at a distance, it is great to see it also being used more than ever for compassion at a distance too. This is all very well, of course, if we have the web at our fingertips. But we are the lucky ones. Billions of people don\u2019t have the option to turn to the web in times of need or normality. A gross digital divide holds back <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/FactsFigures2019.pdf\">almost half the planet</a> when it most needs the web.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In Africa, only one in four people can access the web and the benefits that so many of us take for granted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This divide is most acutely experienced in developing countries. The position is particularly dire across Africa, where <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/FactsFigures2019.pdf\">only one in four</a> people can access the web and the benefits that so many of us take for granted. Women, in particular, in the developing world, are excluded, with <a href=\"https://webfoundation.org/2020/03/the-gender-gap-in-internet-access-using-a-women-centred-method/\">men 21% more likely</a> to have online access \u2013 rising to 52% in the world\u2019s least developed countries.</p> <p>The challenge extends to the wealthiest nations, too: 60,000 children in the UK <a href=\"https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cco-tackling-the-disadvantage-gap-during-the-covid-19-crisis.pdf\">have no internet at home</a> and device poverty <a href=\"https://www.suttontrust.com/news-opinion/all-news-opinion/school-closures/\">stops many more from learning online</a> while schools remain closed.</p> <p>In the US, an <a href=\"https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/ff7b3d0b-bc00-4498-9f9d-3e56ef95088f/the-digital-divide-.pdf\">estimated 12 million children</a> live in homes without broadband connectivity, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/technology/parking-lots-wifi-coronavirus.html\">people are parking cars</a> outside schools and cafes, desperate for a connection good enough to learn and work \u201cfrom home\u201d. These inequalities fall along the familiar lines of wealth, race and rural v urban divides.</p> <p>Working from home isn\u2019t an option for many \u2014 including some who have jobs that could be done remotely. Businesses in areas without the infrastructure to trade online are denied a lifeline that is keeping others around the world afloat.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Alliance for Affordable Internet, an initiative of the World Wide Web Foundation, which was the foundation that I co-founded with Rosemary Leith, has <a href=\"http://webfoundation.org/docs/2020/04/Covid-Policy-Brief-Access_Public.pdf\">outlined urgent actions</a> that governments and companies should take to provide this lifeline to more people as quickly as possible.</p> <p>We\u2019re in a world where it is so much harder to get by without the web. And yet the digital divide won\u2019t disappear once this crisis is over. The ever-quickening march to digitisation has become a sprint. We must make sure those currently in the slow lane have the means to catch up. Otherwise billions will be left behind in the dust. As Covid-19 forces huge change to our lives, we have an opportunity for big, bold action that recognises that, as with electricity in the last century and postal services before that, the web is an essential utility that governments and business should combine to deliver as a basic right.</p> <p>History shows us that after all great global upheavals there are major attempts to repair the damage and rebuild, with some more successfully delivered than others. In the midst of this turmoil we must surely strive to ensure some good emerges out of the darkness.</p> <p>The web can and must be for everyone \u2014 now is our moment to make this happen. We have the technical means to connect the entire world in <a href=\"https://a4ai.org/meaningful-connectivity-a-new-standard-to-measure-internet-access/\">meaningful</a> and <a href=\"https://a4ai.org/affordable-internet-is-1-for-2\">affordable ways</a>: we now need the will and the investment.</p> <p>Governments must lead the way. They must invest in network infrastructure, not only in urban centres, but in rural settings where market forces alone fail to connect residents. And because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/07/broadband-new-warnings-to-end-rip-off-price-rises\">data affordability</a> remains one of the biggest barriers to access, these networks must be efficient. For example, policies that encourage service providers to share network infrastructure, and regulations designed to shape competitive markets for data, can go a long way towards bringing down costs for users.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/18/exclusive-dramatic-slowdown-in-global-growth-of-the-internet\">And, to connect everyone</a>, governments will need to target typically excluded groups \u2013 including people on low incomes, women, and those in rural areas. This means funding public access and digital literacy initiatives to ensure everyone has the skills to use the internet in meaningful ways.</p> <p>Service providers must invest in network performance, reliability and coverage so that everyone is within reach of high-quality connectivity. We have seen experiments with drones, balloons and satellites to connect hard-to-reach areas. While these don\u2019t replace good policy and investment in proven technologies, innovation such as this is a welcome addition to the mix.</p> <p>There is nothing to stop governments and companies making a choice now, to accelerate progress on connectivity where good changes are happening and to step up where they aren\u2019t.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Demand action from your government to make universal internet connectivity a priority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Finally, we can all play a role as individuals.

If the government\u2019s claims to global leadership on climate are to have any meaning at all, it must stop turning blind eye to the links between UK banks and deforestation, by introducing strong regulation, harsh penalties and strict provisions on full public transparency of environmental and social impacts of all investment portfolios,\u201d said Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da8f52a1092c2ceadc5559626f76d7d203d7459b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da8f52a1092c2ceadc5559626f76d7d203d7459b/0_213_3293_1975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Extinction Rebellion UK gather in front of the investment firm BlackRock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extinction Rebellion UK gather in front of the investment firm BlackRock to challenge it over its climate crisis responsibilities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In response to the findings, a spokesperson for Aberdeen Standard Investments said: \u201cThere are definitely shortcomings in supply chain monitoring for the entire beef industry in Brazil, but these practices are improving across the industry and investor activism plays an important role in this development ...

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Known deaths pass 385,000</strong></h2> <p>According to Johns Hopkins University there have been 6,430,705 coronavirus cases confirmed worldwide and 385,947 deaths reported.&nbsp;The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording regimes, as well as suspected under-reporting.</p> <h2><strong>WHO reports 100,000 new cases a day for five days</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization<strong>&nbsp;</strong>has received reports of 100,000 new cases of coronavirus every day for the past five days, as the outbreak gathers pace in various regions around the world, its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said. Opening the WHO\u2019s regular coronavirus briefing, he added: \u201cFor several weeks the number of cases reported each day in the Americas has been more than the rest of the world put together. We are especially worried about Central and South America, where many countries are witnessing accelerating epidemics. We also see increasing numbers of cases in the eastern Mediterranean, south-east Asia and Africa, although the numbers are much smaller.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Brazil looks to reopen despite record coronavirus deaths</strong></h2> <p>Brazil registered a record number of daily deaths from the novel coronavirus for a second consecutive day, according to health ministry data released on Wednesday, even as city and state authorities moved aggressively to open commerce back up. There were 1,349 new coronavirus deaths and 28,633 additional confirmed cases, the data showed, meaning Brazil had registered 32,548 deaths and 584,016 total confirmed cases. Its rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus, saying on Tuesday that death was \u201ceveryone\u2019s destiny\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Mexico sees deaths twice as high as previous record</strong></h2> <p>Mexican health authorities reported 1,092 coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, the highest toll in one day so far, with total infections surging past 100,000. The number of deaths was more than twice a previous record and daily infections were also at an all-time high of 3,912. The additions bring the total number of known cases to 101,238 and deaths to 11,729. Health authorities have previously said the real number is higher.</p> <h2><strong>George Floyd had coronavirus, according to autopsy</strong></h2> <p>The Minneapolis man who died with a policeman\u2019s knee on his neck tested positive for coronavirus, according to a full autopsy report released by the Hennepin county medical examiner\u2019s office. The report noted that the virus was not a contributing factor in his death and that Floyd had no symptoms. <a href=\"https://kstp.com/news/george-floyd-autopsy-report-shows-george-floyd-died-from-cardiopulmonary-arrest-was-positive-for-covid-19/5750262/#.XthNVR5NIek.twitter\">KSTP news reported</a>: \u201cA postmortem nasal swab was taken, which confirmed that Floyd was positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. It is noted that Floyd was known to be positive for Covid-19 on April 3. The postmortem positivity likely reflects asymptomatic but persistent PCR positivity from previous infection.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>California: rise in cases raises fears over reopening and protests</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/california-covid-19-cases-rise-reopen-protest\">number of coronavirus cases in California is on the rise</a> after weeks of optimism that infections had slowed, raising fears that plans to reopen counties, along with mass protests against police brutality, could accelerate transmission. According to numbers from Johns Hopkins University, California is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states\">one of 20 states</a>&nbsp;that have seen an increase in cases in the past five days.</p> <h2><strong>Coronavirus crisis could cause $25tn fossil fuel industry collapse</strong></h2> <p>The coronavirus outbreak could trigger a $25tn (\u00a320tn) collapse in the fossil fuel industry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/04/coronavirus-crisis-collapse-fossil-fuels-demand\">by accelerating a terminal decline</a> for the world\u2019s most polluting companies. A study has found that the value of the world\u2019s fossil fuel reserves could fall by two-thirds, sooner than the industry expects, because&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">the Covid-19 crisis</a> has hastened the peak for oil, gas and coal demand. The looming fossil fuel collapse could pose \u201ca significant threat to global financial stability\u201d by wiping out the market value of fossil fuel companies, according to the financial thinktank Carbon Tracker.</p>",
  "<p>Hurtling down the motorway on a Triumph T120 with a backpack full of knickers, Jen Lewandowski thought: <em>this is terrific.</em> Lewandowski, 41, had met Tom Gidley, 51, just four times before she moved into his Ramsgate home at the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown in March.&nbsp;</p> <p>They originally met through work. Lewandowski had contacted Gidley, who is an artist, to ask if she could sell some of his paintings at an exhibition she was staging. When she collected the paintings from his studio in January, there was an instant connection. \u201cShe had an energy and real light about her,\u201d says Gidley. After the show opened in March, they went for a drink, and then a cup of tea at Lewandowski\u2019s kitchen table. Finally, Lewandowski, who lives in London, visited him for the weekend.&nbsp;<br><br>Then the lockdown measures were announced. \u201cI said: \u2018Look, why don\u2019t you just come down here?\u2019\u201d says Gidley. \u201cEverything\u2019s getting a bit strange.\u201d She agreed, and Gidley collected her on his motorcycle. Since that high-speed jaunt, their relationship has barely slackened in pace. They have spent the entire lockdown together, said \u201cI love you\u201d to each other within days and are in general horribly in love. \u201cIsn\u2019t it <em>wild</em>?\u201d giggles Lewandowski. \u201cIt is quite whirlwind, but it feels right, and we\u2019re going with it.\u201d</p> <p>Gidley and Lewandowski are just one example of the British couples turbocharging their relationships by moving in together during the coronavirus lockdown despite scarcely knowing each other. On 24 March, a day after the lockdown was introduced in England, the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, suggested that couples living apart may want to consider moving in together. \u201cThey should test the strength of their relationship,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/budding-couples-in-uk-told-to-live-together-or-stay-apart\">said Harries</a> at a government press conference, \u201cand decide whether one wishes to be permanently resident in another household.\u201d</p> <p>Harries\u2019 comments sent couples across the country scrambling into crisis talks, as they tried to decide whether moving in together during a global pandemic was a good idea, a bit premature or potential disaster. During this time, many came to the conclusion that it was worth a shot \u2013 the partner could just move out again if everything went down the toilet. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have an exit strategy,\u201d confesses Jack McGarey, a 31-year-old teacher. \u201cI suppose, at the back of my head, I thought: \u2018If it doesn\u2019t work out, she can just go home.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c8d27746ab6043409406a1c950ba79692d0d9beb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8d27746ab6043409406a1c950ba79692d0d9beb/0_246_6517_3911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jen Lewandowski with Tom Gidley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jen Lewandowski with Tom Gidley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McGarey is a bold man: he asked Francesca Elizabeth Williams, a 33-year-old marketer, to move in with him after just one date. After matching on Bumble, the couple had gone for a physically distanced walk in Crowthorne, where they both live, on 21 March, just before the lockdown restrictions came in. After the walk, at a loss for what to suggest \u2013 most restaurants and bars had by then closed \u2013 Williams invited McGarey over for dinner. He arranged the furniture so it would be two metres apart. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to break the rules,\u201d McGarey says. \u201cWe had good intentions.\u201d He groans. \u201cObviously, the night started with social distancing,\u201d Williams says, \u201cbut as the night wore on and we had a few glasses of wine, we didn\u2019t keep our distance.\u201d</p> <p>Two days later, the lockdown began. \u201cI said: \u2018Grab your gym kit and your laptop, and come over.\u201d Williams never left. When we speak, the couple are still syrupy sweet on each other. Every day, they stick to a strict schedule of thrice-daily exercise (a morning 5k run, a yoga class and evening high-intensity interval training workout), meditate, listen to a podcast together, cook and have a \u201cdeep chat\u201d about their families or childhoods. \u201cWe do an audit later in the day,\u201d says McGarey, \u201cto make sure that we\u2019ve ticked everything off.\u201d It may sound hellish to some, but it\u2019s working for them \u2013 although they haven\u2019t said, \u201cI love you,\u201d yet, it\u2019s clearly on the cards. \u201cA few times, I almost said it,\u201d admits Williams shyly, \u201cbut then I thought it was too soon.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it is easy to rush headlong into a whirlwind romance when you are young. Time takes the edge off romantic ardour: we become cynical, crablike, cautious. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot over the years,\u201d muses Jonathan Lovett, a 53-year-old design director from London. \u201cYou have to look for someone who is emotionally available. So many people think they want relationships, but they don\u2019t really.\u201d He met his boyfriend, Kit Yunes, 45, an Argentinian-born, London-based retail worker, on a dating app in February.&nbsp;When the lockdown restrictions came in, Lovett and Yunes were in a music shop, waiting to buy a drum kit. \u201cI turned to Kit,\u201d Lovett says, \u201cand said: \u2018Where are we going to put these drums, then?\u2019\u201d The men got an Uber to Lovett\u2019s house, drum kit in boot, and Yunes never left.&nbsp;</p> <p>Experience has made both men certain that their relationship is durable, and not mere infatuation. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a sort of puppy love,\u201d Lovett insists. But the speed at which they have moved has raised eyebrows among some of their friends, particularly when Yunes gave up his rented property and officially moved in. \u201cSome people have said: \u2018What if this doesn\u2019t work? You don\u2019t want to end up homeless in a pandemic,\u2019\u201d Yunes says. He is unconcerned. \u201cI am happy to take this risk. Everything feels natural, not rushed. I\u2019ve never felt so close to another partner in my life this quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Still, living with someone and picking up their socks when you have milk in your fridge that\u2019s probably older than your relationship \u2013 there\u2019s no way for that not to be weird.&nbsp;\u201cYou catch yourself laughing at how surreal it is,\u201d Lewandowski jokes. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Adjusting to the rhythms of another person\u2019s life, their schedule, their caprices, takes time. \u201cYou definitely have to negotiate around each other,\u201d Gidley says. \u201cThe proximity is wonderful, but it takes work to get the balance right.\u201d He has noticed they tend to have a tiny bust-up when they\u2019re tired, on Friday evenings \u2013 which they always resolve immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s like a pressure valve,\u201d Gidley says. \u201cIt feels healthy.\u201d</p> <p>Is there any way to tell how a relationship formed under the weight of a global pandemic can go? \u201cAll things are possible,\u201d says the Relate counsellor Gurpreet Singh. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a single rule that applies.\u201d Moving in prematurely will exacerbate underlying stressors. \u201cCouples who move in together too soon haven\u2019t worked out a strategy for resolving arguments amicably,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you end up in a lockdown situation too soon, you may drive each other up the wall a little bit, and that might put you off the relationship.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Taking a punt on love doesn\u2019t always go to plan. Emily, a 26-year-old student from Birmingham, met Neil (not their real names) on Bumble in late March: they went on a date just before the lockdown was announced. \u201cI went over to his, and we had a nice time,\u201d says Emily, \u201cso I ended up staying over. He seemed quite keen for me to stay again the next night, so I did, and then I ended up staying for the weekend.\u201d When Neil asked her to stay with him during the coronavirus lockdown, Emily agreed. \u201cI thought it would be a way of helping each other through a mutually difficult time,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe, in retrospect, I wasn\u2019t using my best judgment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9249299ddefd7f9432ce83a958fc4674971ad74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9249299ddefd7f9432ce83a958fc4674971ad74/190_259_5525_3314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Lovett and Kit Yunes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Lovett and Kit Yunes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two cohabited together amicably, at first mostly because Emily swallowed her feelings. When Neil was on video calls with his family and friends, he didn\u2019t mention she was there. \u201cHe was cagey,\u201d Emily says. \u201cI felt like he was trying to conceal me and our relationship, whatever it was.\u201d The anxiety gnawed away at her. \u201cI finally cracked,\u201d she says. \u201cI said that I was uncomfortable and anxious about where I stood. He said he wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship yet.\u201d That must have been tough, I say, after living together for two months as a quasi-couple. \u201cThe fact that it was so intense \u2013&nbsp;I suppose I expected a little bit more,\u201d Emily says flatly. \u201cI wish he had been a bit more honest about his expectations because then I wouldn\u2019t have opened up so much and allowed myself to fall for him.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Emily isn\u2019t bitter about her decision to move in with Neil, even though it ended badly. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it,\u201d she says. \u201cLast year, I was serially dating, mostly through apps, and not getting much out of it.&nbsp;This seemed like a nice chance to give a relationship a go, without overthinking it all the time.\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has given prospective partners the opportunity to connect outside a brutal and sometimes dehumanising dating scene. \u201cWith online dating,\u201d says Gidley, \u201cit can feel horribly like a marketplace. It encourages you to think there\u2019s always another option out there, so you never commit to anyone, even if you really like each other.\u201d</p> <p>In our hyperscheduled modern lives, having the time and space to get to know someone away from work, family and friends means that lovers can develop an intimacy that would take months, even years, to gestate under ordinary circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s given us a bubble of time to build our closeness,\u201d says Lewandowski. \u201cI think that intimacy would be hard to achieve when normal life is happening.\u201d In lockdown, time speeds up, slips forward, accelerates. A meal at your kitchen table together is the equivalent of three real-world dinner dates. A Zoom quiz with friends feels like hitting the three-month mark.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cYou feel like you have time to waste, almost,\u201d says Lovett. \u201cNothing has to just be a conversation over dinner. You can have conversations for hours or even days. That\u2019s the beauty of it. It\u2019s been so intense.\u201d Lovett travels abroad frequently for work and doubts he would have had the time to grow so close to Yunes were it not for the lockdown. \u201cI\u2019d have had to make space for him in my daily routine, seeing my friends, going to work, the gym,\u201d agrees Yunes. \u201cIt would have taken a lot longer.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>This is dating on steroids: a time-lapse fast-forward stumble through all the major relationship milestones. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve been together for six months,\u201d says McGarey, \u201cnot six weeks.\u201d They plan to move to Texas together later this year, so that McGarey can take up a teaching job. \u201cI want to be where Jack is,\u201d Williams says. They have met each other\u2019s families \u2013 on Zoom, of course.</p> <p>Lewandowski compares the heady excitement of her lockdown romance to the shotgun weddings of the second world war. \u201cThere\u2019s something old-fashioned about it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t met any of each other\u2019s friends or families. It reminds me of those old movies where the soldier coming back from the war hops off a train with his new bride.\u201d</p> <p>But a better comparison may be prison. \u201cThose who have relationships in prison have better mental health than those who don\u2019t have a partner or have a partner outside prison,\u201d says Dr Rodrigo Gonz\u00e1lez of the University of Salamanca. He has conducted research into relationships in Spanish prisons. \u201cIt\u2019s partly about companionship,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez says. \u201cBut it\u2019s mostly about sex. Having sex relates to better mental health and higher satisfaction levels in the public as well as prison inmates.\u201d He\u2019s probably on to something: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/dutch-official-advice-to-single-people-find-a-sex-buddy-for-lockdown-coronavirus\">always practical Dutch authorities</a> even recommended that single people find a designated \u201csex buddy\u201d during lockdown.</p> <p>Is the intimacy these couples feel real? Or are they punch-drunk on the surreal enforced intimacy of a global pandemic? \u201cIt\u2019s as real as it can be,\u201d says Singh. \u201cIf they\u2019ve coped well together during these times, it would give me the sense there is strength in the relationship.\u201d But Singh points out that none of the couples will have met each other\u2019s family or friends in real life or had to balance commuting, living apart or work commitments. \u201cGood, healthy relationships are formed over time, when people have lived in each other\u2019s lives during periods of vulnerability,\u201d Singh says. \u201cYou can\u2019t build that in a few days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReality is the true test of any relationship,\u201d Lovett admits. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in this bubble, but I know it\u2019s coming very quickly \u2013 <em>the real world</em>.\u201d But he\u2019s confident they will go the distance. \u201cPeople may be cynical,\u201d Lovett says. \u201cBut sometimes you\u2019ve just got to take that leap of faith.\u201d</p> <p>Lewandowski and Gidley certainly are. On a beautiful Saturday afternoon in the Kent Downs a few weeks ago, Gidley asked Lewandowski to marry him. \u201cI said yes,\u201d Lewandowski says, \u201cand we had a lovely kiss. Just as we did, the wind picked up! It went: <em>whoosh</em>. It was very romantic.\u201d Lewandowski lets out a peal of laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job we\u2019re in lockdown because if people could see us, they would puke,\u201d she cries. \u201cLet\u2019s just see if it lasts!\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>When we first spoke, in mid-April, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Due\u00f1as began weeping within seconds. Her parents\u2019 home town, Santo Domingo de La Calzada, had the worst death rate from coronavirus in Spain, she told me on the phone. \u201cI\u2019m so scared,\u201d she said. Due\u00f1as told stories of police clambering through windows to rescue the dying, who were too weak to open their doors. Regional politicians, meanwhile, refused to give town-by-town figures for the dead, stoking anxiety and encouraging conspiracy theories. Santo Domingo\u2019s locked-down residents, she claimed, were being deliberately kept in the dark as the virus silently stalked the town.</p> <p>Due\u00f1as does not live in Santo Domingo, a town of 6,300 people set among patchwork fields of cereal crops in the northern Spanish region of La Rioja. She was born there, but now lives 28 miles away in Logro\u00f1o, the capital of this wealthy region, best known for the rich red wines that bear its name. Her angry, sometimes wildly conspiratorial outbursts on local Facebook groups \u2013 some of which have been deleted against her will \u2013 mean not all her old neighbours will welcome her back.</p> <p>If Covid-19 increases tensions among neighbours in big cities, it can produce poisonous outbreaks of mistrust in small, more insular places like Santo Domingo. By the time Due\u00f1as and I spoke again, two weeks later, the abbot from the town\u2019s small cathedral had lodged a complaint against her for defamation. (She had claimed the church was covering up the role it had played in spreading the virus.) Even members of her own family were livid at the way she had aired Santo Domingo\u2019s sorry status as one of Spain\u2019s worst Covid-19 disaster zones.</p> <p>Due\u00f1as suggested I call Jorge S\u00e1nchez, a former town councillor and a well-known local figure, to get a sense of the scale of the disaster. On 9 March, he had met with a couple of friends, Enrique Ortega and Aldo Muga, at Muga\u2019s bar. They had chatted about Ortega\u2019s upcoming 51st birthday. \u201cNow I am the only one left alive,\u201d S\u00e1nchez told me. All three caught the disease, and the other two men both died at a hospital in Logro\u00f1o on 21 March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/spain-zip/giv-3902teJKzF4TU1mt/\" data-alt=\"map of Spain and La Rioja region\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/spain-zip/giv-3902teJKzF4TU1mt/\">map of Spain and La Rioja region</a> </figure>  <p>As news spread through town that I was trying to count the dead, I received a call from town councillor Diego Mendiola. He confirmed that regional officials were refusing to give precise figures for Covid-19 deaths in Santo Domingo. All that residents could do was try to keep a tally. While we spoke, Mendiola stopped to read an incoming WhatsApp message. \u201cThat\u2019s another one,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In recent months, television pictures have shown us the empty streets of the world\u2019s great metropolises \u2013 of Madrid, London, New York, Milan. All have suffered badly. But outside the confined spaces of care homes and cruise ships, Covid-19 has been at its most lethal in a handful of southern European country towns. In Santo Domingo, without sufficient data from the regional government, it has fallen to residents to make their own estimates. Based on the number of messages he has received from parishioners asking for deceased loved ones to be mentioned in mass, the abbot, Francisco Su\u00e1rez, now believes 42 people died in the six weeks after 16 March. It is impossible to know exactly how many were killed by Covid-19, as opposed to other causes, but a reasonable, possibly conservative, estimate \u2013 based on multiple sources including newspaper death columns, funeral home websites and interviews with the head of the region\u2019s local health districts \u2013 would be 35.</p> <p>That may not sound like much in the context of a pandemic, but to get a sense of how shocking this figure is, it\u2019s worth comparing it to the death rate in the world\u2019s worst-affected major cities. London had 86 deaths per <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19bylocalareasanddeprivation/deathsoccurringbetween1marchand17april\" title=\"\">100,000 by mid-April</a> (and is now likely past 100), the Madrid region was at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1110955/deaths-from-covid-19-disease-per-100-000-people-by-region-spain/\" title=\"\">131 in mid-May</a>, and New York City <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109867/coronavirus-death-rates-by-age-new-york-city/\" title=\"\">is currently 201</a>. The equivalent figure for Santo Domingo would be 550. Only the northern Italian province of Bergamo has experienced something similar. Towns such as San Pellegrino Terme and San Giovanni Bianco have the highest death rates of all, at around or above 1,000 per 100,000 from all causes during the worst weeks. \u201cThe pain becomes communal, precisely because, in these small places, everyone knows everyone,\u201d Vittorio Milesi, the mayor of San Pellegrino Terme, told me.</p> <p>It is easy for city folk to dream of escaping to the countryside, as they seek safe hideaways from close physical contact or the claustrophobia of a locked-down city apartment. Viewed through this lens, rural towns seem like the bucolic, Zoom-connected work centres of the future. I understand how tempting it is to slip into such reveries. During Spain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, I have been living near Candeleda, a town in the province of \u00c1vila, 100 miles west of Madrid and similar in size to Santo Domingo. I have enjoyed mountain views, flowering meadows and pure, fresh air. But I am also now familiar with the eerie experience of isolation within a normally tight-knit community. City friends are envious. In some ways they are right to be, but in others they are decidedly wrong. Nobody is safe from a global pandemic. Santo Domingo is proof of that.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Few countries have suffered as badly as Spain from Covid-19. In per-capita terms, it is believed to have the world\u2019s highest rate of deaths, according to a study of excess deaths from all causes <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4c784e-c259-4ca4-9a82-648ffde71bf0?shareType=nongift\">by the Financial Times</a> \u2013 though Britain may soon overtake it. Some critics of Spain\u2019s leftwing coalition government have blamed the severity of the outbreak, in part, on the failure to cancel celebrations for International Women\u2019s Day on Sunday 8 March. Across Spain, at the end of a week that had seen the first coronavirus deaths reported in Madrid, the Basque country and Valencia, several million people took to the streets. Populists such as the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/23/wolf-pack-case-spain-feminism-far-right-vox\" title=\"\"> far-right party Vox</a> have accused prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez of putting feminist politics above public health, but Vox also held a mass meeting at a Madrid bullring that day. The truth is that few politicians took the threat of Covid-19 sufficiently seriously at first, and while some scientists were warning of impending danger, most people in Spain did not realise that the dramatic explosion of cases that began a few weeks before in Italy was just about to happen here as well.</p> <p>In Santo Domingo, there were already clues about what was to come. On 8 March, two elderly inhabitants, Mar\u00eda Isabel Aizpur\u00faa and Valent\u00edn P\u00e9rez, passed away \u2013 part of an unusual five-day spike in deaths. In that short period, six people died, seven times higher than could usually be expected in that time period. It\u2019s possible that Covid-19 had claimed lives in the town even before then. Two deaths recorded earlier in the month now look suspicious, though it\u2019s impossible to know the cause for certain. \u201cThe dead weren\u2019t being tested,\u201d said a doctor who dealt with some of them, but asked not to be named. \u201cSo who knows?\u201d</p> <p>When Jorge S\u00e1nchez, the former town councillor, tested positive for Covid-19 on 10 March, he posted a video online telling everyone. It was, he said, a way of trying to wake the town up to what was happening, and of combating the stigma associated with the disease. \u201cPeople were treating it as something shameful,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"211a2d49c85698a5a16adc1ce28e5833952977af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/211a2d49c85698a5a16adc1ce28e5833952977af/0_430_4625_3179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plaza del Santo and the Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plaza del Santo and the Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Heusinkveld/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Santo Domingo lies on the famous pilgrim trail, the Camino de Santiago, which brings tens of thousands of international visitors through its cobbled streets and pebbled squares each year. Close to the centre of town, a stone\u2019s throw from the cathedral, is the town\u2019s only care home, the Hospital del Santo. On 11 March, doctors, nurses and family members \u2013 equipped with masks but little else to protect them \u2013 bustled around one of the home\u2019s ailing residents, 85-year-old Rosa Andr\u00e9s Rodrigo, in the hours before she died. She showed what we now see as classic Covid symptoms \u2013 a fever and shortness of breath \u2013 but which could also come from a winter flu. She died so quickly that there wasn\u2019t time to find out. \u201cAt that stage, we still didn\u2019t know,\u201d the care home manager, Sagrario Loza, told me, \u201cI myself was in there with just a mask on.\u201d</p> <p>Within a week, many of those who had tended to Rosa had contracted the coronavirus, including the care home\u2019s main doctor. \u201cShe was so weak she couldn\u2019t get out of bed,\u201d Cristina D\u00edaz, a pharmacist from a nearby village, who took meals to the doctor\u2019s house, told me. Like many care home workers, the doctor was on a short-term contract and low pay. (Take-home pay for Spanish care home doctors is around \u20ac1,600 per month, and just \u20ac1,400 for nurses.) When the doctor finally got better, her contract had already ended, so she took a job elsewhere. Soon almost half of the care home staff were ill as well.</p> <p>On 14 March, when S\u00e1nchez imposed a nationwide lockdown, he held up the country\u2019s elderly as a reason for acting, reminding Spaniards that it was the pension money of parents and grandparents that had prevented many families falling into destitution during the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cIn this crisis, they are the ones who need to be helped,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Santo Domingo, people were only slowly registering the speed at which the disease was spreading. On 17 March, a group of elderly Hospital del Santo residents sat around a table, dipping brushes into brightly coloured paints to make a rainbow poster with a reassuring message. \u201cWe are all fine,\u201d it read. They hung the poster from a balcony and sent a photograph to <a href=\"https://www.larioja.com/la-rioja/coronavirus/fundacion-hospital-santo-20200406152737-nt.html?ref=https:%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F\" title=\"\">La Rioja newspaper</a>.</p> <p>A week later, with care home deaths rising across Spain, a team from the military emergency unit \u2013 wearing white, hood-to-toe protection suits \u2013 were sent to inspect the Hospital del Santo. They helped to reorganise the centre into different zones, and returned daily to teach staff safety protocols, disinfect corridors and clean out the rooms of the dead. \u201cTheir work was tremendously important to us,\u201d Loza told me. Tests eventually showed 37 of the 65 residents \u2013 including five elderly nuns, living in their own wing \u2013 had Covid-19. Remarkably, most survived. Loza says there were five confirmed Covid-19 deaths, and suspects the disease was responsible for four more. \u201cWe can\u2019t say when it started,\u201d she said. Elsewhere in the country, military units <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52014023\" title=\"\">were discovering</a> care home residents \u201ccompletely abandoned, sometimes even dead in their beds\u201d, the defence minister Margarita Robles told reporters. In Madrid, almost one in seven care home residents has died \u2013 nearly 6,000 people, according to state broadcaster RTVE.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f077afc29c8817fb6cdaa1e5e2b4975ba30925a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f077afc29c8817fb6cdaa1e5e2b4975ba30925a/0_0_3648_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez (centre) and colleagues observing a minute\u2019s silence at the start of Spain\u2019s 10 days of national mourning, 27 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez (centre) and colleagues observing a minute\u2019s silence at the start of Spain\u2019s 10 days of national mourning, 27 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Calvo/LA MONCLOA/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spain\u2019s health services are run by its 17 regional governments, which have each handled the pandemic in their own way \u2013 some choosing to release detailed data, others withholding it. La Rioja is a semi-autonomous region, with a population of just 315,000 and one of the highest living standards in Spain. Between March and late May, it recorded 4,052 cases and 361 deaths, making it Spain\u2019s third-worst region in per-capita terms, but the regional government has refused to produce a town-by-town breakdown of deaths \u2013 a stance that has encouraged people such as Due\u00f1as to see a conspiracy of silence. At daily press briefings in Logro\u00f1o on 21 and 22 March, questions from La Rioja newspaper about Santo Domingo were batted away, even as evidence was mounting that the town was suffering a particularly severe outbreak of Covid-19. \u201cThe government\u2019s spokeswoman, Chus del R\u00edo, basically answered that there was no point in talking about individual local outbreaks because the whole of La Rioja was affected,\u201d the newspaper reported.</p> <p>On the town\u2019s main Facebook group, which began life as a place to post fond childhood memories of schoolteachers, shopkeepers, nuns and priests, there was outrage. Why weren\u2019t they being told? How many had really died? \u201cDo they think we are stupid? We live here, we can all see what is happening,\u201d complained one group member. A spokesman for La Rioja\u2019s regional government told me that the decision not to give details from specific towns was to prevent them being stigmatised. But withholding information also prevented more searching questions about exactly why Santo Domingo was suffering so badly \u2013 and whether more could be done to save its residents.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Lockdown has meant different things in different places. Spain\u2019s has been among the strictest, and was no less strictly observed in the countryside than in cities. Outdoor exercise was banned and children under the age of 13 were not allowed to leave home for 45 days. Some Spaniards embraced the restrictions with <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-lockdown-snitches-thrive-in-europe-reports-watchmen-spying-neighbors/\" title=\"\">inquisitorial fervour</a>. The media began using the phrase \u201cbalcony police\u201d to describe people who hurled insults at passersby who seemed to be breaking lockdown rules. In Madrid, even medical staff on their way to work were sometimes pelted with eggs. This was not just a city thing. In Santo Domingo, too, people complained about the zeal of these \u201cwindow cops\u201d. In some rural towns, including both Santo Domingo and Candeleda where I\u2019m living, the lockdown was enforced not only by residents and police, but also army patrol units.</p> <p>Rural lockdown has certain advantages. In Candeleda, in mid-March, I had a conversation \u2013 shouted from one field to another \u2013 with a neighbour who was counting his cattle. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be alright here,\u201d he roared. \u201cIf necessary, we can just kill a pig or barter our vegetables.\u201d Rural subsistence was suddenly an advantage, and people knew it. As weeks went by, I watched wild flowers paint the valley with streaks of red, yellow and purple. I saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/30/boar-wars-how-wild-hogs-are-trashing-european-cities\" title=\"\">wild boar</a> and otters scurry through fields occupied by sheep, cattle and horses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b7cfb23c0260864ba83e5794661073dd83fc267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b7cfb23c0260864ba83e5794661073dd83fc267/0_0_4340_2878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago, which runs through Santo Domingo de la Calzada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago, which runs through Santo Domingo de la Calzada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But this was no idyll. The internet kept me, and the rest of the town, hooked on the minute-by-minute narrative of death. There were still loved ones to fret about. The countryside was strangely still and hushed. There were no clanking tractors, petrol-powered bush-cutters, jangling goat bells, braying mules or cussing herdsmen. Most of the local farmers live in town, and could only leave to feed livestock. I even missed things that normally bothered me. Distant traffic and overhead flights \u2013 tiny pinpricks of moving light in the night sky \u2013 disappeared. I was too far away from town to share the evening applause for health workers that boosted morale and upheld the sense of community.</p> <p>Just like in cities, loneliness hit people hard. My closest neighbour, Santi, is a self-sufficient countryman in his mid-70s. He moved in near to me a decade ago, doing up his small barn. Santi is a man who needs to talk. Before lockdown, most days he would have coffee at the petrol station cafe and, later, take a walk up the river with friends. Now these were forbidden. \u201cIf you don\u2019t speak, you start forgetting how,\u201d he said after finding another reason to appear at my gate. Sometimes he sat on a nearby rock for an hour, waiting for some company.</p> <p>Santi has a fine sense of humour and I was grateful for his easy laugh, even as I fretted about how far a virus might travel on the wind. Whenever we spoke of someone dying, he shrugged. \u201cPeople have always died,\u201d he said. But his health isn\u2019t good and he was also scared. On his visits into town, the grocer and baker made him stay in his car while they put his food in the boot. There was no chatting. Isolation is isolation, wherever you are.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In Santo Domingo de La Calzada, the dead included Gregorio S\u00e1ez, a well-known figure in a town where the Catholic church plays a central role. The 83-year-old was prior of the lay Brotherhood of Saint Isidore the Farmer, which parades an image of their saint around town during its May fiestas. Santo Domingo\u2019s five brotherhoods, or cofrad\u00edas, are an essential part of local life. Some date back almost to the town\u2019s founding by the 11th century shepherd-hermit, Saint Dominic of the Causeway, after whom the town is named.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot understand Santo Domingo without its saint,\u201d Francisco Su\u00e1rez, the cathedral\u2019s abbot, told me. In his lifetime, the saint helped to build bridges, roads and shelter for pilgrims travelling to the tomb of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela, about 300 miles west. (Santo Domingo is patron saint of Spain\u2019s civil engineers.) Work on Santo Domingo\u2019s cathedral began in the 12th century, and the town has been a stopping point for pilgrims ever since. Today, much of the local economy revolves around the dozen hostels and hotels that offer hundreds of rooms to pilgrims.</p> <p>Such towns are not used to tragedy. In normal times, the most dramatic events that local reporter Javier Albo, a one-man newsroom, covers are minor car crashes. Skimming through La Rioja\u2019s local pages from March and April 2019, the most noteworthy stories concerned a modest swarm of bees and a few complaints about a \u201cplague\u201d of pigeons invading the town.</p> <p>During the strictest phase of lockdown, residents of Santo Domingo tried to keep up their spirits. The police began driving around town in the evening and stopping every few blocks to blast music from their loudhailers and exchange applause with people on balconies. This ritual was briefly suspended after complaints that it was unsuitable at a time of tragedy, but soon it started up again. People loved the shows, which filled the emptiness with noise and coloured lights. Eventually, it turned into a caravan of municipal police cars, ambulances, civil protection and street-cleaning vehicles, which set out at 8pm and drove around for two hours with sirens blaring and loud music mangled by tinny speakers. Like any party, the music depended on who took control of the sound system: some days it was corny Spanish pop or children\u2019s tunes, other days it was AC/DC.</p> <p>\u201cPeople started asking if we could do something for their kids\u2019 birthdays, so we did that too \u2013 playing Happy Birthday,\u201d Francisco Reina, one of the town\u2019s dozen municipal cops told me. \u201cThen a local baker offered to make them cakes, so we delivered those.

In a small town like this, packed with relatives, friends and acquaintances, hundreds may be expected at the velatorio \u2013 the 24-hour wake with the body on display \u2013 or the later funeral mass. A local group called I Like Santo Domingo lobbied for the cathedral bells, which are housed in their own baroque tower, to be rung in honour of the dead. On the evening of 22 March they chimed solemnly for two minutes as people stood silently at windows or on balconies \u2013 a tradition repeated every Monday over the following weeks. It was, at least, a communal mourning. \u201cThat was really important to the families,\u201d said the journalist Albo, who doubles as the group\u2019s president. \u201cAt least they felt that people were supporting them in their grief.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, the pandemic was measured in absences. It wasn\u2019t just that the streets were empty and the pilgrims gone, or that the dead were being carried off. Easter went by without its processions of religious statues. The Virgin Mary and the Risen Christ remained on their pedestals in the cathedral. The weeping notes of a trumpet saeta, an Easter tradition that once inspired a Miles Davis recording, had to be performed from the soloist\u2019s apartment balcony.</p> <p>On 10 May, the town began five days of fiestas to honour its saint. The following day, as those parts of Spain where infection rates had dropped were allowed to slowly ease restrictions, people were finally released from their houses. The only group event permitted in this still-limited first phase, however, was mass. The cathedral\u2019s wooden benches were replaced with plastic chairs, dotted at safe distances. After a trial run on 11 May, with just 17 people, seven masses were held the following day. Between each service, the cathedral was disinfected.</p> <p>The highlight of the fiestas is the spectacular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/may/14/the-20-photographs-of-the-week#img-13\" title=\"\">procession of the Doncellas</a>, when three dozen young women in long white dresses and veils carry baskets of bread covered with white linen on their heads. Like everything else, this was cancelled. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can do it later in the year,\u201d the abbot told me. Not since 1943, when the town suffered a typhus outbreak, had anything similar happened.</p> <p>But, with neighbouring towns suffering much less, some people had a burning question: where had the virus come from?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Given religion\u2019s central role in Santo Domingo de la Calzada, it is not surprising that some blamed the church. On 17 February, a group of 46 parishioners had set out by coach to visit Rome and Florence. They took a bottle of rioja wine for Pope Francis and, after meeting the Vatican official Cardinal Mauro Piacenza, came back with the promise of plenary indulgence for visitors to Saint Dominic\u2019s tomb over the next seven years. The measure, which remits the need to purge sins and thereby avoid tortures in purgatory, was a way of prolonging the 2019 celebrations for the saint\u2019s 1,000th birthday.</p> <p>Did the parishioners also bring back the virus? Italy, after all, is where Covid-19 began its rampage across Europe, and the group returned via northern Italy on 22 February, just as the first cases were being reported there. Many people in Santo Domingo, including one of the local doctors I spoke to, assume the virus came with them. Due\u00f1as has been the most vocal accuser. \u201cOf course they brought it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the church is too powerful to criticise.\u201d</p> <p>Abbot Su\u00e1rez, who led the trip, is incensed by the accusation that his group is responsible for bringing the disease to Santo Domingo. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete lie. The most stupid thing anybody could say,\u201d he told me. He noted that only one of the group \u2013 the prior of the Saint Isidore brotherhood, Gregorio Saez \u2013 had died of Covid-19, \u201cand the family think he caught it in hospital\u201d.</p> <p>Blame and stigma were part of La Rioja\u2019s experience of the pandemic from the very start. The region\u2019s first recorded cases, in the wine town of Haro, 12 miles north of Santo Domingo, appeared among members of its Roma community, who have been made into scapegoats many times in Spanish history. On 24 February, community members attended a funeral in the Basque city of Vitoria, which became one of Spain\u2019s first known contagion points.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"41a9c98a8de9c5e7463d633d923be6042012aaf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a9c98a8de9c5e7463d633d923be6042012aaf0/0_0_4225_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Empty streets in Haro, another small town near Santo Domingo, in early March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Empty streets in Haro, another small town near Santo Domingo, in early March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ander Gillenea/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The civil guard\u2019s toughest unit \u2013 the Logro\u00f1o-based rapid action group \u2013 was sent to Haro to hand out quarantine notices to those who had been there. Conservative media published false tales of virus-carrying Roma from Haro sneaking out of hospitals. Local websites and newspapers even published names and medical records of those allegedly infected. \u201cA lot of lies were told, and people were bombarded with threatening messages,\u201d Silvia Ag\u00fcero, a Roma activist and writer in La Rioja, told me.</p> <p>La Rioja\u2019s rationale for not sharing death figures for towns (or health districts) was precisely to avoid this kind of stigma. \u201cWe\u2019ve never talked about ethnicity, or given information about individuals with Covid,\u201d Alvaro Ruidez, a spokesman for La Rioja\u2019s health service, told me. But the examples of Haro and Santo Domingo show that, if anything, the lack of information provided fertile ground for malicious rumours. \u201cIn fact, knowing this would have made people take it still more seriously,\u201d one of the town\u2019s sharpest observers, who asked not to be named, told me. When I spoke to mayor Milesi of San Pellegrino Terme in Bergamo, he said transparency was crucial to the town\u2019s wellbeing and to its future recovery. Spain, meanwhile, still lacks official municipal data, not just for Santo Domingo but for other hard-hit rural provinces such as Cuenca, Segovia and Soria.</p> <p>Jorge S\u00e1nchez believes the virus entered town from several directions at once. Ricardo Velasco, head of La Rioja\u2019s local health districts, points to the Camino de Santiago itself, often described as the oldest tourist trail in Europe, as a possible source. Its popularity has increased tenfold over two decades, attracting 352,000 pilgrims last year. Half of them follow the so-called \u201cFrench route\u201d, which goes through Santo Domingo. Visitor numbers fall dramatically in February and March, \u201cbut even in these months there are thousands,\u201d Velasco told me. The visitors are from all over the world. \u201cThey come in groups, so suddenly you may have a lot of Italians, and another day it\u2019s a group of Koreans,\u201d says Rafael Crespo, a doctor who serves half a dozen small villages close to Santo Domingo.</p> <p>The camino brings in money and shapes local identity. During the 11 centuries that the route has existed, only wars and natural disasters have closed it. Shutting it down, in other words, means the world has changed utterly. As Covid-19 has spread, people everywhere have, at some stage, been slow to accept that. In early March, local doctors had lobbied for part of the route to be closed, but this didn\u2019t happen until the nationwide lockdown was imposed.</p> <p>Other towns on the pilgrimage route do not seem to have suffered as badly as Santo Domingo. The mayor of neighbouring Belorado, \u00c1lvaro Egu\u00edluz, told me he did not want to blame its own moderately large Covid-19 outbreak on either pilgrims or people from Santo Domingo. \u201cIf we start doing that,\u201d he said, \u201cit will never end.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u2018No government in the world or in any autonomous region can claim to have got everything right,\u201d prime minister S\u00e1nchez said at the end of April, admitting that he himself could have done better. It was a refreshingly honest comment. People such as Due\u00f1as are right to complain about the lack of transparency, but there is no sign of other major mistakes in Santo Domingo that are not widely shared elsewhere.</p> <p>In three months, we have learned a lot. It is notable that the rural black spots in Spain and Italy are places that combine the intimacy of small Mediterranean communities with proximity to the highways of global travel and business. (San Pellegrino Terme, for example, gives its name to a brand of fizzy water sold around the world, but also welcomes tourists to its thermal baths.) Normally, for those places, that is a happy mix. When a virus strikes, it can prove deadly. The connection between Covid-19 and travel is especially grave for Spain, a country where tourism generates 12% of GDP. Only the boldest pilgrims, for example, will pass through Santo Domingo this summer, which will be devastating to locals who depend on their custom.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/24/italy-home-schooling-coronavirus-lockdown-what-weve-learned\">Italian lessons: what we've learned from two months of home schooling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Spain, the lockdown is being eased slowly, in a careful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/lockdown-easing-have-other-leaders-fared-better-than-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">four-stage</a> process that will take up to two months to complete. When I spoke to abbot Su\u00e1rez, it was 11 May \u2013 the day that Santo Domingo entered the first stage of easing. I felt envious. Candeleda was still stuck in so-called \u201cphase zero\u201d.

Elsewhere in Santo Domingo, groups of 10 people were now allowed to socialise, while bars and restaurants could serve clients at widely spaced outside tables.
