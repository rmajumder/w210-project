That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</li> \n   <li><strong>International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years</strong>, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020.</li> \n   <li><strong>Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June</strong>, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. \u201cThe tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a televised address.</li> \n   <li><strong>France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system</strong>, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the \u201csalaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation\u201d of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures</strong>. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal. </li> \n   <li><strong>Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees</strong> who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan</strong>. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to \u201cstay focused on life-saving interventions\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for \u201cmass worldwide killing\u201d</strong>. Trump referred to an unidentified \u201cwacko in China\u201d, in the latest in a series of attacks aimed at the country that he appears to be trying to frame as the centrepiece of his reelection bid.</li> \n   <li><strong>Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries</strong> \u2013 including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years \u2013 after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis.

opponents, academics and health workers have demanded greater transparency over Covid-19 death tolls, writes <strong>Charis McGowan</strong> in Santiago.</p> \n  <p>With 53,617 confirmed cases of infection, Chile has the third highest number of coronavirus cases in South America. </p> \n  <p>With a case-fatality rate of around 1% (totalling 544), Chile\u2019s Health Ministry has pointed out that the country has achieved one of the lowest fatality rates among the OECD nations, well below the global average of 6.8%.</p> \n  <p>However, a document published last week from the Civil Register revealed 4,201 deaths in caused by \u201crespiratory disease\u201d between 3 March and 29 April. </p> \n  <p>Compared to data from the Department of Health Statistics and Information (DEIS), this would indicate a 57.2% increase in respiratory deaths from the year before, suggesting that this year\u2019s excess of 2,000+ respiratory-related deaths could be related to the novel coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The information, tweeted by investigative journalist and scholar Alejandra Matus, sparked a frenzy of comment on social media.</p> \n  <p>Within hours of the post going viral, the Health Ministry clarified that numbers confirmed by the Department of Health Statistics and Information totalled 1,949 respiratory-related deaths from March to May, an 8% increase to the year before.</p> \n  <p>\u201cEach institution maintains its responsibilities within the scope of its competence,\u201d said the Health Ministry in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cThe Health Ministry maintains the responsibility of establishing and defining the codification of the cause of death.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc468039c2c606fa95b8df29c0272f33814b4986\"> \n

Amnesty said the refugees\u2019 lives are at immediate risk, as the Bay of Bengal, where some boats were recently rescued, is facing its biggest storm for decades.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s thought that some of the boats are carrying refugees attempting to flee the desperate conditions in Cox\u2019s Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh, where 1 million Rohingya refugees have sheltered for years after fleeing persecution in Myanmar.</p> \n  <p>The location of the boats is not known, though last week it was reported that at least two vessels carrying Rohingya were believed to have been spotted off the coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey are in rickety boats, these are fishing trawlers that they use to take a very dangerous route in the hope of a better life. The Bangladesh government and others must do everything to save their lives,\u201d said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International\u2019s south Asia campaigner.</p> \n  <p>Louise Donovan, a spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency, added that it is not clear how exactly many people remain adrift but that the storm could be devastating for those stranded. \u201cThe sea is extremely rough at the moment, and if there are any boats that are trying to disembark we would ask governments in the region to assist them,\u201d she said.</p> \n  <p>Earlier this month, hundreds of Rohingya Muslims, including children, were rescued from another boat and escorted by Bangladesh to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited silt island that aid groups warn is isolated and prone to flooding and cyclones. The UN has offered to conduct a risk assessment of the island prior to any refugees being relocated, but this is yet to happen.</p> \n  <p>On Wednesday, authorities in Bangladesh said the 306 Rohingya who remain on the island have been taken to cyclone centres. Officials have previously said that rescued Rohingya were being taken to Bhasan Char as a quarantine measure, to prevent the risk of people bringing coronavirus into the refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar.</p> \n  <p>Just last week, the virus had been detected for the first time in the crowded camps, prompting agencies to warn of a looming humanitarian disaster.</p> \n  <p>In Cox\u2019s Bazar on Wednesday morning, a third red flag was raised as a warning sign that extreme weather is approaching and that all refugees must stay inside.</p> \n  <p>It is hoped that the eye of the cyclone will miss the camp, though agencies still fear flooding, tidal surges and strong winds that could tear apart the flimsy shelters in which families live.</p> \n  <p>There are no cyclone shelters available to refugees in the camps, instead, communities have been given \u201ctie-down kits\u201d, sets of pegs and ropes, to try to strengthen the structures that do exist.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re as prepared as we can be in a very difficult situation and also when dealing with Covid-19 at the same time it is very, very challenging,\u201d added Donovan.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:37:31.744Z\">at 4.37pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec54bf18f0864e579f14915\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:32:06.777Z\">4.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cThe <strong>United States</strong> continues to demonstrate global leadership in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d the US state department has insisted.</p> \n  <p>A lengthy press release published the USAID website, but in the name of the department of state, says that, despite Donald Trump\u2019s threats to permanently end US funding of the World Health Organization, the US government is still distributing billions to countries and NGOs for coronavirus relief efforts.

Months into fighting this pandemic at home and abroad, the United States continues to lead a global response\u2014building on decades of leadership in life-saving health and humanitarian assistance.</p> \n   <p>Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the US Government has committed more than $900 million in State Department and US Agency for International Development (USAID) emergency health, humanitarian, economic, and development assistance specifically aimed at helping governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) fight the pandemic. This funding, provided by Congress, will save lives by improving public health education; protecting healthcare facilities; and increasing laboratory, disease-surveillance, and rapid-response capacity in more than 120 countries.</p> \n   <p>The United States has mobilized as a nation to make this an impressive global effort. Working with the private sector, we have begun to fulfill President Trump\u2019s commitment to provide ventilators to our partners and allies in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The first shipment of ventilators donated by the United States, through USAID, arrived in the Republic of South Africa on May 11, 2020. Our foreign assistance funding to date for the response to the COVID-19 pandemic includes an initial $23 million specifically to provide ventilators to some of these partners and allies.

The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump says the US having the highest cases worldwide is a \u2018badge of honour\u2019. </strong>The US president told reporters at a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting-17/\">cabinet meeting</a> that the high number of cases in the US \u2013 far higher than any other country \u2013 is a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: \u201cYou know when you say that we lead in cases, that\u2019s because we have more testing than anybody else.\u201d He said he looks at the number \u201cin a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/singapore-sentences-man-to-death-via-zoom-call\">Singapore sentences man to death via Zoom call</a>. </strong>A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state\u2019s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely.Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try to curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia.</li> \n   <li><strong>UN chief praises Africa\u2019s efforts to stem virus. </strong>UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared with over 320,000 deaths worldwide.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases. </strong>Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full.</li> \n   <li><strong>Covid-19 crisis will push 60m into poverty says World Bank chief. </strong>Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said. David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%.</li> \n   <li><strong>US president claims hydroxychloroquine study is \u2018Trump enemy statement\u2019. </strong>Trump claimed a recent US study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">\u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d</a>. \u201cIf you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were very old.

The country now has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. <br></p> \n  <p>Here are the main developments from the last few hours:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Global confirmed death toll passes 322,000. </strong>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 322,457 people are known to have died while at least 4,881,619 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began.The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump claimed scientists carried out hydroxychloroquine study because they oppose him politically.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2\">The study</a> of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate. Trump said: \u201cThat was a false study done. Where they gave it very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration\u201d . </li> \n   <li><strong>The Covid-19 crisis could push 60 million people into poverty</strong>, the head of the World Bank, David Malpass, said. Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic</strong>. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa eased its lockdown measures, </strong>resume classes for some pupils on 1 June.Those in grades seven and 12, usually aged 13 and 18, will return to class and the country\u2019s minister of basic education Angie Motshekga said that, under strict social distancing rules, other grades would be able to attend lessons in schools with fewer than 150 pupils. Larger schools will open for other grades at a later date.</li> \n   <li><strong> The Netherlands will press ahead with a further easing of lockdown measures in June</strong> due to a steadily declining number of infections and hospital admissions, its prime minister Mark Rutte has said.The country\u2019s 17 million inhabitants have been living under the lockdown measures for about two and a half months.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d</strong>. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.</strong>There will be no \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said. Lectures will continue virtually, while it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it conforms to social distancing requirements.</li> \n   <li><strong>Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections </strong>as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414.</li> \n   <li><strong>The border between Canada and the US will remain closed</strong> to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day</strong>, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week</strong>, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday</strong>, as the local lockdown eases. People will be able to make \u201crecreational use\u201d of the Catalan capital\u2019s beaches as long as they respect physical distancing.</li> \n   <li><strong>Half a dozen people from three English Premier League football clubs tested positive for Covid-19</strong> in the space of two days, dealing a blow to hopes of top-flight English football resuming next month.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>",

  "<p>The gendered dimensions of political leadership during the Covid-19 crisis has achieved global proportions, with headlines claiming that women are doing things differently, and with better results. Much of this is assertion, given Vietnam and Georgia, amongst other countries with male leaders, have also seen successful containment. We have also witnessed some pushback against the policy decisions taken by Belgian prime minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the novelty of women political leaders remains newsworthy, and the media\u2019s go-to international \u201cface\u2019\u201d of those women who have managed this crisis exceptionally well is Jacinda Ardern.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/reunions-eating-out-and-a-lot-of-haircuts-new-zealand-embraces-relaxation-of-lockdown\">Reunions, eating out and a lot of haircuts: New Zealand embraces relaxation of lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The story of Ardern\u2019s rise and rise is well known around the world. From her \u201cBorgen\u201d moment post-2017 election, securing government after coming through from second place to form an unlikely three-way partnership; to having a baby in office and responding to the Christchurch massacre with words of kindness and resolute determination, hers was deemed a new style of leadership.</p> <p>But as her international acclaim increased, the voices of domestic sceptics grew louder. There was some criticism that her language of kindness had not translated into substantive policy solutions for the most vulnerable of New Zealanders, including children in poverty. There was also lingering disquiet that her coalition partner, New Zealand First, was dampening Labour\u2019s progressive ambitions to be the government of transformation. By February this year, even with Ardern at the helm, Labour had yet to win over centrist National supporters. The polls regularly had the National opposition scoring a higher share of the vote, suggesting the September 2020 election would go down to the wire.</p> <p>On 18 May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/jacinda-ardern-poll-high-popularity-national-simon-bridges-new-zealand-covid-19\">all that changed</a>. The Newshub Reid Research poll showed Labour\u2019s support at 56% compared with National\u2019s on 30%. Ardern\u2019s popularity had soared to a whopping 59%, while almost 92% of respondents said they supported the four-week lockdown imposed from 11.59pm on 25 March, when New Zealand was at 205 cases. Ardern faced the media almost daily, updating journalists and the thousands of New Zealanders who tuned in at 1pm every day with policy details and succinct reminders about staying home, spacing out, and being kind. Internationally, Ardern was being touted as one of a few leaders that had managed both the lockdown, and the communication around the virus, well. It appears that now both New Zealanders\u2019 sentiments and the global assessments are in synch.</p> <p>But what next? Is an election win for one of our most popular leaders ever a given? Most of the Reid Research poll was conducted prior to the country\u2019s move to alert level 2 (and the new freedom that comes with that), and closed just two days after last week\u2019s budget. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/new-zealand-budget-robertson-lays-out-50bn-plan-to-return-jobs-to-pre-covid-19-levels\">$50bn rescue fund</a> included an extension of the wage subsidy in an effort to delay the inevitable onset of high unemployment levels. But the economic predictions remain dire, both in terms of debt and job losses.</p> <p>Historically, alongside party identification (or loyalty), it is the state of the economy, and perception of one\u2019s economic wellbeing, that influences the way New Zealanders vote. History also tells us that one-term governments are unusual (the last one was the third Labour government in 1972-75), that in times of crisis, the status quo rather than change, is \u201ccomforting\u201d. And with the budget, Ardern\u2019s government delivered an economic stimulus package that spoke to these historical impulses. The focus was on wage earners, indeed mostly blue-collar workers (an old fashioned Labour term to be sure); keeping them in jobs, finding them new jobs, and providing universal free access to retraining to support the process of rebuilding New Zealand\u2019s economy. The allocation for \u201cessential workers\u201d (health, education and care work) gained less attention, and there was little funding for beneficiaries, including sole parents, the majority of whom are women.</p> <p>The well-received budget also appealed to a national (albeit gendered) imagining of the good old days of the ministry of works, when full employment referred to male full employment, and Labour won significantly more of their votes from men than from women. It was only in the 1990s, under Helen Clark\u2019s leadership, that Labour\u2019s gender gap in voting began to close. Indeed women voters became a critical part of Labour\u2019s pathway back to power after their decimation in 1990.</p> <p>Jacinda Ardern\u2019s astute political judgement, her authentic communication style and her capacity for calm resolve over the past two and a half years appears to have inspired many voters, both women and men, to return to Labour. However, the election of women leaders brings with it, rightly or wrongly, an additional expectation that the material wellbeing of women as workers and carers, will be substantively addressed. Research from around the world demonstrates that the more women there are in parliament, in cabinet, and in decision-making positions more generally, the more likely the diversity of women\u2019s issues are progressed through public policy. This same point was made by M\u0101ori and Pacific women leaders at a <a href=\"https://www.policycommons.ac.nz/2020/05/15/watch-gender-impact-analysis-policy-forum-women-workers-and-covid-19-in-aotearoa/\">University of Auckland </a><a href=\"https://www.policycommons.ac.nz/2020/05/15/watch-gender-impact-analysis-policy-forum-women-workers-and-covid-19-in-aotearoa/\">policy forum</a> on the eve of Budget 2020. Thus, there remains a challenge for Ardern if Labour is to win again, and that is to ensure she is doing more than symbolically representing the women of New Zealand.</p> <p><em>Jennifer Curtin is professor of politics and public policy at the University of Auckland.</em></p>",

It\u2019s really taking a toll on me, I work so many hours I don\u2019t get much time with my child,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Junior doctor, Aqsa Ghazanfar, described the expenses she has to pay as insulting. \u201cFrankly I mean myself and lots of my colleagues discussed it and feel insulted,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are putting our lives and our family\u2019s lives at risk and none of us have said we are not going to do this job. I am exposing myself to patients who potentially have Covid and bringing it home.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cIt is even more insulting [at the moment] - that is the only word I have really. It is appalling that people are still being asked to pay it.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said that she had to take a loan every time to pay for her family\u2019s visa, as there is \u201cno way that I can pay that much\u201d. </p> \n<p>Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said: \u201cThe immigration health surcharge is a grossly unfair financial burden \u2026 The government must drop this charge as a matter of urgency.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, president of the Doctors\u2019 Association UK said: \u201cThe Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) for NHS workers is a cruel and unnecessary policy which must be scrapped. These surcharges, which run into the thousands for a family of four, can be crippling for frontline NHS workers. Doctors from overseas have told us that this policy has made them feel unwelcome in the UK. The fact that the charge has been increased even further during the Covid pandemic has decimated morale amongst our overseas workforce.\u201c<br><br>\u201dWe were grateful to Sir Keir Starmer for reading out our letter to the Home Office at PMQs today and would welcome an amendment to the Immigration Bill to exempt NHS healthcare workers from the surcharge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Migrant Voice director, Nazek Ramadan, said: \u201cAn average family of four now has to pay nearly \u00a350,000 over the 10 years from arriving in the UK to getting citizenship.</p> \n<p>\u201cOrdinary families are being stripped bare.

  "<p>Greece has revved up the engines of its tourism industry, announcing that holidaymakers will be able to return to its beaches within weeks.</p> <p>In an address to the nation, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said 15 June was the official start date of a tourist season delayed by the global coronavirus pandemic and that direct international fights to the country\u2019s tourist destinations would resume gradually from 1 July.</p> <p>Holidaymakers from the UK and other countries would not be quarantined but would have to undergo coronavirus tests, the centre-right leader said in an attempt to allay fears of the virus being brought in from abroad.</p> <p>As it stands, UK holidaymakers hoping to travel abroad this summer will be subject to a 14-day quarantine on their return under British government plans, though specific details are yet to be announced.</p> <p>In a speech highlighting the significance of the tourism sector for the Greek economy, Mitsotakis said: \u201cSample tests will be conducted on our visitors, and our general health protocols will be adhered to, without them \u2026 overshadowing our bright sun or the natural beauties of Greece.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Greece\" data-alt=\"Greece coronavirus\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Greece\">Greece coronavirus</a> </figure>  <p>Mitsotakis , who has addressed Greeks at intervals throughout the public health crisis, spelled out the measures as he unveiled a tourism plan and other steps to rejuvenate the Greek economy.</p> <p>Previously the prime minister had said that \u201cin the best-case scenario\u201d, Greece would be accepting all tourists from 1 July, but \u2013 seeking to capitalise on the country\u2019s unexpectedly successful handling of the pandemic \u2013 he announced seasonal hotels could open from 15 June.</p> <p>The first foreign tourists are expected to enter the country by car from neighbouring Balkan states that have also recorded low infection and mortality rates.</p> <p>With Athens keen to attract holidaymakers from Britain, its primary market, tax cuts were also announced.</p> <p>In an attempt to make Greece more competitive for tour operators looking to seal package deals in the coming days, Mitsotakis said transport duties would be lowered from 24% to 13% for the next five months, making boat, plane and bus tickets cheaper during the tourist season. Taxes on coffee, soft drinks and tickets for open-air cinemas, a mainstay of any Greek summer, will also be slashed.</p> <p>Greece, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/why-has-eastern-europe-suffered-less-from-coronavirus-than-the-west\">which implemented an early and strict lockdown</a> to avoid strain on its austerity-hit healthcare system, has recorded impressively low figures for Covid-19.</p> <p>By Wednesday the country\u2019s health authorities had recorded 2,850 confirmed cases and 166 deaths. Mitsotakis\u2019s announcement of \u201csample testing\u201d ends speculation of travellers being subject to pre-flight blood tests and being forced to carry coronavirus immunity certificates.</p> <p>But the tourism plan also kickstarts an unprecedented leap into the unknown for the tourist industry, which is being forced to reimagine itself because of the strictures of the global health crisis.</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday the tourism minister, Harry Theoharis, described reigniting the tourist machine as a \u201cvery complicated exercise\u201d.</p> <p>The entire sector - from the obligatory wearing of face masks on flights to the way hotels operate each day while adhering to physical distancing rules \u2013 has had to be reworked down to the tiniest detail in the name of safeguarding health.</p> <p>Allowing tourism to return was clearly a calculated risk, Theoharis said. \u201cHow do we strike the right balance between protection and how do we preserve the core of the experience, because obviously people go on vacation to be free, carefree, to think about relaxation?\u201d he told an on online Economist conference. \u201cAnd how do we do this keeping our infection numbers low and the strength of our health system [on a level] where it can deal not only with citizens but tourists as well.\u201d</p> <p>In Greece\u2019s vast archipelagos of islands \u2013 all of which have remained remarkably free of coronavirus \u2013 the challenges were particularly acute. Some islands, uninhabited during the winter but popular during the summer months, were especially under-equipped, with rudimentary health clinics that would be hard pushed to deal with an outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cIf 9 million tourists come and just 1% falls ill that means 90,000 new cases,\u201d said Gkikas Magiorkinis, an assistant professor of hygiene and epidemiology who sits on the body of public health experts that advises the Greek government on the coronavirus.</p> <p>But for a country that had only just begun to emerge from a near-decade long debt crisis, much is also at stake. Last year Greece attracted a record 33 million tourists \u2013 the equivalent of three times its population. Close to 4 million visitors flew in from the UK.</p> <p>This year industry figures say they will be lucky if Greece attracts a third of that number.</p> <p>Mitsotakis said that although Greece led by example in its handling of the disease, Greeks could be particularly hard-hit by recession as a result of a global economic downturn caused by the pandemic.</p> <p>The only way forward, he said, was to get the tourist season going and prepare the ground for a successful year in 2021 when \u2013 he hoped \u2013 the coronavirus was part of the past.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 May 2020.

  "<p>Roll up! Who wants to lend to the UK government for three years for zero interest?</p> <p>Lots of people. The debt management office \u2013 a busy place these days \u2013 shifted \u00a33.8bn worth of three-year gilts on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/uk-sells-government-bond-with-negative-yield-for-first-time-coronavirus\">at a yield of -0.003%</a>. If buyers hold their paper for the full three years, they will get back slightly less than they invested.</p> <p>At one level, the government will cheer. If, like the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, you are amassing unheard-of levels of debt to pay for the Covid-19 crisis, it\u2019s clearly helpful that investors are willing to pay, in effect, for the privilege of owning your IOUs. It\u2019s an easier problem to face than being bullied by the bond market, which is what old economic textbooks might say should be happening when public borrowing has gone through the roof.</p> <p>But it is still a problem: the message is unmistakably bearish for the economy. Inflation in April <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/inflation-tumbled-uk-lowest-level-four-years-april-ons\">fell to 0.8%</a>, and the bond market clearly believes the recession will be so severe that the rate will go lower yet. In effect, investors are questioning the UK\u2019s ability to generate inflation, at least in the short-term.</p> <p>They are also doubting the Bank of England\u2019s ability to resist cutting interest rates, currently 0.1%, to below zero. The governor, Andrew Bailey, is a sceptic of negative rates for the understandable reason that they risk messing up the banking system, which has to maintain vast holdings of government debt for capital and liquidity purposes. But the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan went negative even before the coronavirus. It could happen here if the downturn is even worse than predicted.</p> <p>The medium-term inflationary picture could also turn out very differently, of course. A global recession caused by a pandemic is unknown territory. If the first effect is deflation, the second could be inflation. Massive government spending programmes could provoke a surge in demand that beaten-up producers suddenly find themselves unable to meet. Look at oil prices as a possible early indicator \u2013 they\u2019ve stopped falling (at least for now).</p> <p>Investors know that parallel risk, of course, just as they can assume that governments would happily seize any opportunity to inflate away some debt by turning a blind eye to returning inflation. It\u2019s been done in the past.</p> <p>But that is also why the bond market\u2019s current willingness to lend at 0% for three years is so alarming. The rush for safety is signalling that the crisis could get worse, and that remedies could take years to be effective.</p> <p>The stock market is singing a far more cheerful tune, it should be noted. It\u2019s almost perky and still seems to believe in something vaguely resembling a V-shaped recovery. But they can\u2019t both be right.</p> <h2>Manufacturing sector is at the crisis\u2019s next stage, but where\u2019s government?</h2> <p>Unite, the union, called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/rolls-royce-to-cut-9000-jobs-worldwide-as-covid-19-takes-toll\">9,000 job losses</a> at Rolls-Royce \u201cshameful opportunism\u201d, a judgment that feels too harsh. The cuts are the deepest at Rolls in decades, but they are matched by the size of the crisis in the aerospace industry.</p> <p>The group\u2019s commercial aerospace division has only two main customers for its engines \u2013 Airbus and Boeing \u2013 and both are cutting production by 30%-40%. Both are also warning that it will take years for output to return to 2019 levels. And, critically, less flying means less work for Rolls-Royce in servicing engines that are already in operation. Job losses were inevitable.</p> <p>Unite, though, is entirely right to demand a strategy from government to \u201cbuild Britain out of this dreadful situation\u201d, as the assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, put it. Rolls\u2019 UK operation, especially the Derby plant, is most exposed to the cuts. The clear threat is that engineering skills are lost permanently.</p> <p>There are plenty of ideas for government investment. For example: accelerate the small modular reactor programme, which uses Rolls-developed technology. If nuclear is to be part of the low-carbon energy mix, smaller plants make more sense than building another Hinkley Point C white elephant.</p> <p>The government\u2019s current concentration on furlough schemes and lending schemes is understandable. But the next stage of the crisis has arrived already in the manufacturing sector, and new and bigger thinking is urgently required. Unite\u2019s idea for a \u201cnational council for recovery\u201d sounds more promising than anything we\u2019ve heard from ministers. Is the department for business, energy and industrial asleep?</p>",

His commitment at prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: \u201cI have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Record number of tests conducted</strong></p> \n  <p>A record 177,216 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. The figures were announced after Johnson restated his ambition to get the daily total up to 200,000 by the end of this month. The figures have often been criticised as misleading. Statistics on the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s website show that although there were 177,216 tests, only 60,744 individuals actually got tested during this 24-hour period. The figures now also include tests carried out for survey purposes, including antibody tests to see if people have had the disease. These survey tests account for 23,601 of the daily total.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK death toll rises by 363</strong></p> \n  <p>A further 363 Covid-19 deaths were announced in the UK, taking the total to 35,704. The number of coronavirus patients in hospital in England had fallen below 10,000 for the first time since March.</p> \n  <p><strong>Government wants tourism to resume in July</strong></p> \n  <p>The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has said the government plans to allow tourism to begin in July. Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefin he said: \u201cI would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can. We\u2019ve set this very ambitious plan to try and get it up and running by the beginning of July. Dowden also announced plans to up a taskforce to help people in the recreation and leisure industries get their sectors back to work again.</p> \n  <p><strong>Bereavement scheme extended</strong></p> \n  <p>The government has bowed to pressure to give families and dependants of migrant NHS support staff who die as a result of contracting coronavirus will be granted indefinite leave to remain. The move follows criticism that care workers, cleaners and porters had been left out of the scheme, which only applied to certain occupations including nurses, biochemists and radiographers. Announcing the move, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said: \u201cWe are extending the scheme to NHS support staff and social care workers. We want to ensure families have the support they need and so this will be effective immediately and retrospectively.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>EU response chief warns of second wave</strong></p> \n  <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK\u2019s \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In an interview with the Guardian she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rolls-Royce plans to cut 9,000 jobs</strong></p> \n  <p>The Derby based engineering firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs \u2013 almost a fifth of its workforce, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, the company\u2019s chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><strong>Northern Ireland set to track and trace for at least a year</strong></p> \n  <p>Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced the contact-tracing programme for Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Five more people were reported to have died of coronavirus in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> taking its total to 494.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wales rules out setting \u2018arbitrary\u2019 date for reopening schools</strong></p> \n  <p>The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence in the evidence \u2013 on Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Public Health Wales has announced 14 more deaths from coronavirus, taking the total in Wales to 1,238.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon denies cover-up over early cases</strong></p> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. Last week it revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. A total of 2,184 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 50 since Tuesday.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK universities facing \u00a3760m hit</strong></p> \n  <p>British universities face a potential \u00a3760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn. A number of universities including Cambridge have said they will conduct all lectures online throughout the 2020-21 academic year.</p> \n  <p><strong>Outsourcing firm apologises for sharing details of hundreds of contract tracers</strong></p> \n  <p>The outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes \u201cto make sure that this does not happen again\u201d. Labour said the breach raised serious questions for the government about the capability of Serco to command public confidence.</p> \n  <p><strong>MoD set to scale down size of Covid support force</strong></p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000.

But these figures have often been criticised as misleading. As <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\">the detailed statistics on the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s website</a> show, although there were 177,216 tests, only 60,744 individuals actually got tested during this 24-hour period. The figures now also include tests carried out for survey purposes, including antibody tests (which show if you have had the virus, not if you have it now). These survey tests account for 23,601 of the daily total.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dowden said for the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people the new government \u201cstay alert\u201d advice means they should stay at home.</strong> The \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan only applies to England, because the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations have not adopted it. Dowden said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Staying alert, for the vast majority of people, still means staying at home as much as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This sounded like an attempt to counter the impression conveyed by some ministerial messages that the government is in a rush to end the lockdown.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dowden said he was setting up a taskforce to help people in the recreation and leisure industries get their sectors back to work again.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec558928f0864e579f149b1#block-5ec558928f0864e579f149b1\">5.21pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said the number of coronavirus patients in hospital in England had fallen below 10,000 for the first time since March.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dowden said he wanted tourism to resume in July.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can.

Also very little independent study or research about how the app might function seems to be in place to understand the use patterns as they unfold. Technology use generally brings in unintended consequences, and it is difficult to know what these will be.</p> \n   <p>Manual tracing alone is too slow, and if there is a second spike it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to locate the contacts faster than the rate of new contacts are becoming exposed. The rapid transmission of the virus between people, is faster than the time it takes to do the needed detective work and phone calls to alert all exposed individuals. However, an app will not work on its own either, so best way forward would be a combined approach.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Joshua Moon, research fellow at the University of Sussex Business School, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have my doubts that this target will be met, given the issues with the app and the need to train contact tracers. Even then, 1 June is delayed at best - this is a system which should have been in place before the pandemic even started. Accounting even for this, the system is delayed in its scale up.</p> \n   <p>On top of this, the system needs an additional component: isolate. Testing, tracking, and tracing contacts and patients is not going to stop this pandemic unless patients are isolated, and contacts are tested and isolated. This system is going to have to develop as we go along, we need to pay attention to how well it works and adapt as we go along.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rowland Kao, professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science, University of Edinburgh, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any voluntary use of the app would have to be supplemented by traditional contact tracing employing large numbers of people. As it is expected that all of these people will be newly trained, one should expect teething problems and therefore a considerable lag time before the contact-tracing programme is as effective as it could be and when surveillance and testing will therefore play its biggest role in ensuring that infection numbers stay low.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:57:14.743Z\">at 4.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec54e768f0886ce4f5d7349\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:49:20.843Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Barnier says 'new dynamism' needed to stop UK-EU trade talks ending in failure</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday No 10 released the text of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/886168/Letter_to_Michel_Barnier_19.05.20.pdf\">a letter (pdf)</a> sent by <strong>David Frost</strong>, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, to <strong>Michel Barnier</strong>, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in which Frost complained that the EU was just offering the UK \u201ca relatively low-quality trade agreement coming with unprecedented EU oversight of our laws and institutions\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Barnier has now released<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/brexit_files/info_site/uktf-20203060790-mb-reply-to-df-wd.pdf\"> the text of his reply (pdf)</a>. In it, he confirms that Frost has proposed aiming for a less ambitious trade deal than originally envisaged, giving up on the aim of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement. (Barnier objects, saying this might take more time, and would not resolve the level playing field dispute anyway.) He says \u201cnew dynamism\u201d is needed to avoid the talks ending in stalemate.</p> \n  <p>And he restates the longstanding EU claim that the UK wants to \u201ccherry pick\u201d - to enjoy the benefits of EU membership, but not the obligations. Barnier says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Regardless of what your letter suggests, there is no automatic entitlement to any benefits that the EU may have offered or granted in other contexts and circumstances to other, often very different, partners. </p> \n   <p>Every agreement that the EU has concluded is unique, with its own balance of rights and obligations, tailored to the partner and era in which it is concluded. There is no model, no uniform precedent to follow in EU trade policy. </p> \n   <p>Neither is there a right to what you admit are unprecedented UK proposals in a number of areas. Just as we do not accept selective benefits in the single market without the corresponding obligations, we also do not accept cherry picking from our past agreements. The EU is looking to the future, not to the past, in these negotiations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0cd5bf3a0ff61fdf582811dee2f6cd7579dbb21\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0cd5bf3a0ff61fdf582811dee2f6cd7579dbb21/0_40_4645_2787/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michel Barnier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michel Barnier.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Landemard/Le Pictorium Agency via Zuma/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:55:08.423Z\">at 4.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec54e058f0864e579f14933\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:35:31.828Z\">4.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67a9d2e82d071b3123828048e26c9a3a68c09bb4\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67a9d2e82d071b3123828048e26c9a3a68c09bb4/0_89_4986_2992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellis Tustin, grandson of Berrice Moore, holds up his grandfather\u2019s name staging a protest outside the Houses of Parliament today.

His commitment at prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons came as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said there had been no effective tracing in the country for 10 weeks. Johnson said: \u201cI have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will enable us, help us very greatly to defeat this disease and move the country forward.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>EU response chief warns of second wave</strong></p> \n  <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK\u2019s \u2013 on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In an interview with the Guardian she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the time now to completely relax.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rolls-Royce plans to cut 9,000 jobs</strong></p> \n  <p>The Derby based engineering firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs \u2013 almost a fifth of its workforce, with UK factories set to be hardest hit. Negotiations are beginning with trade unions before any figures for job losses in the UK are agreed but Warren East, the company\u2019s chief executive, said most of the cuts would be in its civil aerospace business. Demand for aircraft, and the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce, have slumped across the world in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p><strong>Northern Ireland set track and trace for at least a year</strong></p> \n  <p>Stormont\u2019s health minister, Robin Swann, has announced the contact-tracing programme for Northern Ireland is set to last for at least a year. He said a pilot programme that began at the start of April to track contacts associated with all confirmed cases of Covid-19 would be ramped up to a seven-day operation and would last for at least a year. Five more people were reported to have died of coronavirus in Northern Ireland taking its total to 494.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wales rules out setting \u2018arbitrary\u2019 date for reopening schools</strong></p> \n  <p>The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said she will not set an \u201carbitrary\u201d date for when more children will return to school. She said more evidence \u2013 and more confidence \u2013 in the evidence around Covid-19 was needed before schools would open to more children. Public Health Wales has announced 14 more fatalities from coronavirus, taking the death toll in Wales to 1,238. </p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon denies cover-up over early cases</strong></p> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon has denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. Last week it revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. A total of 2,184 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, an increase of 50 since Tuesday.</p> \n  <p><strong>UK universities facing \u00a3760m hit </strong></p> \n  <p>British universities face a potential \u00a3760m blow to their funding after about one in five students said they would not enrol in the next academic year if classes were delivered online and other activities curtailed. A survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than 20% said they were willing to delay starting their courses if universities were not operating as normal due to the coronavirus pandemic, which would mean there would be 120,000 fewer students when the academic year begins in autumn. A number of universities including Cambridge have said they will conduct all lectures online throughout the 2020-21 academic year. </p> \n  <p><strong>Outsourcing firm apologises for sharing details of hundreds of contract tracers</strong></p> \n  <p>The outsourcing firm Serco has apologised after accidentally sharing the email addresses of almost 300 contact tracers. The company is training staff to trace cases of Covid-19 for the UK government. It made the error when it emailed new trainees to tell them about training. Serco said it had apologised and would review its processes \u201cto make sure that this does not happen again\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>MoD set to scale down size of Covid support force</strong></p> \n  <p>The Ministry of Defence is poised to announce a reduction in the numbers of military personnel ready to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the UK to 7,500 from 20,000. These are soldiers and other members of the armed forces \u201cheld at readiness\u201d so they can be deployed quickly if needed by civilian authorities, but with only 4,000 currently being used and the national situation slowly improving it has been decided fewer troops are required on standby.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T15:31:16.035Z\">at 4.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec534688f0864e579f147e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-boffey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T13:47:27.723Z\">2.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across <strong>Europe </strong>is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments \u2013 including the UK \u2013 on disease control.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,\u201d says Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).</p> \n  <p>It has been the unenviable task of scientists to tell it as it is through the coronavirus pandemic.

Here are the main points. Unlike other lobby briefings, the post-PMQs one includes briefing from a source able to comment on political matters, as well as briefing from the PM\u2019s civil service spokesman (the official spokesman).</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman confirmed that the PM\u2019s commitment to have the contact-tracing system up and running by 1 June was a firm pledge - even though at one point in PMQs Johnson only said he had \u201cgrowing confidence\u201d on this point.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec517098f0864e579f14631#block-5ec517098f0864e579f14631\"> 1.07pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>But the spokesman also refused to back what Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser, said yesterday about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/19/uk-coronavirus-live-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec40df78f0864e579f13e6e#block-5ec40df78f0864e579f13e6e\">it being essential for a contact-tracing system to be in place before any further lockdown measures could be lifted.</a> </strong>Asked if the PM agreed, the spokesman said that the government would be guided by the best scientific advice and that it would only open schools when it was safe to do so. He also stressed that, in the Commons this afternoon, the PM said a contact-tracing system would be in place by 1 June.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the contact-tracing system would launch before the NHS contact-tracing app was ready to be rolled out nationwide.</strong> The app is supposed to be one element of the new contact tracing system. But the government now talks about \u201ctest and trace\u201d, not \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d. As the Guardian reports today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/uk-plans-for-contact-tracing-in-doubt-as-app-not-ready-until-june\">rolling out the app has been hit by some setbacks.</a> Yesterday the health minister Lord Bethell told peers the government would begin with the tracing rather than with the app. Asked about this comment, the spokesman said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t disagree with that.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the ONS was planning to publish more information about R, the reproduction number, tomorrow.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government had no plans to reconsider the two-metre rule. </strong>This morning <strong>Prof Robert Dingwall</strong>, a government adviser who sits on Nervtag (the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group) told <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8339837/Government-scientist-says-2m-social-distancing-rule-based-fragile-evidence.html\">the BBC that the evidence for this was \u201cvery fragile\u201d</a> and that other countries adopted a different approach.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, will take the government press conference this afternoon, the spokesman said. </strong>He will appear with Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director for NHS England.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A source said that the Conservative party was still making plans for its autumn conference to go ahead</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/lib-dems-urged-to-axe-party-conference-and-switch-to-virtual-format-due-to-coronavirus\">Labour has abandoned its normal conference</a>, and instead plans an online event. Asked about the Tory one, a source said that planning for it continued but that this was being kept under review. He said any final decision about whether to go ahead with it would be taken on the basis of the latest scientific and medical advice.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A source defended the government\u2019s decision to try to install Sir Bernard Jenkin as chair of the liaison committee.</strong> The liaison committee comprises all select committee chairs, and its most prominent job is to take evidence from the prime minister several times a year. Johnson has still not appeared before it at all, even though he became PM 10 months ago. This evening MPs will be asked to vote on a government motion setting up the committee, with Jenkin as chair, even though Jenkin does not currently chair a select committee. Labour MPs are backing an amendment saying only a serving committee chair should be eligible to chair the liaison committee. They think No 10 wants Jenkin in the post because he will be soft on the PM. Asked why No 10 wanted Jenkin, a source said Jenkin was \u201ca distinguished backbencher\u201d with \u201ca long track record of holding governments to account\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p

She said: \u201cThe cases from the Nike conference where all reported in the normal way through our daily figures. The reason that we didn\u2019t say where these people got the virus was down to patient confidentiality.\u201d She said as so few people were infected at the time, revealing the link to the conference would have risked revealing patient identities. </p> \n  <p>Carlaw insisted that the public should have been told. He accepted there was a balance to be struck between patient confidentiality and public health, but he added: \u201cFor coronavirus that balance must clearly sit in favour of protecting the public\u2019s health. We do have a right to know.\u201d </p> \n  <p>He said the contact tracing that followed the conference didn\u2019t happen at the appropriate scale. Sturgeon rejected this. She pointed out that 60 people in Scotland an a further 50 people in England were contacted after the conference. She said: \u201cLet\u2019s not engage in ridiculous language of secrecy are covered up to cover. It doesn\u2019t impugn my integrity, but it actually starts to impugn the integrity of the experts who managed this outbreak, including, I have to say Public Health England, who were part of the expert management team.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon confirmed that she would set out details on Thursday about how Scotland proposes to ease its lockdown measures. She said she was encouraged by the latest data showing a slower rise in the death rate from the disease. </p> \n  <p>She said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The trends we are seeing do matter, and they provide further grounds for encouragement, in particular the number of Covid-19 deaths has fallen for the third week, and are almost half the level three weeks ago.

At first he resorted to bluster, accusing Starmer of ignorance and quoting broad-brush testing statistics to avoid the more specific question about why care homes are still not routinely able to access the level of testing that is supposed to be available. Challenging Starmer on fact is normally a grievous error, but instead of pressing him repeatedly on this, the Labour leader moved on to contact tracing. Johnson had a moderately effective retort when he claimed that Starmer was asking about matters which he had already been briefed on privately (which may well be true, although there is merit in Starmer forcing the PM to put these matters on the record), but what worked best for Johnson was that he was able actually announce something: that contact tracing will be up and running on 1 June, and able to trace 10,000 contacts a day. </p> \n  <p>Starmer did not seem to have anticipated this, allowing Johnson to accuse him of not listening. For the final two questions, on the NHS surcharge, Starmer was on stronger ground, and his point about a care worker on the minimum wage having to work 70 hours to pay for this was a powerful one. Johnson\u2019s defence was glib, but it did not feel like a decisive exchange.</p> \n  <p>So Johnson got through this without the humbling he endured last week. But to do so, he had to make quite a specific promise. When he first said that a contact tracing scheme capable of tracking 10,000 contacts a day would be up and running by 1 June, he made a firm commitment. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec515b98f0864e579f1461c#block-5ec515b98f0864e579f1461c\">12.38pm.) </a>Later in the exchanges he was a bit more conditional, telling Starmer:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What he heard is that we have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place, it will be in place by June 1.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This morning Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, gave what may turn out to be a more realistic assessment (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec4d0c48f08a1782fa7df81#block-5ec4d0c48f08a1782fa7df81\">7.48am)</a>, saying that although he hoped to see a contact tracing system in place by 1 June, \u201cit won\u2019t necessarily be as developed and full blown as we\u2019d like\u201d.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ec4d5308f0886ce4f5d6d40#block-5ec4d5308f0886ce4f5d6d40\">8.06am.) </a>Buckland was speaking in particular in relation to testing, but the statement has a wider application; in recent days there has been increasing focus on the consequences of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/19/uk-coronavirus-live-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec3d26c8f08a1782fa7d7c1#block-5ec3d26c8f08a1782fa7d7c1\">the government\u2019s decision to get elderly patients out of hospitals and into care homes to free up bed space.</a> Buckland\u2019s statement was not, in substance, very surprising \u2013 it has been obvious for some time that this is what has happening \u2013 but, given that most ministers find it near-impossible to admit anything that might look like a mistake, his candour was striking.</p> \n  <p>In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago Prof Martin Green, chief executive of<strong> Care England</strong>, which represents care providers, welcomed what Buckland said. Green told the programme:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s very significant because it\u2019s probably the first time that we\u2019ve had an admission that there was a priority for the NHS. We knew that from the very start of the pandemic, and in fact part of that challenge was that the priority for the NHS led to things like the disruption of PPE supplies for care homes.</p> \n   <p>In many ways I can understand why the government prioritised the NHS. I can understand why they wanted to make sure there was enough capacity, because if the pandemic had gone in the way that it was projected to go there would have been a huge need for hospital beds.

She says the government has world-leading measures to combat extremism. There will be an independent review of the Prevent programme, she says.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Around 1,000 migrants are said to have arrived across the Channel since the lockdown. What are you doing about that?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she is doing a lot. Border Force officers and others are working night and day on this, she says.

The Home Office is working with Sage on this, she says. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Would you be confident sending your child to primary school in June?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she would be. Children\u2019s education is vital, she says. She says this does not amount to rushing back to a full school day.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Should sanctions be taken against councils that don\u2019t cooperate?</em></p> \n  <p>No, says Patel. She says government and councils need to work together.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What happens if a teacher does not turn up?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she has seen some teachers do heroic work keeping schools open for the children of key workers and for vulnerable children.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Should sentences be increased for people who cough at police officers, threatening them with coronavirus?</em></p> \n  <p>Patel says she is looking at that.

Asked whether she was confident that this system is currently in place, she said: \u201cI think it\u2019s getting better.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div>",
  "<p>The body that represents local authorities across England has set out serious concerns over proposals to reopen primary schools on 1 June, as ministers appeared to row back on the idea after sustained criticism from councils and school leaders.</p> \n<p>With just 11 days until the government\u2019s schools deadline, the Local Government Association, which represents most local authorities in England, said councils should be given access to local coronavirus testing data in order to safely reopen schools. </p> \n<p>\u201cAs there are different Covid-19 infection rates around the country, schools and councils must be able to work together to decide how and when schools open to more children. Some areas may want to work faster than others,\u201d said Judith Blake, chair of the LGA\u2019s children and young people board.</p> \n<p>\u201cCouncils also need crucial testing data to be shared with them, to help enable greater confidence for teachers and parents around school openings, and powers to manage outbreaks in places like schools, care homes, businesses and communities if new Covid-19 clusters emerge.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government had said it wanted children in nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6 to begin a phased return to schools from 1 June, with other years following soon after, so that primary children have a month of school before the summer holidays.</p> \n<p>But the LGA\u2019s intervention came as more councils in England distanced themselves from the government\u2019s self-imposed target. Staffordshire county council, which includes the education secretary, Gavin Williamson\u2019s, constituency of South Staffordshire, was among those saying they would leave decisions on reopening to headteachers.</p> \n<p>The Conservative-dominated West Sussex county council also said it did not feel bound by the 1 June target, saying in a statement: \u201cIt is our view that any phased return to schools needs to be managed safely and the practicalities of that phased return need to be considered carefully against each individual school\u2019s risk assessment of what can be managed safely.\u201d</p> \n<p>Graeme Miller, a Labour councillor and leader of Sunderland council, was more emphatic: \u201cOur stance is clear: we cannot expect teachers, or children, to be in a school environment in Sunderland unless they know that it is safe for them, and there are serious question marks about that presently, based on the localised health picture in the north-east.\u201d</p> \n<p>Miller said the country \u201cwas on a knife-edge in our fight against Covid-19 at this moment in time\u201d, with only a limited understanding of whether, and how rapidly, children could pass on the virus.</p> \n<p>The government is now saying 1 June is not a fixed date and that ministers need to listen to the concerns of councils and teachers, with the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, striking a conciliatory note during a series of media interviews.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation.

These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the minister emphasised that the government was in listening mode: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to listen to what we are being told and also to engage and to persuade and to make sure the necessary arrangements are in place. The government always said that we hoped that 1 June would be the date. It was conditional.\u201d</p> \n<p>In another interview with BBC Breakfast, Buckland acknowledged teachers\u2019 safety concerns. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us want to put either children or our dedicated teaching staff in any danger at all, and the question of being safe is clearly paramount.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo we\u2019re all working towards 1 June and planning for that return, but I accept the point that there may well be issues from employers that need to be addressed which might not mean we\u2019ll see a uniform approach on 1 June.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As the number of deaths in care homes reached 11,600, the justice secretary also addressed questions about coronavirus testing, saying the NHS had been chosen as the focus instead of care homes and that was \u201cright and essential\u201d so as not to overwhelm hospitals.</p> \n<p>He told Sky News: \u201cI think we rightly emphasised the importance of making sure our NHS services, our hospitals, were places that would continue to admit patients and wouldn\u2019t be incubators of the disease. We achieved that. We protected our NHS.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if the government focus on the health service had been to the detriment of care homes, Buckland replied: \u201cI think we needed to make a choice about testing and we did decide to focus upon the NHS.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the issue with care homes is that we\u2019ve got many thousands of different providers, different settings. There have been lots of examples of care homes that have mercifully stayed infection-free, but sadly far too many cases of infection and then death.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked to clarify his policy that the strategy was to \u201cfocus on the NHS first and foremost\u201d, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s right, and I think that was absolutely essential.\u201d</p> \n<p>Deaths in care homes from coronavirus account for about of quarter of the total fatalities from the virus. However, Buckland later said that choosing between health settings and care was not a \u201cbinary choice\u201d for the government.</p> \n<p>In an interview with ITV, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been told time and time again rightly that hospitals are not the best settings for older people in terms of recovery. Therefore I don\u2019t think anybody is to be blamed for wanting to get residents back into a familiar setting.\u201d</p>",

The satirical lifestyle show \u2013 \u201cfor a world in which nobody has a life\u201d \u2013 is a half-hour shot of anxiety-induced delirium. It\u2019s been whipped up absurdly quickly by some of the country\u2019s top comedic talents (the second episode, which aired on Wednesday, wasn\u2019t ready for previews until late on Tuesday night), and served with zero romanticisation of this very bad time we\u2019re all having.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbwDKEU1ejM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AbwDKEU1ejM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One of the series\u2019 greatest assets is its non-comedic talent: the Australian current affairs legend Ray Martin. Martin reads from what is essentially a Shaun Micallef script; he deadpans about \u201cfive new viruses we\u2019d like to give to Richard Wilkins\u201d, and at one point stands grinning before the camera with tuxedo pockets full of soap: \u201cStay soapy!\u201d</p> <p>Martin\u2019s endearing presence adds an extra slippery layer of surrealism to the whole thing. It\u2019s oddly appropriate for a time in which broadcasters have delivered increasingly bizarre bulletins each night (remember the week you were told you can no longer hug your mum, your industry was no longer viable, and you were only allowed to get a haircut from 1.5 metres away?)</p> <p>In the same style as the early 2000s SBS comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrxkKqc7aIs\">Life Support</a>, the show consists of \u201chelpful\u201d home maintenance, cooking and finance tips from comedians including Ryan Shelton, Bjorn Stewart and Anne Edmond\u2019s manic alter ego <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otkkgoHzXqw\">Helen Bidou</a>.

That means having strong pipelines and strong investments in pipelines, and a good network of pipelines around Australia to support that,\u201d Taylor told the ABC.</p> <p>The NCCC did not directly respond to questions on whether it had considered alternatives to gas, and the basis for the taskforce\u2019s claim that it was key to reducing electricity prices. A spokesman said its focus was currently on supporting businesses to reopen. He said the NCCC had liaised with more than a thousand stakeholders, including some with renewable energy expertise, and the manufacturing taskforce was one of several working groups it had set up. Options for economic recovery would be provided to government in due course.</p> <p>In the draft report, the taskforce says its recommendations on gas aim to correct \u201cmarket failures of our current energy supply\u201d. It says an expanded gas industry should work closely with a developing hydrogen industry and Australia could become a world leader in exporting hydrogen developed with renewable energy and gas.</p> <p>Other recommendations from the taskforce include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Considering tax incentives for priority gas infrastructure.</p></li> <li><p>Lifting remaining gas exploration moratoria in New South Wales and Victoria, and easing regulations in the Northern Territory to allow quicker access to new supply from the massive Beetaloo Basin.</p></li> <li><p>Using a reverse auction \u201ccontract-for-difference\u201d scheme, such as that used for wind and solar in Victoria, for state governments to buy gas-fired power at lowest cost.</p></li> <li><p>Providing support, such as low-cost capital, for existing small and medium-sized gas companies to invest.</p></li> <li><p>Rapidly cutting regulations, described as \u201cgreen and red tape\u201d, to allow developments.</p></li> <li><p>Introducing gas reservation policies for the NT and east coast developments, as exist in Western Australia, to ensure not all gas is exported.</p></li> </ul> <p>On electricity generation, the taskforce says gas-fired power is central to more rapid adoption of renewable energy at lowest cost, and could contribute 10-15% of total generation as back-up for wind and solar as coal declines. If gas prices stay low, it says combined-cycle gas generation \u2013 a form of \u201cbaseload\u201d power that the federal government has not backed as part of the future \u2013 would \u201clikely expand significantly\u201d.</p> <p>Its assessment that gas is necessary to support variable clean energy is at odds with the Australian Energy Market Operator, which last year listed pumped hydro, batteries and \u201cdemand-side participation\u201d schemes, which offer energy users cash to cut down consumption when needed, as potentially cheaper alternatives.</p> <p>The<strong> </strong>government\u2019s push for gas escalated as the price plunged from about $12 a gigajoule to about $4.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s strategic orientation in the world is rarely the most salient topic of national debate, and it is lost almost entirely in the mostly domestic politics of quarantine.

Mr Johnson\u2019s plan was for Britain to be a champion of international free trade, thwarting protectionism by the power of its open-market example. These delusions can be seen in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2644d2af-4c02-46e5-877a-efe1f69511bb\" title=\"\">plan</a> for minimal border checks on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Belief in the \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d mantra is a requirement for advancement in Mr Johnson\u2019s administration. Pragmatic voices seeking alignment with Europe were long ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-reshuffle-johnsons-cabinet-of-courtiers\" title=\"\">drowned out</a>. David Frost, Mr Johnson\u2019s chief negotiator, takes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/19/brexit-talks-eu-wants-us-to-obey-the-rules-of-their-club-says-gove\" title=\"\">maximalist position</a> that sees any accommodation to EU jurisdiction as nullifying sacred principles of Brexit. In that respect, he is more ideologue and politician than diplomat, which makes him ill-suited to the task of brokering a deal.</p> <p>For Eurosceptic hardliners, the priority is a trade deal with Washington, to which end negotiations are under way in parallel with Brexit talks. For the majority of UK businesses, the European side of the equation needs balancing first, since that is where the greater proportion of exports go \u2013 around 45%, compared with around 20% to the US. The Atlanticists argue that those proportions describe a status quo from which Brexit is the departure point; what matters is untapped markets. Trade economists query the wisdom of betting everything on benefits that don\u2019t exist yet at the expense of those that do.</p> <p>Brexit ultras also think a deal with Donald Trump will put pressure on the Europeans by demonstrating that the UK has options. But Brussels sees Mr Trump\u2019s nationalistic trade agenda as a <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-builds-anti-trump-trade-bazooka/\" title=\"\">threat to the stability of the international order</a>. That makes concessions on the European side much less likely. And for some Eurosceptics who share Mr Trump\u2019s wrecking attitude to the European project, maximum damage to relations with Brussels is a goal in itself.</p> <p>Market access is just one component in this geostrategic contest. Washington wants to dump its agricultural surplus on British consumers (which would ruin domestic farmers), but it also wants the UK to side with Mr Trump in his escalating rhetorical confrontation with China. The EU takes a less belligerent stance towards Beijing. Mr Johnson\u2019s China policy is a muddle, warily engaged, but under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/29/johnson-faces-tory-rebellion-over-huawei-5g-plans-for-britain\" title=\"\">pressure from many Tories</a> who prefer the US line.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic has incinerated old expectations and savaged economic prospects for probably years. It introduces stresses to an already fragmented global trading order that were not foreseen by Eurosceptic ideologues. It sharpens dilemmas that were already acute. The lone-trade model forces the UK to compromise on two fronts, in parallel negotiations, with little leverage and no allies. Concessions to the east damage prospects to the west. It is easy to see why the prime minister does not want to admit in public that his choices are constrained, not expanded, by Brexit. But it is a fact to which he must adapt to navigate safely through newly turbulent waters.</p>",
  "<p>I am hard pressed to name another athlete who has dominated my life quite like Michael Jeffrey Jordan.

When the network surveyed 615 hoops fans to choose the better player between Jordan and James, 73% opted for the former. Jordan scored with older fans (four-to-one ) and younger ones (two-to-one). He swept all 17 voting categories on offer, the overwhelming choice to take a game-winning shot (76%) <em>and </em>share a drink with (65%). Even Jordan\u2019s more narrow victories in categories such as \u201ctrust to pass you the ball\u201d (57%), \u201cchoose as a teammate\u201d (63%) and positive off-court impact (62%) were comfortable enough. Never mind if these lopsided margins benefited from recency bias. (The polling was conducted over the weekend of episodes seven and eight, as James and his active NBA counterparts were on coronavirus lockdown.)</p> <p>Rightfully, I should be basking in Jordan\u2019s mandate. But truth be told I have never been more conflicted.</p> <p>When I was a kid, it was enough to take Jordan at face value. As far as I knew, he was an otherworldly basketball player whose vast skill owed as much to natural talent as sweat equity, and whose clutch gene traced to a never-say-die attitude. Sure, there were reports of him <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2020/05/i-knew-jerry-krause-the-last-dance-michael-jordan-co-have-done-him-dirty.html\">sparring with management</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/19/horace-grant-michael-jordan-the-last-dance-documentary-espn\">tangling with teammates</a>. And sure, there was more recent evidence of him snubbing selfie-seeking rappers, stiffing kids out of free Air Jordans and doubling down on grudges in maybe the <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/chicago/columns/story?columnist=greenberg_jon&amp;id=4468210\">most bitter hall of fame speech ever delivered</a>. But it was difficult to argue <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_career_achievements_by_Michael_Jordan\">with the results</a>.</p> <p>Forget growing the NBA globally. Jordan was an excuse to put off homework for a few hours, a reason to get together with friends \u2013 a blissful diversion for me as my parents went through a lengthy divorce. He was an uncomplicated superstar for a relatively quiet time in history when wars were over in a month and the greatest question facing humanity was whether Ross and Rachel would end up together. It was clear to everyone that we were living in a moment.</p> <p>But now that the moment has passed, who could appraise Jordan on his basketball skill alone anymore? As much as The Last Dance<em> </em>tried to keep a tight focus on the court, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/09/the-last-dance-michael-jordan-netflix\">Jordan the executive producer</a> hand-checking the viewer all the while, I couldn\u2019t help but note the many belittling references to his \u201csupporting cast\u201d or the villainizing of Bulls GM Jerry Krause \u2013 who, it should be noted, is dead and unable to defend himself. I watched Jordan dismiss his 80s-era teammates as womanizing cokeheads and take pride in bullying benchwarmer Scott Burrell and Steve Kerr. I watched him explain away his famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/04/michael-jordan-espn-last-dance-republicans-sneakers-quote-nba\">\u201cRepublicans buy sneakers too\u201d line as a joke</a>.</p> <p>More to the point: I watched Jordan speak adoringly about his parents and brother and the off-duty Chicago cops in his entourage without really making much mention of his three adult children. In fact, I was convinced that was where the documentary was headed after Jordan\u2019s passionate soliloquy on the price of winning. But the kids only appear briefly toward the end of the series. Certainly, when it came to shutting out the distractions of the world, nobody did it better than MJ. But we don\u2019t live in that world anymore. Hence why, an adult now, I find myself gravitating more and more toward James.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a354cacbe98e432df41517fff0f52589636272f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a354cacbe98e432df41517fff0f52589636272f/0_118_3204_1924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Last Dance has been essential viewing for basketball fans in the past few weeks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Last Dance has been essential viewing for basketball fans in the past few weeks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christina Mushi-Brunt/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At worst James is the single greatest success story in team sports, a child prodigy who not only overcame <a href=\"https://www.sportscasting.com/lebron-james-had-a-more-depressing-childhood-than-you-think/\">the hardscrabble circumstances of his youth</a> but fulfilled every expectation that was ever foisted upon him.

There\u2019s no Kobe Bryant, a GOAT challenger whose copycatting of Jordan I once found as grating as nails on a chalkboard. But when Bryant explained, in footage shot for The Last Dance before his death this year, that his career was essentially a love letter to Jordan, all I could take away was regret. Clearly, eternal greatness doesn\u2019t have to be a zero-sum game. It could just be a pleasant distraction, a standard to aspire. It could just be a body of work to appreciate <em>in </em>its time that encapsulated a moment that won\u2019t soon be forgotten.</p>",

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one day we find an ancient cave painting and right in the middle of all the cavemen we find Trump, \u2018fake news\u2019, \u2018I never touched that dinosaur\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1262937457575723012\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump claims he\u2019s taking hydroxychloroquine, but let\u2019s remember: it\u2019s not what goes into his mouth that makes him an a**hole, it\u2019s what comes out. <a href=\"https://t.co/CM0xcm0g12\">pic.twitter.com/CM0xcm0g12</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1262937457575723012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 20, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>No one knows if Trump is telling the truth about taking the drug, Noah continued. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s trying to distract from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/pelosi-trump-steve-linick-firing-retaliation-unlawful\">inspector general story</a>, or from <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/18/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html\">all the coronavirus deaths</a>, or from the fact that his most trusted adviser is actually one of those South Korean soccer dolls,\u201d said Noah, referring to Jared Kushner. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know.</p> <p>\u201cSo Trump is either taking a dangerous, ineffective drug or he\u2019s lying about doing it just for the LOLs,\u201d Noah added.</p> <p>As for Pelosi\u2019s comments on the matter, Noah could only facepalm. \u201cMocking the president\u2019s weight also makes a lot of people who aren\u2019t Trump feel like shit too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo please, just remember: Trump\u2019s not an asshole because of what goes into his mouth. He\u2019s an asshole because of what comes out of it.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2> <p>\u201cYou have to hand it to Trump \u2013 just when you think it can\u2019t get any crazier, he starts popping FDA-disapproved drugs and telling everyone else to try it, too,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel on the hydroxychloroquine fiasco. \u201cOur president is a hydroxymoron. It\u2019s hard to process but are we surprised that the guy who thought windmills caused cancer thinks a lupus drug kills coronavirus?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwBIBrJMVCA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NwBIBrJMVCA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>To be fair, Kimmel continued, \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump has any idea what drugs he takes every day. He\u2019s like a dog \u2013 Mike Pompeo just puts the pills in peanut butter and feeds it to him.\u201d So why say he\u2019s taking an unproven drug? Kimmel thought about it for awhile, he said, and came to the \u201cthe only reasonable conclusion: he\u2019s trying to kill himself.</p> <p>\u201cRemember how we all said he didn\u2019t really want to be president?\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cWell guess what, I think we were right.\u201d Kimmel joked that Trump is trying to end his presidency with the dangerous drug, since \u201che\u2019s done everything possible to make sure no one would ever want to vote for him again: he colluded with Russia, he extorted Ukraine, he declared his love for Kim Jong-un, he made fun of John McCain, he threw paper towels at Puerto Ricans, he paid off a porn star, in the middle of a pandemic, he wants to reopen the mall.</p> <p>\u201cThe man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/22/not-too-bright-trump-trolled-for-staring-at-the-eclipse-with-no-eye-protection\">stared directly into an eclipse</a>, and none of it worked \u2013 he\u2019s still popular, and he\u2019s still trapped in that White House, and there\u2019s only one way out now: a big glass of bleach with a hydro and Z-pack chaser.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqPZ42isWbE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OqPZ42isWbE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And on Late Night, Seth Meyers traced Trump\u2019s hydroxychloroquine comments back to his long history of shilling scammy products, such as Trump Vodka and Trump University. Given his track record, Meyers said, it makes sense that Trump would claim to personally take a potentially dangerous drug he\u2019s been hawking as a miracle cure for weeks, citing \u201cI get a lot of positive calls about it\u201d as evidence.</p> <p>\u201cYour evidence is that you hear good stories and get positive calls about it \u2026 we\u2019re talking about a potentially dangerous medication, not the new hibachi place in town,\u201d said Meyers.</p> <p>\u201cLook, Trump\u2019s gonna say and do crazy shit,\u201d Meyers added. \u201cHe failed on the pandemic response and unemployment is at its highest point in 100 years, so now he\u2019s spraying ink in the water so he can dart under a rock before the press can figure out what happened. We don\u2019t have to spend all day dissecting it, debating whether it\u2019s a chess move or a planned distraction \u2013 the guy doesn\u2019t play chess. He doesn\u2019t even know how to close an umbrella. Watching him play chess would be like asking your dog to change the channel on the remote control.\u201d</p> <p>The drug\u2019s benefits are unproven, Meyers continued, and side-effects can include agitation, confusion, insomnia, mania, hallucinations and paranoia. \u201cSo either Trump\u2019s lying about taking it \u2026 or he\u2019s been taking it for 73 years.\u201d</p>",

That will inhibit them from being very frank and you don\u2019t want to inhibit frankness from scientists because you really want to know what is their best estimate of what\u2019s going on at the moment \u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cI would say this is not a healthy debate to have, I think, scientists should stick to advice and then it is for government to accept the advice and decide what to do with it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/oct/07/nobel-prize-chemistry-2009\">The Nobel prize-winning biochemist</a> said the government was right to disassociate itself from Coffey\u2019s comments.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t to mean that scientists are always going to get everything right, far from it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will have got things wrong but the beauty of science is that as new evidence comes in you change your understanding of it. And in the end the only way to progress out of this pandemic is through science.\u201d</p> \n<p>When faced with criticism of its handling of the pandemic, the government has consistently responded with the refrain that it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/scientists-criticise-uk-government-over-following-the-science\">\u201cfollowing the science\u201d</a>. Ramakrishnan said that while that was possible in some instances, with physical distancing for example, when evidence of the benefits were clear, it was not always so simple.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe science is complicated and putting it into policies also complicated and so you can\u2019t just say you\u2019re following the science in every case,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what ministers should say is, \u2018we\u2019re heeding the science, we\u2019re heeding the science advice, we\u2019re considering it when we make our decisions\u2019 \u2013 that would be a more honest thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>A member of Sage, who did not want to be named, also stressed that decisions were ultimately the responsibility of ministers.</p> \n<p>\u201cPoliticians are in charge, and they decide what advice they get,\u201d they said. \u201cScientists like me are invited to give advice and have no power to enact any decisions. They don\u2019t have to accept the advice, and indeed should take a wider view than the science when making decisions \u2013 they are elected by the population to take decisions on our behalf.\u201d</p> \n<p>Alex Stevens, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Kent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/06/expert-quits-home-office-drug-panel-over-political-vetting\">who quit</a> the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), which reports to the Home Office, last year over the alleged \u201cpolitical vetting\u201d of panel members by the government, wrote a paper published in the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0894-x.epdf?sharing_token=lj-FzqIXDPxYs_b-saUh1tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OhBxUj-qDTg0jgIqy3_uHgZZUihTm4w9uuFG1K2_pqeKk2I5M1dojpatmS7si4ULTw9ji0ld8laNu_n05T4MEgM-U0Becv09jg2x11hgw3Mji2igHDOS79uchuPlyd3q8%3D\">Nature journal last week</a> arguing the government was not following the science, which is not always set in stone, but it was \u201c\u2018survival of the ideas that fit\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>He told the Guardian: \u201cScience just isn\u2019t like that and so the idea that they were following the science was wrong.

Wherever there is an element of doubt, and if players feel that there are too many question marks, then we respect their decision.\u201d</p> <p>Watford have been one of the most outspoken clubs regarding plans to restart the Premier League in June. Deeney had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/19/pfa-asks-premier-league-to-research-covid-19s-impact-on-bame-players\" title=\"\">said he would not participate</a> in group training and over the weekend Pearson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/16/nigel-pearson-worried-about-fatality-if-premier-league-resumes\" title=\"\">raised concerns about the possibility of a coronavirus\u2011related death</a> in the league. \u201cI\u2019ve made my position very clear, in terms of what I think about the overall situation, but having said that my job still is to support the people I work alongside, and that\u2019s what I will do,\u201d Pearson said on Wednesday. \u201cOnce the decision had been made to restart it was very important that we try to create an environment in which the players feel safe.\u201d</p> <p>Watford, like other clubs, will decide whether to support the protocols designed to allow contact training once those are put forward. The government hopes to approve guidelines this week.</p> <p>Mariappa revealed he was the Watford player who tested positive for coronavirus but said he was asymptomatic and had not breached any guidelines. \u201cIt was a big surprise because I haven\u2019t really left the house, apart from some exercise and the odd walk with the kids,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/05/20/exclusive-adrian-mariappa-shocked-learn-positive-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">told the Telegraph</a>. \u201cI\u2019ve mainly just been homeschooling and keeping fit.

So it\u2019s about the probability with which you minimise that risk. Players should have the right to air their concerns and should be central to the process of evolving the rules to put them into action.\u201d</p> <p>Baer-Hoffmann endorsed Deeney\u2019s call for extra research into the effects of Covid-19 on black, Asian and minority ethnic people and added: \u201cWe have heard from multiple players [across Europe\u2019s top leagues] that they are being pressured. We\u2019ve also heard that players did not feel appropriately involved in developing these protocols. In Germany the players have not been part of the process, frankly at all. Let\u2019s also be honest, a lot of players do want to return and are happy that football is finding a way back but, of course, not in any circumstance.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Amid the pandemic, the great issues of the day are inescapably immediate and health-centred. But eyes will lift eventually, and as that happens we will notice how the wider world has already changed as a result of Covid-19. A lot of the speculation about the post-coronavirus political world is plain fanciful. But there was a gripping reminder this week about one effect that is now more real than ever: the pandemic\u2019s role in boosting the global heft of China.</p> \n<p>The rise of China is of course not new. In some Chinese perspectives, it goes back centuries. Even from a western viewpoint it was already well advanced before the pandemic. But when the Obama administration\u2019s US ambassador to the United Nations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/07/samantha-power-former-us-ambassador-un-interview\">Samantha Power, </a>was <a href=\"https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c56cb6a6-8d09-462a-84e3-b668ecdeb54c\">asked this week by the Commons foreign affairs committee</a> to assess Covid-19\u2019s impact on the global order, she turned first and without hesitation to China\u2019s rise.</p> \n<p>Covid-19, said Power in her evidence, has accelerated all the trends. The US is now decoupling decisively from China. The developing world, bound to China by the debt and dependency of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/26/belt-and-road-forum-xi-jinping-promises-transparency-to-ease-concerns\">belt and road\u201d strategies</a>, is in contrast binding more firmly to it. China\u2019s \u201cwolf-warrior\u201d diplomacy against states that criticise it is increasingly aggressive. Meanwhile, in the global forums, China is stepping in to fill the vacuum left by Donald Trump\u2019s US. Chinese president Xi Jinping, said Power, is now well on his way to supplanting the postwar order based on the western alliance with a new China-centred network.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3244f1ab-a9c6-4121-a57f-aff4fc353640\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wS_uXk9Pmbo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>For proof of this, look no further than what happened at the World Health Organization assembly in Geneva this week. On the one hand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/donald-trump-and-xi-jinping-meet-the-new-cold-warriors\">Trump spent the week slagging off the WHO</a>, threatening to withdraw all US funding, promoting quack medical remedies and attacking China. On the other, Xi addressed the assembly, donated $2bn to the WHO for the coronavirus battle, called for a vaccine to be made available to all, and successfully watered down the planned post-pandemic international investigation into Covid-19. Having done that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/why-has-china-slapped-tariffs-on-australian-barley-and-what-can-australia-do-about-it\">Xi slapped a punitive 80% tariff </a>on Australian barley to punish Canberra for pressing for a fuller, more independent Covid-19 probe. Stand by, if it takes place, for a similar Xi approach at the postponed Cop26 climate conference.</p> \n<p>As the world emerges from its coronavirus bunker, governments will discover a fast changing geopolitical landscape. It will be one in which the authoritarian pull exerted by China is now steadily outmuscling the democratic and rights-based push of what used to be the US-led western alliance. A potent catalyst for this has been Trump\u2019s unilateral retreat into American nativism. But, as Power pointed out, the authoritarian process can be measured in other ways too, including China\u2019s increasing use of cyber warfare against international Covid-19 critics, the more than 80 countries currently governed by emergency pandemic legislation and the upwards of 50 nations in which elections have been postponed, almost without debate.</p> \n<p>At this point, we must ask what role Britain should play in this new global order. That question lies behind Power\u2019s appearance at the Commons foreign affairs committee this week. It is examining the Johnson government\u2019s <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/225/the-fco-and-the-integrated-review/\">\u201cintegrated review\u201d </a>of Britain\u2019s foreign, defence, security and development policy, announced in February. This review was originally conceived as a root-and-branch recalibration of Britain\u2019s role in the world after Brexit. But it has now inescapably evolved into a review of the global post-coronavirus reset too.</p> \n<p>Covid-19 is obviously part of any explanation about why the China issue has become a lot more volatile and salient in British politics. It is only 10 years since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/05/tony-blair-a-journey-book-review\">Tony Blair </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/05/tony-blair-a-journey-book-review\">could write</a> that Britain should ensure that Europe, in partnership with America, should offer China a new global partnership. Every aspect of that proposition has now gone. Britain is no longer part of Europe. Europe is itself in existential difficulty. The US is no longer a partner. Meanwhile China has forged ahead on its own.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/12/us-message-to-britain-in-bilateral-trade-talks-its-us-or-china\">US message to Britain in bilateral trade talks: it's us \u2013 or China</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But it is not just the Blair approach that is long gone. In his own memoirs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/20/some-people-never-convince-david-cameron-reflects-brexit-legacy\">David Cameron explains how he advocated an economic \u201clong game\u201d with China </a>that would give Britain greater political leverage \u201cto bring China into the rules-based international system \u2013 through rules on trade, but also rules on climate change, terrorism and human rights.\u201d Cameron even took Xi for a pint in a pub near Chequers. But where, in the Trump era, is that rules-based system now? And where, post-Brexit, is Britain\u2019s leverage in that or any other global order?</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s Conservative party is struggling to find a plausible answer to this last question. Perhaps the integrated review will provide it. If so, it will need to come up with an extremely realistic containment strategy towards China. This would need to echo the approach \u2013 an alliance based on rules, values and engagement to face down the Soviet Union without tipping into nuclear war \u2013 that the American diplomat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/19/guardianobituaries.usa\">George Kennan</a> crafted in 1946, and which shaped US foreign policy for nearly half a century. Yet it would have to do it in the full knowledge that the UK is nowhere near as powerful as the US was in the postwar world, that the US has defected to isolationism, and that Brexit Britain is itself seen \u2013 and partly sees itself \u2013 as an alliance breaker.</p> \n<p>China in 2020 is not the USSR in 1946. But there is little sign that the Tory party is anywhere close to agreeing on the mature, long-term strategy on China that is needed. The cold war and Euroscepticism both cast long shadows. The bulk of newer Tory MPs, many of them active in the new China Research Group of MPs <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/tom-tugendhat-chairing-the-china-research-group-and-the-foreign-affairs-committee/\">chaired by the foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat,</a> now think about China as a threat but regard European allies as the past and thus lack any workable strategy for constraining Chinese power.</p> \n<p>Yet Covid-19 has made the question of how to stand up to China more pressing than before. The dilemmas are not restricted to the Tory party or to Britain. Labour has notably toughened its line, as its China spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/china-presents-itself-as-rival-to-democracy-and-plays-uk-says-labour-stephen-kinnock\">Stephen Kinnock </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/china-presents-itself-as-rival-to-democracy-and-plays-uk-says-labour-stephen-kinnock\">made clear this week</a>. But no single nation state, even the US, can stand up to China and its authoritarian model without alliances, without patient deployment of hard and soft power, and without a readiness to make tactical compromises.</p> \n<p>The answer for a medium-sized power like Britain is to have an alliance-based and institutions-based containment strategy and to work with Germany, France, the EU, India, Australia and others to achieve a relationship with China that rejects both Chinese and American bullying. The problem is that this is the one thing that this government, besotted with its self-image of Britain as an independent, buccaneering world player, cannot bring itself to do.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist</p>",

He was as happy as anything there.\u201d</p> <p>The farm is the base of the Bufalina Soap Company, which makes a range of scented soap. The company says on its website: \u201cWe make our soap with the milk from our herd of Mediterranean water buffalo, located in the Welsh Marches.</p> <p>\u201cAround the world this buffalo breed is famous for its dairy products such as mozzarella, gelato and ice cream. The richness of the milk makes it ideal for making a creamy, luxurious and gentle soap.\u201d</p> <p>The buffalo was put down.</p>",
  "<p>We haven\u2019t seen much of Boris Johnson over the past week. In fact we haven\u2019t seen him at all; not even for a single Downing Street press conference. Far too much like hard work. He\u2019s even making the notoriously lazy David Cameron look industrious by comparison. And Dave wasn\u2019t prime minister during the worst global health crisis in 100 years.</p> \n<p>Now, though, things have become a little clearer. In between taking Dilyn for a walk in the park and avoiding changing his baby\u2019s nappies, Boris has been breaking the habit of a lifetime by actually doing some preparation. After two weeks of humiliation at the despatch box during prime minister\u2019s questions, Boris had been taking lessons in how not to appear like a total car crash in front of a top QC.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82beeb58-e861-4575-90dd-2b879d1a3a65\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic</a>&nbsp;like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The message that Boris appeared to have been given was for him to be more himself. The downside to this, though, is that the real Boris is actually rather unpleasant. The popular, fun-loving image has only ever been a veneer. Deep down, Boris is needy and insecure. Character traits that he hates in himself and finds impossible to accept, so his first instinct when cornered is to lash out. So that was the Boris we got at this week\u2019s PMQs. Pugnacious, ungracious, blustering, and not totally coherent.</p> \n<p>For the extra Tory backbenchers who had been bussed in for the occasion \u2013 the party high command feel Boris performs best when there is a home audience \u2013 this was an undoubted improvement on what had gone before when only a surly incompetence had been on view. But it was still a long way short of what most people in the country would have wanted from their leader at such a time. Even when he is being himself, Boris just isn\u2019t that good when up against someone like Keir Starmer, who is used to building a case based on the evidence.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader began on care homes. How did the government square its insistence that it had \u201cthrown a protective ring around care homes\u201d with the evidence given to the health select committee by the chief executive of Care England that countless patients had been booted out of hospital without any testing for the coronavirus?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAs he knows full well, er, the, er, dist \u2026 \u201d Boris began, struggling to complete a meaningful sentence.

But just as it seemed the prime minister was reverting to one of his other default settings of winging it, he glanced at his notes for a better line of attack.</p> \n<p>Aha, he said. No one had been released into care homes without a clinician signing them out. Here we got a first view of the government\u2019s defence in the coming public inquiry. The government had never intended the wrong people to be released from hospitals and if they had been, then it was all down to doctor error. In five years\u2019 time it will turn out that all the excess care home deaths were down to one doctor who has also conveniently died of the coronavirus, and nothing to do with any decisions the government had made.</p> \n<p>There were times during the following exchanges when Starmer appeared rather unsettled by this new bullish, sollipsistic Boris \u2013 it was the height of cheek to accuse Starmer of feigning ignorance, when the prime minister was so busy feigning intelligence. At one point Matt Hancock started joining in \u2013 \u201cand you bought your mum a \u00a310m donkey sanctuary, so there\u201d \u2013 before the Speaker invited him to either shut up or sod off. Matt slumped into a five-year-old\u2019s strop and stared angrily at the ground.</p> \n<p>Not that Boris appeared particularly grateful for the health secretary\u2019s intervention \u2013 he dislikes toadies as much as those who stand up to him \u2013 as he promptly threw him under a bus by insisting that the test and trace programme would be fully operational by 1 June. There was no word on whether Matt\u2019s App would also be up and running, but given that the government has missed almost every deadline it has set for itself \u2013 and lied about the ones it has met \u2013 no one was holding their breath. Boris had yet again set himself and his health secretary up to fail.</p> \n<p>Although Starmer wasn\u2019t getting things all his own way, there was no doubt he was still getting the better of every argument. There\u2019s something about the poise and command of the Labour leader that seems to get under the prime minister\u2019s skin. As if he knows that he will never come close to having his integrity or intellect. At one point Boris nearly lost it completely by demanding that Keir stop being so negative. How about some applause for the people who hadn\u2019t died?</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but 34,000 dead is negative,\u201d Starmer observed. Especially as the real figure was north of 50,000, many of which were totally avoidable.</p> \n<p>One could forgive a lot if Boris was even able to come close to an apology, but now he can\u2019t even admit that there is a correlation between an effective test-and-trace system and a further easing of lockdown measures. There again, he can\u2019t bring himself to say how many children he has, so what hope is there?</p> \n<p>It was with the last two questions that Starmer left Boris hopelessly exposed. How did the government justify <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/19/uk-government-urged-to-scrap-624-nhs-charge-for-migrant-care-workers-helping-combat-coronavirus\">the \u00a3624 visa surcharge on so many overseas workers</a> who had done so much to keep the NHS running more or less smoothly?</p> \n<p>Boris merely shrugged. They were a useful source of revenue. Besides, they were lucky to have a job in which some of them could say they had been able to save the life of the prime minister. Put that way, Luis and Jenny should have been thanking him for fleecing them for more cash rather than the other way round. Such is his narcissism, Boris had no idea how petty and spiteful he sounded.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The rest of PMQs was something of a non-event. Boris had clearly come prepared to see off Keir and only had bog-standard, drivel-strewn non-answers for everyone else. He left the chamber with a swagger. Before he had twice lost on a knockout; now he had just been comprehensively outclassed on points. And back in Downing Street, Classic Dom would be telling him that was another overwhelming victory.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022</em> This article was amended on 21 May 2020 to correct the figure for the NHS surcharge levied on migrant workers from outside the European Economic Area.</p>",

  "<h2>No change: councils where no maintained schools are likely to meet the 1 June deadline</h2> \n<p>\u2022 <strong>Sunderland city council</strong> said there was \u201cno rush\u201d to open up schools further on 1 June given the relatively local high rate of Covid-19 infections. The council leader, Graeme Millar, said: \u201cOur stance is clear, we cannot expect teachers \u2013 or children \u2013 to be in a school environment in Sunderland unless they know that it is safe for them, and there are serious question marks about that presently, based on the localised health picture in the north-east.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 <strong>Liverpool </strong><strong>city </strong><strong>council</strong> suggested risk assessment work would begin only after half-term and that it was unlikely schools would be ready before the <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/every-merseyside-council-stands-schools-18278974\">middle of June</a>. \u201cWe will only support the schools reopening when we are satisfied that it is safe to do so,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <strong>Sefton council</strong> in Merseyside said schools were <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/every-merseyside-council-stands-schools-18278974\">unlikely to be ready</a> before 15 June. \u201cWe therefore do not expect childcare providers or schools to adhere to government guidance in terms of timescales, or the suggested year groups, if they judge this not to be in the best interest of children.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 <strong>Solihull council</strong>, in the West Midlands, said its schools would <a href=\"https://www.solihull.gov.uk/news/ArtMID/820/ArticleID/2939/19-May-Message-from-Councillor-Ian-Courts-Leader-of-Solihull-Council\">not be ready</a> by the government\u2019s deadline: \u201cThe government has the ambition of a 1 June return, but the reality in Solihull is that schools will need to use that first week in June to ensure they are completely ready for more pupils to attend.

  "<p>Two British startups have announced plans to invest as much as \u00a34bn in building the UK\u2019s first large-scale battery factory, in a move that could prove a major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/07/uk-car-industry-future-hinges-not-on-brexit-but-on-batteries\">boost to the country\u2019s struggling car industry</a>.</p> <p>AMTE Power and Britishvolt have signed a memorandum of understanding saying they will work together on plans for a plant to make lithium ion batteries, the key component in electric cars as well as energy storage products.</p> <p>Lars Carlstrom, the chief executive of Britishvolt, said the companies had an ambition to build facilities producing batteries with capacity of as much as 30 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year, which would be roughly equivalent to the joint Tesla-Panasonic Gigafactory in Nevada. A factory of that size would create as many as 4,000 jobs, he said.</p> <p>The global automotive industry is racing to secure supplies of lithium ion batteries as manufacturers seek to meet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/25/2020-set-to-be-year-of-the-electric-car-say-industry-analysts\">growing demand for electric cars</a> as well as government regulations that limit carbon dioxide exhaust emissions.</p> <p>However, the lack of large-scale battery manufacturing facilities in the UK has raised fears over the future of the country\u2019s automotive industry, including from the Jaguar Land Rover boss, Ralf Speth. Transport costs mean that securing a battery supply close to car assembly plants is attractive for carmakers.</p> <p>The government-backed Faraday Institution estimates 130 GWh of annual capacity will be required by 2040 if the UK is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/not-investing-in-electric-car-battery-production-could-cost-uk-105000-jobs-study\">retain a large automotive sector</a>.</p> <p>The UK recently lost out on a major investment in battery production by Tesla. Elon Musk, the US electric carmaker\u2019s chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/13/tesla-cites-brexit-as-germany-chosen-over-uk-for-european-plant-elon-musk\">blamed Brexit uncertainty</a> for his decision to choose Berlin over a British location. Other battery producers such as Sweden\u2019s Northvolt, South Korea\u2019s LG Chem and China\u2019s CATL have built factories in EU countries.</p> <p>Carlstrom said the UK\u2019s struggles with Brexit had provided an opportunity for the company to approach the market, with other companies unwilling to invest despite the expected demand for batteries from UK car factories.</p> <p>European and UK carmakers have tended to import battery cells, which are then assembled into packs to go in cars, from China and South Korea. However, carmakers such as the Vauxhall owner, Peugeot, have recognised an increasing need to secure a supply of cells closer to home.</p> <p>Securing investment in a UK gigafactory has been a top priority for the government\u2019s automotive industry officials. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/12/car-research-low-carbon-engines\">government-backed Advanced Propulsion Centre</a> orchestrated the tie-up between two startups.</p> <p>AMTE Power, which was founded in 2013, already runs a small facility in Thurso, northern Scotland, and is looking at sites in Teesside and Dundee for a larger plant capable of 1GWh a year. AMTE, led by the chief executive, Kevin Brundish, focuses on specialist markets such as high-performance cars.</p> <p>Britishvolt is looking at five locations for a larger plant with an annual capacity of 10GWh of batteries aimed at mass-market cars, with the possibility of adding another 20GWh after that. Britishvolt expects to raise the first \u00a31.2bn of funds in the next year, after receiving initial backing from Scandinavian and Middle Eastern investors.</p> <p>The company is confident it can raise funds despite the looming coronavirus recession, as investors look for green investment opportunities. Later stages of building could focus on different technologies, such as solid-state batteries, as development continues.</p>",

  "<p>Many terrible crimes have been perpetrated in Afghanistan\u2019s 42 years of war. Yet the attack on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/gunmen-attack-kabul-hospital-used-by-medecins-sans-frontieres\">maternity wing</a> of a Kabul hospital on 12 May was unprecedented and particularly devastating. Even in a country where bloodshed has become grimly familiar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/mothers-in-labour-pregnant-women-and-babies-were-kabul-gunmens-target-msf\">this attack</a> was unbearable.</p> <p>The gunmen had passed through general wards to kill mothers: women who were pregnant, giving birth or with their newborns. They killed 24 people; apart from one midwife and two babies, all were mothers. The footage of one tiny baby wrapped in a blood-drenched blanket carried out during the four hour-long attack seemed to symbolise the despair felt by many: a child born in Afghanistan can barely draw breath before war engulfs her.</p> <p>Who carried out the attack is still unknown. The hospital is in a neighbourhood where most people are Shia Muslim from the ethnic Hazara community. That would suggest the assault was the work of the local franchise of the Islamic State group, ISKP. It has carried out many grisly, sectarian attacks on civilians in the past, whereas the Taliban have not.</p> <p>ISKP has not put its name to this transgression, however, and the Taliban were quick to deny responsibility. Yet, suspicion against the latter movement or elements within it lingers. The Taliban\u2019s understanding of <a href=\"http://alemarahenglish.com/?p=34192\">the agreement</a> they signed with the United States on 29 February was that they would not carry out attacks on cities. However, if the movement had wanted to continue carrying out major acts of urban terrorism \u2013 useful militarily for demoralising the population and spreading chaos within government \u2013 what could be more deniable than an attack that was this savage and this sectarian?</p> <p>Whoever carried out the attack,<strong> </strong>the anguish people felt over this particular act of butchery was heightened by the fact that it came in the middle of a \u201cpeace process\u201d initiated by Washington, which has so far brought political dividends for the administration of Donald Trump but little protection for Afghan civilians.</p> <p>America\u2019s agreement with the Taliban was supposed to usher in talks between the insurgent movement and other Afghans. It followed eight days when all parties to the conflict, including the Taliban, had reduced violence markedly. The US thought it also had an unwritten understanding that violence would remain at low levels. Yet on 2 March the Taliban spokesman, <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200302-taliban-say-will-resume-operations-against-afghan-forces\">Zabihullah Mujahid, announced</a> an end to the temporary respite: \u201cAs per the agreement, our mujahideen will not attack foreign forces but our operations will continue against the Kabul administration forces.\u201d</p> <p>It has been a strange time, when the leaders of a \u201cjihad\u201d hold their fire against foreign forces while targeting their fellow Afghans and fellow Muslims during a pandemic and, in the last three weeks, during Ramadan.</p> <p>Since the March announcement, the Taliban have turned down repeated requests for a ceasefire or at least a reduction in violence. At first, Afghan government forces and the US military acted with restraint, even as the Taliban ramped up their attacks. Research in late March and early April by my organisation, Afghanistan Analysts Network, found people in some areas controlled by the Taliban describing continuing peace.</p> <p>One elder in Logar, a province to the south of Kabul, said that before the deal, people had been taking sleeping pills just to get some rest. \u201cThey were afraid of night raids by the government and Taliban attacks during the day.\u201d Since the US agreement, he said, people were happy, busy and able to return to their fields and get on with their lives.</p> <p>By contrast, we found people in other contested areas of the country in despair as bloodshed swiftly resumed. \u201cIt\u2019s only the Taliban that are attacking,\u201d a local journalist in Badghis province, in the north-east, said. \u201cCorona is one disaster and Taliban attacks another.\u201d</p> <p>In mid-March, the government did order a shift of stance from \u201cdefensive\u201d to \u201cactive defensive\u201d. Civilians are again being killed and injured by both the Taliban and government forces, <a href=\"https://unama.unmissions.org/rising-civilian-casualty-numbers-highlight-urgent-need-halt-fighting-and-re-focus-peace-negotiations\">according to the United Nations</a>, in greater numbers last month than in April 2019.</p> <p>The US military is still far less active than it was. Provisional data from the UN <a href=\"https://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/unama_protection_of_civilians_in_armed_conflict_-_2020_first_quarter_report_english_0.pdf\">for the first quarter of the year</a> suggests the number of civilians killed or injured by US forces has fallen to zero since the February agreement.</p> <p>Meanwhile the withdrawal of US troops \u2013 from about 13,000 to 8,600 \u2013 and the abandonment of five military bases are on track to be completed by mid-July.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/19/afghan-kabul-hospital-attack-i-thought-my-baby-had-died-and-i-would-be-next\">Afghan hospital attack: 'I thought my baby had died and I would be next'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kabul does at least now have a recognised leader, following disputed elections in September and parallel presidential inaugurations by the two frontrunners in March. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/16/afghan-rivals-power-sharing-deal-would-promote-official-accused-of-and-torture\">power-sharing deal</a>, signed on Sunday, leaves President Ashraf Ghani in place. As soon as it was agreed, the US envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, left for the region to press the government and the Taliban to start talks.</p> <p>It is possible, indeed common, for parties to a conflict to talk and fight during a peace process. However, when that happens, there must be a serious intention to reach a negotiated end to the war. Doubt hovers over whether the Taliban really do want to negotiate. Since 29 February, there has been little to suggest they aim to replace fighting with talking, despite US government claims.</p> <p>Instead, it seems plausible that the Taliban see the US agreement as a means of removing their most dangerous enemy from the battlefield, leaving Kabul open and vulnerable. Unfortunately, Washington has no plan B if the Taliban do not actually want to negotiate with their fellow Afghans. The US approach relies on the Taliban\u2019s good intentions.</p> <p>The continuing Taliban insurgency is also the \u201csea\u201d in which other groups swim. Even if the hospital attack was not carried out by the Taliban,<strong> </strong> their continuing campaign of violence still makes such an atrocity easier to mount. If they had agreed to a mutual reduction in violence, Afghan intelligence would have been less tied up, and the Taliban themselves might have had a good chance of uncovering and preventing the attack. But this was not the case.</p> <p>In this bloody spring, the one flicker of hope for civilians is that not every Taliban field commander enthusiastically returned to the fight in March; some did hope the negotiations would succeed. In more than one district, locals described to us commanders sitting down to talk to elders about their hopes for peace. However, one Afghan aid worker in the south warned that Taliban members hungry for peace in his district would still obey the leadership; if it did not order them to lay down arms, he said, \u201cthey cannot stop fighting\u201d.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Taliban launched a major offensive against the northern city of Kunduz, as they have done most years since 2015, when they briefly captured it. The Afghan government responded with an airstrike on an NGO clinic that was treating wounded Taliban fighters alongside civilian patients. Medical facilities, staff and patients are specifically protected by the Geneva conventions and international humanitarian law.<br><br>The horrible fear is that the US-initiated peace process will prove a chimera, the conflict between Afghan forces will intensify as American troops withdraw, and neither the Taliban nor the government will spare civilians.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Kate Clark is a co-director of the <a href=\"https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/en/\">Afghanistan Analysts Network</a>, a Kabul-based research organisation, and has worked on or in Afghanistan for 20 years<br></p>",

When kids miss their friends, that loneliness might express itself as anger, anxiety and sleep problems.</p> <p>This is where technology can be your child\u2019s best friend. \u201cFriendships help keep children as strong, resilient, happy and relaxed as possible. Having the online companionship of friends provides the support they need in lockdown and will be important too when they return to a strange and unsettling new school environment after it ends,\u201d says psychotherapist Alicia Eaton, author of First Aid for Your Child\u2019s Mind.</p> <p>\u201cStrong friendships will help them go back to school feeling able to cope with any challenges.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s how to help your child connect with their mates, whatever their age.</p> <h2>Age six and under</h2> <p>Some children, particularly as they get older, are happy to share their thoughts and emotions on video calls via WhatsApp, FaceTime or even Zoom, but with the under-sixes online communication should be less verbal and more visual, says Eaton. \u201cIf your five-year-old has been given a birthday gift, and you say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s FaceTime and say thank you,\u2019 they tend to freeze as they\u2019re not great at communicating in that way.\u201d</p> <p>So instead of calling friends just for a chat, try giving your child and their pals activities to share over a video call, such as playing Top Trumps (the physical cards may work better than the app version). Scavenger hunts also work well, so give each child an illustrated list of simple things to find and tick off \u2013 a fork, something yellow, a book with a picture of an animal on the cover. Your child is likely to bond better with smaller groups of, say, two to four, as they\u2019re less likely to talk over each other and end up with nobody knowing what\u2019s going on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/may/20/from-greece-to-thailand-take-your-family-on-holiday-without-leaving-home\">From Greece to Thailand: take your family on holiday without leaving home</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Age seven to 12</h2> <p>This is the age when kids\u2019 friendships become all-consuming, yet they can still be very fickle. \u201cRemember when you went back to school after the summer holidays, and all of a sudden, your best friend wasn\u2019t your best friend any more because they had buddied up with someone else over the holidays,\u201d says Eaton. The right tech can help your child keep up the friendships they really care about.</p> <p>Eaton suggests organising smaller Zoom meet-ups rather than inviting your child\u2019s entire class as there\u2019s less chance of your child getting camera shy and they\u2019ll be more likely to join in with the conversation. Also, take advantage of online games and platforms, such as Minecraft and Roblox, which allow friends to gather in a virtual world, playing and chatting at the same time.</p> <p>With all that, you may be worrying about screen time. \u201cFocus on quality over quantity when it comes to screen time,\u201d says Eaton. \u201cThis should avoid unnecessary arguments, give you a break and allow your children to make the most of the tech they have at home.\u201d</p> <h2>Teenagers</h2> <p>The growing independence of teens gives them a wider choice of ways to maintain communication independently, with messaging and video calls topping the bill. On video chats, playing with the look of the screen becomes a key part of the conversation.

  "<p>A larger proportion of Americans have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/us-unemployment-jobless-coronavirus-economy\">lost their jobs</a> during this pandemic than at any time since the Great Depression.<strong> </strong>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/uk-jobless-april-coronavirus-crisis-unemployment-benefits\">unemployment increased</a> to 2.1 million in April, and economists expect millions more people to become unemployed<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/uk-furlough-scheme-unemployment-rise-coronavirus\">once the furlough scheme ends</a>. The current, acute crisis in unemployment is likely to become a chronic condition that, even if it waxes and wanes, will not remedy itself. Like the Great Depression, it demands intervention not only to resume trade and employment, but also to preserve the institutions we cherish.</p> <p>The virus will not simply evaporate; many of the jobs that used to exist have already gone, and more will go still. We will have to feel our way to reviving industries in a world altered by fear of contagion. People will want to avoid human contact to a greater degree than ever before, accelerating existing trends toward greater automation and socially distanced work. Economic busts generally foster market consolidation, as bigger operators weather a storm that swamps smaller enterprises. These effects have an inequitable impact, hurting the poor far more than the rich, demonstrating the cruel effects of inept or inactive governments. For all the clamour that the economy is in peril, what remains of democracy is in far greater danger of perishing from this new depression without some form of new New Deal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hoover ran for re-election in 1932, claiming his policies had ended the depression and urging voters to be grateful to him. They chose Roosevelt</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The United States tried denial as its first response to the Great Depression of the early 20th century. In 1929, President Herbert Hoover said: \u201cAny lack of confidence in the economic future or the basic strength of business in the United States is foolish.\u201d When his scolding failed, Hoover insisted that government could do nothing to alleviate the crisis. \u201cEconomic depression can not be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Soaring unemployment finally provoked political action<em><strong>.</strong></em> Hoover allowed a federal public works programme that provided, he noted with satisfaction, sustenance to some 700,000 Americans and their families; at the time, about seven million remained unemployed. Hoover ran for re-election in 1932, claiming his policies had ended the depression and urging voters to be grateful to him: \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful for the presence in Washington of a Republican administration.\u201d He pledged a balanced budget, higher tariffs and tighter monetary policy. Unpersuaded, voters chose Franklin D Roosevelt. <br><br>Roosevelt promised public works and jobs, labour rights, and a transition to more sustainable practices of production. He acknowledged that he, too, would like a balanced budget \u2013 once the nation had spent the necessary amount to end the depression. He espoused \u201cthe philosophy of social justice\u201d, rejecting \u201ctrickle down\u201d prosperity and preferring instead to \u201cmake the average of mankind comfortable and secure [so] their prosperity will rise upward, just as yeast rises up\u201d.<br><br>Taking office in March 1933, with more than ten million unemployed, Roosevelt and Democratic majorities in Congress delivered looser monetary policy, price support for agriculture, union rights and billions of dollars for public works and employment. Economic recovery began immediately and continued thereafter, with rapid growth that nevertheless took years to make up ground lost during the Hoover years.<br><br>It took several tries to get the jobs programme going. First, the Roosevelt administration bankrolled projects to be managed at the local level. But major works required advance planning, and by the end of summer 1933, only 250,000 Americans had jobs on such projects. Some smaller works did get under way, but letting local governments run them meant there were inequities in working conditions and wages, along with varying degrees of managerial competence.<br><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"423defdb18168a907bfc753e73c32a127cc589d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/423defdb18168a907bfc753e73c32a127cc589d9/0_14_5019_3013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unemployed men queuing fat a soup kitchen run by the Bahai Fellowship at 203 East 9th Street, New York, circa 1930.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unemployed men queuing fat a soup kitchen run by the Bahai Fellowship at 203 East 9th Street, New York, circa 1930.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FPG/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually the Roosevelt administration decided to hire workers itself, on projects of all kinds in all states and territories. Mandating eight-hour days and 40-hour weeks, calibrating wages to assure a decent standard of living, and barring child labour, the public works programmes set national expectations for working conditions. Racial discrimination on the works was prohibited first by rule and then by law; the public works programmes gave black Americans unprecedented economic opportunities, even in an age of continued segregation.<br><br>Mostly, the workers were builders. They installed or improved more than half a million miles of roads. They built schools, parks, libraries, post offices, seaports and airports; bridges and hydroelectric dams; stadiums and theatres and \u2014 humble but vital \u2013 sidewalks. They brought power \u2013 electrical, to be sure, but with it political and symbolic \u2013 to people and parts of the country that never had it before.<br><br></p> <p>Even with three to four million workers at once on its payroll, Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was still too small: as many more citizens remained unemployed. To dispel the depression, the New Deal should have grown bigger, sooner. Washington remained fearful of spending the necessary sums until after the war. But economic recovery was not the New Deal\u2019s only aim.<br><br>The depression had brought self-government into global disrepute. The apparent incapacity or unwillingness of elected officials eroded faith in representative government and emboldened dictators. Roosevelt wanted the New Deal public works programmes to prove that democracy worked, and for everyone.

The New Deal was the biggest peacetime expression of national purpose in American history. New Deal art reflected this notion. Writers and artists documented the memories of formerly enslaved people, the music of rural folks and the lives of workers in factory and field, and by making art out of them acknowledged their importance. This version of democracy, built on the interdependence of a variety of peoples, became Roosevelt\u2019s vision for the United Nations.<br><br></p> <p>During this pandemic, sheltering in place \u2013 or staying at home \u2013 has robbed us of the common spaces that were vital to the New Deal\u2019s cultural programme. We cannot congregate in theatres or stadiums, or even stop to chat in the street. Yet our interdependence is no less real for its intangibility. We should remember that cornerstone of the New Deal.</p> <p>We can learn, too, from New Dealers\u2019 commitment to providing people not only with a social safety net but with jobs to lift them out of unemployment. We might also take as a model the New Deal programme of public works that modernised the economy and adapted it to the world that was then new; advocates for a global \u201cgreen new deal\u201d have long contended that we need a new infrastructure to prepare ourselves for a more sustainable way of life.</p> <p>We might also learn from the New Deal\u2019s deficiencies. We should be bold, going bigger sooner and erring on the side of too much rather than too little, and uncompromising in seeking equity. And we should remember that the purpose of a jobs programme is not only to provide economic stimulus, but also the dignity of work at a decent wage under good conditions to all who can do it, and moreover to remind us that, should enough of us choose it, we can prove that democracy works.</p> <p>\u2022 Eric Rauchway is distinguished professor of history at the University of California, Davis.

  "<p>Reality TV may be one of the few winners during the coronavirus pandemic. MasterChef reached record viewing figures of 7.9 million at the end of last month, while Britain\u2019s Got Talent had its best series launch since 2017 with 8.2 million viewers. Last year, the show\u2019s figures slumped to an all-time low.</p> <p>At first, reality TV served as a means of escapism: a throwback to the good old days, when seeing singletons swap spit on an island turned your stomach for reasons unrelated to anxiety about the R-rate. Now, however, we are all cooped up indoors, just like the contestants, and reality TV can be enjoyed through a different lens.</p> <p>Many have noted a newfound understanding for what once seemed like disproportionate aggression from Pooja, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azsJnaYknPw\">meme-worthy contestant</a> on Bigg Boss (the Indian version of the Celebrity Big Brother). The daily tearful breakdowns of Big Brother UK\u2019s season seven contestant <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rfi8ZoM5jk\">Nikki Grahame seem slightly less unreasonable</a>. Although the forced celibacy of Too Hot To Handle at first felt too close to home, some viewers revelled in seeing their current reality reflected on screen. Others have opted to rewatch the Netflix hit Love is Blind with this fresh perspective, courtesy of our very own \u201cpods\u201d. Most days we are just one draining Zoom call away from a full-on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NULMhnfctJk\">Megan McKenna</a> Celebrity Big Brother style meltdown, in the makeshift diary room of Instagram stories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"034781b033057b32b9f6481e2a824165afe268e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/034781b033057b32b9f6481e2a824165afe268e2/72_1_1469_882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nikki Grahame crying on Big Brother\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We\u2019ve all felt a little bit like Nikki Grahame at some point during this pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While other TV genres are acclimatising at a snail\u2019s pace, reality television has already begun to adapt to the new normal. What could serve as better fodder for drama than a global pandemic? The 90 Day Fiance franchise has capitalised by launching a quarantine special mini-series, following the lives of the show\u2019s many dysfunctional couples, whose communication issues have been compounded by lockdown. ITV\u2019s Gemma Collins: Diva Forever show was restyled as Diva on Lockdown, which is already rivalling her equally dramatic stint on Celebrity Big Brother. There have even been whisperings of a quarantine edition of The Bachelor as regular filming of the series remains on hold.</p> <p>These attempts have not all been a success. The follow-up to the Tiger King documentary, made on FaceTime, fell flat, as did the Too Hot To Handle reunion, which was similarly done via video interview. Although it hasn\u2019t yet aired, the finale to the beleaguered series 12 of Drag Race will go ahead with a lip sync competition recorded over Zoom \u2013 a move that has been met with near universal disappointment.</p> <p>But in the same way that physical distance emboldens online trolls, many cast members of these shows have taken advantage of the fact that the showdowns are no longer face-to-face to let rip. The Real Housewives of Atlanta\u2019s socially distanced reunion was the show\u2019s most explosive episode yet and the 90 Day Fiance\u2019s tell-all looks set to be equally sparky: uncut footage of the episode has already been leaked and gone viral.</p> <p>It is rare for even the biggest of world events to intervene in reality TV like this. Earlier this year, when Love Island presenter Caroline Flack died, viewers rightly questioned the ethics of ITV\u2019s decision not to inform the cast and its choice to continue filming as if nothing had happened. When the 9/11 attacks took place, the finalists of Big Brother 2 were informed, primarily because one of the contestant\u2019s cousins was listed as missing in the World Trade Center collapse. But, for better or worse, producers have chosen to weave Covid-19 into programmes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9a545959b8260300f7c4311f182a0f3045f7b60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9a545959b8260300f7c4311f182a0f3045f7b60/319_0_2243_1347/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger King\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tiger King reunion fell flat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The German, Swedish, Canadian and Brazilian versions of Big Brother had all begun before the pandemic and housemates were informed of it live on television. After doing so, interest in the series in Brazil skyrocketed: the season was extended by four days due to its popularity and a record-breaking 1.5bn votes were cast on the 10th eviction night at the end of March (viewers are allowed to vote multiple times). The episode had a viewing share of 55% in Rio de Janeiro and 51% in S\u00e3o Paulo. That\u2019s not surprising; although Towie is something I watch out of habit, as opposed to any great interest, I would kill to see what Chloe Sims is getting up to in a quarantine-themed series of the show.</p> <p>So much of reality TV requires a suspension of reality; these programmes exist in an alternate timeline where the day\u2019s biggest issues are usually who got off with whom the night before. Era-defining events such as the election of Donald Trump or the Brexit referendum are barely referenced, in order to maintain an hour or so of fantasy. But there has been strange comfort in seeing how cast members are grappling with lockdown in these various parallel universes. In most cases, it turns out that reality stars are just like us \u2013 mindlessly ordering crap in bulk from Amazon to cope with the apocalypse and arguing with whoever they can get within shouting distance of.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>The job retention or<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/uk-unemployment-rate-furlough-jobs-market\"> furlough scheme</a>, created by the government, business representatives and trade unions working together, has had no parallel in UK history. It has kept six million people in work, and backfilled seven and a half million jobs. Without it, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e2c0615-f2af-4885-a9bf-78deeb94bc80\">one in three businesses</a> say they would have had to lay off staff; and many workers would have felt compelled to try to continue to work, despite public health guidance requiring them not to.</p> <p>No one imagines that the scheme can continue in its present form indefinitely. While a worthwhile investment to support the economy and ensure millions aren\u2019t without a wage, it is a very costly scheme. It is also inflexible, requiring workers to completely remove themselves from work. And the \u201cmissing\u201d 20% of earnings for those who have been furloughed has pushed many below even the minimum wage.</p> <p>So the question is not whether the furlough scheme should change, but what that change should look like \u2013 especially in a context where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/17/britain-is-at-risk-of-returning-to-80s-levels-of-unemployment\">unemployment is heading up to at least 9%</a>.</p> <p>The chancellor has been slow to take decisions in this area. Since the beginning of the scheme, we have urged him to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/rishi-sunak-coronavirus-rescue-plan-labour-britain-economy\"> allow part-time working</a> \u2013 but now learn that this will not be introduced until the start of August. This sets the UK scheme apart from those in continental Europe, which allow part-time working.</p> <p>Briefings to the press suggest that from the beginning of August, those covered by the scheme will need to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">their employer contribute 40% of their previous wage</a>, or support will be discontinued. If these rumours are correct, this again sets the UK\u2019s scheme apart from other countries, where support has often been linked to the lifting of the lockdown.</p> <p>The practical impact of a uniform employer contribution, in the absence of other forms of support for different sectors, is clear. By the time we get to 1 August, social distancing requirements may still be in place. While it is possible that some restaurants, for example, may be opening by then, they may well need to operate substantially under capacity in order to enforce social distancing. This could mean that the employer could not afford a 40% contribution, and would be forced to lay off staff. And as another example, many manufacturers may still have heavily disrupted supply chains, either in the UK or beyond, by then \u2013 again, preventing them from generating revenue sufficient to pay a 40% contribution. The implications are also clear for those staff who are furloughed because they are shielding for medical reasons, whose employers may no longer wish to support them.</p> <p>Adopting an identikit approach to all workers and all businesses from August neglects these challenges. Above all, it risks creating a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/17/britain-is-at-risk-of-returning-to-80s-levels-of-unemployment\">second, massive wave of unemployment</a>, at a time when the jobs market will be unable to absorb it. This is particularly the case given that jobs in hospitality, catering and tourism are often one of the first routes out of unemployment, especially for the young.</p> <p>A more differentiated approach would, admittedly, pose challenges for the government. Hard choices would need to be made, including how to deal with difficult boundary issues between sectors, timing problems in relation to changes in social distancing, and more conditionality on the scheme to ensure it genuinely support\u200bs employment.</p> <p>However, these political and administrative difficulties are just that \u2013 political and administrative. A far less tractable kind of difficulty would be how to aid those who might become long-term unemployed. \u200b</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/rwss/docs/2011/chapter2.pdf\">Studies following the previous recession</a> in the US indicated how those who became unemployed following the global financial crisis saw their future earnings permanently hampered as a result. The government has perhaps become blas\u00e9 about the impact of unemployment in the UK, given its comparatively low levels recently. However, it\u2019s arguable that a decade of sluggish growth in wages, coupled with above-average inflation, helped insulate us from unemployment \u2013 conditions that are unlikely to persist in this form into the future.</p> <p>Failing to engage with redesigning the furlough scheme, and opting instead for administratively \u201ceasy\u201d options, could leave our country with much higher unemployment, with all the human and economic costs that implies. These hard times require our government to be willing to face up to hard choices, and to show the courage to govern in the country\u2019s long-term interest.</p> <p>\u2022 Anneliese Dodds is the shadow chancellor of the exchequer</p>",
  "<p>Rolls-Royce is to cut 9,000 jobs, almost a fifth of its workforce, as the coronavirus crisis takes its toll on the aviation industry.</p> <p>The jet engine manufacturer said it was targeting \u00a31.3bn in annual cost savings to weather the protracted downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that has grounded much of the world\u2019s airlines. Head count cuts will account for about half the savings target.</p> <p>Derby-based Rolls-Royce, which employs 52,000 staff globally, said the job losses would be felt worst in its civil aerospace business, with about 8,000 of the 9,000 roles being made redundant coming from that division. The company also makes fighter jet and ship engines as well as reactors for nuclear submarines, but it said there would be no job losses at its defence business.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Rolls-Royce\u2019s chief executive, Warren East, indicated that the UK would be heavily affected. The group\u2019s civil aerospace division employs almost 16,000 people in the UK.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that of our civil aerospace business, approximately two-thirds of the total employees are in the UK at the moment and that\u2019s probably a good first proxy.\u201d</p> <p>In total, Rolls-Royce employs 23,700 staff in the UK, where nine of its approximately 17 main manufacturing locations are based.

  "<p>The journalists\u2019 union has blasted the Morrison government for exerting pressure on the ABC to embark on a six-month wage freeze, declaring the intervention by the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, threatens the national broadcaster\u2019s independence. </p> <p>The blast from the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance comes as Guardian Australia has learned the national broadcaster\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, told a staff meeting earlier this week senior executives would forgo their bonuses and \u201cat-risk\u201d payments this financial year because of the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>Anderson wrote to all ABC staff on Wednesday evening confirming that was his position, and also revealing that he had requested his salary be reduced by 5% in light of the pandemic and the budgetary pressure on the organisation.</p> <p>\u201cThe ABC decided in April that it was not appropriate in the current environment to pay bonuses to senior executives or any salary at-risk payments this financial year, and as managing director, I declined the 2% increase that would have been paid to me pursuant to the Remuneration Tribunal determination this July,\u201d Anderson\u2019s email said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/20/abc-must-freeze-wages-government-warns\">ABC must freeze wages, government warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI also requested (and had approved) that my salary be reduced by 5% from April until the end of September.

The public service commissioner followed up that directive by writing to all non-public service agencies \u2013 including the ABC \u2013 informing them the government expected them to adopt the same practice.</p> <p>The communications minister told Anderson in this week\u2019s letter the ABC embarking on a six-month wage pause would not only be consistent with the practice being applied across government agencies during the Covid-19 pandemic, it would also be a \u201chighly appropriate gesture of solidarity\u201d with journalists in commercial media who are facing pay cuts and the closure of their organisations because of a precipitous dive in advertising revenue.</p> <p>But Paul Murphy, the chief executive of the MEAA, declared on Wednesday that Fletcher had engaged in overreach.

  "<p><em> </em>In July 2017, William Perry Pendley, a crusading conservative attorney, delivered a speech to a group of rightwing activists in North Carolina in which he was completely candid about his ideological commitments.</p> <p>He accused \u201cthe media\u201d of selling \u201ctheir soul to the greens\u201d. <strong> </strong>And after criticizing the Endangered Species Act, he made light of killing endangered species.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why out west we say \u2018shoot, shovel and shut up\u2019 when it comes to the discovery of endangered species on your property,\u201d he said, according to an audio recording of the event obtained by the Guardian. \u201cAnd I have to say, as a lawyer, that\u2019s not legal advice,\u201d he added, as some in his audience quietly snickered at the reference to the illegal extermination, and the burial, of endangered animals.</p> <p>It has been almost three years since he gave those remarks, and Pendley is now the acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, a powerful agency that oversees more than 240m acres of federal land belonging to the American people, manages mineral resources and is required to comply with environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act.</p> <p>Pendley has helped turn BLM into what one high-level employee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, called \u201ca ghost ship\u201d in which \u201csuspicion\u201d, \u201cfear\u201d and \u201clow morale\u201d abound, despite the best efforts of career civil servants to support each other.</p> <p>As Pendley and his superiors at the interior department press ahead with an effort to move BLM\u2019s headquarters from Washington DC to Grand Junction, Colorado, the agency has hemorrhaged staff members and lost critical institutional memory, which many critics believe was the true purpose of the relocation effort all along.</p> <p>\u201cA skeleton crew is left\u201d at BLM headquarters, said the employee. \u201cSo few people were able to move west that a lot of people retired early and a lot of people took other jobs, so my ballpark estimate is there is only about 20% of permanent employees left\u201d at headquarters. As a result, the agency is failing to fulfill its most basic duties, like responding to public records requests and conducting oversight of state and regional operations, the staffer added.</p> <p>Environmental and government watchdog groups are now responding with a lawsuit that calls into question the legitimacy of Pendley\u2019s position. Last week a pair of environmental nonprofits sued the interior department, alleging that by repeatedly tapping Pendley as the BLM\u2019s acting director, rather than officially nominating him for the position, the interior secretary has skirted the Senate confirmation process usually required for high-level executive branch appointments, and has violated federal law. </p> <p>\u201cThe illegitimate Pendley appointment is particularly troublesome because he has forcibly moved the BLM Headquarters from Washington DC, to remote western Colorado,\u201d said Peter Jenkins, a senior counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, one of the groups that sued. \u201cIn doing so he uprooted the lives of scores of seasoned BLM staff and disrupted this already strained agency.\u201d</p> <p>An interior department spokesperson defended Pendley\u2019s record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cad7a5caa1502b7d37e1a714f03eb132adce28b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cad7a5caa1502b7d37e1a714f03eb132adce28b0/0_236_4988_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Trump administration rolled back key provisions of the Endangered Species Act, a law credited with saving the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly bear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Trump administration rolled back key provisions of the Endangered Species Act, a law credited with saving the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly bear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Bleier/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMr Pendley brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the department and is committed to carrying out the administration\u2019s priorities and achieving the BLM\u2019s \u2026 mission for the betterment of the American people,\u201d said Conner Swanson, the spokesperson. \u201cMr Pendley has provided a steady hand in facilitating important matters, from the BLM headquarters move west to its response to Covid-19.\u201d Swanson has said that the lawsuit against Pendley is \u201cbaseless\u201d.</p> <p>Pendley, a tall man with a handlebar mustache and a penchant for cowboy boots, has remarked in the past that his \u201cpersonal opinions are irrelevant\u201d to his job at BLM.</p> <p>\u201cI have a new job now. I\u2019m a zealous advocate for my client. My client is the American people and my bosses are the president of the United States and [interior] secretary [David] Bernhardt,\u201d Pendley said during an appearance at <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/william-perry-pendley-climate_n_5da0bcffe4b087efdbaddc0b\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/william-perry-pendley-climate_n_5da0bcffe4b087efdbaddc0b\">conference</a> of the Society of Environmental Journalists in Fort Collins, Colorado, last year. \u201cWhat I thought, what I wrote, what I did in the past is irrelevant. I have orders, I have laws to obey, and I intend to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Pendley has long opposed public lands and wildlife protections. After serving in the Reagan administration in the 1980s, he became the president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF), a conservative litigation organization funded by conservative and industry groups including the Charles Koch Foundation and Exxon Mobil, according to research from the watchdog groups Documented and Accountable.US.</p> <p>Under Pendley\u2019s leadership, the firm was a persistent foe of federal land agencies, getting involved in dozens of cases on behalf of industry groups and private landowners to challenge environmental protections implemented by the interior department. </p> <p>Pendley became something of a fixture among the anti-government set, writing numerous books extolling rebellion against public lands and the federal government. He has expressed sympathy in the past for the Bundy family, whose militant agitation against federal land ownership included the armed takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in 2016.</p> <p>He has compared climate change to unicorns because \u201cneither exist\u201d. And in a 2016 National Review <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/01/federal-government-should-sell-western-land-follow-constitution/\">article</a>, he laid out a case that argued for the near-total abolition of federal public lands across the nation.</p> <p>Given his long history of legal advocacy on behalf of extractive industries, Pendley brought with him a 17-page recusal list of past clients, employers and investments<strong> </strong>when he took control of the BLM in 2019. The list included groups such as the American Exploration &amp; Mining Association and the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. It has been nearly impossible for the public to know whether Pendley has abided by his recusal list, however, because the BLM has failed to release his detailed official calendar to the public.</p> <p>Though Pendley has long been a committed conservative, he has not always had kind words for Donald Trump. In a 2016 <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2016/06/13/trump-the-polar-opposite-of-reagan/\">op-ed</a> in the Daily Caller, for instance, he said then-candidate Trump \u201cis not fit to pull off Reagan\u2019s boots\u201d.</p> <p>Apart from Pendley\u2019s role in moving BLM\u2019s headquarters to Colorado, the agency under his leadership has also repeatedly proposed <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/04/18/blm-plan-western-colorado-public-land-drilling/\">land management plans</a> that heavily promote the <a href=\"https://missoulian.com/opinion/columnists/lets-stop-giving-oil-and-gas-control-of-public-lands/article_ea8c0d90-3af6-528c-9a88-bf040863059c.html\">energy industry</a>. In March, for instance, conservationists in Montana came out aggressively against a BLM resource management plan that they believe is far too friendly to corporate oil and gas interests, <a href=\"https://billingsgazette.com/lifestyles/recreation/conservationists-launch-fight-against-blms-management-plan-for-central-montana/article_dcdb3503-06a6-58a6-bedf-d396a8f56e1f.html\">according to</a> the Billings Gazette.</p> <p>In a statement issued earlier this year, Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva, the chairman of the House natural resources committee, expressed his concerns over Pendley.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who wants our land management agencies to be functional in the future needs to recognize the seriousness of what Secretary Bernhardt, acting director Pendley, and their subordinates are doing.\u201d</p>",

in several jurisdictions, including 24 cases in the last 3 days across 2 jurisdictions, the risk of introduction across an interstate border remains. The current quarantine restrictions ensure that such cases are isolated and unable to spread the disease further within the community. </p> \n   <p>While AHPPC provided no specific advice on interstate borders, closure has been an effective mechanism in reducing the introduction of disease in several jurisdictions, including South Australia, Queensland and Northern Territory. </p> \n   <p>As Western Australia increases the size of mass gatherings in the hospitality, community and sports sectors in Phases 2 and 3, the re-introduction of Covid-19 back into the community from travellers could lead to substantial outbreaks that may require either delay in easing of further restrictions or re-introduction of social distancing and mass gathering measures.</p> \n   <p>Until community spread is eliminated in the affected jurisdictions, which will require at least a month to confirm (two 14-day incubation periods), opening of the interstate borders is not recommended. If the community spread is controlled, relaxation of the interstate borders could be considered after the introduction and assessment of the impact of Phase 4.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T07:58:57.360Z\">at 8.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec4d32f8f08a1782fa7df97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T07:25:12.923Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Anaesthetists will have access to telehealth to do pre-operative consultations, the Australian Society of Anaesthetists said. </p> \n  <p>The expansion is a \u201cmajor win,\u201d ASA president <strong>Dr Suzi Nou</strong> said, and will \u201censure anaesthetists can identify patient factors that could significantly increase the risk for complications\u201d.

Some Australian politicians, including Australia\u2019s foreign minister <strong>Marise Payne</strong>, Prime Minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> and Minister for Home Affairs <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>, have been in a bullish mood, as some media reports said, in criticizing China for its lack of transparency, and vowed to stand up for their values. <br><br>Some Australian media outlets see this as a move aimed at further pressuring China and seeking to hold Beijing accountable for the outbreak, calling on Beijing to face overwhelming global pressure at the WHA meeting. <br><br>\u201cThis is a totally different thing from the so-called independent inquiry pushed by the Australian side,\u201d <strong>Zhao Lijian</strong>, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Tuesday on the resolution approved by the international community.

It\u2019s a win for the international community, and Australia, as a strong and active part of that international community, would certainly see it that way. Do you have any comment?</p> \n  <p><strong>Zhao Lijian:</strong> First and foremost, China supports a comprehensive evaluation of global Covid-19 response to ensure experience gained and lessons learnt after the pandemic is brought under control, which should be led by WHO and conducted in a science-based, professional, objective and impartial manner. China has been consistent and clear about this all along. The draft resolution on Covid-19 being discussed at this year\u2019s WHA is consistent with China\u2019s position and reflects the widespread consensus of other countries. China, along with other parties, has actively participated in the consultations on the draft resolution and the co-sponsoring of the draft resolution.</p> \n  <p>Second, the above-mentioned draft resolution is entirely different from what the Australia called \u201cindependent international review\u201d. For example, the draft resolution proposes to initiate at the appropriate moment an evaluation rather than to launch an \u201cindependent international review\u201d instantly, which confirms WHO\u2019s leading role instead of adopting another mechanism. The draft resolution calls for an evaluation of experience gained and lessons learnt from the WHO-coordinated international health response, rather than an inquiry based on the presumption of guilt targeting certain country. We hope Australia will read the text carefully instead of making conclusions based on assumptions.</p> \n  <p>Lastly, I want to stress that we welcome it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political manoeuvere and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:44:10.234Z\">at 3.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494eb8f08a1782fa7de65\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:28:04.951Z\">3.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Beijing calls on Australia to 'completely give up its political manoeuvre'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry has responded to theWorld Health Assembly motion (which was led by the EU) and recommended Australia \u2018changes its course\u2019.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The spokesperson highlighted the differences between the WHA resolution and Australia\u2019s proposal of an independent international review <strong>and stressed that China welcomes it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political </strong><strong>manoeuvre</strong><strong> and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:39:46.283Z\">at 3.39am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494a38f0864e579f141fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:23:54.889Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Covid crisis, and the trade situation, has resulted in this announcement from the government:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Following broad industry consultation and further consideration of the impacts on industry, the Australian government has made the decision not to proceed with the Onshore Biosecurity Levy. </p> \n   <p>The department undertook a co-design process with industry to develop a levy model that was practical for industry and the government. </p> \n   <p>This process highlighted that a levy could not be implemented without significant regulatory impacts on industry and proposed levy payers. </p> \n   <p>This decision has also been made in consideration of the ongoing impacts of drought, bushfires and Covid-19 on the Australian economy and the rapidly changing global trade environment. </p> \n   <p>The department would like to thank the Industry Working Group and other stakeholders who provided valuable input and feedback on the proposed levy design. </p> \n   <p>A levy will not be progressed and this decision will not impact on the overall biosecurity budget. </p> \n   <p>Australia\u2019s biosecurity system will continue to be funded through existing arrangements. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:26:16.972Z\">at 3.26am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494418f0886ce4f5d6bff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:23:06.199Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Penny Wong </strong>also spoke to the ABC radio this morning (in Adelaide) where she repeated Labor\u2019s stance on the government\u2019s relationship with China:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think on the inquiry, if that\u2019s the question, this is the inquiry into the pandemic, I\u2019ve made very clear from the start we supported it.<br></p> \n   <p>And we welcome the resolution at the World Health Assembly to have an inquiry, a European Union-led resolution that has many countries signed up to it, including Australia.<br></p> \n   <p>It does differ from what <strong>Marise Payne</strong> announced on Insiders, in that the World Health Organisation is doing the inquiry.

They serve in their personal capacity, they are not, if you like, part of the WHO structure.

  "<p>When coronavirus first arrived in Britain, ministers initially placed their hopes on the summer months offering relief from the pandemic. The idea was that if they could suppress infections until the late spring, the change in temperature might help to stop the virus in its tracks.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t to be.<strong> </strong>Scientific advice now suggests that temperature in and of itself has <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-summer-temperature-warm-hot-spread-study-pandemic-a9506201.html\">limited effect on Covid-19\u2019s spread</a>. Yet as the death toll continues to rise, prayers for sunny weather from government are louder than ever. Why? To help keep people onside over what has the potential to be a long, dull, stay-at-home British summer.</p> <p>With the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pitting himself against the bulk of his party over a gradual rather than a rapid easing of lockdown, the UK is now on course to move at a more stately pace than its European counterparts when it comes to socialising, the reopening of bars \u2013 and holidays. While the EU has a three-stage plan to restart tourism, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists\">Italy and Spain</a> aim to reopen for visitors as early as June, the UK is taking a rather different approach.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists\">Global report: Italy reopens cafes as Spain prepares for return of tourists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Next month, a two-week quarantine is being introduced for all new arrivals to the UK, including British people returning from abroad. The move has been heavily criticised by the travel industry, with one trade body warning it will have a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on the UK aviation industry and the wider economy.</p> <p>However, with Johnson determined to press on with what one No 10 adviser describes as the \u201cslow and steady\u201d path out of lockdown, the focus in government is not on appeasing airline companies but working out how to keep a potentially restless British public onside while its neighbours holiday.</p> <p>Even if talks of \u201cair bridges\u201d \u2013 allowing quarantine-free travel to and from low-infection countries such as Greece \u2013 come to fruition, the general sense in government is that the bulk of Britons will not be jetting abroad this summer.</p> <p>As well as quarantine and safety concerns, the economic reality means extravagant holidays just won\u2019t be an option for many. With unemployment set to increase even further and many on reduced household incomes, holidays are likely to be a luxury that people cannot afford. Social distancing practices mean that budget flights, too, could soon become much harder to find.</p> <p>As a result, ministers have begun to work out what they can do to keep morale up over the long summer months. While public support is now very much for lockdown continuing, the worry is what happens when other countries enjoy breaks with more ease. \u201cIf the R number rises in these countries as a result, we\u2019ll be praised for our response \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t, we might start to get some heat,\u201d explains one government figure.</p> <p>The great hope is that the weather gods will shine on the UK. The evidence suggests that activity outside carries a much lower risk of transmission than inside. Just look at how Northern Ireland is now allowing a half dozen people from different households to gather, if they are outside. All the plans to relax socialising coming down the tracks are based on being outside. \u201cIf it rains, we\u2019re fucked,\u201d says one rather blunt Tory MP.</p> <p>\u201cBritain\u2019s going to look like the 1940s this summer,\u201d predicts a government insider privy to discussions. Expect Mr Whippys on Bournemouth beach, camping breaks and, if we\u2019re lucky, drive-in cinemas.</p> <p>Talks are under way across departments to see what can be done to help retail businesses move outside. There is a focus on encouraging local councils to make it easy to cut red tape for businesses so they can adapt to a new normal in which trading outside is the preferred option. Inside No 10, one good-case scenario for mid-summer is that people will be permitted to dine outside at a restaurant with someone they don\u2019t live with.</p> <p>While restaurants and cafes are viewed as potential beneficiaries of good weather, the prospects for a lazy summer afternoon in the pub are bleaker. The concern is that the low cost of a pint means that it won\u2019t be financially viable for a pub to open its garden while taking in just a small number of people \u2013 whereas a more expensive restaurant could manage. But entrepreneurial landlords will be encouraged to think outside the box.</p> <p>The first holiday likely to be allowed will be camping \u2013 if that works out, then private home hire could be next. Hotels are viewed as harder to reopen due to the number of people coming and going. Discussions are under way over an extended holiday season \u2013 not just the typical high season of peak summer months \u2013 given that changing circumstances mean the traditional holiday period cannot be relied upon.</p> <p>Ministers are considering promoting parts of the UK that are usually off the tourist trail. With an increase expected in the number of domestic tourists, it\u2019s not only viewed as an opportunity to promote undiscovered spots \u2013 it could also be what\u2019s needed to keep MPs on side. On Tory WhatsApp, Devon and Cornwall MPs are already worried about an influx of people to their constituencies \u2013 with locals concerned about the virus spreading. However, in No 10 there\u2019s a sense that \u201ccommon sense\u201d will allow everyone an opportunity to explore.</p> <p>However, for all the efforts to keep the UK entertained this summer, the biggest risk factor may be not the weather but the economy. The furlough scheme is up for review in August and companies will be asked to pay a higher contribution. There is concern among MPs that this could be a crunch point for high unemployment. If that comes to pass, no amount of ice-cream by the coast or sitting around campfires will be enough to distract from the bad times ahead.</p> <p>\u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor</p>",
  "<p>We\u2019re now months into our strange new socially distanced age. For some it probably feels like years already. But, for those who have remained well and those who are able to leave their homes, there has been one generally agreed upside of the pandemic: the impact on our planet. With roads empty, the sound of birdsong filling normally clogged streets and the sight of empty skies, the lockdown has given the planet a much needed breather. Cities are now beginning to reopen \u2013 many with ad hoc bike lanes to aid social distancing; and millions will be thinking about working from home for good. This year, global carbon emissions will likely drop between 6% and 8%. But to stop the planet heating by more than 1.5C, we need at least a similar drop <em>every single year</em>. The lesson from the shutdown, writes Gaia Vince in this week\u2019s cover story, is that as important as individual changes are, the shift needed remains a structural and governmental one.

Is there even anywhere to travel to?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/20/coronavirus-nsw-galleries-and-museums-scramble-after-unexpected-lifting-of-restrictions\">Coronavirus NSW: galleries and museums scramble after unexpected lifting of restrictions</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Here we try to answer the most pressing questions when it comes to air travel and holidays during the pandemic.</p> \n<p>These answers are based on comments from politicians, experts and industry stakeholders and should not be treated as medical or legal advice.</p> \n<h2>Where can I fly?</h2> \n<p>As of 20 May, the majority of state and territory border closures are still in place, so interstate holidays are unlikely in the immediate future.</p> \n<p>Here are the current travel restrictions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT \u2013 </strong>There have been no border closures in Victoria, NSW or the ACT throughout the entire pandemic. You can fly into them without trouble and legally travel between without having to isolate. But if you are coming from any other state or territory, chances are you will need to quarantine when you arrive back. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Queensland \u2013 </strong>There is currently a hard border closure in Queensland, meaning unless it\u2019s for essential reasons you are not allowed to enter the state. You can return if you are a Queensland resident, but if you have been to a \u201cCovid-19 hotspot\u201d in the last 14 days you must quarantine for two weeks. These hotspots consist of a considerable number of local government areas in Victoria and NSW. A full list <a href=\"https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/current-status/hotspots-covid-19\">can be found here.</a></p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Western Australia \u2013 </strong>Some of the country\u2019s strictest border closures are in place in WA. You are not permitted to enter the state unless you have been granted a special exemption and, if you are a WA resident, you must apply for an exemption before you leave the state, and must isolate for 14 days when you return.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>South Australia \u2013 </strong>While SA has closed its border, it\u2019s a softer closure than Queensland or WA. You are allowed in but you must self-isolate for 14 days unless you are an essential traveller. </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Tasmania \u2013 </strong>Similar to SA, all non-essential travellers to Tasmania must quarantine for 14 days upon arrival, including returning residents.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Northern Territory \u2013 </strong>All non-essential travellers entering the NT, including returning residents, must undergo 14 days mandatory quarantine and pay a \u2018quarantine fee\u2019 of $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Which airlines are flying?</h2> \n<p>Currently Qantas, Virgin and Region Express airlines are flying extremely limited domestic schedules.</p> \n<p>Qantas and its budget arm Jetstar are preparing to ramp up domestic services when border restrictions ease, with the company\u2019s chief executive, Alan Joyce, urging travellers to begin planning their trips.</p> \n<p>Rex also appears to be preparing for increased regional travel.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s unclear if and when Virgin will begin regular interstate flights as the company is currently in voluntary administration. This includes the company\u2019s low-cost offshoot TigerAir.</p> \n<h2>Will there be physical distancing on flights?</h2> \n<p>No.</p> \n<p>The Qantas chief executive has stated the airline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/qantas-decision-to-fill-australian-flights-to-capacity-condemned-by-infectious-disease-experts\">will not be observing physical distancing</a> aboard planes, either by spacing out passengers or leaving middle rows free. Joyce said that doing so would drastically inflate ticket prices and, given the seemingly low rates of transmission on aeroplanes, would not be economically justifiable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/qantas-decision-to-fill-australian-flights-to-capacity-condemned-by-infectious-disease-experts\">Qantas decision to fill Australian flights to capacity condemned by infectious disease experts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThis idea of the middle seat [being left free] isn\u2019t social distancing, it\u2019s a 60cm difference between two people. To get the full [1.5 metres] squared, you will end up with 22 people on an aircraft of 180 seats and the airfares are nine to 10 times as much,\u201d he told ABC radio.</p> \n<p>Regional Express has said it will try to allocate alternating occupied and unoccupied seats where possible, however, it will still fill planes to capacity if need be.</p> \n<h2>Are planes safe when it comes to Covid-19?</h2> \n<p>There is no simple answer to this.</p> \n<p>As Joyce and other airline executive are quick to point out, there have been very few known or suspected cases of Covid-19 transmission on aeroplanes.</p> \n<p>When announcing plans to ramp up domestic flights, the Qantas medical director, Dr Ian Hosegood, said due to the physical arrangement of planes they were safer than other forms of public transit.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s due to a combination of factors, including the cabin air filtration system, the fact people don\u2019t sit face-to-face and the high backs of aircraft seats acting as a physical barrier. As far as the virus goes, an aircraft cabin is a very different environment to other forms of public transport,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn-flight transmission\u2019s just not something that we\u2019ve seen, and that was even during the peak of the pandemic. At this point and into the coming weeks the likelihood of anyone travelling domestically with Covid is extremely low, and those other factors mean that the risk is infinitesimal.\u201d</p> \n<p>But a number of epidemiologists and infectious disease experts do not agree.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Raina MacIntyre, a virologist at the University of NSW, told ABC she would not be flying until vaccinated for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The infectious disease expert and epidemiology professor Marylouise McLaws told Guardian Australia that, like other densely populated enclosed spaces, planes were likely \u201cbrilliant amplification environments\u201d for the virus.</p> \n<p>\u201cPerhaps there haven\u2019t been confirmed cases from flights, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t be careful, and it could just mean we haven\u2019t identified them as a risk factor yet \u2026 There are still a significant amount of cases that are under investigation,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Many planes have advanced air filtration systems that refresh the air in the cabins every few minutes and remove virus particles, but multiple epidemiologists have said this likely won\u2019t protect you if someone in your immediate area is infectious.</p> \n<h2>Should I wear a mask on a flight?</h2> \n<p>Yes, unless you have a medical reason not to.</p> \n<p>Regardless of whether an airline mandates wearing a mask, McLaws said it is a vital step in protecting yourself and others on flights.</p> \n<p>\u201cPreventing Covid-19 is a bundle of many things \u2026 When you can\u2019t have one of those, such as social distancing, you need to protect yourself from inhaling or exhaling the virus with a mask.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even if you are not directly seated near other people, wearing a mask is still important as people are regularly moving around the cabin, through narrow aisles.</p> \n<p>It may be difficult for those with respiratory illnesses such as emphysema to wear a mask, but if you are medically able, McLaw highly recommends you do so at all times while flying.</p> \n<p>Qantas is currently not planning to make mask-wearing mandatory when its \u201cfly well\u201d safety procedures roll out on 12 June. It will be providing masks to all passengers and recommending they be worn, but will only require this if a passenger is displaying symptoms during the flight.</p> \n<p>From 1 June it will be mandatory for all passengers on Regional Express flights to wear a mask while travelling unless they are exempt for medical reasons. While you can purchase a mask at the time of your flight, passengers are encouraged to bring their own.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/22/bad-neighbour-will-the-cruise-industry-ever-be-the-same-again-after-coronavirus\">'Bad neighbour': will the cruise industry resume its rise in Australia after coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>McLaws notes that if lower grade or cloth face masks are being used passengers should not talk during the flight.</p> \n<p>\u201cCloth masks provide anywhere between 10 and 60% protection. That\u2019s not at the 98% of a hospital-grade mask, therefore the wearer is required not to speak or laugh through the mask. This will push particles through the looser weave.\u201d</p> \n<h2>What else are airlines doing?</h2> \n<p>Qantas has laid out a \u201cfly well\u201d program, which aims to increase safety on all Qantas and Jetstar flights. Measures at airports include contactless check-ins, extra disinfectant stations at terminals and rearranging the Qantas lounge. Onboard there is additional cleaning of aircraft, travellers being asked to limit movements around the cabin, limits on the number of times attendants offer food and drinks, and the provision of alcohol wipes to all passengers.</p> \n<p>Rex will also have mandatory temperature testing of all passengers and Qantas appears to be ramping up this testing as well. On both airlines, travellers with flu-like symptoms will be turned away from flights.<br></p> \n<h2>What if I feel sick on the day of my flight?</h2> \n<p>Along with new safety procedures, Qantas has increased flexibility for all Qantas and Jetstar flights.</p> \n<p>For domestic flights booked between 21 May and 30 June, for travel between 12 June and 31 October, the change of flight fee will be waived one time.</p> \n<p>This means as long as you haven\u2019t already changed your booking, if you wake up with a raised temperature or any flu-like symptoms you are able to reschedule your flight with no charge. If you are denied boarding due to illness you can also be moved to another flight free of charge.</p> \n<p>Rex said that in the event that someone was denied check-in due because they had a high temperature, the airline would allow them to rebook for a later date. Any refund would be considered on a case by case basis.</p> \n<h2>Is it too soon to be planning an interstate holiday?</h2> \n<p>It depends on who you ask, but currently, no states or territories are actively encouraging travellers to come to visit.</p> \n<p>The national cabinet guidelines have suggested 10 July as the time to review interstate travel, however, it\u2019s unclear which states are likely to follow this.</p> \n<p>The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has said the state\u2019s borders would be reviewed at the end of each month, with September floated as a \u201crealistic\u201d timeframe by the state\u2019s chief health officer.</p> \n<p>Previously, the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, said the state border would be lifted \u201cdead last\u201d and Western Australia appears to be on a similar trajectory.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has urged other states to reopen sooner rather than later, and holiday travel inside the state will be allowed from 1 June.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The federal tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, said he would like to see restriction relaxed in time for the winter tourism boom.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose states who\u2019ve got border controls in place, assuming we\u2019ve continued to see very low rates of transmission of Covid-19, ought to be looking at opening up their borders,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need people moving across this country again when it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, airlines are also keen to see travel begin again.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe look forward hopefully to seeing a lot of you on our flights in July for a holiday,\u201d Joyce said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI encourage you to do your research now and to look at some of the very attractive airfares we\u2019re going to have \u2026 If you need to visit family and friends, now\u2019s the time to start planning.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Tropical cyclones have become more intense around the globe in the past four decades, with more destructive storms forming more often, according to a study that further confirms the theory that warming oceans would drive more dangerous cyclones.</p> <p>Analysis of satellite records from 1979 to 2017 found a clear rise in the most destructive cyclones \u2013 also known as hurricanes or typhoons \u2013 that deliver sustained winds in excess of about 185km/h.</p> <p>Australia sits across two ocean basins where cyclones form \u2013 the southern Indian Ocean and southern Pacific Ocean \u2013 where the study also identified rising trends of the more destructive storms.</p> <p>Experts told Guardian Australia the finding was in line with climate model predictions and the knowledge that increasing ocean temperatures gave tropical storms more energy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/20/is-the-coalitions-gas-nirvana-just-an-attempt-to-have-its-fossil-fuel-cake-and-eat-it-too\">Is the Coalition's gas nirvana just an attempt to have its fossil fuel cake and eat it too? | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dr Hamish Ramsay, a senior research scientist at CSIRO who studies cyclones, said: \u201cThis study confirms what the climate models have been predicting for some time \u2013 that the proportion of the most intense storms will increase as the climate warms.\u201d</p> <p>While climate scientists have long-predicted that global heating would deliver stronger cyclones, a trend that was statistically significant has been challenging to identify in part due to the natural swings in the world\u2019s climate masking changes.</p> <p>Published in the leading journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/05/12/1920849117\">the study</a> was carried out by scientists at the US government\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p> <p>The scientists did not try to find a cause for the increase in more dangerous cyclones, but said the trends were consistent with understanding of physics and modelling, and the finding \u201cincreases confidence that [tropical cyclones] have become substantially stronger, and that there is a likely human fingerprint on this increase\u201d.</p> <p>The probability of a cyclone reaching wind speeds greater than 185km/h had risen by about 15% over the 39 years studied.</p> <p>A previous study of the same data had only spanned a shorter period from 1982 to 2009 and, while positive trends had been found, they were statistically not at significant levels, the study said.</p> <p>As well as looking at the number of cyclones forming globally, the study also looked at changes in cyclone intensity by region. The southern Indian Ocean and the southern pacific Ocean both showed an increase in the number of the more intense storms, although the trends in each individual region were not as robust due to the smaller number of cyclones.</p> <p>\u201c[The study] suggests that the climate change signal in the data is potentially already emerging and this is something that climate scientists have been saying for some time,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cWe maybe at a point now where we are starting to evidence from observational data that supports what the models have been telling us.\u201d</p> <p>Ramsay said as well as increasing the wind speeds in cyclones, warming oceans would also likely see cyclones delivering more rainfall. There was still uncertainty as to whether the numbers of all categories of cyclones would rise or fall under climate change.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">2018 State of the Climate Report</a> said since 1982 there had been a downward trend in the number of all tropical cyclones in the Australian region but it was not possible to see any trend in the intensity of cyclones.</p> <p>Previous research has found that when cyclones form, they are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0158-3\">tending to move more slowly</a>, while delivering more rain.</p> <p>Dr Greg Holland, a senior scientist emeritus at the <a href=\"https://ncar.ucar.edu/\">National Center for Atmospheric Research</a> in Colorado, has studied cyclones for about 40 years.</p> <p>The Melbourne-based scientist said while there were legitimate arguments over the finer details of trends and intensity in relation to tropical cyclones: \u201cThe work all points in the same direction \u2013 the proportion of the most intense cyclones is going up.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cThere is nobody saying the trend will go the other way. The physics has been well set out for 30 or 40 years. If you get a warmer ocean then the intensities of cyclones goes up. That\u2019s a 5% or 10% increase in maximum winds for every 1C of warming in the ocean. The world is warming and its because we have put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cFor the Australian region \u2013 which is the eastern Indian and southern west Pacific \u2013 it means we now have the potential for there to be more intense tropical cyclones coming ashore and doing more damage.</p> <p>\u201cThe chances of us getting an intense cyclone have gone up already and they will go up in the future.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/19/angus-taylors-tech-not-taxes-approach-is-likely-to-create-more-problems-than-it-solves\">Angus Taylor's 'tech, not taxes' approach is likely to create more problems than it solves | Ketan Joshi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Holland said there was also <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24828193/\">evidence that the ocean region of Australia where intense cyclones could strike was also expanding</a>. The observed movement was only about 150km, he said, but this would soon put Brisbane \u201cin the cyclone zone\u201d.</p> <p>Prof Steven Sherwood, of the UNSW Climate Change Research Centre, said the study was important \u201cbecause it shows that the upward trends first reported about a decade ago in cyclone activity have been sustained, and have now gone on long enough that it is no longer possible for them to be a random natural variation.\u201d</p> <p>He said the study found that averaged globally, 30% of cyclones in the 1980s were \u201cmajor\u201d compared with 40% of cyclones now.</p> <p>\u201cThere is of course nothing surprising about this \u2014 we\u2019ve just reached the point of \u2018non-deniability\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe implication for Australia is that our risk exposure to strong cyclones will almost certainly continue to increase as long as global temperatures increase.</p> <p>\u201cIt also appears that storms are encroaching farther away from the equator, although this is harder to confirm observationally. If this is true, it means that the Queensland southern coast in particular may be at growing risk.\u201d</p>",

At Benefit, they have opened brow bars for waxing appointments in Asia-Pacific, with similar hygiene measures in place. \u201cOur typical two-seat service stations will be limited to one customer and placed six feet apart from each other,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cTo ensure all brow waxing stations are properly sanitised and disinfected in between services, our appointments will be spread out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8391f17085667985c5fc98baac61f0ffc3bc30e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8391f17085667985c5fc98baac61f0ffc3bc30e/0_0_2796_2808/996.jpg\" alt=\"The brows that started the boom: Cara Delevingne\" width=\"996\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The brows that started the boom: Cara Delevingne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blair says her members are on board with whatever the measures will be: \u201cOne positive is that, predominantly, we are already a very hygienic industry and take great care to protect our therapists and customers, so we will more easily adjust to new government rules.\u201d She adds that a study commissioned last year found that hair and beauty treatments were worth around \u00a36.6bn to the UK economy in a year, meaning there is motivation to find new ways of making this work. \u201cI think the antibody tests will be a bit of a game-changer for us,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will reassure clients who want to go for a treatment. I would be worried myself. I would really like to do my eyelashes \u2013 they aren\u2019t looking their best \u2013 but I have my health and that\u2019s much more important.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, the virtual appointments continue \u2013 and may become part of a new normal in the world of eyebrows, even when salon appointments are reintroduced. \u201cWe think that this touch-free way for our customers to explore and play with our products has set a new standard and will be a welcomed experience in a post-Covid 19 era,\u201d says Bailey. Riley agrees, pointing out that appointments online work for an international customer, even without the pandemic factor. \u201cI was speaking to a client from Sydney last night,\u201d she says. \u201cVideo will never replace the salon experience but the virtual world and the physical world will start merging.\u201d Better start practising the art of holding tweezers and a smart phone at the same time, then.</p>",

  "<p>News last week that Woody Allen\u2019s latest, the Amazon-disowned A Rainy Day in New York, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/13/woody-allen-rainy-day-in-new-york-tops-global-box-office\">was the world\u2019s number one film at the box office</a> spread fast, mainly because of its inherent absurdity. Allen, a figure associated more with critical acclaim than commercial success, is currently outgrossing Pixar\u2019s Onward with a film that might never see a US release, a bizarro turn of events that felt indicative of what\u2019s become a very surreal year in film.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/16/netflix-criminal-justice-documentaries-us\">Forget Tiger King: Netflix's broken criminal justice docs are just as shocking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The overwhelming majority of global cinemas remain closed due to the ongoing pandemic and so Allen\u2019s blockbusting triumph was the result of having just opened in South Korea, a country that\u2019s far ahead in the knotty process of restarting its economy. Without <em>real</em> box office numbers to analyse, we\u2019ve been forced to look elsewhere to find out what films people are watching and with its unparalleled dominance in the world of streaming, the best place to look is of course Netflix. While the platform still refrains from any regular form of data-sharing, it drops the odd humblebrag when something hits big and has also implemented a daily top 10 feature which allows us to at least see what shows and films are the most watched even if we don\u2019t know how many people are watching.</p> <p>While the list is often predictably led by the streamer\u2019s latest high-profile original (in large part a result of it receiving the most aggressive on-site promotion), what\u2019s become far more interesting to observe is the number of forgotten B-movies that have been nestling alongside, granted a second life for an audience arguably far larger than they\u2019ve ever had before. In recent weeks, the US top 10 has included teen horror House at the End of the Street, action thrillers Sleepless and Den of Thieves, fact-based drama Soul Surfer, Single White Female rip-off The Roommate and sci-fi adventure Lockout. Each of these films shares a number of characteristics: a recognisable star lead, a wide theatrical release and a middling or underwhelming performance at the box office. So they land on Netflix and are met with a vague awareness of the film but with a stronger familiarity attached to the actors propping them up, the kind of combination that time and again has led to rental success in the past. Take 2017 for example. What was the most rented title of the year? Wonder Woman? Rogue One? Thor: Ragnarok? Nope, it was the Ben Affleck thriller The Accountant, a film that did solid business theatrically but blew up at home, consumers perhaps waiting for the most fitting price point for a film that didn\u2019t demand the big-screen experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"272e0356685be9e0e498bd337ac6f69b442862aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/272e0356685be9e0e498bd337ac6f69b442862aa/0_141_3000_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Foxx in Sleepless\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Foxx in Sleepless.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Open Road Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With Netflix, the psychology of what to watch is obviously very different, with no cost attached to each individual film, but with so much choice and with it being just one of many widely used services, strong viewership for every new addition is by no means a guarantee (higher-profile recent adds to US Netflix, including The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, District 9, Back to the Future, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and The Artist, all failed to make a showing in the chart). What\u2019s revealing is to then see what <em>does</em> cause people to click en masse and how a mostly forgotten film that might be part of a cheap bulk acquisition can gain a new fanbase. An early sign of this came in 2015 when the Netflix arrival of A Very Brady Sequel led to <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2015/01/20-years-after-its-release-a-very-brady-meme.html\">an unusual viral afterlife</a> for a comedy released almost 20 years earlier. The film, a well-received, tongue-in-cheek sequel to an update of the earnest family TV show, made less then $22m at the US box office leading to the third film heading straight to the small screen. Its cultural impact was minimal but within weeks of landing on Netflix two decades later, it was responsible for a flurry of memes from an audience who were most likely not born when it came out (<a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/george-glass-sure-jan-skule\">Sure, Jan</a> remains in rotation now).</p> <p>We haven\u2019t seen quite the same social media explosion just yet for any of the titles mentioned but without the standard May release schedule in place, a thirst for the new is stronger than ever. So now, rather than rushing to see Fast &amp; Furious 9 or Black Widow, millions of Americans are instead watching House at the End of the Street, a poorly reviewed 2012 thriller starring a pre-Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrence. Shot in 2010 and then shelved for two years, the film eventually did average business on release but was promptly forgotten about as Lawrence\u2019s star continued to ascend. But renewed interest (it\u2019s been in the US top 10 since being added to Netflix on 7 May and trended on Twitter soon after) has led to film sites, eager for content, to post a deluge of clickbait pieces from Looper\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.looper.com/209197/the-ending-of-house-at-the-end-of-the-street-explained/\">The ending of House at the End of the Street explained</a> to Screen Rant\u2019s <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/house-end-street-2-updates-release-date-story/\">House At The End Of The Street 2: Will It Happen?</a> (spoiler: it won\u2019t). The Jamie Foxx thriller Sleepless has seen a similar trajectory, lingering in the most watched for weeks after making only $20m in the US on release in 2017 (see: We Got This Covered\u2019s <a href=\"https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/jamie-foxx-action-movie-dominating-netflix/\">An Underrated Jamie Foxx Thriller Has Been Surprisingly Popular On Netflix</a>).</p> <p>What\u2019s encouraging for Netflix is that these successes have emerged from smaller companies, rather than big studios. The reason this matters right now is that the increasingly fractured nature of streaming means that individual studios are taking back their own movies for their own platforms. Pre-existing deals mean this hasn\u2019t all happened automatically but soon, Disney+ will house all Disney films and some family-friendly Fox titles, Hulu will have other Fox movies including Searchlight, Peacock will take Universal films, HBO Max will have Warner and New Line titles and CBS All Access will take Paramount catalogue. It\u2019s one of the reasons Netflix has been acquiring and producing so many \u201coriginal\u201d films to stock up, to fill up their homepage with enough reasons to subscribe before the great drought begins. This surge of clicks for films briefly leased from less prestigious companies, those unlikely to launch their own platforms, not only suggests to Netflix that there\u2019s life outside of the big studios but also helps them to figure out the formula for their own future original films.</p> <p>The platform\u2019s two biggest success stories of late \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/06/spenser-confidential-review-mark-wahlberg-netflix\">Spenser Confidential</a>, starring Mark Wahlberg, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/22/extraction-review-chris-hemsworth-netflix-action-thriller\">Extraction</a>, starring Chris Hemsworth (now, allegedly, Netflix\u2019s biggest two film premieres ever) \u2013 fall in line with the aforementioned B-movie hits: reviews were tepid and plotting was simple but both were anchored by a recognisable star and millions were happy to press play without further expense. Given the muted box office clout of both actors outside of franchise fare (Wahlberg stumbled with Deepwater Horizon, Patriots Day and Mile 22 while Hemsworth couldn\u2019t turn Bad Times at El Royale or In the Heart of the Sea into hits), it\u2019s unlikely these films would have made a dent theatrically yet scored over 85 million and 90 million online viewers apiece. Netflix has responded to the success by giving the green light to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/extraction-netflix-sequel-chris-hemsworth-joe-russo-screenplay-script-sam-hargrave-1202925594/\">an Extraction sequel</a>, another Wahlberg action film described as <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/mark-wahlberg-marc-guggenheim-netflix-our-man-from-jersey-seven-figure-deal-1202934559/\">a \u201cblue-collar 007\u201d</a> and an action-heavy franchise-starter for <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/jessica-alba-trigger-warning-netflix-1234608020/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=exacttarget&amp;utm_campaign=newsalert&amp;utm_content=206486_05-15-2020_headline&amp;utm_term=167038\">another fallen star, Jessica Alba</a>. Rather than wait for B-movies to receive a second life years after a big-screen release, Netflix is cutting out the middle man.</p>",

  "<p>Global leaders must heed the lessons of the financial crisis of 2008 when they look to repair the damage from the coronavirus pandemic, leading experts have warned, to avoid entrenching disastrous social, health and environmental inequalities and hastening climate breakdown.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/29/its-more-than-a-decade-since-the-financial-crisis-wheres-the-recovery\">2008 global financial crisis</a> and recession marked the last time the world experienced a convulsion comparable in scale to the coronavirus crisis, though starkly different in its nature. Governments responded first with economic rescue and stimulus packages worth trillions in taxpayer cash, followed in many cases by austerity programmes to cut back public spending.</p> <p>But the past decade has produced far greater levels of inequality than has been seen since before the second world war, producing starker contrasts between the extremely rich and the rest in health, job security, education and other measures, with poorer people suffering worst and the middle classes squeezed while the income of the top 1% soared.</p> <p>Greenhouse gas emissions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/paris-climate-deal-world-not-on-track-to-meet-goal-amid-continuous-emissions\">have also risen</a>, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">warnings from scientists</a> and the Paris agreement of 2015, threatening an even worse crisis if governments do not rapidly change tack. The rise came despite some efforts to \u201cgreen\u201d the post financial crisis recovery, with low-carbon and environmental measures accounting for <a href=\"https://apjjf.org/-Edward-B.-Barbier/3383/article.html\">about 16% of the stimulus</a>.</p> <p>To avoid a similar outcome this time, leaders must ensure their response to the Covid-19 crisis looks to the good of the whole of society, rather than just the economy, and addresses the climate emergency as well, said Sir Michael Marmot, who led the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/austerity-blamed-for-life-expectancy-stalling-for-first-time-in-century\">landmark UK review of public health</a> that found life expectancy fell following austerity.</p> <p>\u201cThe scale of what is happening in the economy now is hugely greater than in 2008,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe need to bring the climate agenda and the health agenda together. If we are not careful, the steps we take now will increase inequalities further. Enough people are saying now that austerity is not an experiment we want to repeat.\u201d</p> <p>Marmot is one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">leading voices calling for a \u201cgreen recovery\u201d</a> that would direct any economic stimulus towards measures that reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as generating jobs and repairing the economy.</p> <p>The economic stimulus in the years after 2008 did produce some environmental improvements such as investments in renewable energy, which have cut the cost of solar and wind power. But the push to cut emissions was stymied by factors such as the sharp fall in the carbon price under the EU\u2019s emissions trading scheme, and China\u2019s construction push.</p> <p>This time can be different, argues Lord Nicholas Stern, one of the world\u2019s leading climate economists and author of the landmark 2006 review of the costs of climate change. \u201cTechnology is completely different now. We have seen the costs of key technologies such as renewable energy come right down. We have altogether superior electric vehicle technology. And we know more about air pollution, and how many people it kills.\u201d</p> <p>Putting money into the fossil fuel economy would be a waste, he added. \u201cThat produces insecurity. If we do things that leave stranded assets [in fossil fuel businesses], we also have stranded jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Yet talking about environmental measures in the midst of an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/economic-recovery-covid-19-crisis-politics\">economic crisis</a> may not be popular, and could be seized on by populist opponents of climate action. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/09/who-really-are-the-gilets-jaunes\">gilets jaunes protests</a> in France were sparked by a rise in fuel taxes that had a particular impact on poorer workers in rural areas. Those protests had roots far deeper than just the fuel tax, some extending back to the response to the 2008 financial crisis, but some experts fear they show how green measures can be presented as contrary to working people\u2019s interests.</p> <p>\u201cThe gilets jaunes show there is a lesson to learn,\u201d says Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, and one of the most influential global voices on energy economics. \u201cI am afraid there will be a divergence among policymakers \u2013 they will see [a choice between] either jobs or climate change. It\u2019s very important that we put policies in place that help to create jobs and stimulate a clean energy transition.\u201d</p> <p>Leading economists are hopeful, however, that those mistakes can be avoided and that the world will turn to \u201cbuild back better\u201d instead of pouring resources into fossil fuels.</p> <p>\u201cFocus on what we already know works,\u201d said Birol. That means clean energy, such as wind and solar power, and energy efficiency. \u201cThen focus on technologies that are ready for the big time \u2013 hydrogen [energy] and batteries. Third, we need sustained political support.\u201d</p> <p>The green recovery now has a rigorous intellectual underpinning, in the form of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/green-stimulus-can-repair-global-economy-and-climate-study-says?fbclid=IwAR3ALbARCbncWbEbdBLaxUK_m2YSQLic6a2KyCzpGjn77w0ROgcuPxm5QqU\">paper by Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, Stern and others</a>, published earlier this month. The paper examined the aftermath of the 2008 crisis and found that putting public money into green projects produced greater returns in both the short and long term than pouring cash into conventional high-carbon projects.</p> <p>That is crucial, according to Brian O\u2019Callaghan, of the Smith School for Enterprise at Oxford University and co-author of the study, because governments want \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects that produce a lot of jobs quickly, that do not need too high levels of existing skills or extensive training, and that provide infrastructure that benefit the economy.</p> <p>Retrofitting buildings, working on cities to make them more friendly to cyclists and pedestrians, digging trenches for broadband connections, putting in networks for charging electric vehicles, and planting trees are all examples of \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects that could create jobs in the short term and reduce emissions permanently, according to Stern. \u201cThese are things that can be done quickly, and they are labour intensive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPolicymakers have time to design policy that both accelerates our economic recovery and reduces inequality,\u201d said O\u2019Callaghan. \u201cIt is time to rethink economic stimulus. This spending should be about more than just increasing next year\u2019s GDP. Once-in-a-generation government spending could be used to reduce inequality and set up new industries for the coming decade.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The big debate over the past few days has been whether it\u2019s safe to open schools to children other than those those of key workers or classed as vulnerable. However, this isn\u2019t quite the right question to be asking. There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community, it\u2019s about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling. What we should be asking is whether schools are <em>safe enough</em> to open. To answer this, of course, you have to have data. What is needed to inform decisions is information and real-time monitoring, at the local level, to tell us what the daily number of new cases and rate of transmission is. Those concrete numbers should be what drives policy, not a set of abstract arguments, even less an ideological battle.</p> <p>In the absence of this data, the proposal to reopen schools in England on 1 June remains controversial among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\">teaching unions, the British Medical Association, staff</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/rushed-and-premature-parents-reveal-fears-over-schools-reopening-amid-covid-19-crisis\">parents</a> alike. Our view is that schools should reopen as soon as possible, but this must form part of a larger system of \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d strategies, proper support and full transparency about the trade-offs involved and the large scientific uncertainty.</p> <p>That scientific uncertainty surrounds two key questions: the first is the degree to which children can transmit the virus to teachers and parents. The second is the number of children likely to develop a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome several weeks after exposure to coronavirus. <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31103-X/fulltext\">A recent study in the Lancet</a> found a thirtyfold increase in children presenting with this condition in Lombardy, Italy, and the research team warned that other countries experiencing Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks would probably also see a rise in cases. The numbers were small and the evidence suggests that the syndrome is likely to be uncommon but, given that we still don\u2019t have data on exactly how many children have been exposed to the virus, we can\u2019t make a calculation as to how rare it actually is.</p> <p>Elsewhere, we see that Denmark, Norway, Germany and New Zealand are starting to reopen their schools, which raises the question of why those countries might be in a position to do so while the UK is not. Politicians desperate for answers point to a <a href=\"http://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2020-04/NCIRS%20NSW%20Schools%20COVID_Summary_FINAL%20public_26%20April%202020.pdf\">preliminary study </a>from New South Wales in Australia that found that \u201cclose contact\u201d in schools resulted in very little transmission. However, one major caveat is that research was conducted during a period when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/are-schools-open-closed-term-2-australia-coronavirus-easter-holidays\">attendance had dropped to 5%</a>, enabling true physical distancing. In addition, early widespread implementation of <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-contact-tracing\">community testing, contact tracing and isolation</a> of carriers across the country has helped to manage the number of cases. Australia is therefore easing its lockdown against a background of solid control of the virus. The lesson from there and other nations with similarly effective regimes is that the UK needs to suppress the virus and ensure that public health infrastructure is ready to detect new infections and identify clusters rapidly.</p> <p>Given the difficulties around maintaining physical distance in overcrowded state schools, we need to identify innovative strategies involving the use of larger spaces, phased re-entry, or both. <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2020-05-11/students-in-denmark-go-to-school-in-soccer-stadium-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\">In Denmark, some schools have made use of spaces, such as a football stadium</a>, that aren\u2019t currently being used. This may be a particularly useful tool in major cities with larger schools and class sizes. Germany has asked older children to return first, while New Zealand and Israel have prioritised the return of children who are from vulnerable homes, younger children who require adult supervision or pupils who have learning difficulties. The decision to prioritise younger pupils \u2013 because the early years are fundamental to reducing educational inequalities \u2013 or to focus on older pupils \u2013 because they are better able to follow physical distancing rules and have exams and graduation ahead \u2013 is a political one.</p> <p>Flexible thinking is key to balancing the competing demands of safety and educational need. In the UK this could mean schools returning early from the summer holidays. Schools in New Zealand and Thailand have revised the dates of holidays for the remainder of the calendar year to make up for the teaching time lost during the lockdown. All signs point to this virus hitting hard in the coming winter as flu season begins and activity moves largely indoors. We should make optimum use of the summer months to get schools prepared and able to function, alongside a strong public health infrastructure.</p> <p>Given the higher number of coronavirus cases and active community transmission in the UK, a conservative, locally managed approach to schools reopening seems wise. For example, a system whereby the rate of transmission and the number of daily new cases in a given area must be below a set level before schools can reopen could be implemented \u2013 and then only if \u201ctest, trace, isolate\u201d, social distancing, and hygiene and surveillance measures are in place. These conditions should be agreed in consultation with teachers and school heads, and public health, child psychology and education experts.</p> <p>The tragedy is that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">countries </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">that moved the fastest and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">\u201ccrunched the curve\u201d</a> are those that never had to close schools, or are in a strong position to reopen them quickly. While the number of daily Covid-19 deaths grabs headlines, we must not forget the children experiencing hunger from loss of school meals, those living in abusive households and the widening educational deficit. While many scientific and logistical questions remain, what\u2019s clear is that children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are truly paying the price for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/britain-covid-19-head-start-squandered\">UK government\u2019s poor decisions</a> over the past 12 weeks.</p> <p>\u2022 Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.

  "<p>\u2018It\u2019s everything. Tourism feeds me and my daughter. It lets me give jobs to 22 people. It goes into the whole community,\u201d says Naima Montejo, owner of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SurfMedsCaribe/\">Surf Meds Caribe</a>, the only female-run surf school on Costa Rica\u2019s Caribbean coast.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been planting, growing food, trying to come back to our roots,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s not much money, so we\u2019ve been trading. Some trees or seeds, some yucca or plantain. We switch. People are getting together, being creative. What we <em>can </em>do is help each other.\u201d</p> <p>Montejo lives in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, a coastal town known for surf, three-toed sloths and an eight-mile stretch of jungle-edged sandy beach (now behind police tape). With a tropical climate and jubilant mix of Tico, African-Caribbean, indigenous and nearly 70 more nationalities, it touts pared-back beach life and an offbeat Caribbean vibe: languid yet lively. Much of the region is nature reserve. Most of its residents remember a time when the only route to town was the beach and, like a lot of the country, tourism is its lifeforce.</p> <p>Puerto Viejo has been \u201cshut\u201d since 16 March, when Costa Rica declared a state of emergency, and then closed borders, businesses and beaches in quick succession. The country\u2019s mantra, main greeting and answer to all questions, <em>pura vida</em> (literally, pure life), was traded for <em>qu\u00e9date en casa</em> (stay at home).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92d8e784eb7784b6fe19a2aaee01c11943bedbbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92d8e784eb7784b6fe19a2aaee01c11943bedbbf/0_434_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The beach at Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, Costa Rica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The beach at Puerto Viejo de Talamanca.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassia Geller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the exception of a local <em>ley seca </em>(dry law) banning booze sales \u2013 quietly dropped in April \u2013 the general view is that the swift, strict response worked. With its hotels and rental homes shuttered and driving access restricted, remote Puerto Viejo has no registered cases (or hospitals).</p> <p>But running a surf school when the beach is behind police tape, you have no students and strict social distancing is in place \u201chas been hard on all of us,\u201d says Montejo, whose team are all ardent pro-level surfers \u201cusually more in the water than out\u201d.</p> <p>With lessons off, Montejo has got back into landscaping and garden design, and her work as a jeweller. Making ends meet \u201ctakes a lot more energy,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the only thing that really worries me is the guys: a lot of them live from teaching.\u201d</p> <p>Tourism and local livelihoods are inextricable. \u201cIt\u2019s 99.5% of our economy. Other regions have plantations, commerce, ports; we have tourism,\u201d says Roger Sans, who had the dubious honour of becoming president of the <em>C\u00e1mara de Turismo y Comercio Caribe Sur</em> a week before the borders closed. After launching a <em>qu\u00e9date-en-casa</em> campaign, his second act was to open a food bank. It has delivered food parcels to more than 1,000 families.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"834a5b6cd3825cffb274a75aa7073f58e1f70750\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/834a5b6cd3825cffb274a75aa7073f58e1f70750/0_322_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Puerto Viejo de Talamanca on Costa Rica\u2019s Caribbean coast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Puerto Viejo de Talamanca is on Costa Rica\u2019s Caribbean coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassia Geller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The World Tourism Organization estimates the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/07/world-tourism-faces-worst-crisis-since-records-began-says-unwto-report\">Covid-19 crisis could cut international tourist arrivals (around the world) by </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/07/world-tourism-faces-worst-crisis-since-records-began-says-unwto-report\">up to 80%</a> compared with 2019, threatening more than 100 million jobs in the process. In Costa Rica, more money is made in foreign exchange through tourism than via exports such as coffee, bananas, pineapples and pharmaceuticals combined. Official figures, from 2016, documented just over 210,000 people (then 8.8% of the population) working in tourism.</p> <p>The government is paying out a monthly unemployment \u201cbonus\u201d, but only to those \u201cofficially\u201d employed before the crisis. Which leaves out the casual workers, from fishermen to bike rental people, who usually cater to the 400,000 international visitors Costa Rica\u2019s Caribbean area sees every year. Many of this number, plus thousands more Costa Ricans, come especially for Semana Santa, Easter week. Last year, hostel Selina, in Puerto Viejo, sold 1,045 beds between 14 and 20 April.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d never seen anything like it,\u201d says Mat\u00edas Llaituqueo, who runs <a href=\"https://www.costaricaspanishteachers.com/\">Spanish language classes</a> , as well as managing a local hotel and several Airbnb properties. He moved to Puerto Viejo from Argentina 13 years ago. \u201cSemana Santa is incredible here: the people, the traffic, it\u2019s so busy. But this year, nothing. No people on the street: like a ghost town.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d54b74b0783caaeaacbd1a93115f77328659f8e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d54b74b0783caaeaacbd1a93115f77328659f8e0/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mat\u00edas Llaituqueo, right, who provides Spanish language classes; pictured with is daughter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mat\u00edas Llaituqueo, right, who provides Spanish language classes; pictured with his daughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cassia Geller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tourist exodus left established expats and a smattering of travellers, including several escapees from Panama\u2019s locked-down <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/lockdown-leaves-festivalgoers-stranded-on-beach-with-sewage-problem\">Tribal Gathering festival</a>. Some are pleased to wait out the pandemic jungle-side; others are concerned about the start of dengue season and the flesh-eating <em>papalomoyo</em> parasite (fun to say, terrible to have).</p> <p>Of the unafflicted expats, many are following the worldwide upskilling trend. Llaituqueo\u2019s Spanish classes have, if anything, increased: \u201cPeople want to use their time well,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can\u2019t move, they can\u2019t travel, they can\u2019t go to the beach \u2013 so they decide to learn.\u201d</p> <p>The staff at Aguas Claras hotel are also learning: \u201cOur chef is helping out the gardeners, our receptionist is painting chairs, and our manager is helping set up jungle night-lights,\u201d says co-owner Elena Rohrmoser. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all delivering groceries for the families of the<em> </em>schoolchildren in [the nearby village of] Manzanillo. You can\u2019t keep everyone hanging on not doing anything.\u201d</p> <p>Rohrmoser and her mother \u2013 both originally from the capital, San Jos\u00e9 \u2013 opened the hotel a year and a half ago. They\u2019re now facing relative inaction until the end of the year. \u201cIt had just started happening,\u201d Rohrmoser says. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, to give opportunities to so many people and now try to maintain things, keep jobs and keep a sense of perspective.\u201d</p> <p>This week, Costa Rica\u2019s boutique hotels, restaurants and national parks have reopened at limited capacity, while the beach is accessible from 5am-8am. But the impact has already been felt. Shevonne Newton set up <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PVesenciales/\">Puerto Viejo Esenciales</a> to supplement official food banks with necessities such as cooking gas and pet food, but found the need for food was far more urgent.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting dozens of calls a day, from all over,\u201d says Newton, who says there are approximately 7,000 people in Talamanca who need food right now. Already 20% of Costa Rica\u2019s population falls below the national poverty level.</p> <p>\u201cThis has just made it more extreme,\u201d she says. \u201cLocals were already struggling. Now they definitely don\u2019t have their gardening or their cooking positions. Without tourism the businesses just go under.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a3c5f1b76590aa33f6c5871fc5b8e96e05695df1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3c5f1b76590aa33f6c5871fc5b8e96e05695df1/0_101_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sloth Conservation Foundation\u2019s Becky Cliffe, and brown-throated sloth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sloth Conservation Foundation\u2019s Becky Cliffe, and brown-throated sloth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzi Eszterhas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The impact may go beyond people and harm the environment, too. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask people to prioritise conservation when they\u2019re struggling to eat,\u201d says Becky Cliffe, who runs the <a href=\"https://slothconservation.com/\">Sloth Conservation Foundation</a> in Puerto Viejo and holds a PhD in sloth behaviour. Fewer visitors means fewer cars, and fewer tourists harassing the town\u2019s sloth residents, she says. But on the other hand, the crisis can \u201cmean the exploitation of nature: hunting, cutting down trees for wood \u2013 and lost income for the rescue centres\u201d.</p> <p>Nature guide Abel Bustamante agrees: \u201cMany conservation programmes are closed because there are no volunteers. We go to the beach first thing to stop people taking turtle eggs and selling or eating them. Sadly, they mean money or food, and you don\u2019t think about sustainability when you need to eat.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25c5ab8bdf11e497d8f05ca558017d08b352bafd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c5ab8bdf11e497d8f05ca558017d08b352bafd/0_147_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abel Bustamante near a beach in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, Costa Rica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abel Bustamante</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Abel Bustantamente</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The community is using the time to preserve its cherished <em>pura vida</em>, with landlocked surfers reforesting the beachside areas affected by erosion: \u201cWe used to come out of the water, grab some mango, eat right there and go back to surf \u2013 but these trees have disappeared,\u201d says Montejo. \u201cTourism picked up really quickly here. Hopefully, after this we can manage it more respectfully.\u201d </p> <p>There\u2019s a lot to work out: from how to run a biosecure hotel to how to teach surfing in a world of social distancing. But for now, Montejo will join the town\u2019s surfers, swimmers, dog-walkers and fishermen for the sanctioned 5am-8am migration into Puerto Viejo\u2019s indomitable ocean swell. <em>Pura vida</em>.</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago, when Australia\u2019s climate and energy botch-up was still in its infancy, politicians and their advisers used to talk up the virtues of gas as a transitional fuel, and they used to talk about carbon capture and storage (CCS) as technology that governments needed to invest in to drive the transition to low-emissions economies.</p> <p>The great botch-up is now well past infancy, and Australia\u2019s record on climate and energy is a disaster so profound it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/18/for-your-children-former-top-australian-public-servants-call-for-carbon-price\">still traumatising backstage protagonists</a> years after the stadium rock wreckers have left the crime scene.</p> <p>Yet people in power are still talking within the same parameters. Gas. CCS. As if these might be new discoveries \u2013 as if the economics of the transition have remained immutable in the decade we spent watching the political class execute inter-generational failure at our expense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/angus-taylor-says-it-is-not-australian-government-policy-to-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2050\">Angus Taylor says it is not Australian government policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just in case you\u2019ve missed the Morrison government warming up the talking points about Australia\u2019s great gas-led recovery from the economic shock of Covid-19, allow me to bring this winter marketing offensive to your attention. The prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/coalition-eyes-australian-economic-sovereignty-with-boost-to-manufacturing\">several ministers</a>, and some prominent corporate advisers, like the former Fortescue boss Nev Power, are out, banging that drum.</p> <p>We are told cheap gas will help restart an economy hit for six by coronavirus. Cheap gas will boost flagging growth, create jobs, and make projects considered uneconomic five minutes ago suddenly economic.</p> <p>It is gas nirvana, as far as the eye can see \u2013 except it is unclear to me where this cheap gas will come from. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/13/australias-booming-lng-industry-stalls-after-fall-in-oil-prices-amid-coronavirus\">Gas prices have fallen recently</a>, but will these falls be sustained? Are falling gas prices really the environment in which companies will pursue new investments?</p> <p>Won\u2019t they worry about stranded assets? Won\u2019t they worry about carbon risk \u2013 that being a real thing. Ask the Reserve Bank. Or the banking regulator. Or the corporate regulator. Australia\u2019s gas industry needs to be able to extract and sell the resource at a rate of return that justifies any new investments accompanying the opening up of new supply. That\u2019s a basic rule of business, unless there\u2019s some undisclosed fine print.</p> <p>Unless, of course, the real story is taxpayers are going to be saddled with the risks of marginal investments, which makes gas nirvana sound more like a billion-dollar boondoggle dreamed up by a kitchen cabinet of vested interests.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t sound nearly as exciting, does it?</p> <p>Just while we are on this, gas nirvana also has another dimension. It is being invoked, in part, to justify <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/coalition-reveals-new-emissions-reduction-measures-including-paying-polluters-to-stay-under-cap\">the reworking the miserable suite of alleged emissions reduction policies</a> that the Coalition has kept on life support since the Abbott era. If the future is gas and CCS, then the policies will need another tweak to make them fit for purpose, because low emissions are just a matter of definition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/18/for-your-children-former-top-australian-public-servants-call-for-carbon-price\">'For your children': former top Australian public servants call for carbon price</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government says we need to look at CCS because all the sensible people are technologically neutral, not ideological. The goal should be emissions reduction, never mind the means.</p> <p>Fine as far as it goes, except that parable lacks some context. The real story is this: Australia has failed to take meaningful action to reduce emissions, because the Coalition has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/20/a-clean-energy-target-is-not-unconscionable-tony-abbott-wrecking-climate-policy-is\">wrecked progress at every turn for more than 10 years</a>.</p> <p>The truth is the Liberal and National parties have blown the critical decade. That failure is now an implicit justification for more taxpayer support for CCS, because the need may become so pressing that all options will have to be on the table to try and stave off the worst-case scenario \u2013 not that the arguments will ever be framed in such frank terms. The talking point says this: Australia can sequester emissions, we can have our fossil fuel cake and eat it too. Cue applause track.</p> <p>I need to make a couple of things clear because the climate and energy debate has become so toxic and so polarised that all nuance has departed the stage.</p> <p>I have no profound objection to gas as a transitional fuel \u2013 the operative word being transitional. If we pursue gas peaking to firm renewables, that\u2019s one thing. If we bolt gas into the system as a permanent substitute for coal, and justify that substitution on the basis that gas is marginally less emissions-intensive, that\u2019s quite another.</p> <p>I also don\u2019t object to CCS, because as I flagged a minute ago, we might actually need it. If Donald Trump somehow manages to convince Americans to re-elect him in November despite the fact the president represents a clear and present danger to his own citizens, we are going to need a whole lot more than CCS to get the world out of the climate hole it will fall into because of the sustained absence of US leadership.</p> <p>What I\u2019m saying today is two things: resources are finite, and the government has options. Let\u2019s call them option A and option B.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/16/labor-calls-for-end-to-decade-long-barney-on-climate-wars-in-post-pandemic-recovery\">Labor calls for end to 'decade-long barney' on climate wars in post-pandemic recovery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Option A sees the Morrison government choose not to make a mockery of the international climate commitments it signed up to, voluntarily, in 2015. It can use the economic recovery from Covid-19 as an opportunity to drive a low-emissions transition, which will drive sustainable jobs and growth. The government can choose to set Australia up for half a century, not another election cycle. Plenty of smart people think that\u2019s a viable option.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s option B. The government can use the recovery from Covid-19 as cover to lock in fossil fuels for another couple of decades. It can dress up the gas-led recovery as an act of enlightened national sovereignty, a downpayment on enhancing strategic capability, knowing that concept will resonate at a time when Australians are feeling insecure about their economic prospects.</p> <p>Morrison and his ministers and advisers can gamble that a majority of Australians will care more about having a job today than saving the planet tomorrow \u2013 and the worst of it is, that\u2019s not much of a gamble.</p> <p>This sensibility broadly reflects community sentiment. This is how a majority of Australians have voted at every federal election since 2013 \u2013 and that was before we all endured the greatest economic shock since the great depression \u2013 before a global pandemic rendered community-minded activism a second-order issue, a luxury that might be resumed in due course.</p> <p>To be clear: right now, on current indications, the Coalition is limbering up for option B, and trying to make a virtue of it.</p>",

Around 5am, when the sun started rising, we saw Malta, we saw the buildings of Malta. Everyone was happy and yelling.\u2019\u2019</p> \n<p>The migrants said they were intercepted by the vessel. \u201cThey gave us life vests and around 20 or 25 people jumped into the water and almost drowned,\u201d said another survivor. \u201cSo [the Maltese boat] started turning around so we wouldn\u2019t swim to the city. They were likely to kill us. They made waves. They gave us ropes and told us to hold on to the ropes and tie them to our boat and go back.\u201d</p> \n<p>According to the witnesses, a second AFM vessel arrived at the scene and an officer informed the dinghy passengers that Malta was infected by the virus and unable to accept more people. </p> \n<p>\u201cThen one of the Maltese officials said, \u2018Ok we made a decision, we won\u2019t return you to Libya\u2019,\u201d said another survivor. \u201cHe said, \u2018We will show you the route to Italy\u2019.\u201d We said, \u2018No, we don\u2019t have fuel\u2019.

We told the officials that the previous Maltese vessel attached a rope to our boat to try pulling us back, but it hit the engine many times and the engine broke. They gave us a new engine, a 45 or 40 Yamaha.\u201d</p> \n<p>The testimony matches photographs provided by the survivors. In a photo taken before the encounter with the Maltese, a \u201cParsun 60\u201d motor can be seen. Afterwards \u201cYamaha\u201d is visible on the new motor, which was allegedly provided. At that point, the Maltese officials gave the migrants the coordinates to reach Sicily.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe kept moving until the next day, and around 10am we arrived in Italy,\u201d said one of the asylum seekers.</p> \n<p>\u201cDoes Malta consider the manoeuvres driven by the AFM vessel P02 in line with search and rescue operation standards?

In the past people have made paintings to commemorate historical moments. Now we\u2019ve got a historical moment happening every 12 hours, every one hour, so it\u2019s, how do you react to that as an artist? How do you make history painting now about probably the most historical event we\u2019re ever going to live through?\u201d</p> <p>His feelings about events change all the time, he says: \u201cAdmiration, frustration, anger \u2026 It is an emotional washing machine.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global confirmed cases near 4.9 million</strong></h2> <p>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 323,286 people are known to have died from Covid-19 while at least 4,897,567 are confirmed as having been infected since the outbreak began. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and statistical recording regimes, as well as suspected undercounting.</p> <h2><strong>Trump says the US having the highest cases worldwide is a \u2018badge of honour\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The US President told reporters at a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-cabinet-meeting-17/\">cabinet meeting</a> that the high number of cases in the US \u2013 far higher than any other country \u2013 is a \u201cbadge of honour\u201d, because it means the US is testing the most. Trump told reporters: \u201cYou know when you say that we lead in cases, that\u2019s because we have more testing than anybody else.\u201d He said he looks at the number \u201cin a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>UN chief praises Africa\u2019s efforts to stem virus</strong></h2> <p>UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Wednesday that the developed world could learn lessons from the preventative measures taken by many African countries to stem the spread of the coronavirus. There have been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths from 88,000 cases of the disease registered throughout the African continent, relatively low numbers compared to over 320,000 deaths worldwide.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil confirms record daily rise in deaths and cases</strong></h2> <p>Brazil has confirmed a record 17,408 cases in the last 24 hours and a record 1,179 deaths. The country now has 271,628 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17,971 people have died. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full.</p> <h2><strong>Covid-19 crisis will push 60m into poverty says World Bank chief</strong></h2> <p>Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said. David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%.</p> <h2><strong>US President claims hydroxychloroquine study is \u2018Trump enemy statement\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Trump claimed a recent United States study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">\u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d</a>. \u201cIf you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were very old.

The beginning of the spring semester has been postponed several times since March as South Korea battled the first large coronavirus outbreak outside China, with classes held online.</p> <h2><strong>China gears up for annual congress</strong></h2> <p>China\u2019s biggest political event of the year opens Friday after months of delay over coronavirus fears, with President Xi Jinping determined to project strength and control over the outbreak despite international criticism and a wounded economy. The annual gatherings have been occasions for the Communist Party to tout its achievements, set the country\u2019s economic agenda and consolidate Xi\u2019s power, but this year\u2019s congress comes on the back of the biggest challenge of Xi\u2019s political life, with a virus that has killed thousands of people, paralysed the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and sparked a bout of online criticism of the government.</p> <h2><strong>WHO assembly passes a resolution to investigate global pandemic response</strong></h2> <p>Member states have backed a resolution strongly supportive of the World Health Organization, after Donald Trump issued a fresh broadside against the UN body, giving it 30 days to make unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/member-states-back-who-after-renewed-donald-trump-attack\">None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections</a> to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries.

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Patrick Wintour and Julian Borger report: </em></p> \n  <p>Member states have backed a resolution strongly supportive of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>, after Donald Trump issued a fresh broadside against the UN body, giving it 30 days to make unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding.</p> \n  <p>A resolution that backed the WHO\u2019s leadership and said there needed to be an investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic won endorsement at the WHO\u2019s annual ministerial meeting on Tuesday.</p> \n  <p>The US president launched his attack late on Monday, sending a lengthy letter outlining America\u2019s belief that the WHO had not been sufficiently independent of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, and had been too willing to accept its explanations for the origins of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n  <p>As the pandemic worsens in the US, and other countries begin a tentative recovery, Trump has sought to blame China and the WHO. The letter accused the WHO of making repeated mistakes, meaning thousands of lives had been lost, and America\u2019s interests not served.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership,\u201d Trump told its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.</p> \n  <p>His attack was timed to coincide with the start of the two-day World <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a> Assembly, which on Tuesday finally backed a draft resolution that supported a WHO-established independent and impartial inquiry into the WHO\u2019s conduct over the coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The resolution, supported by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, on Monday and largely drafted by the European Union, stops short of the kind of international inquiry focused on China\u2019s conduct that was first canvassed by Australia and the US. The Chinese foreign ministry claimed the resolution was completely different from the politically motivated inquiry sought by Australia.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/member-states-back-who-after-renewed-donald-trump-attack\">Member states back WHO after renewed Donald Trump attack</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec46adf8f0864e579f14139\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T23:30:49.399Z\">12.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Senate confirms Trump appointee to FEC</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Senate has confirmed Trey Trainor, a conservative Texas attorney, to the Federal Elections Committee. </p> \n  <p>Trainor, an election law attorney, has pushed for less regulation of money in politics.

Research published by the Mayo Clinic has suggested that \u201coff-label\u201d repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/hydroxychloroquine-trump-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know\">Hydroxychloroquine, Trump and Covid-19: what you need to know</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T21:23:14.470Z\">at 10.23pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec447a38f0864e579f1405f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T21:05:40.952Z\">10.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today so far</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me today.
