  "<p>MPs have labelled British Airways \u201ca national disgrace\u201d for trying to slash its staff terms and conditions during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>In a scathing report, the Commons transport select committee accused BA of making \u201ca calculated attempt to take advantage of the pandemic\u201d through moves that could lead to up to 12,000 staff being laid off and the remaining 30,000 put on inferior contracts.</p> <p>Although the report said some redundancies at BA and other airlines might be inevitable, it condemned the flagcarrier, which has been granted a \u00a3300m Bank of England loan and received \u00a335m a month to furlough thousands of employees.</p> <p>In conclusion, MPs said: \u201cThe behaviour of British Airways and its parent company towards its employees is a national disgrace. It falls well below the standards we would expect from any employer, especially in light of the scale of taxpayer subsidy, at this time of national crisis.\u201d</p> <p>BA issued formal notice to unions at the end of April of its plans to lay off staff and reduce terms and conditions. The 45-day minimum period for consultation will pass on Monday, although immediate redundancies are not expected.</p> <p>The transport committee chair, Huw Merriman, said: \u201cThe impact of coronavirus may sadly mean that the loss of some jobs in the aviation sector is justified. The behaviour of British Airways and its parent company, IAG, is not.\u201d</p> <p>He said MPs would continue to bring pressure to alter BA\u2019s plans, including potentially asking if its airport slots \u2013 it occupies almost half of takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow, Britain\u2019s biggest airport \u2013 could be reviewed on competition grounds.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThis wanton destruction of a loyal workforce cannot appear to go without sanction \u2013 by government, parliamentarians or paying passengers who may choose differently in future.\u201d</p> <p>BA said the report was \u201cfuelled by impassioned messages\u201d rather than the facts, and said: \u201cThe government has no plans to help the sector restart and recover, as evidenced by the introduction of the 14-day quarantine regulation. We find ourselves in the deepest crisis ever faced by the airline industry. A crisis not of our making but one which we must address.</p> <p>\u201cWe will do everything in our power to ensure that British Airways can survive and sustain the maximum number of jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy.\u201d</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic, easyJet and other airlines are expecting to shed a similar proportion of their workforce, but BA\u2019s proposals to force through inferior contracts on staff follow previous attempts, and ensuing industrial disputes, before the pandemic.</p> <p>The report acknowledged the depth of the crisis facing aviation, and said helping the sector\u2019s recovery from a 97% drop in passenger flights and the loss of \u00a320bn in revenue in the UK should be a priority for government. It criticised ministers for failing to act sooner, saying that at four months into the crisis \u201cthe strategy should be more developed\u201d and urged it to set out plans as soon as possible.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it said the quarantine measures introduced last Monday would damage the recovery, and urged it to abandon the policy on review in favour of \u201ca more flexible and risk-based approach to border control\u201d. BA, easyJet and Ryanair have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/12/ba-easyjet-and-ryanair-begin-court-action-over-uk-quarantine-rules\">launched a high court action</a> to overturn rules forcing passengers arriving from abroad to self-isolate for 14 days.</p> <p>MPs also called for a temporary suspension of air passenger duty and business rates payments to help the sector recover.</p> <p>The Unite union, which represents thousands of aviation workers, said the report was \u201can immediate wake-up call to the government\u201d.</p> <p>The union\u2019s assistant general secretary, Diana Holland, said: \u201cThe chancellor first promised support for aviation in March and three months later that still has not materialised. The aviation industry must also respect the report\u2019s findings and stop prematurely making workers redundant.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the report, a government spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise that this will be a very distressing time for all employees in the aviation industry and their families. We encourage businesses to respect the spirit of measures such as the job retention scheme.However, we stand ready to support those who may still lose their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cWe continue to work at speed to help protect the long-term future of the sector. However, we will always put public health first, and we must not risk an extremely damaging second wave of the virus.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Environmentalists cheered by huge improvements in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/clean-air-in-europe-during-lockdown-leads-to-11000-fewer-deaths\">air quality</a> during the lockdown \u2013 and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/09/great-britain-coal-free-industrial-revolution-electricity\">collapse in coal</a> power generation \u2013 have another reason to celebrate. Even the stock market has gone in their favour.</p> <p>A detailed number-crunching of environmentally sustainable funds has revealed that they have outperformed traditional funds across the board \u2013 beating them during the pandemic as well as during the 10 years up to and including the coronavirus sell-off.</p> <p>The data, from the global research agency Morningstar, comes amid growing evidence that environmentally focused investing \u2013 once pigeonholed by City traditionalists as only for a vegan/hippy minority \u2013 is becoming mainstream. This week, Vanguard, one of the world\u2019s biggest fund managers, launched two ethical index funds aimed at UK investors, while Aviva, Britain\u2019s biggest insurer, unveiled a \u201cclimate transition\u201d fund.</p> <p>Morningstar examined 745 sustainable funds and compared them against 4,150 traditional funds, and found they matched or beat returns in all categories \u2013 whether bonds or shares, UK or abroad.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The outperformance continued during the coronavirus crisis</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAverage returns and success rates for sustainable funds suggest that there is no performance trade-off associated with sustainable funds. In fact, a majority of sustainable funds have outperformed their traditional peers over multiple time horizons,\u201d it says.</p> <p>Over 10 years, the average annual return for a sustainable fund invested in large global companies has been 6.9% a year, while a traditionally invested fund has made 6.3% a year.</p> <p>The outperformance continued during the coronavirus crisis. \u201cIn all but one category considered in the study, sustainable funds outperformed, with average excess returns in Q12020 ranging between 0.09% and 1.83% across categories,\u201d Morningstar says.</p> <p>One reason may be that many US tech stocks, popular among environmental investors, have soared during the crisis, while shares in oil, gas and coal companies have plummeted. The Nasdaq index of US tech stocks has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/us-nasdaq-index-wiped-out-all-of-2020s-losses-triggered-by-covid-19\">recovered completely</a> from the coronavirus crisis, reaching new highs this week, while the oil giant ExxonMobil is trading at $53 compared with $70 before the lockdown.</p> <p>The Morningstar researchers noted that sustainable funds are longer-lasting than their peers. One of the tricks of the asset management industry is that funds that do badly are quietly removed \u2013 usually by merging them with another, better-performing fund. This has the effect of flattering the overall performance figures, suggesting that investors are doing better over the longer term than they really are. Morningstar found that three-quarters of sustainable funds lasted 10 years or more, compared with less than half of traditional funds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7df2a4db32bd6e2d91dbc0db62f2e96d368a1cd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7df2a4db32bd6e2d91dbc0db62f2e96d368a1cd5/105_133_2074_1244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shares in oil companies have plummeted.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shares in oil companies have plummeted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallagher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campaigners welcomed the confirmation that sustainable funds are better.

  "<p>A member of a government Covid-19 recovery taskforce has rejected the overwhelming focus on gas as the path out of recession, saying the country risked ending up with stranded fossil fuel infrastructure and should be doing more to back renewable energy.</p> <p>Paul Bastian, national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and a member of a manufacturing taskforce advising the federal government\u2019s handpicked National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC), said gas had a significant role to play, but the importance of cheap clean energy in cutting costs for industry had barely featured in public discussion when it should be \u201cfront and centre\u201d.</p> <p>Bastian declined to comment directly on a leaked draft report by the manufacturing taskforce, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/leaked-covid-19-commission-report-calls-for-australian-taxpayers-to-underwrite-gas-industry-expansion\">revealed by Guardian Australia last month</a>, that recommended the Morrison government underwrite a massive expansion of the gas industry, including helping open new fields and build hundreds of kilometres of pipelines, citing a confidentiality agreement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/leaked-covid-19-commission-report-calls-for-australian-taxpayers-to-underwrite-gas-industry-expansion\">Leaked Covid-19 commission report calls for Australian taxpayers to underwrite gas industry expansion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But he confirmed gas had \u201ccompletely dominated\u201d taskforce discussions, while renewable energy played a much smaller role.

This time, it describes the peak in consumption that will occur as the natural growth in demand is whittled away by the increasing number of electric vehicles on the road.</p> <p>According to research by not-for-profit group Carbon Tracker released on Thursday, the decarbonisation of the global economy under the Paris Agreement, which is designed to limit global heating to less than 2C, is likely to slash the value of oil, gas and coal reserves by two thirds.</p> <p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, analysts thought the peak in demand for oil might be five years away, Everitt says.</p> <p>\u201cNow the theory is that demand will take so long to recover from coronavirus that it will never come back,\u201d he says.</p> <p>While in the short term a fall in demand should also reduce petrol prices, the fear is that it could make it uneconomic to refine oil in Australia, leaving the country completely dependent on imports.</p> <p>\u201cThe pressure on operators is pretty intense,\u201d Everitt says.</p> <p>\u201cIf I was a large institution invested in an oil company listed in Australia&nbsp;I would want to know what the plan is.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Late-night hosts are, by conventional wisdom, comedians \u2013 entertainers who commune with \u201cour moment\u201d somewhere on a spectrum between playful to biting. Which is a tall order, as our moment keeps getting darker, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation\">flooded with bullshit</a> increasingly exposed but rarely expunged. A late-night host in the overwritten script that is 2020 has been tasked with discussing, somehow <em>processing</em> (a word taxed beyond its means this year) the impeachment of the president; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">mishandling of a public health emergency</a> by the federal government; the loss of more than 100,000 Americans in a global pandemic; the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression; the gruesome killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> by Minneapolis police on camera, which has sparked the most widespread protest movement for racial justice since the 1960s; and brutal crackdowns by police on people protesting against police brutality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/12/jimmy-kimmel-trump-confederate-monuments-late-night-recap\">Jimmy Kimmel: 'Nascar now has done more to fight racism than the president'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Late-night TV has proven to be a strangely helpful way for many to stay tethered to, rather than escape from, the feverish timeline of this deeply unfunny year and reality TV presidency. Though the genre remains overwhelmingly white and male, programs such as the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the Daily Show with Trevor Noah and Jimmy Kimmel Live! can dispense with the both sides-ism still rampant in mainstream media, or cable news\u2019s fixation with images of burned property, or the false (white) ideal of objectivity in journalism. The programs are almost all politically engaged and mildly outraged by default, serving neither as antidote nor an escape so much as a bracing tonic \u2013 manageable, congenial content that gets down enough important information without tipping into paralyzing overwhelm.</p> <p>Still, the Black Lives Matter protests since the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day has presented late-night shows with a challenge: how to adapt to a surging movement without seeming didactic, aloof or problematic; to avoid the gauzy \u201cpreach love, reject hate\u201d emptiness of celebrity statements, or seem too passive to the moral imperative for racial justice and accountability. Each host has had to recalibrate to the warp speed of widespread protests under a hostile administration in a pandemic, revealing a range of sharpness and political immediacy for each show and audience.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMpbwODjNTA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XMpbwODjNTA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The struggle of articulating the summer of 2020 is best embodied by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/02/stephen-colbert-on-george-floyd-death\">Tonight Show\u2019s Jimmy Fallon</a>, the host striving most for the ever-disappearing political middle. The Tonight Show is usually a wheelhouse of affable celebrity interviews and YouTube-worthy game segments. But on 1 June, Fallon, a gregarious comedian still living down the infamous Trump hair-tousling moment from 2016, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=XMpbwODjNTA&amp;feature=emb_logo\">offered a vulnerable mea culpa</a> after video from 2000 of him donning blackface to impersonate comedian Chris Rock on Saturday Night Live circulated on Twitter. Nervous and solemn, he admitted he didn\u2019t know what to do other than speak up, since \u201cthe silence is the biggest crime that white guys like me and the rest of us are doing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to say something, we need to keep saying something. And we need to say \u2018that\u2019s not OK\u2019 more than just one day on Twitter,\u201d Fallon urged. \u201cWe can\u2019t just hope that everyone loves each other. We can\u2019t say, \u2018Be the change.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Since then, Fallon has taken the mildest tack into America\u2019s, and particularly white America\u2019s, moment of racial reckoning: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=XMpbwODjNTA&amp;feature=emb_logo\">an interview with the NAACP president, Derrick Johnson</a>; a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhU0rSSZPk4\">comic bit</a> with the Tonight Show writer Tim Barnes on white guilt meltdowns via \u201cjust checking in\u201d texts; and an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJvUw27vrNs\">interview with former tennis player James Blake</a> about his assault by a New York police officer before the US Open in 2015.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9XtUDB4ykA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s9XtUDB4ykA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Jimmy Kimmel, who strives for the everyman but has pivoted in the past three years to frequently mocking Trump, also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/03/seth-meyers-on-trump-the-worst-case-scenario-is-here\">spoke of a personal reckoning</a> catered to an audience potentially defensive or uncomfortable sitting with the idea of white privilege. Kimmel was once defensive about the term, too, he admitted. \u201cI rejected it, because I didn\u2019t understand what white privilege meant,\u201d he said, and offered viewers a concrete starting definition: \u201cWhite privilege doesn\u2019t mean your life hasn\u2019t been hard, it just means the color of your skin isn\u2019t one of the things that makes it harder.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, shows whose host, time slot and network favor unapologetically political personas have doubled down on monologues as urgent, frustrated clarifiers peppered with pop or consumer culture references. Seth Meyers, who has staked his claim on Closer Look segments \u2013 extended monologues specifically and repeatedly lambasting Trump and his associates \u2013 has almost dispensed with jokes altogether in his fire alarms about America\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/03/seth-meyers-on-trump-the-worst-case-scenario-is-here\">worst-case scenario</a>\u201d descent into authoritarianism and calls for radical reform.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV5srZTCX9k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YV5srZTCX9k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Meyers, along with Samantha Bee and John Oliver, has not only recapped the popularity of calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV5srZTCX9k\">worked to destigmatize the concept</a> for a (probably sympathetic) white audience and offered space for activists such as Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, to explain movement aims. Bee urged viewers to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1LnTOaZtO4\">defund the police</a>!\u201d while Oliver spent 33 minutes on the racist history of American policing and the argument to defund it on Last Week Tonight, then explained the concept <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwJIYtzOLRI\">as a guest on Fallon\u2019s show</a>.</p> <p>Somewhere in the middle of personal examination and political action lies Stephen Colbert, an erudite former political satirist who took over the top ratings slot when, after a year and a half at the Late Show, he committed to monologues frequently roasting Trump. Colbert\u2019s monologues on the protests shrewdly thread the needle between recapping the demonstrations and understanding calls to defund police without explicitly echoing them; his guests have included the politicians Stacey Abrams and Cory Booker and black media figures Emmanuel Acho and Charlamagne Tha God.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s Trevor Noah, the only host of color in this group. A master code-switcher (and polyglot), Noah has seamlessly tailored seasoned understanding of uprising and oppression, as a biracial man growing under apartheid and a police state in South Africa, to the potential defensiveness and confusion of a mostly white audience.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4amCfVbA_c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v4amCfVbA_c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4amCfVbA_c\">18-minute video</a> now viewed more than 8m times, Noah tempered fixations on \u201clooting\u201d with an explanation of the uprising\u2019s logical, necessary response to the violation of society\u2019s social contract. \u201cThat unease that you felt watching that Target being looted, try to imagine how it must feel for black Americans when they watch themselves being looted every single day,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s fundamentally what\u2019s happening in America: police in America are looting black bodies.\u201d</p> <p>In an illustration of the current late-night processing ecosystem, Noah\u2019s video was cited by <a href=\"https://www.kimjoneswrites.com/\">Kimberly Jones</a>, a black activist in Minneapolis, in a viscerally emotional two-minute clip. \u201cTrevor Noah said it so beautifully last night,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a social contract that we all have, that if you steal or if I steal, then the person who is the authority comes in and they fix the situation, but the person who fixes the situation is <em>killing us</em>.\u201d Jones\u2019s anvil-heavy words served as the backbone for Oliver\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/08/john-oliver-us-policing-is-a-structure-built-on-systemic-racism\">Last Week Tonight episode on the protests and police brutality</a> the next week. \u201cThe best thing for us to do was to basically to give 33 minutes of context for that two-minute clip, and then just shut up,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwJIYtzOLRI\">Oliver told Fallon</a>.</p> <p>Oliver offers perhaps the best model for late-night in the summer of 2020, a time when so many need to listen, and the hosts are paid to talk: step up with context, education and inquiry \u2013 made more, not less, potent by the flexibility of genre.</p>",

  "<p>No country is emerging unscathed from the Covid-19 pandemic, but the impact on the world\u2019s poorest countries is especially severe. Extreme poverty is on the rise and underfunded health systems are woefully ill-prepared to cope with the virus. The number of children in Africa dying of preventable diseases is increasing. The gains made in development since the turn of the millennium are being reversed.</p> <p>The international community is well aware of what\u2019s happening. More than 100 countries have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-world-bank-imf-resources/imf-chief-economist-says-100-countries-seek-pandemic-aid-more-resources-may-be-needed-idUSKCN21W2UQ\" title=\"\">sought financial help</a> from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF\u2019s sister organisation, the World Bank, says emerging market and developing economies will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/08/world-bank-warns-covid-19-pandemic-risks-dramatic-rise-in-poverty\" title=\"\">shrink</a> by 2.5% this year, their first collective contraction in 60 years. The G20 \u2013 the body that brings together the biggest players from the developed and developing worlds \u2013 has recognised that oppressively high debt levels make it impossible for low-income countries to boost health spending.</p> <p>The response to this unfolding human tragedy has been inadequate in every respect. The IMF has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/dozens-poorer-nations-seek-imf-help-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">nothing</a> like the bare minimum of $2.5tn it says is needed to meet the demands for help. A debt-relief deal agreed in April excludes money that poor countries have borrowed from China and the private sector. The G20 has no meeting planned until November, fully justifying the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/g20-leading-world-out-of-coronavirus-crisis-gordon-brown\" title=\"\">accusation by Gordon Brown</a> that it has gone awol \u2013 absent without lending.</p> <p>Mr Brown\u2019s criticism is all the more telling because he was instrumental, as UK prime minister, in pulling together a response to the 2008 financial crash that included boosting resources for the IMF and World Bank.</p> <p>The situation today is far more serious. Pandemics are nothing new, nor are global recessions. What makes the current crisis unique \u2013 and so terrifying \u2013 is that never before in the modern age have both occurred at the same time. Debt levels were smaller and more manageable for low-income countries in 2008. China\u2019s subsequent strong growth boosted demand for the commodity-producing nations of Africa and Latin America. Above all, there was a willingness to cooperate.</p> <p>The London G20 in April 2009 now looks to have been the last gasp of a multilateral system created in the mid-1940s and no longer fit for purpose. There is, though, no time for a complete overhaul, and for now at least the world will have to cope using the institutions it has got.</p> <p>Developed countries should recognise that their response to Covid-19 \u2013 central banks printing money through quantitative easing programmes and finance ministries running up record peacetime deficits \u2013 is <a href=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/03/25/1585171627000/From-coronavirus-crisis-to--sovereign-debt-crisis/\" title=\"\">not an option</a> for emerging market and developing nations. Rich countries can borrow heavily at rock-bottom interest rates; poor countries cannot.</p> <p>As a result, the IMF and World Bank have to act as the finance ministry and the central bank for those countries that can\u2019t go it alone. To fulfil this role, they need to be properly resourced. The IMF has its own way of creating money, known as special drawing rights, which can be converted into hard currency by member countries. There has rarely, if ever, been a <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/making-imfs-special-drawing-rights-work-covid-19-economic-relief\" title=\"\">stronger case</a> for a new allocation of SDRs. This is also the time for the World Bank to be tripling both its regular lending and the soft loans and grants it provides to the world\u2019s 76 poorest countries through its International Development Association. Credit guarantees from major shareholders would facilitate this.</p> <p>Next month marks the 15th anniversary of the Gleneagles summit at which the G8 delivered a package of debt relief and aid for poor countries. The argument then was that it made sense for rich nations to convert the money they were owed into <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/14/01/49/pr09243\" title=\"\">social investment</a> in poor countries, many of which were paying far more in interest payments on their debt than they were on health and education. That argument is even more compelling in 2020 than it was in 2005.</p> <p>None of this is going to be easy all the time Donald Trump is in the White House, but those developed countries still committed to a <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/g20-must-agree-on-stronger-global-covid19-response-by-gordon-brown-2020-06\" title=\"\">multilateral approach</a> need to show that they are prepared to act on SDRs and debt relief with or without US support. Some of the leadership Mr Brown provided in 2009 would be most welcome.</p>",

He responded with brutal violence. Over the next two years, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/19/un-human-rights-chief-condemns-grotesque-rape-chants-burundi-youth-militia\">youth-led militia group</a>, known as the Imbonerakure, as well as various state security forces, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/fear-warns-burundi-atrocities-polls-190904133751594.html\">killed </a><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/fear-warns-burundi-atrocities-polls-190904133751594.html\">more than 1,200 Burundians</a> in an attempt to quash street protests. Four hundred thousand more fled the country. A born-again Christian, Nkurunziza spent much of that time organising prayer meetings.</p> <p>When donors cut aid, he retaliated by barring most foreign media outlets from reporting inside Burundi. When the <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/burundi\">international criminal court (ICC) </a>opened an investigation into crimes against humanity in 2017, he responded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/28/burundi-becomes-first-nation-to-leave-international-criminal-court\">withdrawing Burundi from the Rome statute</a>; the first nation ever to do so. In 2019, he went a step further and shut down the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">U</a><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">N\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">human rights office </a>in the country after 23 years, claiming he had made sufficient progress in human rights.</p> <p>Yet when Nkurunziza first came to power following the 1993-2005 Burundian civil war, which pitted Hutu rebels against the Tutsi-led army, he had seemed genuinely committed to the ideals of peace and democracy. As the leader of the CNDD\u2013FDD (National Council for the Defence of Democracy \u2013 Forces for the Defence of Democracy) Hutu rebel group, he had begun negotiating a peace deal in 2001. Two years later he signed the <a href=\"https://peacemaker.un.org/node/1207\">Arusha agreement</a>, which ended the civil war, in which 300,000 people died. He transformed his rebel group into a political party and joined the transition government as a minister for good governance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a180bcca7db08b01c48deea4377ea52d8f88853\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a180bcca7db08b01c48deea4377ea52d8f88853/946_0_4526_3273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pierre Nkurunziza, riding a bicycle, with his wife, Denise Bucumi, right, go to vote in the 2015 presidential election, in his birthplace of Ngozi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierre Nkurunziza, riding a bicycle, with his wife, Denise Bucumi, right, go to vote in the 2015 presidential election, in his birthplace of Ngozi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Berthier Mugiraneza/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2005 Nkurunziza became president after his party won the elections by a landslide. A year later he lifted a curfew that had been in place since 1972. In 2007 Burundian soldiers joined an African Union (AU) peacekeeping force in troubled Somalia. The <a href=\"https://umoya.org/2009/03/13/burundi-paris-club-creditors-cancel-burundis-debt/\">Paris Club group</a> of creditors cancelled Burundi\u2019s debt in 2009.&nbsp;</p> <p>But after being re-elected with 92% of the vote in the 2010 poll, which was boycotted by many opposition candidates, Nkurunziza became increasingly authoritarian, power-hungry and intolerant. In 2014 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27818254\">he even banned jogging</a> out of \u201cfears it could be used by his opponents as a cover for subversion\u201d.</p> <p>Burundi was inching so close to another Hutu-Tutsi conflict that in 2016 the AU approved a pre-emptive deployment of a 5,000-strong <a href=\"https://theglobalobservatory.org/2016/02/burundi-nkurunziza-african-union-maprobu/\">African Prevention and Protection Mission </a>in Burundi, which has yet to be deployed because Nkurunziza objected to it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Colonisation has produced many crises that continue to haunt post-independence Africa but few have been as destructive as the Hutu-Tutsi divide. In neighbouring <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26875506\">Rwanda in 1994 it fuelled a genocide in which 800,000 </a>mostly Tutsis were killed by the Hutus. Twenty years earlier, in Burundi, it led to a wave of mass killing of mostly Hutus by the Tutsi-led army following a failed Hutu coup in 1972. Experts estimated that more than 100,000 people were killed.</p> <p>Like Rwanda, the 1972 killings affected Burundi so deeply that it has become a defining political factor.

Nkurunziza\u2019s father, Eustache Ngabisha, a former member of parliament and governor of Ngozi and Kayansi provinces, was a victim of the 1972 ethnic killings. Nkurunziza was eight years old at the time of his death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Born in Ngozi, Nkurunziza was the son of Ngabisha and of Domitille (nee Minani), a Tutsi assistant nurse. After his father\u2019s death, his family moved to Gitega, where Nkurunziza attended Athen\u00e9e de Gitega secondary school.</p> <p>A fitness enthusiast and keen footballer who in later life owned his own team, Hallelujah FC, Nkurunziza studied physical education at the University of Burundi. After graduation in 1990, he worked as a high school PE teacher at Muramvya high school. He married Denise Bucumi, who later became a pastor, in 1994.</p> <p>The following year, while working as a lecturer at the University of Burundi, in Bujumbura, Nkurunziza was shot at during a Tutsi attack on the campus, which killed hundreds of students. He joined one of several rebel Hutu groups, CNDD\u2013FDD, as a soldier.&nbsp;Two of his six siblings were killed after civil war erupted in 1993 and three others died while fighting with CNDD-FDD. By 1998 Nkurunziza was promoted to deputy secretary-general of the group, and in 2001 became its leader.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb01ebc0ae6464f3f642b53c6eb0b7a1da884e10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb01ebc0ae6464f3f642b53c6eb0b7a1da884e10/0_11_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-government protestors in Bujumbura, 2015.

  "<p>Eschewing recently fashionable titles such as curator and art educator, Alister Warman, who has died of cancer aged 73, described what he did as \u201cworking with artists\u201d. The first official director of the Serpentine Gallery, from 1983 to 1991, then principal of the Byam Shaw School of Art, both in London, Alister had an approach that was always intuitive and collaborative, rather than strategic.</p> <p>The Serpentine Gallery&nbsp;had opened in a former tea pavilion in Hyde Park in 1970, under the authority of the Arts Council, with Sue Grayson as gallery \u201corganiser\u201d; in 1987, four years into Alister\u2019s tenure, it became a trust, independent of the council. Alister\u2019s diverse programme reflected his belief that the quality of the strongest artists stemmed from waywardness and conviction. British painters working in different idioms were given one-person exhibitions: Kenneth Martin and Ivon Hitchens; Tess Jaray and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jul/25/maggi-hambling-artist\">Maggi Hambling</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/29/frank-bowling-painter-six-decade-journey-to-success-tate\">Frank Bowling</a> and Ken Kiff.&nbsp;In 2018 he reflected that \u201csome of the artists might seem parochial in the context of the global firmament that has become the norm\u201d. However this programming, as well as his openness to different media, such as ceramics, textiles and printed ephemera as well as painting and sculpture, now seems prescient.</p> <p>Unusually, photographers were shown in depth, in exhibitions such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/another-country-photographs-north-east-england/\">Another Country</a> (1985), Chris Killip\u2019s and Graham Smith\u2019s photographs taken in the north-east of England; a pioneer look at Japanese photography in&nbsp;Black Sun: The Eyes of Four (1986);&nbsp;and&nbsp;Eug\u00e8ne Atget: Photographs of Old France (1984). </p> <p>Female artists were given solo exhibitions at a time when that was uncommon, notably a first British show for <a href=\"http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/louise-bourgeois-nature-study-0/\">Louise Bourgeois</a> in 1985, and, later, younger sculptors such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/22/alison-wilding-review-sculpture-de-la-warr-pavilion-bexhill-on-sea\">Alison Wilding</a>, Rebecca Horn and Alice Aycock. Paulo Rego\u2019s show in 1988 coincided with what Alister described in the catalogue preface as \u201ca sea-change\u201d in her work \u2013 the more realistic figures from her intimate life were enacting dramas. He cited the menace of the just-completed painting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/artpages/rego_paula_the_family.htm\">The Family</a>,&nbsp;in which two young women try to revive an ailing man, one rubbing against him, and speculated correctly that Rego \u201chad discovered a key to unlock the furniture containing her childhood fears. And in having the courage to use this key she has at the same time become an artist of the first rank.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d343f8d5944898284b9b47fd8b879b570ae672e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d343f8d5944898284b9b47fd8b879b570ae672e8/104_93_2215_2767/801.jpg\" alt=\"A Louise Bourgeois sculpture from her first solo British show, at the Serpentine Gallery in 1985, organised by Alister Warman.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Louise Bourgeois sculpture from her first solo British show, at the Serpentine Gallery in 1985, organised by Alister Warman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Serpentine Galleries</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead of always curating group exhibitions at the Serpentine himself, Alister gave a free hand to critics such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/adriansearle\">Adrian Searle</a> and Andrew Brighton. His light touch was also demonstrated by <a href=\"https://www.danielburen.com/images/exhibit/591?ref=search&amp;q=Serpentine\">Structure for Two Catalpas</a>, a 1987 piece by Daniel Buren named after the grand trees on the gallery lawn, where the French artist used a transversal wall articulated by his signature vertical stripes to join the inside and outdoor spaces. A cool LA aesthetic prevailed in the 1990 exhibition of Ed Ruscha\u2019s new paintings.</p> <p>Alister viewed his 1991 move to the Byam Shaw School of Art as an opportunity to remake the independent art college. His first step was to abolish departments for different media and insist on a single \u201cfine art\u201d course. Regular visiting artists would be invited to the school on the same day, giving them the chance to meet each other and hang out with the students in Esmeralda\u2019s Brazilian cafe. Although students and staff regretted the loss of independence when the Byam Shaw became part of the much larger Central Saint Martins in 2003, the change brought access to state-of-the-art facilities and survival. Alister hoped that the school\u2019s \u201cresourcefulness \u2026 would allow it to adapt more quickly to changing circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Harrow, north-west London, Alister was the second of five children of Zillah (nee Whittle), and Mark Warman, a classicist who taught at Harrow school after the second world war. After Harrow, Alister studied at the Courtauld Institute of Art (1966-69) and in 1971 joined Newcastle Polytechnic to teach art history. After a year travelling in South America, in 1976 he went to the Arts Council of Great Britain, based in Piccadilly, London, first working on grants and projects.</p> <p>When he became the Arts Council\u2019s officer responsible for art in public spaces, in the early 1980s he commissioned Bridget Riley (then temporarily out of the limelight) to make a large wall painting for the Royal Liverpool University hospital.&nbsp;It did not survive rebuilding but was remade in 2017 for the <a href=\"https://www.maxhetzler.com/news/2017-05-16-bridget-rileybridget-riley-solo-show-chinati-foundation-marfa-6-october-2017-2019\">Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas</a>. Working with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/apr/23/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">Eduardo Paolozzi</a> as the artist produced mosaics for Tottenham Court Road station on the London Underground from 1979, Alister convinced him to use black and white for the Northern line and colour for the Central.</p> <p>In 1983, after an open competition, Alister became the first person designated \u201cdirector\u201d of the Serpentine Gallery. At the farewell for his successor, in 2016, one speaker described the place Julia Peyton-Jones encountered on her arrival as a \u201cpotting shed\u201d. There were gasps from the audience until those who were familiar with Alister\u2019s tenure and character thought of how he preferred to nurture rather than showcase careers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33cbc6a4077576a7204f1789fe2467c7f0c047e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33cbc6a4077576a7204f1789fe2467c7f0c047e2/534_0_4446_2669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As the Arts Council officer responsible for art in public spaces, Alister Warman worked with Eduardo Paolozzi when he was producing mosaics for Tottenham Court Road station on the London Underground.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As the Arts Council officer responsible for art in public spaces, Alister Warman worked with Eduardo Paolozzi when he was producing mosaics for Tottenham Court Road station on the London Underground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jansos/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After leaving Byam Shaw, Alister continued to work with artists, on the board of the independent spaces Gasworks and Peer, and on the <a href=\"http://www.kennetharmitagefoundation.org.uk/\">Kenneth Armitage Foundation</a> and the City &amp; Guilds of London Art School. Riley and, later, the estate of Anthony and Sheila Caro employed him to advise on options for their foundations.</p> <p>Over a lifetime, intertwined pleasures came from close and attentive looking at paintings and birds in the landscape. In a conversation with the artist Ruth Maclennan for her project Hide (2010), he explained that Archway Tower (now Vantage Point), viewed from his desk at Byam Shaw, served as a guidepost for cormorants commuting from Hampstead Ponds to roost at Walthamstow reservoirs.</p> <p>Alister is survived by his partner of 31 years, the artist Alison Turnbull, by Jake and Rebecca, his children from his first marriage, to Anne Guthrie, which ended in divorce in 1990, and by four grandchildren, Dylan, James, Oliver and Suki.</p> <p>\u2022 Alister Seager Warman, curator and art school principal, born 9 December 1946; died 29 May 2020</p>",
  "<p>Most businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base \u2013 half the <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/01/30/1977203/0/en/Digital-2020-Social-media-use-spans-almost-half-global-population.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">world\u2019s population is now on social media</a> \u2013 it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.</p> <p>Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of \u201cjob done\u201d, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.&nbsp;</p> <p>Beyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what\u2019s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.&nbsp;</p> <p>But as well as all this modern stuff \u2013 the basics are still important too.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cOn the high street you wouldn\u2019t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,\u201d says PR and social media expert <a href=\"https://www.mikecrutchleymedia.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mike Crutchley</a>.</p> <p>As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cSocial media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,\u201d he says. \u201cHigh-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.\u201d</p> <p>The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd1a6f22277e0ca67a527ecdc87f078a4cbe3569\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd1a6f22277e0ca67a527ecdc87f078a4cbe3569/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hands of woman artisan taking aphoto of her handmade plant pot at her studio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">High quality images and video are vital on social media.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stocksy United</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Shareability matters</h2> <p>Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don\u2019t engage and share your original posts then you\u2019re missing a huge potential source of customers.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created <a href=\"https://clapforourcarers.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">clapforourcarers.co.uk</a> with <a href=\"https://uk.godaddy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoDaddy</a>.</p> <p>Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,\u201d says Plas.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/go-make-it/2020/jun/12/freeze-dried-fruit-and-brownies-how-having-a-website-kept-these-businesses-thriving-when-lockdown-hit\">Freeze-dried fruit and brownies: how having a website kept these businesses thriving when lockdown hit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.&nbsp;</p> <p>The first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.</p> <p>Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.\u201d</p> <p>Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Becoming an influencer</h2> <p>\u201cSome influencers get a bad reputation,\u201d says Masha Zvereva, founder of <a href=\"https://codingblonde.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coding Blonde</a>. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.</p> <p>Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cInfluencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don\u2019t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you\u2019re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cAnyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I\u2019d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people\u2019s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?\u201d</p> <h2>Building a brand</h2> <p>Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can\u2019t be overstated.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is something Zaffrin and Brian O\u2019Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company <a href=\"https://www.fivedotbotanics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Five Dot Botanics</a> set out to do well before their company launched.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c019d31e0a05e500bfad4d6c968d89b093c80f5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c019d31e0a05e500bfad4d6c968d89b093c80f5b/0_0_573_764/375.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: 'Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand'\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cSocial media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,\u201d says Zaffrin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Before setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.&nbsp;</p> <p>The stories the O\u2019Sullivans shared weren\u2019t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.</p> <p>Once the social channels were up and running, the O\u2019Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy\u2019s services \u2013 and they were in business.</p> <p>Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you\u2019re willing to put money behind it \u2013 paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is \u201cone to watch\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cOur audience are our fans,\u201d she says. \u201cThey root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want.

  "<p>Starting a business and planning for its future once involved bricks and mortar, shelves, tills and customers walking through your door. Not so today. Even before the coronavirus lockdown limited people\u2019s trips to retailers in the flesh, online shopping was flying high. According to the <a href=\"https://www.worldretailcongress.com/__media/Global_ecommerce_Market_Ranking_2019_001.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Global Ecommerce Market Ranking 2019</a>, the UK has the world\u2019s fourth largest e-commerce market in revenue terms, and the third highest percentage of online shoppers, at almost 80%. And it\u2019s set to continue. Research by the analysts Retail Economics last year found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/09/half-of-uk-retail-sales-will-be-online-within-10-years-report-predicts\">53% of retail sales</a> were expected to be online by 2028. In the wake of lockdown, it seems likely this trend will only accelerate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/go-make-it/2020/jun/01/from-promotions-to-gift-cards-how-a-great-website-keeps-customers-coming-back-again-and-again\">From promotions to gift cards: how a great website keeps customers coming back again and again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given the way that we shop is changing, it has never been more important for retailers to get online. In a survey for the website builder <a href=\"https://uk.godaddy.com/websites-marketing\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoDaddy</a>, a fifth of micro businesses said they had gone online for the first time during lockdown and nearly half that their use of digital and social media tools had increased.</p> <p>For some, e-commerce has always been part of the plan. The artisan hot chocolate company Knoops opened its first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013, and went on to open a London store in February this year, with more planned. But head of marketing Anna Chapman says that having an online presence was always a key part of the company\u2019s strategy. \u201cChocolate has a broad appeal, and we wanted to be able to reach people in their homes, especially those who didn\u2019t live near our stores,\u201d she says.&nbsp;</p> <p>The company\u2019s <a href=\"https://knoops.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a> centres around its hot chocolate maker, the Knoopifier, with owners getting access to online subscriptions for pouches of \u201cKnoopifier\u201d chocolate buttons delivered to their home. The website has always been an important part of the company\u2019s strategy, but Chapman says that lockdown emphasised this further.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"49b6fc1fcca1f3c623bf098be42781af64184eb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49b6fc1fcca1f3c623bf098be42781af64184eb7/0_0_573_764/375.jpg\" alt=\"Quote: 'We started to rebuild our website and have far more focus on a functional online shop'\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhile our doors were closed, it was obviously the only way we could take any revenue at all, and we were able to focus our efforts entirely on our website and social media channels,\u201d she says. \u201cThis importance will remain \u2013 the majority of retailers now accept that an omnichannel approach is vital. Our current situation has been an extremely stark reminder of its importance.\u201d</p> <p>For other SMEs, while a website may have been part of their business, using it to sell is a recent addition. Rob Wilson, \u201cchief toaster\u201d at <a href=\"https://www.toastale.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toast Ale</a>, a craft beer brewer that uses bread which would otherwise be wasted, says that despite having an online presence, it wasn\u2019t really part of the business\u2019s strategy.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe very much focused on building our brand online but our routes to market were bars, pubs, restaurants and retail \u2013 70% of our business was on-trade, about 30% was in conventional retail environments, and a fraction of a percent was online,\u201d he says.</p> <p>But when those sales channels were cut off during lockdown, Toast Ale, which donates its profits to sustainability charities, was forced to shift its sales online. \u201cWe started to rebuild our website and have far more focus on a more functional online shop. It has massively transformed our business and helped us survive \u2013 it\u2019s become a huge opportunity to reach a whole new audience. We just hadn\u2019t thought about it as a sales channel and now we\u2019ve suddenly realised its potential.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, Chris Fryer, founder of the vegan pie business <a href=\"https://magpye.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magpye</a>, hadn\u2019t really explored e-commerce, instead selling pies from his converted horse box at events and supplying local pubs in the north of England. \u201cWe had a full calendar of events booked. We were supplying pubs with pies and had just expanded, dropping off to four or five pubs twice a week. Then our income stopped \u2013 it was a cliff-edge.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Like Wilson at Toast Ale, Fryer realised quickly that he would have to shift to e-commerce and has been similarly amazed by the effect it has had.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment we\u2019re just doing local deliveries across the north east but we\u2019re looking into expanding. Our plan potentially is to sell our horsebox and become a web-based pie shop,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e8e58324389d4460b4603e3de76abcd809600d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e8e58324389d4460b4603e3de76abcd809600d8/2634_0_3072_3840/800.jpg\" alt=\"Small business ownersWorking women at their store They wearing casual clothing, accepting new orders online and take photo of packed merchandise for customer\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Online tools - such as those offered by GoDaddy - make it easy to create a web store and process orders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: svetikd/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it comes to setting up an e-commerce site, there is an increasingly wide range of tools available to business owners from a range of sources. They include web hosting companies such as GoDaddy, which has created <a href=\"https://openwestand.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open We Stand</a> \u2013 a portal of resources for small businesses during lockdown. Fryer says that while he has some experience building websites, it was quicker and easier to turn to readymade tools with GoDaddy.</p> <p>\u201cI had the domain registered with GoDaddy but had done nothing with it. Once it became clear we would have to move online I started looking into it. I could have gone down the route of coding it from scratch but it would have taken a week or two, especially things like payment options. With the GoDaddy tools it took half a day, then I spent a day or two testing and it was ready to go. Although we didn\u2019t use the option, I knew GoDaddy would build the site for you for free if you needed,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThey do a free three-month trial, so there\u2019s really nothing to lose by having a go. The admin side, monitoring it, doing the orders is all quite simple, so even if you\u2019ve got no skills whatsoever I don\u2019t think many people would struggle with it.\u201d</p> <p>At Toast Ale, the switch was led by COO Louisa Ziane, who has experience of managing websites. Wilson is adamant that the work has paid off, with e-commerce proving an \u201camazing opportunity\u201d, not just now but, he believes, in the future. \u201cI would say that at current rates we\u2019re looking at probably half a million pounds of revenue coming from our online shop.

The videotaped killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has triggered antiracist protests in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-take-place-in-cities-around-the-world\">every corner of the planet</a>. People have taken to the streets in Paris and Berlin, Tel Aviv and Stockholm; Floyd\u2019s face has been painted as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HaraldDoornbos/status/1270437663003246594\">mural on a shattered wall</a> in Idlib, Syria. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d has become a universal slogan. Floyd once told a high school classmate, \u201cI want to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/podcasts/the-daily/george-floyd-protests-funeral.html?showTranscript=1\">touch the world</a>\u201d. And he has.</p> <p>Of course, the protests are not solely in solidarity with Floyd and black Americans. In each country, they have been rooted in the very specific <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aamnamohdin/status/1271010943422599169\">experience of that </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aamnamohdin/status/1271010943422599169\">country</a>. But America was the spur to action. Bristolians had been campaigning for years against the statue of Edward Colston. But it took the killing of a man in faraway Minnesota <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">to bring it down</a>, and spark a national inquiry into who and what gets memorialised in stone and bronze \u2013 the debate that got Johnson\u2019s Twitter finger twitching, and to which we shall return.</p> <p>It\u2019s a paradox. The world denounces the racism that remains the defining birth defect of the United States, pointing its collective finger at that country to shame it \u2013 and yet, by that very act of castigation, it confirms America\u2019s power. The US is still the global arena, the place where issues that vex every nation are played out. It remains the reflecting glass in which so much of the world sees itself.</p> <p>Racism offers a clear example. There is hate in every country, of course, but largely thanks to its colonisation of the global imagination through TV and movies, America\u2019s horrors are endowed with a vivid, even epic quality that somehow renders them uniquely universal. A killing in Minneapolis can trigger a global reaction, in a way that one in Manchester never would. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHBKmT6eNGw\">Gene Hackman</a> never starred in a film called Brixton Burning.</p> <p>The result is that an episode that should be damaging for America\u2019s global influence, its soft power, somehow only adds to it. Just as capitalism can co-opt and profit from anticapitalism \u2013 with corporations now seizing on the slogan Black Lives Matter as a useful bit of <a href=\"https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/global-businesses-embrace-black-lives-matter-movement/\">ad copy</a> \u2013 so the US can gain from its failure to address the racism that has disfigured it since the founding of the republic.</p> <p>We shouldn\u2019t be surprised. This is a country that can turn even its most dysfunctional excesses into commercial gold \u2013 witness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Netflix\u2019s Tiger King</a> \u2013 and it has done so for decades. While Britain tried to hush up its atrocities overseas, even burning incriminating documents through the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/29/revealed-bonfire-papers-empire\">Operation </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/29/revealed-bonfire-papers-empire\">Legacy</a>, Hollywood made a cottage industry of examining, for example, the Vietnam war, cementing its place in international pop culture. And so while British teenagers in the 1980s might know nothing of Britain\u2019s brutal crushing of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12997138\">Mau Mau insurgency</a> in Kenya, they certainly did know that the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sajngb0W6I\">average age of a US </a>combat soldier in Vietnam<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sajngb0W6I\"> </a>was 19.</p> <p>This dynamic works well for America, but it should have the rest of us on our guard. For the aftermath of Floyd\u2019s death has revealed the risks of importing yet another trademark US product: namely, the culture war.</p> <p>Take Johnson and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1271388180193914880\">those tweets</a>. The language (and punctuation) may not have been Trumpian, but the form is pure Trump. Not a speech, not a TV interview, but a direct, unfiltered appeal via social media to his base, and on a topic calculated to polarise public opinion. Cannily, Johnson avoided the question of slaver statues, opting to speak instead in defence of the Whitehall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/far-right-protesters-plan-defence-of-statues-such-as-churchills\">memorial to Winston Churchill</a> defaced by protesters last weekend. You don\u2019t need a poll to tell you that the PM is likely to have a comfortable majority on his side for that one.</p> <p>There is a lesson here for campaigners and activists, a lesson from America. The right loves a culture war, because such a battle changes the subject \u2013 almost always shifting from ground on which they would lose to ground on which they can win.</p> <p>Let\u2019s imagine the initial focus had remained instead on a demand to tackle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/11/honour-george-floyd-learn-lessons-lawrence-inquiry\">discrimination in policing and criminal justice</a>, expanding to include the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\">higher death rates</a> from Covid-19 among black Britons. Johnson and others in power would now be on the defensive, forced to promise action.</p> <p>But once the focus shifted, they could exhale with relief. Not only is a debate about statues or faulty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/11/fawlty-towers-dont-mention-the-war-episode-removed-from-uktv\">TV shows</a> a handy distraction from the specific injustices at the heart of all this, it also splits the coalition, even the consensus, that had, remarkably, formed in revulsion at Floyd\u2019s killing. Once statues of Gandhi and Mandela are also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/1271373255329435650\">boarded</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/1271373255329435650\"> up for their own protection</a>, as they now are, it means precious unity has been lost.</p> <p>Of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">the case against </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">memorials to slavers</a> is cast-iron and just. But widening the focus allows those in charge to stop talking about something hard for them, and shift to something much easier. US-style culture wars don\u2019t just poison the air: even when progressives win, victory often comes at the expense of the structural change that might matter more. In America, celebrities have been coaxed to make the right noises on race for years \u2013 and all the while the Minneapolis police department was left untouched.</p> <p>So let\u2019s be wary of adopting one of the US\u2019s most unappetising exports. Let\u2019s borrow instead the slogan, and wisdom, of its civil rights movement of nearly 60 years ago \u2013 and keep eyes on the prize.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>When Kate Moore, a 21-year-old student, saw the bitterness of the division in her home of Ashbourne over the disappearance of a bust of a black man\u2019s head, she decided to come up with a compromise.</p> <p>Over the last week, the mystery over the whereabouts of the head, which Moore viewed as indisputably racist, has lifted this small Derbyshire town to national prominence. Before that it was best known as the home of Royal Shrovetide, an eccentric, beloved and very English game of \u201cmedieval football\u201d played through the streets each year.</p> <p>Everyone could get behind that, Moore thought. So she mocked up a suggested alternative for the spot where the head had been \u2013 an emblem commemorating the importance of Shrovetide to the town \u2013 and posted it on Facebook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a8baba31817ed046af586bde74869af8d8de102e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8baba31817ed046af586bde74869af8d8de102e/202_64_3208_3209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Moore\u2019s suggested design for a replacement arch in Ashbourne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Moore\u2019s suggested design for a replacement arch in Ashbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Kate Moore/Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The response, as brutal as it was swift, suggested Ashbourne was some way from healing or compromise. \u201cStick your wank idea up your arse,\u201d one post said. \u201cWhoever you are I hope you suffer the wrath and cold shoulder you and your snowflake ill informed muppets deserve ... Get fucked,\u201d said another. \u201cThe Blacks Head,\u201d said a third, using the bust\u2019s nickname. \u201cWhat\u2019s next??? Black Coffee Black Tea Black Grapes Black Liquorice... ffs it\u2019s batshit crazy!!!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was pretty upset,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThey said, \u2018you\u2019re not from here\u2019. But I am.\u201d</p> <p>Three weeks after the death of George Floyd, and five days after a controversial Bristol statue of the slavetrader Edward Colston was toppled, the intensity of the mood that has gripped Ashbourne is far from unique. And with grown men in shorts and woggles defending a statue of Robert Baden-Powell, and the prime minister himself intervening, it has taken on the unmistakable flavour of a culture war. </p> <p>The Derbyshire Dales\u2019 incarnation of this national crisis began seven days ago, when another student from Ashbourne published a petition: \u201cRemove the racist caricature of a black man\u2019s head from the Green Man sign.\u201d The crude wooden caricature, which sits on an archway resembling a gallows in the centre of town, is a recognisable version of a classically demeaning image of a black man. The petition\u2019s author \u2013 who has since stayed out of view after a torrent of abuse and threats \u2013 wanted her town to be part of the international movement. \u201cWe in Ashbourne can do our bit to fight back against this kind of vile racism,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>After the momentous events in Bristol on Sunday, and with the number of signatories calling for the head\u2019s removal reaching 30,000, the district council \u2013 which turned out to be the owner \u2013 decided it had to act. Plans were made to take it down on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>They never came to pass. As local Facebook groups lit up and a counter-petition gained thousands of signatures of its own, a protest was swiftly organised and more than 100 people showed up on Monday night. A man in a hood climbed a ladder and hung a sign over the head that said \u201cSAVE ME\u201d. A local councillor, Stuart Lees, spoke to outline a plan to protect the head. \u201cSomebody is going to come along and it\u2019ll disappear,\u201d he said. \u201dIf we take it down now as a town, we know where it is.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ab4f380fc487b367e5bc5b3e6fe2e2a383d3745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ab4f380fc487b367e5bc5b3e6fe2e2a383d3745/152_897_2475_3092/800.jpg\" alt=\"Duncan Renshaw and \u2018Raffa\u2019 hold up the black head after taking it down from its perch last week.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duncan Renshaw and \u2018Raffa\u2019 hold up the black head after taking it down from its perch last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rod Kirkpatrick/F Stop Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone clapped. Two men, a Polish resident identified only as Raffa and another local, Duncan Renshaw, climbed up and \u2013 after some complications \u2013 brought it down to whoops and applause. \u201cYou\u2019re not hanging him, are you?\u201d one woman asked, to laughter. \u201cWe should have worn white hoods for this,\u201d someone replied. After some celebratory photographs, the object was put in the back of a white van, and driven away.</p> <p>Where did it go? Nobody was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s in a secret location,\u201d said Thomas Donnelly, a Conservative councillor. \u201cIt\u2019s in a prominent Ashburnian person\u2019s garage,\u201d said Renshaw, one of the two men who removed it. The council itself refused all requests for comment, but issued a statement asserting that it would regain possession of the object on Tuesday.</p> <p>There were rumours, though. Most people seemed to think a councillor had it. On Tuesday, Lees answered the phone to the Guardian but declined to comment. Asked if he had the head, he said \u201cHello? Hello?\u201d then made a crackling noise to suggest poor reception, laughed, and hung up.</p> <p>When Moore and her friends \u2013 fellow students Eva Gorman and Lucy Hill \u2013 heard that the head had come down, they first thought it was a victory. They are part of a 30-strong group backing the original petition that has been discussing the issue online. \u201cThen we figured out what was actually happening,\u201d Moore said. </p> <p>The three young women are a little stunned that their call for change has caused such consternation. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a longer way off than I thought it was before this,\u201d said Gorman. The close-knit nature of the town makes the disagreement especially hard, she said, remembering the cold stares she recieved the previous day when walking down the street.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not enjoying being in a confrontational situation with people we\u2019ve known all our lives,\u201d said Hill. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to be quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Annie Smail, another student who wants the head removed, says the consequences have been profound. \u201cNeighbours have fallen out, people are having arguments of the kind where you can\u2019t be friends any more,\u201d she said. </p> <p>When Smail and others have tried to defend their position on Facebook, she said, they have been silenced. One resident who objected to the comment that \u201cif the blacks don\u2019t like it they can leave our country\u201d in one popular group was immediately removed by the administrator. Meanwhile, Facebook received multiple complaints about a post saying the bust should be replaced with \u201ca replica of George Floyd\u2019s head\u201d, but concluded it was not in violation of its guidelines.</p> <p>In the 2011 census, 98.5% of Ashbourne\u2019s population of 8,377 was white, and there were only 12 black people. While a trickle of newcomers has since slightly changed the town\u2019s ethnic profile, the few minority residents are conspicuously absent from the discussion.</p> <p>One person from a minority background, who asked not to be named, remembered the liberal use of racial slurs at school, and the daily humiliation when the teacher struggled with their name at registration. \u201cEven now, when they say my name at the GP\u2019s, people look at me,\u201d they said. \u201cI left school a while ago, and it\u2019s still embedded in me. All the white people of Ashbourne telling us this sign isn\u2019t offensive \u2026 it\u2019s just horrific. How can someone who\u2019s never experienced it say what you feel?\u201d</p> <p>To those on the other side of the debate, such sentiments do not detract from the cultural significance of the object itself. Outside his house, 70-year-old Martin Spencer, a town councillor and retired electrical engineer, said he had been told not to make any comment to the press, but added: \u201c45,000 people signing a petition \u2013 there\u2019s nowhere near that many live here. So I think it\u2019s irrelevant. Wouldn\u2019t matter to me if it was 100,000.\u201d</p> <p>Minorities do have a harder time, he conceded, considering the question of privilege. \u201cI worked in Derby for years, there were some foreign guys, and one said they used to share driving licences. They\u2019re giving themselves a bad name, some of them. Foreign people, they do tend to break the law - and I think of Lee Rigby.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9320dcf274fbc6703a8386e9cc745afa71eda974\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9320dcf274fbc6703a8386e9cc745afa71eda974/0_495_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Millward, then aged 100, holds the ball aloft during the 2016 Royal Shrovetide football match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Millward, then aged 100, holds the ball aloft during the 2016 Royal Shrovetide football match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew James Harrison/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said the bust\u2019s detractors \u201cshould understand the full reasoning behind it. It\u2019s a grade 2 listed item. I know some of the people who took it down, some of them very closely. They care a great deal about the heritage of Ashbourne.\u201d Is one of them Lees, the councillor? \u201cI\u2019m a very good friend of his and he won\u2019t tell you,\u201d Spencer laughed.</p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon, the council shifted its position from saying that \u201cwe expect to have possession of the head\u201d to \u201cwe are aware of the location of the head\u201d. Requests for additional comment were refused.</p> <p>By Thursday, there had been no update. At Lees\u2019 house at around 4pm, a woman who answered the door said the councillor was out. The head was not visible.</p> <p>Later on, Renshaw - the man who took the head down in the first place - answered the phone and shed more light on the circumstances. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to get ripped down by a bunch of idiots. So, basically, we asked that the council put it in a safe place, and it\u2019s gone in a controlled environment room which has to be signed in or out of.\u201d</p> <p>Lees, it emerged, really had been out \u2013 at a carefully choreographed meeting to arrange the head\u2019s handover. \u201cStuart [Lees] wanted a witness, so we both took it, Stuart\u2019s signed on our behalf, and there are three signatures,\u201d said Renshaw. \u201cIt was locked in a garage. If you\u2019d gone in for hours you wouldn\u2019t have found it.\u201d Lees declined to comment.</p> <p>On Thursday evening, the council said at a meeting that the head had been recovered, and that no decision on its future would be made until a public consultation could take place. It also announced an inquiry.</p> <p>Clare Gamble, a Labour councillor, said the week\u2019s events had \u201cturned the Derbyshire Dales into a national disgrace\u201d.</p> <p>Those who want the head returned continue to view that as absurd, and believe the row is likely to blow over. But their opponents insist that such an outcome will never happen. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop fighting for this small piece of justice,\u201d said Gorman.</p>",
  "<p>A coalmining site in south Wales is facing closure after the Welsh government used new powers to force it to halt on environmental grounds.</p> <p>More than 150 jobs at the Nant Helen opencast site near Neath are under threat after the Labour-led administration stepped in, arguing that keeping the coal in the ground was in the best interests of the people of Wales.</p> <p>The site\u2019s operator, <a href=\"https://www.coal.com/\">Celtic Energy</a>, expressed shock at the decision. It said work at the site was due to cease next year and it was worried at the impact on the community and on the site of stopping production immediately.</p> <p>Nant Helen was mothballed in 2016 after it stopped supplying coal to the Aberthaw power station. It reopened in January 2019 and has been providing coal to, among others, the domestic market and the steel industry.</p> <p>It has been operating under a licence issued by the UK body the Coal Authority.Earlier this month, Celtic Energy was told that the Welsh government, which has new powers over the production of fossil fuels, had declined to authorise the licence.</p> <p>A Welsh government spokesperson said: \u201cAs we move towards a low-carbon economy, we are proactively supporting a constructive transition away from coal extraction and use. Continuing coal extraction from Nant Helen would have inevitable environmental and climate change impacts.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesperson said refusing to authorise the licence ensures the coal remains in the ground. \u201cIt will not contribute to global climate change, which is in the best interest of the people of Wales.\u201d</p> <p>It is the first time Welsh ministers have declined to authorise a licence related to the extraction of fossil fuels under the licensing powers transferred to them in April 2018.</p> <p>Will Watson, the chief executive officer of Celtic Energy, said: \u201cWe were shocked to receive a letter from the Coal Authority advising us of the [Welsh government\u2019s] decision.</p> <p>\u201cWe are working with the Coal Authority and local authorities to consider options for a way forward which minimises the environmental impacts and delivers the best long-term outcome for the site, surrounding communities, our employees and Wales as a whole.\u201d</p> <p>The opencast mine site and an adjacent coal washery is the preferred site for a \u00a3100m train-testing site. Currently manufacturers have to send trains across Europe for testing before they come back to the UK for service.</p> <p>It is hoped employees of the opencast mine will be able to find work restoring the area and then be employed at the testing site.</p>",
  "<p>Just as trailers for the BBC\u2019s Windrush drama <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p08g29ff/sitting-in-limbo\">Sitting in Limbo</a> were released at the start of this month, Anthony Bryan, who was wrongly imprisoned for five weeks after mistakenly being classified as an illegal immigrant, and whose story is dramatised in the film, received an interim offer of compensation from the Home Office. It was two and a half years after officials first realised they had made an error, and more than two years since the then prime minister, Theresa May first apologised for the Home Office\u2019s mistakes. The compensation letter came exactly a week before the film was due to go out on television, and the timing of its arrival made him very thoughtful.</p> <p>A few days before Sitting in Limbo was broadcast, emails and calls started coming from the private office of the home secretary, Priti Patel, asking if Bryan would join a video call with her just an hour before the film went out. The home secretary is \u201cactively thinking\u201d about \u201cgiving a voice\u201d to the Windrush generation, one email read, \u201cand feels it vitally important to hear directly from affected members of the community, such as Mr Bryan\u201d.</p> <p>Bryan felt sceptical about the timing of this invitation, and declined. Meanwhile Home Office staff were pestering the film\u2019s makers to let them have an early preview \u2013 without success.</p> <p>These are standard Home Office damage-limitation manoeuvres,<strong> </strong>without any effective action to address the underlying problem. (And none of the other 30 Windrush claimants being supported by the North Kensington Law Centre, which has been helping Bryan, received compensation offers this month or had invitations to have phone calls with the home secretary, staff there told me.)</p> <p>Clearly the unfolding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a> and the focus on Britain\u2019s own difficulties with racism are making ministers particularly anxious to be seen to be doing the right thing on Windrush. They will be uneasily aware that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/18/revealed-depth-of-home-office-failures-on-windrush\">not enough has been done to put things right</a>. This is not a centuries-old problem that can be shrugged off as history, but the direct consequence of hostile environment measures that remain a central part of government policy.</p> <p>Of course, giving people a voice and listening is great, but much careful listening has already been done, and those affected by the scandal have for months been saying that now is the time to move on to action. A forensic 275-page analysis of what went wrong, based on detailed interviews with hundreds of those affected, was <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/874022/6.5577_HO_Windrush_Lessons_Learned_Review_WEB_v2.pdf\">submitted to the Home Office in March</a>. One of the key recommendations made by its author, Wendy Williams, was a call for a full review of the government\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d measures.</p> <p>But none of the policies that caused the Windrush scandal have been repealed, and Patel has made no commitment to reverse them. She tweeted new apologies as the programme was broadcast, lamenting the \u201cunimaginable suffering endured by the Windrush generation\u201d, but <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/windrush-lessons-learned-review\">seems to have shown little interest in looking again at the structure of immigration legislation</a>, which continues to cause so much suffering to thousands of people living entirely legally in the UK.<strong> </strong>In this regard, her stance echoes that of Nick Timothy, May\u2019s former special adviser, and one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/theresa-may-was-not-opposed-to-go-home-vans-official-accounts-suggest\">key architects of the hostile environment</a>, who last week breezily asserted that it was a \u201csensible\u201d policy. He added that he was \u201ccertainly never warned\u201d that there was a cohort of people who might get trapped in its embrace because they were unable to prove that they were living in the UK legally.</p> <p>Both of these points are highly questionable. After all the life-shattering problems the policies have caused, \u201csensible\u201d seems a peculiar word to have chosen. They<strong> </strong>deliberately made life impossible for tens of thousands of people without documentation, introducing workplace immigration checks, and eligibility checks for healthcare, bank accounts, pensions, driving licences, rental contracts and benefits. It was the hostile environment that caused Bryan to get the sack from his job as a decorator, and saw him formally categorised as an illegal resident (despite having lived in London since arriving as an eight-year-old in 1965), arrested, detained and booked on a flight back to Jamaica, a country he hadn\u2019t visited in more than 50 years.</p> <p>The hostile environment policies introduced new levels of spite into society; the government set up the National Allegations Database, designed to make it easier for people to make tip-offs about immigration offenders to the Home Office.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not even clear that these \u201csensible\u201d measures have succeeded in their stated goal of addressing illegal immigration, as a handful of reports from the <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/handling-of-the-windrush-situation/\">National Audit Office</a>, the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567652/ICIBI-hostile-environment-driving-licences-and-bank-accounts-January-to-July-2016.pdf\">Borders and Immigration Inspectorate</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/15/mps-criticise-error-hit-hostile-environment-illegal-immigrants\">Home Affairs </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/15/mps-criticise-error-hit-hostile-environment-illegal-immigrants\">select </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/15/mps-criticise-error-hit-hostile-environment-illegal-immigrants\">committee</a> concluded. What is clear is that large numbers of people who came to the UK legally, but who struggle to prove their status, are still being denied healthcare, formal employment and stable housing; the policies institutionalise cruelty and drive people underground.</p> <p>Timothy\u2019s assertion that he was never warned is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/22/government-aware-for-years-that-hostile-environment-hurt-windrush-generation\">contradicted by so much evidence</a> that it feels disingenuous. His own department\u2019s impact assessments warned that these policies could hurt people who had been in the UK for decades, but who had no documentation. Every migration and race organisation<strong> </strong>united to warn that racially discriminatory consequences would follow. A Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants lawyer remembers a junior immigration minister rolling his eyes at her warnings when she gave evidence in parliament. They were warned; they just didn\u2019t want to listen, she says. </p> <p>Timothy\u2019s comments matter because the government continues to cling on to these cruel policies in spite of their damaging impact on so many, including thousands of the key workers who have been supporting Britain throughout the pandemic. The hostile environment also gave us the NHS surcharge in 2015, which, until a sudden U-turn last month, required doctors and care workers to pay for the right to access the care they were providing, and which they were already paying for through taxation. It has also increased visa charges so exponentially that families are pushed into destitution as they try to pay recurring immigration costs. Many are forced into illegality because they cannot afford the exorbitant cost of regularising their status.</p> <p>The Home Office has spent two years in a legal battle over whether the rent to right policy \u2013 which requires landlords to check on tenants\u2019 immigration status \u2013 is racially discriminatory. The high court said it was; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">court of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">appeal agreed it could be,</a> but ruled that the scheme was nevertheless \u201cjustified\u201d; a new appeal is under way. </p> <p>In her review into what caused Windrush, Williams makes it clear that officials should be actively educating themselves. The department\u2019s failings on Windrush demonstrate an \u201cinstitutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation\u201d that is \u201cconsistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism\u201d, she concluded. The scandal was able to happen, she added \u201cbecause of the public\u2019s and officials\u2019 poor understanding of Britain\u2019s colonial history \u2026 and the history of black Britons\u201d.</p> <p>Two years ago, the then home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/sajid-javid-plans-fairer-more-compassionate-immigration-system\">Sajid Javid, promised to review the immigration system</a> to ensure it was working in a compassionate, fair and humane way; we are still waiting for that review. Only 60 people have received Windrush compensation payments \u2013 which is why last-minute invitations to video chats with the home secretary do not feel welcome.</p> <p>\u2022 Amelia Gentleman is a Guardian reporter.

  "<p>For the past five days, Bijendra Singh has been haunted by the voice of his dead wife, Neelam. \u201cWhy could you not get me the treatment that I needed?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhy could you not save me, save our baby?\u201d</p> <p>It was around 6am on 5 June when Neelam, more than eight months pregnant, began complaining of lower back pain and breathlessness. Presuming it was early contractions, Singh and his wife set off in his brother\u2019s auto-rickshaw to a government hospital in the Uttar Pradesh city of Noida. Before leaving, they kissed their five year-old son goodbye and promised they would be returning with the birthday present he had requested: a baby sister.</p> <p>However, because of her suspected Covid-19 symptoms, they were refused entry at eight hospitals. It was to be a 15-hour ordeal that would expose how the coronavirus pandemic has pushed India\u2019s healthcare system to the brink of collapse, and would result in the needless death of 30-year-old Neelam.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the beginning of this pandemic, the government completely underestimated the virus,\u201d said Dr Harjit Singh Bhatti, who works on the Covid-19 ward of Delhi\u2019s Manipal hospital. \u201cWe had over two months of lockdown, but all that time was wasted. We have not seen any investment in healthcare, which will be the only way to get this under control.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cEvery day I see the number of patients are rising, while hospital admission is becoming impossible and many are dying outside hospitals. Healthcare workers are all getting infected in droves and our healthcare system in Delhi is already exhausted. If strong steps are not taken now, I expect the healthcare system to collapse in a few weeks.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, India began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/global-report-india-reports-surge-in-covid-19-cases-as-lockdown-eased\">easing its coronavirus lockdown</a>, one of the largest and strictest in the world, with shopping malls and places of worship opening their doors for the first time in more than two months.

India\u2019s biggest cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai are running out of not only beds but also doctors and nurses to treat the unprecedented numbers of patients, and university medical professors have been seconded to work on Covid wards. Private hospitals have been charging upwards of 80,000 rupees (\u00a3840) per night for those who are admitted with Covid symptoms \u2013 unaffordable prices for even middle-class let alone poorer Indians.</p> <p>Singh, a factory worker from Khora Colony in Ghaziabad, took his wife first to a government hospitalin the neighbouring city of Noida. But the doctor insisted they could not admit her. It was to become a familiar refrain. At another hospital nearby, an ambulance driver refused to go near Neelam because he suspected she had Covid-19, and she was refused admission. They then went to the private Shivalik hospital. \u201cBut again the doctor said there, sorry, this looks like a Covid case, we don\u2019t have ventilators or beds,\u201d said Singh.</p> <p>They tried eight hospitals, each time being denied entry because medics suspected from Neelam\u2019s breathing troubles that she had Covid-19, although she was never tested.</p> <p>\u201cAt the fourth hospital, I broke down, pleading with them, telling them I had been going around hospitals all morning. They told me \u2018we cannot treat her, she will die here\u2019,\u201d said Singh. \u201cMy wife was shouting out: \u2018I need oxygen, I need painkillers, please help me,\u2019 but no one listened to her.\u201d</p> <p>By the time the couple reached their next hope, Sharda hospital, they were so desperate that they paid for Neelam to be transferred to an ambulance so she could have access to an oxygen tank.</p> <p>At the seventh hospital, Gims hospital in Noida, when it too refused to admit her, Singh called the police. \u201cI could not bring myself to go back into the ambulance and face her. She kept telling me: \u2018I won\u2019t survive much longer, please get me help, you are not doing anything for me.\u2019 At this point I lost all my strength.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f93f774203d82fdfba3ea0738429e89c067e363\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f93f774203d82fdfba3ea0738429e89c067e363/0_0_5544_3326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A colleague helps a nurse put on PPE in Max hospital, New Delhi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A colleague helps a nurse put on PPE in Max hospital, New Delhi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atish Patel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But even the two officers could not get her a bed. Singh and Neelam drove 30 miles to the Max hospital in Ghaziabad, where again doctors walked him into the ward to show him it was full, so they drove back to Gims. \u201cBut when we got there, I pulled the oxygen mask off my wife\u2019s face and she was dead,\u201d said Singh.</p> <p>\u201cPlease know I did everything to save her and my baby. It is not my fault, the system is broken.\u201d</p> <p>The consequences of a pandemic in India, a poverty-stricken and densely populated country that spends just 1% of GDP on healthcare, are becoming more apparent by the day.</p> <p>Hospital morgues are overflowing with bodies: Delhi\u2019s LNJP hospital morgue, which has capacity for 45 bodies, last week had 108 piled up. Nigambodh Ghat, New Delhi\u2019s biggest and oldest crematorium, has begun building traditional funeral pyres because their furnaces cannot keep up with the number of bodies, around 30 a day more than usual. They have performed more than 500 coronavirus-related funerals in the past two months.</p> <p>Delhi\u2019s deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, has said the capital will have more than 500,000 Covid-19 cases by July and will need to increase the number of beds from 9,000 to 80,000 to meet demand. \u201cFor Delhi, this is a big problem if cases continue to rise,\u201d Sisodia said.</p> <p>Balram Bhargava, the director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, insisted India was still \u201cdefinitely not\u201d in a community transmission stage of the outbreak, even though officials in Delhi admitted they knew the source of only around 50% of infections. But this was rejected by Bhatti, the Covid-19 doctor. \u201cThe claims of no community transmission is rubbish, it is only to save the government from criticism and so they can avoid spending more money on hospitals and manpower,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Only 5m tests have been done in a country of 1.3 billion people. And while India\u2019s official death toll of 8,102 is comparatively low, some analysts believe this may be due to rampant under-reporting and also the fact that 65% of India\u2019s population is below the age of 35, compared with nations with more vulnerable, ageing populations.</p> <p>Even the home minister, Amit Shah, admitted in a speech on Monday that the government, which last month announced a stimulus package billed as being worth $266bn, \u201cmay have made a mistake, we may have fallen short\u201d in the fight against the virus.</p> <p>The situation has become so bad that not even money and influence can pull the usual strings. Resident associations for affluent neighbourhoods have begun buying their own oxygen supplies. In Delhi\u2019s Greater Kailash I (GK1), an upmarket area in south Delhi, the residents\u2019 association has purchased two oxygen concentrator machines, while in the housing complex of Eldeco Utopia in Noida, residents have bought 20 oximeters and sequestered five rooms, equipping them with oxygen cylinders, a stretcher, a wheelchair and PPE kit.</p> <p>\u201cThe bubble we lived in has burst,\u201d said Rajiv Kakria, an adviser to the GK1 residents\u2019 association. \u201cYou can have money. You can have connections and know influential people, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything. You can still die waiting for a bed or oxygen.\u201d</p>",

Hopefully a sign of things to come after last night\u2019s low-scoring affair. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ee34ff08f0839df653849b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T09:51:09.294Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Peeeeeeeeeep!!!!!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Underway in Geelong!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ee34f628f0839df653849af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T09:49:06.163Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Players, coaches and umpires are now taking a knee. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HawthornFC/status/1271384545313484801\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;There is no place for racism in our society.&quot; \ud83d\udc9b <a href=\"https://t.co/yvCP3jlkrU\">pic.twitter.com/yvCP3jlkrU</a></p>&mdash; Hawthorn FC (@HawthornFC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HawthornFC/status/1271384545313484801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T10:11:49.993Z\">at 11.11am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee34ef38f08cdef7bed418d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T09:47:36.286Z\">10.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Four minutes to the opening bounce, which means *checks notes* Shane Warne narrating one of those overblown self-congratulatory montages that plague Australian sports broadcasting. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ee2f7338f08cdef7bed3e9b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T09:42:21.634Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In case any of you Hawkers missed this from a few days ago, here\u2019s <strong>Jonathan Horn </strong>paying tribute to Australian Football Hall of Fame inductee John Kennedy Sr.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>John Kennedy was a hard, hard man.

Footy, two nights in a row! We are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMlP_Moo0bE\">being spoiled</a>. </p> <p>After last night\u2019s nail-biting, breathless and error-strewn return to action at the MCG, we\u2019re off down the highway to Kardinia Park for the resumption of the most entertaining rivalry in the modern game. <strong>Geelong v Hawthorn is underway from 7.50pm</strong> and I\u2019ll be here to make sure you have a rough idea what\u2019s happening down at the Cattery.</p> <p>Matches between this pair tend to be close, highlighted by that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8mqubtTW0g\">astonishing period around the turn of the decade </a>when contests of incredible skill invariably ended within a kick. Both clubs have descended somewhat from those lofty heights, but neither have plummeted far, and Chris Scott and Alastair Clarkson will consider their premiership windows open in this most unpredictable of seasons.</p> <p>This is ordinarily a rivalry that draws a bumper crowd to the MCG, but with fans still locked out Geelong have lobbied successfully for the Hawks to make the journey to GHMBA Stadium for the first time since 2006. Not only that, but there is an expectation that other heavyweights will make rare visits to Victoria\u2019s Surf Coast later in the season, in a major boost to the Cats\u2019 flag hopes. Few teams in history have enjoyed home ground advantage like Geelong in the past decade or so (42-8 win-loss record in previous 50 matches), and their familiarity with the dimensions (the Kardinia Park oval is the third-longest but also the narrowest in the league) should give them a notable advantage.</p> <p>Let me know what you think of that, as well as some other tasty morsels, like Patrick Dangerfield\u2019s place in the game on the night of his 250th appearance, Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett pandering to #SokkahTwitter by advocating for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/superfooty/status/1271354892532121600\">relegation</a> from the AFL, or how tonight could be the last time modern greats Shaun Burgoyne (37), Gary Ablett (36) and Harry Taylor (34 today!) all compete for the same Sherrin.</p> <p>Get in touch by Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jphowcroft?lang=en\">@JPHowcroft</a> or send emails to <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com. </a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GeelongCats/status/1271343909210226688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wish you were here. \ud83d\ude22<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Danger250?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Danger250</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFLCatsHawks?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AFLCatsHawks</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Ww95pTiKTp\">pic.twitter.com/Ww95pTiKTp</a></p>&mdash; Geelong Cats (@GeelongCats) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeelongCats/status/1271343909210226688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T08:59:56.810Z\">at 9.59am BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p><br>An invisible killer that is passed through touch, homes and businesses in lockdown, desperate efforts to test, track and trace, community resilience in the face of tragedy.</p> <p>It sounds very much like life in the time of Covid-19, but this is also the world depicted in a high-profile BBC One drama focusing on the aftermath of the nerve agent attack on the former Russian spy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/sergei-skripal\">Sergei Skripal</a> in Wiltshire.</p> <p>Filming for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08dqns1\">The Salisbury Poisonings</a> ended just days before the Covid-19 lockdown began in the UK and, as coronavirus swept the world, there were concerns among its makers that there would be no appetite for the show for months or years.</p> <p>But, speaking to the Guardian, the series director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/saul-dibb\">Saul Dibb</a>, and the producer, Karen Lewis, said they believed the Covid-19 crisis had made the drama, which will be broadcast over three nights from Sunday, all the more relevant.</p> <p>Dibb said the parallels between novichok, the nerve agent used in the Salisbury attack, and Covid-19 were unavoidable. \u201cIt\u2019s deadly and passed through touch \u2013 an invisible threat. You don\u2019t know if you are passing it on,\u201d said Dibb.</p> <p>The drama examines how \u201ceveryday\u201d people were affected, at times in the most horrific of ways, and how local police and officials were caught in the eye of a storm. \u201cIt\u2019s not a story about central government, it\u2019s a story about people working it out at a local level,\u201d said Dibb. \u201cAll that has so much to say to us now.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis said: \u201cThe stuff that is being done now on a much bigger scale was done there. It resonates with what is happening now in many ways \u2013 it\u2019s about community coming together and economic impact, the closing down of shops and restaurants, no footfall, no tourists.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of the drama was never to tell the spy story and the global politics. Dibb said that rather than point the camera at the bench where the Skripals collapsed in March 2018, they turned it in the other direction. \u201cIt was about the collateral damage, how people were impacted,\u201d he said.</p> <p>So Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, barely feature. Instead front and centre is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/01/salisbury-novichok-poisonings-look-back\">Tracy Daszkiewicz</a>, the director of public health in Wiltshire, who led the effort to pin down where the novichok had been and who might have been contaminated by it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3acc91a363fb62450d885a7c92338e0fe30d8914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3acc91a363fb62450d885a7c92338e0fe30d8914/0_121_4250_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne-Marie Duff as Tracy Daszkiewicz with Darren Boyd as DS Dave Minty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne-Marie Duff as Tracy Daszkiewicz with Darren Boyd as DS Dave Minty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Huw John/BBC/Dancing Ledge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also follows the police officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/15/police-officer-nick-bailey-poisoned-by-novichok-returns-to-active-duty\">Nick Bailey</a> who was contaminated after going into Skripal\u2019s house, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/15/novichok-victim-dawn-sturgess-parents-tell-of-their-anger-and-hurt\">Dawn Sturgess </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/21/novichok-victim-partner-kept-in-the-dark-charlie-rowley-dawn-sturgess\">Charlie Rowley</a>, who were poisoned four months after the Skripal attack by novichok hidden in a perfume bottle. Sturgess, 44, died.</p> <p>Dibb said: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a Spielberg story of these extraordinary things happening in a small town \u2013 the hazmat suits, the army, the tanks, a spy and Russia and poison.</p> <p>\u201cI felt it was a weird Jaws story. Tracy is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/feb/11/royscheider19322008\">Chief Brody</a> in the middle of this small town where there\u2019s this invisible killer and she is completely thrown out of her comfort zone into a position where she has to try and keep people safe. And each decision has implications either for the economy and politics of this local town or the health and lives of all of these people.</p> <p>\u201cIt was also like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/jun/04/features.review27\">United 93 [the Paul Greengrass film</a> about the airline passengers who fought back against al-Qaida hijackers], a very recent retelling of a story of everyday heroes in a hyper-realist way.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/31/she-never-had-a-voice-dawn-sturgess-parents-hope-tv-drama-bbc-salisbury-poisonings-novichok\">'She never had a voice': Dawn Sturgess's parents hope TV drama will set record straight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was important for the makers that the main people featured or their families were willing to help tell their stories. Sturgess\u2019s father and mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/31/she-never-had-a-voice-dawn-sturgess-parents-hope-tv-drama-bbc-salisbury-poisonings-novichok\">Stan and Caroline Sturgess</a>, Rowley \u2013 her partner \u2013 Daszkiewicz and Bailey all cooperated closely.</p> <p>Dibb said: \u201cNo one wanted to make it if the people in it hadn\u2019t agreed to it. I think they knew if they talked to us and opened up with us and told us what it was really like, we would be able to tell the story more fully, more respectfully, more honestly.\u201d</p> <p>On the Sturgesses, Lewis said: \u201cIt was amazing how open they were. It was barely a year since Dawn had died. They were still grieving and still are. They are a very dignified family.\u201d</p> <p>Dibb added: \u201cThere\u2019s a bit I like in the film. Stan opens the door and Dawn\u2019s sons come in and her sisters and their families. Suddenly you see there\u2019s this big family of people who all love her. That brought it home to me shooting that scene how big the repercussions are.</p> <p>\u201cWith Covid there are thousands and thousands of deaths. We\u2019re talking here about one death. I think it shows through looking at one individual\u2019s death how significant all of those individual stories are. They often get glossed over. For us it\u2019s the chance to say this is one person, this is what all of those 40,000 people have experienced now.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis said Bailey felt guilty that he may have poisoned his family, having unknowingly carried novichok into his home: \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that none of his family were poisoned.\u201d</p> <p>Dibb said: \u201cWhen he comes home once he\u2019s been at the crime scene, he makes a cup of tea, makes breakfast, brings it up to his wife, kisses his wife, hugs his kids. All the while contaminating his house and passing this thing on in a way that could have been fatal for all of them. Those things have a greater resonance now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce2b77ae51467ecaa3cafb3a4b26db433849afb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce2b77ae51467ecaa3cafb3a4b26db433849afb0/0_141_4241_2546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafe Spall as Nick Bailey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafe Spall as Nick Bailey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Pardon/BBC/Dancing Ledge</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The drama may able to highlight some elements of the story that news stories could not \u2013 for example, what it felt like being poisoned. Dibb said: \u201cFor Nick Bailey it involved hallucinations and paranoia and visions and all of those kind of things that you\u2019re able to create visually.\u201d</p> <p>The makers have been conscious of the impact the drama may have on Salisbury.</p> <p>Dibb said: \u201cThe poisonings in Salisbury are part of Salisbury\u2019s history. It\u2019s just insane; you\u2019re in a small British cathedral city with hazmat suits and tanks and helicopters everywhere and this bizarre poison that\u2019s been placed in the middle of a shopping centre. On one level it\u2019s so absurd.\u201d</p> <p>There is no neat ending. \u201cWe were very mindful not to try and pretend we had all the answers. But I guess it also is a story of it passing. It does pass. Salisbury has moved on. What we\u2019re in at the moment, it will pass.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>The Salisbury Poisonings is on BBC One on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday at 9pm.</p></li> <li></li> </ul>",
  "<p>When a black friend or colleague shares their anger at the structural racism black British people have faced, I know that my job is to listen, not to chip in, \u201cMe too!\u201d \u2013 I may have experienced racism over the years, but as someone of East African Asian heritage I\u2019m more than aware it is not a patch on what my black friends have experienced. So in this moment, the right way to use my experience of racism is to channel it into expressing solidarity with black people; drawing on it to tell them that they\u2019re wrong about racism would be offensive and absurd.</p> <p>Over the last week, home secretary Priti Patel has shown us why it is so important for people like me to spell this out. Patel gave a Commons statement on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/08/uk-coronavirus-johnson-says-anti-racist-protests-were-subverted-by-thuggery-live-news-covid19-updates\">Black Lives Matter protests on Monday</a>. The black MP Florence Eshalomi asked her whether she understood the frustration and anger of so many people in the context of these protests. \u201cDoes she recognise that there is structural inequality, discrimination and racism in our country?\u201d Her voice shook with emotion as she spoke of her son, who has just turned three. \u201cI do not want to have to wait until he is a teenager before we see changes in this country,\u201d she said. \u201cWill the home secretary and the government act now? Black lives matter, and we need to see the government doing something about that.\u201d</p> <p>Patel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Channel4News/videos/250342173079880/\">response was awful</a>. First she expressed outrage that Eshalomi was seemingly accusing the government of not understanding structural racism. (It\u2019s hardly a surprise that a black MP put that charge to a home secretary who leads on the government\u2019s hostile environment policy, which discriminated against the Windrush generation of black Britons, and whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/28/windrush-scandal-only-60-victims-given-compensation-so-far\">compensation fund</a> has paid out only a paltry sum so far.) Then Patel proceeded to list her own experiences of racism, including being called a Paki in the playground. \u201cSo when it comes to racism, sexism, tolerance or social justice, I will not take lectures from those on other side of the house.\u201d</p> <p>By implying Eshalomi\u2019s concerns about structural racism against black people do not have a basis in reality and are motivated by bad faith, Patel gaslighted her. The Labour MPs who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/11/bame-mps-accuse-priti-patel-of-gaslighting-in-racism-debate\">wrote to Patel</a> about this were right to do so. Cue more gaslighting: \u201cI will not be silenced by @UKLabour MPs who continue to dismiss the contributions of those who don\u2019t conform to their view of how ethnic minorities should behave,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pritipatel/status/1271075607955288064?s=20\">responded Patel</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s often said there should be no hierarchies in racism. In one sense, I agree: it would be sick to sit around arguing whether antisemitism, Islamophobia or anti-black racism is worse: they are all forces for evil (there are also important differences between them, an understanding of which is critical to tackling them).</p> <p>But there are indeed hierarchies of racism when it comes to lived experience. Patel should be aware of that because of her heritage. Like me, she is of East African Asian descent; like my grandparents, hers were encouraged to move from India to East Africa under British colonial rule and a system that made them both victims and agents of colonial racism.</p> <p>Anti-black racism remains rife in the East African Asian community in Britain today. Sure, some British Asians may experience racist abuse by black Britons, but structural racism is about relative power structures. Like Patel, I found it painful to be called a Paki by other children. But let me tell you: as two middle-class daughters of economically successful East African Asian immigrants we speak from a position of relative power and privilege compared with our brothers and sisters who grew up in working-class black or Pakistani or Bangladeshi communities in Britain. That\u2019s why we both have a massive responsibility to recognise those power dynamics when we speak from the dispatch box or write a newspaper column.</p> <p>Some people who have little experience of racism themselves don\u2019t get this. \u201cSurely they are not suggesting [Patel\u2019s] not black enough to have experienced real racism?\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonGroves1/status/1271080897140469766?s=20\">one journalist asked yesterday</a> of the Labour MPs who wrote to her. No: they were saying that Patel\u2019s experiences of anti-Asian racism do not make her an authority on anti-black racism.</p> <p>In this sense, the catch-all umbrella of \u201cBAME\u201d \u2013 black, Asian and minority ethnic \u2013 has become distinctly unhelpful as it has evolved into being understood less as a collection of ethnicities and more as a group in and of itself. It contributes to a situation in which people who clearly don\u2019t understand racism can tell themselves they are allying with one \u201cBAME\u201d politician over another rather than face up to the fact they are aligning themselves with the oppressor over the oppressed.</p> <p>To be fair, Patel is not the only one to have done this this week. The chancellor and vice chancellor of Oxford University both drew on their own Irish heritage and experiences of anti-Irish prejudice to inform their argument about why black students are wrong to ask for the removal of a statue of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52999319\">Cecil Rhodes from Oriel College</a>. It is not to diminish the pain of anti-Irish prejudice to highlight that using your experience of this to lecture black people is a symptom of structural racism, not part of the solution. Similarly, one of the things that made <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Chakrabarti-Inquiry-Report-30June16.pdf\">Shami Cha</a><a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Chakrabarti-Inquiry-Report-30June16.pdf\">krab</a><a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Chakrabarti-Inquiry-Report-30June16.pdf\">arti\u2019s 2016 report</a> into antisemitism in the Labour party so offensive was the way in which she repeatedly drew on her own experiences of racism as if they gifted her such a strong understanding of antisemitism that she had the right to pronounce on it.</p> <p>Experiencing one form of racism does not confer the right to shout down someone else expressing anger about another form of racism, particularly when that person comes from a group that has faced even greater discrimination and injustice than you. That\u2019s all that letter was saying. That it was so misunderstood shows how much further we\u2019ve got to go in even understanding, let alone eradicating, racism.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer and a Guardian/Observer columnist</p>",

  "<ul> \n <li></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Good morning.</p> \n<p>Black and brown Americans have long faced higher rates of infant mortality, heart disease and other health challenges than their white counterparts.

  "<p>Back when feminism was mainstreaming, and it seemed like the conversation was finally going to turn toward \u201chow do we start to think about women as human beings, rather than as mothers/sexual objects/children/domesticity machines?\u201d, women drew up a lot of lists. <em>Please read these books of feminist theory. Please watch these women-directed movies. Please follow these women on Twitter. </em>We thought we could educate people \u2013 of any of the genders \u2013 out of their misogyny.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/corona-rage-covid-19-masks-jessa-crispin\">Corona rage is boiling over.

It turns out needling a bunch of guys into putting The Second Sex on their bedside table didn\u2019t make the world safer for women. And, as anyone who has been raped by a Yale man knows, education doesn\u2019t make anyone a better person.</p> <p>As anti-racism protests mobilize across the United States, anti-racist reading lists have also proliferated. Suddenly Instagram, typically the most unabashedly shallow social media platform, has converted overnight into the world\u2019s largest anti-racism bookstore. I\u2019m impressed with the good faith of the people sharing these lists or asking others for recommendations, and for the presence of these books on bestseller lists.</p> <p>But I\u2019m also skeptical. Because feminism tried this, and it mostly failed to connect the <em>intellectual</em> understanding of misogyny with the way the world functions for women. We taught it. We talked about it. We wrote about it, we marched about it, we podcasted about it, we yelled about it, we made YouTube videos about it, we wore T-shirts about it, we went to court about it.</p> <p>And over and over again, we said, <em>Please, read our books</em>. Because <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy/\">reading builds empathy</a>. Because <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/christina-desmarais/why-reading-books-makes-you-a-better-person-according-to-science.html\">reading makes you a better person</a>. (Stalin was a big reader, but sure.) We demanded and got women superheroes. We got more of our stories and experiences told in film and television. We got documentaries made about our deaths, our history and our struggles to live in a world hostile to us. And part of it was our fault, for mostly elevating white voices, voices with minor requests, voices pitched to avoid making men too uncomfortable. But as soon as a stressor hit \u2013 a small thing like a combination pandemic-uprising-global lockdown \u2013 domestic violence rates rose, women lost their jobs at a disproportionate rate, and the difficulty in raising equal attention for black women killed by police, like Breonna Taylor and <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/transgender-woman-police-killing-stlouis_n_599df3f7e4b05710aa599d34\">Kiwi Herring</a>, became obvious.</p> <p>Education has so often been used as a method of indoctrination and control \u2013 typically the first step of any colonial project is to take over the schools. So why can\u2019t the colonized or the oppressed use the same tool to reverse the damage?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Maybe if we all just consume the right products, the world will become a better place</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While I would never argue against reading \u2013 I was a book critic for 15 years, and I have made similar lists, yelling at people to read <a href=\"https://punctumbooks.com/titles/knocking-the-hustle/\">Lester Spence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/directed-by-desire-the-collected-poems-of-june-jordan-by-june-jordan/\">June Jordan</a>, <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/carceral-capitalism\">Jackie Wang</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sevenstories.com/books/2821-a-field-guide-for-female-interrogators\">Coco Fusco</a>, <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374274788\">Pankaj Mishra</a> \u2013 I think we have to admit the limited effect education and entertainment have on the material reality of the world. Intellectual curiosity should always be encouraged, and diversity of thought and perspective is important for a multitude of reasons. But often we leave an issue with \u201ceducate yourself\u201d and figure that person will \u201cdo the work\u201d and either find enlightenment or remain an irredeemable misogynist or racist troll forever.</p> <p>Part of it is our naive and longstanding belief that we can <em>buy</em> our way to liberation. Maybe if we all just consume the right products, the world will become a better place. But buying grass-fed beef didn\u2019t slow global warming, it just made a couple of very rich men much richer. Buying a couple of books from the Women\u2019s History Month display table at Barnes &amp; Noble didn\u2019t solve misogyny.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to recognize that paying attention is not the same as understanding, and in an age of information overload, more information \u2013 the <em>right</em> information this time, of course \u2013 isn\u2019t the full solution. We perceive each other through intermediaries, and this seems to be what we prefer. For that which is foreign to us, we prefer a theory or an explanation. We watch a documentary about beekeepers in Macedonia and think we now understand beekeepers in Macedonia. But all we are doing is interpreting reality through someone else\u2019s interpretation of reality.</p> <p>How do we make a bad person less of a bad person? Trying to answer this question has led us to all sorts of timewasters and ethical dead ends. We tried through yelling, we tried through medical experimentation, we tried through re-education, we tried through philosophy. But as anyone who has been raped by a philosopher knows \u2026</p> <p>When we are dealing with someone who is indoctrinated or besotted with bad or regressive thinking, the intuitive approach is to educate or instruct. But there truly is no replacement for actual, physical, social encounter between humans to create a shared perspective. And right now, in this uprising, that is where the counterintuitive, but constructive, answer is forming. We are encountering each other in our shared (and forced) encounters with the police. The building can start from there. There is no shortcut. We must find one another on the streets.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jessa Crispin is a Guardian US columnist.

In a clever premise that sets up a seat-of-the pants adventure, the powers that be have established 13 \u201cvirgin zones\u201d around the globe, deported the former inhabitants, and instituted a strict no-go policy enforced by paramilitary units. This has given rise to an extreme sport: teams of opportunistic adventurers attempt to cross the zones in a&nbsp;bid&nbsp;to \u201ccollect\u201d all 13. Lebbon follows the leader of one of these teams, Dylan, and his daughter Jen, as they enter a zone known as Eden. They discover that the ecosystem of Eden has given rise to a host of horrific creatures, and soon the team is fighting for survival. Lebbon excels at portraying the phantasmagorical proliferation of nature within Eden, which is truly red in tooth and claw, and escalates the tension towards a gripping climax.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"54af4f02dedcdd35f702cec356ea67286d568914\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54af4f02dedcdd35f702cec356ea67286d568914/0_0_187_293/187.jpg\" alt=\"We Ride the Storm\" width=\"187\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>First self-published in 2018,&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/we-ride-the-storm-9780356514086.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">We Ride the Storm</a></strong>&nbsp;(Orbit, \u00a38.99) by&nbsp;Devin Madson&nbsp;is the first volume of the Reborn Empire series, a fantasy epic set in the Asian-inspired empire of Kisian.

  "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s roundup of developments from the coronavirus pandemic. As more countries ease out of lockdown, scientists shed light on how the virus attacks and raise questions over the wastewater that drains from sinks and bathrooms.</p> \n<h2>Lockdowns work</h2> \n<p>Substantial lockdowns around the world have taken their toll on millions of lives and dented economies globally. So it was a relief to hear that the bluntest tool of all in the outbreak management toolbox did actually work. Lockdowns in Europe saved more than 3 million lives, including an estimated 470,000 in the UK, 690,000 in France, and 630,000 in Italy, according to researchers at Imperial College London.</p> \n<p>Outbreak modellers found that lockdowns slashed the average number of people that contagious individuals infected by 81%. In the UK, that amounted to lowering the all-important reproduction number of the virus, R, from 3.8 to 0.63, the researchers <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7\">reported in Nature</a>. In 11 countries from France and Germany to Spain and Italy, lockdowns pushed the R value below one, meaning the epidemics went into decline.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/global-report-eu-nations-continue-steady-exits-from-lockdown\">Global report: EU nations continue steady exits from lockdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The modelling showed that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people in those countries had been infected by coronavirus but \u201cattack rates\u201d varied dramatically, from 0.46% of Norwegians infected to 8% of Belgians. In the UK an estimated 5.1% of people were infected. Prof Axel Gandy, a statistician on the team, said the model suggested \u201cwe are very far away from herd immunity\u201d, where at least two-thirds of the population need to have acquired protective immunity to the disease. \u201cWe need to tread very carefully,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2404-8\">More work on lockdowns</a> came from the University of California, Berkeley. Scientists there estimated that lockdowns in the US, France, China, South Korea and Iran had prevented about 530m infections. The research came as New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, declared the country virus-free and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/new-zealand-abandons-covid-19-restrictions-after-nation-declared-no-cases\">scrapped all coronavirus restrictions</a>, except strict border controls.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"634b5ed6-bc05-4cf6-9564-3cf587cdcfc3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gTskXsdMwc0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Enter the virus</strong></h2> \n<p>Scientists worked out early on how the virus invades human cells and establishes infections. Spikes on the virus bind to so-called ACE-2 receptors that pepper the surfaces of many human cells, most importantly those in the respiratory tract. Once latched on, the virus gains entry and replicates over and over, until millions burst out to infect more cells.</p> \n<p>But that might not be the only way in. Separate teams led by the Technical University of Munich and Bristol University found that the virus attaches to a second human cell receptor called NRP1. Like ACE-2, it peppers cells in the respiratory tract, but it is also abundant in olfactory tissues, those that are used to smell.</p> \n<p>Both groups found that blocking the receptor prevented the virus from infecting human cells in the lab, adding weight to the idea that it is important. What is most intriguing about the receptor is that it may be a gateway to the brain, and in particular allow the virus to reach olfactory centres and potentially disrupt the sense of smell.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.137802v2\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.134114v1\">papers</a> are tentative for now and have yet to be published in scientific journals. But if the results are sound, they might explain some of the disease\u2019s stranger symptoms and help to steer future vaccine design.</p> \n<h2><strong>Keep your distance</strong></h2> \n<p>Politicians on either sides of the Atlantic became embroiled in debates over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/science-behind-coronavirus-distancing-rules-2-metre\">safe distancing</a>. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, posted \u2013 and then swiftly deleted \u2013 a photo of President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign staff displaying zero physical distancing. Meanwhile in the UK, the Tories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/mps-pressure-boris-johnson-cut-2-metre-distancing-rule-tories-covid-19-england-uk-economy\">piled pressure on Boris Johnson</a> to reduce the 2-metre distancing guideline to 1 metre, amid concerns for the economy, in particular pubs, cafes and restaurants. Johnson made clear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/englands-2-metre-distancing-rule-still-under-review\">he wants to ease the rule</a>, but uncertainty around whether the advice will be changed has caused chaos for councils and retailers, who may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/uncertainty-over-2-metre-distancing-rule-in-england-causing-chaos\">wasted millions of pounds</a> on signs and other preparations for reopening the high streets.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/science-behind-coronavirus-distancing-rules-2-metre\">What is the science behind the UK's coronavirus distancing rules?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Prof Susan Michie, who sits on the behavioural science subgroup of the government\u2019s Sage committee of experts, said reducing the distance to 1m would undermine messages of how the virus is transmitted. \u201cIt seems to me that now is not the time to be lifting restrictions unless there\u2019s a very good argument.

Previous research has shown that the virus can survive for anything from four hours on a copper surface to five days on glass, with cardboard, plastic and wood all lying somewhere between. What was less clear was how often domestic objects and surfaces are contaminated with the virus.</p> \n<p>A team of virologists at the University of Bonn hunted for the virus in air samples, wastewater and on surfaces in 21 randomly selected households. All were in quarantine after at least one member had tested positive for the virus. None of the air samples tested positive for the virus, but among the water samples taken from sinks, showers and toilets, 15.5% contained the virus. Strikingly, tests on 119 surfaces, including door knobs, handles, electronic gadgets, furnishings, food and drink items, clothes, plants and pets, yielded only four positives. These came from one TV remote control, two metal doorknobs and one wooden stove overlay.

Indigenous Australians account for 28% of people in prison. Life expectancy is 10 years less than that of the general population. Decades of calling for recognition in the constitution have gone unanswered.</p> <p>Now that racism is in the headlines, there has been a greater focus on Indigenous Australians, although campaigners have expressed frustration that it took the death of an African American man to shine a light on their plight.</p> <p>The anger has coalesced around high-profile deaths in custody.

Yet he dismissed the broader argument from campaigners that Australia should not see itself as absent of the kind of racism present in the US.</p> <p>\u201cAustralia, in this global moment of Black Lives Matter, is revealing itself as the colonial outpost that it is,\u201d said Dr Chelsea Bond, a Munanjali and South Sea Islander academic at the University of Queensland. She questioned how it was that Morrison could say in the radio interview that there was \u201cno slavery in Australia\u201d.</p> <p>Morrison later acknowledged he had been wrong.

But in his apology, Morrison said he did not want to start a \u201chistory war\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAppealing for truth-telling in history is not a matter of feelings,\u201d Bond said. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply irresponsible for our prime minister to be trying to incite a history war based on lies. It strikes me that he wouldn\u2019t want to use this moment to honour the pain and trauma Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have experienced in this country. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to do that?\u201d</p> <p>The Labor opposition has sought to elevate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/17/ken-wyatt-says-he-has-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-plan-for-scott-morrison\">the case for a \u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/17/ken-wyatt-says-he-has-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-plan-for-scott-morrison\">voice to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/17/ken-wyatt-says-he-has-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-plan-for-scott-morrison\">parliament\u201d</a>, a constitutionally enshrined representative body to advise politicians on Indigenous policy.

And that\u2019s what I would like the media to also focus on: it\u2019s not \u2018do you or don\u2019t you\u2019. It\u2019s actually thinking about deeply what the issues are.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison appeared somewhat chastened as he was taken to task about his claims that there was no slavery in Australia. \u201cI acknowledge there have been all sorts of hideous practices that have taken place. And so I\u2019m not denying any of that. OK. I\u2019m not denying any of that. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to go into an endless history wars discussion about this.\u201d</p> <p>Protesters have indicated they intend to hold more rallies at the weekend. Many argue that while they acknowledge the health risks from the pandemic, racism poses its own risks to Australia\u2019s First Nations people. A popular placard at last weekend\u2019s rallies read \u201cRacism is a pandemic\u201d.</p> <p>Bond said it was a painful moment. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing that black lives matter, but what black people are being reminded of is how little they\u2019ve mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are hurting because it\u2019s taking them back to the first time they noticed that race was real and was violence.

  "<p>The UK government is considering steps to end its ongoing financial support for fossil fuels overseas after using \u00a33.5bn of public funds to support polluting projects since signing the Paris climate agreement.</p> <p>Senior civil servants are understood to be planning a new climate strategy that would phase out financial support for oil and gas infrastructure in developing countries ahead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/cop26-climate-talks-in-glasgow-will-be-delayed-by-a-year-un-confirms\">the UN\u2019s Cop26 international climate talks</a> next year.</p> <p>The talks come amid growing outcry from MPs and campaign groups over the government\u2019s continuing financial support for fossil fuel projects in Africa and south-ease Asia through its foreign finance institutions.</p> <p>Separate investigations by campaigners, to be published this week, reveal that the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/global-witness-accuses-uk-of-rank-hypocrisy-on-fossil-fuel-projects\">has offered billions of pounds-worth of overseas fossil fuel financing</a> since the Paris climate accord was agreed in 2016, and forged close links with the fossil fuel industry through a series of hospitality events and gifts.&nbsp;</p> <p>UK Export Finance (UKEF), a government credit agency, has offered loans, guarantees and insurance worth at least \u00a33bn to UK companies involved in foreign fossil fuel projects since the Paris climate agreement, according to figures unearthed by Global Justice Now.</p> <p>The campaign group found that the government\u2019s development bank, CDC Group, has directly invested at least \u00a3300m in high-emissions projects in Africa and south Asia, including fossil fuel power plants and cement-making.</p> <p>CDC\u2019s indirect investments include \u00a334.5m for the African Infrastructure Investment Fund III, which has invested some of this money in four different fossil fuel projects, according to Global Justice.</p> <p>Daniel Willis, a climate campaigner with Global Justice, said the financial support offered by the financial institutions and other aid since the Paris agreement in 2016 has totalled \u00a33.5bn.</p> <p>\u201cFor the government to show real climate leadership ahead of Cop26 and support a global green recovery from Covid-19, it needs to end these highly damaging investments,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A separate investigation by Global Witness has found that 96% of the gifts and hospitality accepted by UKEF in the past 20 years related to the energy sector were paid for by major fossil fuel companies, including Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil business Saudi Aramco and Gazprom, which is owned by the Russian government.</p> <p>The gifts include Nokia mobile phones from Sabic, a petrochemical company owned by Saudi Aramco, and trips worth several thousand pounds to visit a gas project in Russia that was paid for by Gazprom.</p> <p>A modest 4% of UKEF\u2019s energy industry hospitality events were linked to renewable energy companies, according to the report.</p> <p>Adam McGibbon, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, said UKEF\u2019s hospitality records \u201cunderline just how in bed they are with some of the world\u2019s biggest polluters\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHospitality gifts are more than just pleasantries; they are a tried and tested technique for big business to maintain influence over policy.

A CDC spokesman said the development bank will reveal its new climate strategy later this year, which will prioritise investment in renewable energy over fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p> <p>Government officials are understood to be wary of calling for fossil fuel financing to be ruled out entirely at the expense of helping developing countries achieve other development goals, including access to reliable electricity for almost 1 billion people for the first time.</p> <p>This stance would likely draw criticism from environmentalists and MPs who believe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/08/africa-poised-lead-way-global-green-revolution-says-report\">renewable energy could help power developing economies</a>.</p> <p>The Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, before his election as leader of the opposition, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/06/climate-crisis-green-new-deal-labour-cop26\">said earlier this year</a> that \u201crather than funding fossil fuel projects abroad, we should use our development budget and technical expertise to help other countries skip our bad habits and grow their own low-carbon economies on renewables instead\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department of International Development said the UK government had agreed that \u201call future aid spend will be aligned with the Paris agreement\u201d and last year doubled its investment to help developing countries tackle climate change.</p>",

The oppressed are only going to be oppressed for so long,\u201d Casillas said.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the years since Perez-Lopez was killed, Casillas said he had become even more convinced that real change starts with police reform, a conversation that has been thrust forward as cities explore \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">defunding\u201d police departments</a>.</p> <p>District attorneys must be more willing to prosecute cops for unjustified shootings, he said, and individual police officers must be held accountable.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe threat of criminal prosecution has to be real, and cops have to know their claims of self-defense will be scrutinized before things will change.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018These cops will kill you\u2019</h2> <p>Meanwhile in east Oakland, community organizers are demanding the immediate release of more information on Salgado\u2019s death \u2013 including video footage of the incident<strong>.</strong> </p> <p>Near the memorial constructed at the place where Salgado died, visitors on Monday lit candles, drank beer and wept over the memory of another friend lost to violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a piece of the car he was driving,\u201d said a friend, pointing to a piece of plastic attached to a balloon.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the vigil, a 62-year-old man said he repeatedly warns young people to stay away from police at all costs \u2013 a lesson he said he learned living in east Oakland as a Native American.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI tell these kids, I beg them, these cops will kill you and get away with it.\u201d</p>",

Here are today\u2019s key events:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The national cabinet met and reconfirmed its commitment to the 3-step easing of restrictions, with some changes. Those changes include lifting the 100 person limit on gatherings due in stage 3 of the plan which most states move to from next month. Instead the 1 person per 4sqm rule will apply.</li> \n   <li>Plans are also under way for easing of restrictions on large gatherings. Stadiums that can seat up to 40,000 people will be able to host 10,000 people under step 3.</li> \n   <li>The prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed planning has commenced to allow the safe return of international students to Australia.</li> \n   <li>South Australia set a date of 20 July for the reopening of its borders. Queensland is aiming for 10 July.</li> \n   <li>Rose Bay Public School in Sydney closed due to a suspected covid-19 case that was later confirmed to be positive.</li> \n   <li>Black Lives Matter protestors gathered at Sydney\u2019s Town Hall and Hyde Park on Friday night to draw attention to Australia\u2019s record on Indigenous deaths in custody. They were met with a large police presence.</li> \n   <li> Scott Morrison apologised after he incorrectly stated Australia had no history of slavery.<br></li> \n   <li>NSW postponed local government elections until 2021.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you for joining us.

But the Prime Minister is refusing to rule out kicking workers in other industries off JobSeeker before September. Why can\u2019t the Prime Minister be clear - which Australians will he leave behind? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison:</strong><br></p> \n  <p>From the very outset of this crisis, the Government has put in place the most comprehensive, the largest set of income support and economic lifeline measures that this country has ever seen. And the one we started with was JobSeeker, because JobSeeker, the unemployment benefit is the safety net that sits right under all Australians if they find themselves out of work. That\u2019s what we did first. <br></p> \n  <p>The second measure, substantial measure that we put in place for income support was JobKeeper. Now, JobKeeper was put in to ensure that Australians could find themselves continuing to be on the books of employers and doing some work in some cases, and they would be there in that arrangement for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>That has bought our economy critical time. If businesses were put in a position that they had to make decisions back in March and April about whether those employees could stay in those businesses, we would have seen millions more find themselves on their way seeking support through the unemployment system. <br></p> \n  <p>Now, Mr Speaker, that decision bought those businesses time. It bought Australia time. When other countries were only going for three months, we took the decision to go for six months. <br></p> \n  <p>And that provided some certainty and confidence, and since that time, we have seen consumer confidence restored under the ANZ Index, and 70% restore by business since the COVID crisis hit. Now we are going through the same thoughtful, meticulous process of considering the data and looking forward and reviewing the program to make the right set of decisions about the right combination of income supports and fiscal supports to the economy that would be in place after the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>This is how our Government makes decisions. We do things carefully, considering the advice, looking at the economic environment and ensure that we make those decisions at the right time. <br></p> \n  <p>JobKeeper is there until the end of September, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s why we put it in place. It will remain in place until the end of September. <br></p> \n  <p>And Mr Speaker, it will continue to provide that confidence. At the same time, the Treasurer and I and the members of the Cabinet will work together with the members of the Government to ensure that we get the right balance and mix of fiscal policies, because it\u2019s the fiscal policies, given the absence of monetary ammunition that\u2019s in the system that will be so important. But we want, above all things, above all things, is to get Australians back into jobs. <strong>Australians don\u2019t want to be on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. They want to be in jobs, Mr Speaker.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p>And what we hear from the Opposition all the time is how they would seek to keep people back, not allow them to go forward. And the policies we will put in place and continue to put in place will be about them - not only getting the support they need when they need it.

Why does the prime minister need another review to tell him that Teddy\u2019s sacrifice should be honoured with a Victoria Cross? </p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: t</strong>here is absolutely no doubt that Teddy Sheean was an extraordinary Australian who did extraordinary things. At a time that none of us in this place can possibly imagine. And the issues that were confronted by servicemen and women at that time is nothing we can imagine. Their commanders and those who were there at that time and made judgment on these issues. So when one goes back and looks at these matters again, one must be very careful when they\u2019re putting themselves in the place of others who were there at the time.</p> \n  <p> Now, Mr Speaker, the tribunal, the four members of the tribunal, not all 11, but the four members of it, was unanimous. Not 11, just four. I point that out to the leader of the opposition. As he represented that all 11 members of the tribunal made that decision. That is in fact not the case. There was four, Mr Speaker. </p> \n  <p>But Mr Speaker, equally, then the government receives the recommendation from the tribunal, the government then needs to consider that recommendation informing a view, and indeed, the minister and then the prime minister needs to form a view. And so you take advice from all of the agencies that would have a relevant view on this, as I have done. <br></p> \n  <p>And I tabled, Mr Speaker, the letter from the chief of the defence force, Gen Campbell, for the purposes of the question and for the House. I can assure you, as prime minister and as chair of the national security committee of cabinet, that I do not consider the advice of the chief of the defence Force lightly. I consider it very carefully. And it wasn\u2019t just the current chief of defence force, Mr Speaker. Not just the current chief of the defence force that I have consulted on this matter. But many others, many others, Mr Speaker, who have served in that capacity in recent times. <br></p> \n  <p>So I\u2019m not going to consider the advice that comes from the single person who commands every single man, woman who serves in our defence forces lightly. So the issue that is raised in relation to this matter, Mr Speaker, is whether compelling new evidence has been presented and is available for me to take a decision that would enable me to make a recommendation to Her Majesty. <br></p> \n  <p>Now Mr Speaker, that matter, on my advice, is in dispute, and so I have sought advice from the former defence minister, the former solicitor general, the former secretary of the department of prime minister and cabinet, and one of the most renowned military historians in this country, to consider that very precise question. And Mr Speaker, if that advice comes back and says that very high bar has been passed, then that is helpful advice. And I can assure you, because I consulted the chief of the defence force on this matter. </p> \n  <p>Albanese tries to table the document, but a snippy <strong>Christian Porter </strong>says it is a public document, so no.

The shadow minister wants to bring out quotes. I\u2019ve got a lot of quotes for the shadow minister.

It will mean more new homes, more small businesses and jobs are protected and provide a stronger bridge to the economic recovery of our country.\u2019 And it goes on and on and on. In fact, I\u2019ll continue. I\u2019ll continue if we\u2019ve got quotes. <br></p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a home builder, Jessie Zilkie from Bundaberg ,who said the following in response. On the first Saturday after the homebuilder was announced, the response that they had for the house and land packages, she said the following. <br></p> \n   <p>\u2018We\u2019re gearing up. I\u2019ve employed three people this week in various roles. I\u2019ve been in contact with some subcontractors, suppliers, to make sure that we can handle it. It\u2019s certainly going to be a boost locally to jobs and the industry.\u2019 It goes on and on. In the Domain article that the shadow minister referred to, in that Domain article, it referred to the fact that house and land packages throughout this country increased last Saturday by up to 70%. <br></p> \n   <p>Now what do new home sales mean? It means what I said earlier this week. The hundreds of thousands of jobs in the residential construction industry are protected. Now I know the shadow minister probably hasn\u2019t come across a tradie. He\u2019s been here a bit too long in the halls of Canberra. <br></p> \n   <p>But hundreds of thousands of tradies, carpenters on building sites, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers and in regional Australia \u2013 the timber mill workers who make the frames and trusses. <br></p> \n   <p>The manufacturers who make the bricks and the glass and the tiles. Those hundreds of thousands of jobs will be protected. We estimate 20,000 new homes. 7,000 substantial rebuilds, and those 20,000 new homes we\u2019ve also seen evidence is overwhelmingly supporting new home-buyer, so the Labor party have opposed the first home super saver scheme. They opposed the first home loan deposit scheme.

The scheme provides for 27,000 new projects, which is 7,000 renovation/new builds. And 20,000 new home constructions. It was never the intention of this program to provide subsidy support for small-scale renovations.</p> \n   <p> That was not the purpose. And I\u2019ll tell you why we weren\u2019t going to do that. We weren\u2019t going to do that because the risk of integrity to the program and a repeat of the insulation batts farce that occurred under the Labor party, where people were going around knocking on doors, basically pulling in pink batts and saying that they\u2019re going to put them in your roof and pocketing the difference was a joke. <br></p> \n   <p>It was a complete failure, Mr Speaker. Four people died, Mr Speaker, in relation to that program. They died as a result of that program as established in a royal commission. I note, I note Mr Speaker, in a royal commission. <br></p> \n   <p> So in this program, we were not going to give rise to a situation where people passing themselves off as renovators were going to go and knock on the doors of pensioners, rip out their sinks and dishwashers and then seek to claim some government subsidy. That\u2019s not the nature of the program. <br></p> \n   <p>This is not for do-it-yourself home renovations. This is about approved work by certified builders of significant scale to enable people to bring forward projects that they have put off and now can proceed with. <br></p> \n   <p>Now I note the derision that is applied by those opposite to someone who might be proceeding with a substantial renovation, a new build of their home, of some $150,000. The average loan taken out for a renovation is $164,000.</p> \n   <p> And I can tell you that\u2019s the case, because there are families around this country who cannot afford to go and build a new home. Their families are expanding. Their children are growing up. They can\u2019t afford to sell their house and go and buy land and engage in a new construction. So what do they do? They borrow money to expand their existing home and renovate substantially their existing home, because they can\u2019t afford to build a $300,000 or $350,000 new home. <br></p> \n   <p><strong>The opposition\u2019s derision of this initiative smacks of two things.

People have told me that they want to rebuild, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be able to sign a contract by the end of the year. How will the prime minister ensure that bushfire victims like these ones can access the homebuilder scheme? <br></p> \n  <p><strong>Morrison: </strong>Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member for her question, and I commend her for the work that she\u2019s done within her community, as I do all of those members who have been in bushfire-affected areas for the work that they\u2019ve done in engaging communities and raising issues that need to be addressed. </p> \n  <p>The commitment that we made to the states and territories was to jointly fund the demolition work that was being done across all of those buildings that were damaged and destroyed during the course of the bushfires. <br></p> \n  <p>The advice I have from the state government in NSW is that demolition work will be completed next month, but is already progressing through so many parts of the state. <br></p> \n  <p>That is the project which is managed, by the state government. They\u2019re running the contractors and they\u2019re doing it at a cracking pace and I commend them for doing that, and to keep pushing forward. The homebuilder program, as introduced by the housing minister and by the treasurer enables grants of $25,000 for those who are eligible under the income test rules to be able to support the construction of new homes. <br></p> \n  <p>And one of the key issues I\u2019ve been discussing with the state and territory premiers has been how we can escalate and more rapidly ensure that approvals are given, not just for these types of cases but more generally. The purpose is to bring it there and get the projects happening again. <br></p> \n  <p>But people in affected areas are eligible for the grants, subject of course to the income restrictions placed on those, and I\u2019ll be working closely with the states and territories to ensure that they can accelerate the rate of a home approval, not just in these areas but everywhere, because this is critical to job creation.

Are those requirements being observed for special purpose flights in and did you have to warn<strong> Alan Tudge </strong>and others that they weren\u2019t correctly social distancing on the most recent flight from Melbourne to Canberra?</p> \n  <p><strong>Murphy:</strong> social distancing is not possible in the same way in domestic flights. We have a domestic airline policy. Airlines, domestic airlines, certainly short-haul airlines, present quite a low risk of transmission because of their air handling. We have not seen a clear case of transmission of the virus on a domestic flight in Australia. So whilst initially the airlines were practising good distancing, they are now occupying their seats more fully, and I know that\u2019s one of the circumstances where we think it\u2019s not an unreasonable choice if someone chooses to wear a mask.</p> \n  <p> I certainly have not warned any politician about not practising social distancing. So airlines, and on the return flights from overseas, they have been at 80% occupancy, so we\u2019re trying to get a bit of gap. But you can\u2019t get the full 1.5-metre on a flight.

Its health policy, its youth policy, its suicide policy, its employment policy, its welfare policy; this is an incredibly complicated area and not all Indigenous experiences are the same. Indigenous Australians living in metropolitan areas have different life experiences to those living in regional and remote areas and so to suggest that there is one set of issues that applies to the Indigenous population is obviously ridiculous.</p> \n   <p>And we are aware of the heartbreaking stories within remote Indigenous communities, of abuse, sexual violence, of alcoholism, of drug abuse.

Delivery frequency in rural, regional and remote areas will not change. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that wait times for letters will more than double, from three to seven days. <strong>This is not true.</strong> Mail speed standards for regular interstate letters (mail travelling around the country) have not changed. Whether measured in business days or actual days, the speed of delivery for intrastate mail has changed by only one or two days for regular intrastate letters, not out by four days as suggested.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed regional Australians and small business will be disadvantaged compared to metropolitan areas. <strong>This is not true.</strong> While the delivery frequency of regular mail has been adjusted in metropolitan areas, the delivery frequency for regular mail for rural, regional and remote areas was protected and remains unchanged. Licensed post offices \u2013 which, together with community postal agencies, represent about 2,300 small businesses in regional and rural communities \u2013 have come out in active support of the temporary regulatory changes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that vulnerable Australians will be most impacted by the changes. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The temporary regulatory changes give Australia Post flexibility to provide additional services that better support vulnerable Australians, such as delivering medicines and grocery boxes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the changes are permanent. <strong>This is not true.</strong> The regulations are written such that changes will automatically end on 30 June 2021. The government will assess the effect of these temporary arrangements before the end of the year, and decide if they are to stay in place for the full period expected. Any extension of the temporary relief measures will be informed by relevant consultations. Such an extension would also be subject to a new disallowance period.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>It has been claimed that the government wants to privatise Australia Post. <strong>This is not true. </strong>The Morrison government is fully committed to Australia Post remaining in government ownership.

This includes practising good hand and respiratory hygiene, staying 1.5m away from other people, staying home when sick, and getting tested if they have cold or flu like symptoms.

You can feel it in the air. And some of it is racially charged. There\u2019s also a few other issues that we need to get to. Wayne Swan was on our show about half an hour ago saying Pete, Captain Cook statues and the like may be better placed in museums, what do you think?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>Well, I think a museum would be a great place for Wayne Swan. I can\u2019t think of anyone more in the past than Wayne Swan. Really, is he serious? Look, I don\u2019t think ripping pages out of history books and brushing over parts of history that you don\u2019t agree with or that you don\u2019t like is really something that the Australian public is going to embrace. There are good and bad parts of our history. You learn from that. And sit down \u2013 and you see what Netflix has done and the ABC now is trying to do. I just think it is such an absurdity. You sit down with your kids, looking at some of these videos, explaining that slavery was a horrible period in the United States. There was a civil war that took place. Kids learn from all of that. But removing that sort of content from online or from our television sets, I just don\u2019t think makes any sense. People need to learn from history. Need to appreciate those periods. And people will reflect back on us in 100 years and no doubt form their own judgments as well. But I just really think airbrushing history or pretending that something didn\u2019t happen is such an obscure sort of leftwing cause. I don\u2019t think the mainstream public agree with it.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Q: </strong>Richard, you\u2019re left wing, have things gone too far?<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Dutton: </strong>He has got two left wings.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Marles: </strong>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a leftwing cause. I think history matters. People need to be judged in the context of their history. And as Peter said, future generations are going to judge us. They are actually going to judge us on what we do or do not do in terms of dealing with the question of Indigenous disadvantage in this country. That\u2019s what we have got to be focusing on. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to be given a lot of credit for going on a statue rampage. We actually have to be doing something about improving the lives of Indigenous Australians right now and I think that\u2019s what should be our focus.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-12T00:48:52.795Z\">at 1.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2c1438f0839df653844dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:42:34.397Z\">12.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For all the international coronavirus news, head here</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/12/coronavirus-live-news-markets-fall-over-fears-of-long-us-recovery-as-brazil-cases-top-800000\">Coronavirus live news: markets fall over fears of long US recovery as Brazil cases top 800,000</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ee2be718f08969537f781c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-11T23:35:47.180Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Albanese on statues: 'You can't rewrite history, you have to learn from it'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>called in to Sydney radio 2GB, where he was asked about what is apparently the biggest issue in Australia at the moment \u2013 the tearing down of statues.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My position is very clear, which is that you can\u2019t rewrite history, you have to learn from it.

I don\u2019t know where all this hope is coming from but we\u2019re getting there, we\u2019re stepping towards saying what needs to be said, unfiltered.

We do not have a backdoor that allows someone to enter a meeting without being visible.\u201d</p> <p>The statement raises questions about Zoom bowing to Chinese pressure. Unlike many Western social media platforms, it is not blocked in China. The company did not explain under what law the meetings \u2013 which were hosted outside mainland China \u2013 were deemed to be illegal.</p> <p>Zoom said it had no ability to block participants from particular countries and so it ended three of the meetings and suspended or terminated the associated host accounts. Zoom said it took no action for one meeting because metadata showed it had no participants from mainland China, however two of the others had a \u201csignificant number of mainland China participants\u201d.</p> <p>It is unclear why the company would shut down the accounts of Zoom users based in the US and in Hong Kong. The account of Zhou Fengsuo, a Chinese activist based in the US, was shut down days after he hosted a memorial for the Tiananmen crackdown.</p> <p>Lee Cheuk-Yan, a pro-democracy campaigner in Hong Kong who organises a yearly Tiananmen vigil, saw his account shut down just before hosting an event on a controversial extradition law that caused mass anti-government protests in the city for the last year.</p> <p>Lee said Zoom\u2019s response was \u201cshameful\u201d and accused it of \u201cpolitical censorship\u201d. \u201cThey have restored my account but Zoom continues to kneel before the Communist party,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy purpose on opening Zoom is to reach out to mainland Chinese, breaking the censorship of the Chinese Communist party. With this policy it defeats my original purpose.\u201d He said he had closed his account and requested a refund.</p> <p>Wang Dan, another activist whose Zoom event on 3 June to commemorate the anniversary of the 4 June Tiananmen crackdown was shut down twice, said: \u201cThe Chinese communist party is actively attacking democracy around the world. They have already started to intervene in the social system and way of life in the US. The whole world should be on alert.\u201d</p> <p>Wang said Zoom\u2019s statement did not absolve the company from responsibility for infringing on the \u201crights and interests\u201d of citizens in the US where the company is based. \u201cWe will continue to seek the support of the law and public opinion, and ask zoom to take responsibility for its own wrong behaviour,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Because Zoom is not blocked in China it has been used by some activists who want to reach those on the mainland. Wang and Lee\u2019s events were both hosted outside of mainland China.</p> <p>Zoom said it would no longer allow requests from Beijing to impact anyone outside of mainland China, however it was developing ways to block people from inside the country. The new measure \u201cwill enable us to comply with requests from local authorities when they determine activity on our platform is illegal within their borders\u201d, it said.</p> <p>\u201cHowever we will also be able to protect these conversations for participants outside of those borders where the activity is allowed.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/24/uk-government-told-not-to-use-zoom-because-of-china-fears\">UK government told not to use Zoom because of China fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe hope that one day, governments who build barriers to disconnect their people from the world and each other will recognise that they are acting against their own interests, as well as the rights of their citizens and all humanity.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs, told reporters at a regular press briefing that she was not aware of the details of the case.</p> <p>US lawmakers and human rights groups have condemned Zoom. US representatives Greg Walden and Cathy McMorris Rodgers sent a letter to Zoom CEO Eric Yuan calling on him to clarify his company\u2019s practices. US senator Josh Hawley asked Yuan to \u201cpick a side: American principles and free-speech, or short-term global profits and censorship\u201d.</p> <p>Yaqiu Wang, China researcher for Human Rights Watch said: \u201cLaws in China are often abusive and don\u2019t comply with international human rights standards. Yet tech companies have a responsibility to respect human rights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTech companies should stand together to resist Beijing\u2019s censorship demands and uphold the right to freedom of expression.

Judged by this&nbsp;yardstick, the UK was last in recession in 2008-09, when there were&nbsp;six consecutive quarters of negative growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Some economists believe this definition of recession is flawed, since an economy would not be in recession if it contracted by 5% in the first quarter, expanded by 0.1% in each of the following two quarters and then contracted again by 5% in the fourth quarter. It would, however, be deemed to be in recession if it grew by 5% in each of the first and fourth quarters but contracted by 0.1% in each of the second and third quarters.</p>\n    <p>An alternative \u2013 and tougher definition \u2013 is a full calendar year of negative output. Given the UK economy has grown on average by 2.5% over many decades, it is rare for gross domestic product (GDP) to fall on an annual basis. There have been only five such years since the end of the second world war: 1974, 1975, 1980, 1981 and 1991.</p>\n    <p>The United States has its own method of assessing recession, with the National Bureau of Economic Research's business cycle-dating committee making a judgment.</p>\n    <p>The NBER defines recession as \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production and wholesale-retail sales\".</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Given the rapid onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the Bank of England has estimated GDP could contract by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\">25% in the second quarter</a> and unemployment more than double, triggering what it expects to be the deepest recession for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/what-caused-the-economic-slump-of-1706-\">more than 300 years</a>.

  "<p>When tennis (along with golf) was granted an early release from lockdown last month, it prompted a few outraged mutterings. How typical of Boris, our tennis-playing prime minister, to favour a sport played overwhelmingly by his own kind. In theory, it\u2019s not quite as simple as that: you don\u2019t need to be well-heeled to play tennis in Britain. The country has thousands of public courts, which are either free, or very cheap, to use. Balls and rackets aren\u2019t that expensive. Yet the perception remains, in the UK and elsewhere, that tennis is a sport for the few not the many.</p> <p>It is associated with sealed-off private spaces, with posh people in pressed white linen, with codes of etiquette (and tricky techniques) that take a lifetime to master. And whereas tennis clubs across the country welcomed their members back with alacrity, I have found it striking, walking around the town where I live&nbsp;these past few weeks,&nbsp;to see&nbsp;many public courts remaining padlocked.&nbsp;Middle England may be excitedly dusting off its tennis gear \u2013&nbsp;albeit in preparation for a Wimbledon-free summer \u2013&nbsp;but that hasn\u2019t always been possible for the rest of the country.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because tennis was considered effeminate, it suited men to have women at clubs, to allay suspicions about their sexuality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>David Berry\u2019s engaging and thoughtful book sets out to show that tennis doesn\u2019t deserve its elitist reputation. \u201cUnderneath its establishment image,\u201d he writes, \u201ctennis is a surprisingly radical game.\u201d He isn\u2019t the first author to make such a claim. In her quirky 2014 book <em>Love </em><em>Game, </em>the cultural historian Elizabeth Wilson attempted to prove that tennis is inherently subversive and \u201cromantic\u201d. Hers was an argument rooted in aesthetics: she stressed the sport\u2019s visual similarity to dance, and suggested that it has an \u201cerotic\u201d undertow. Berry, a former TV producer, adopts a different approach. For him, the radicalism of tennis has less to do with the feelings it inspires than with the ways in which it has functioned, over the years, as a fulcrum for various social forces, quite a few of which have been progressive.</p> <p>The most basic observation Berry makes is that tennis has often appealed to mavericks and misfits. This was especially the case in its early decades. The sport\u2019s first great populariser, Major Walter Wingfield, was an oddball Victorian inventor who,&nbsp;prior to launching his portable lawn tennis sets in 1873,&nbsp;unleashed a series of&nbsp;other&nbsp;products on the public, among them \u201ca butterfly bicycle, a smoking mixture and a French cookery school\u201d.&nbsp;All, Berry writes, were \u201ca little ahead of their time\u201d. Four years later, the first Wimbledon took place: its referee was a former doctor, who would parade around the grounds wearing white flannel trousers and a white helmet, smoking Turkish cigarettes and dispensing opinions \u201con everything\u201d.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"da10e26644971c5193fb104b8e4213682df92f01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da10e26644971c5193fb104b8e4213682df92f01/0_0_2976_4275/696.jpg\" alt=\"Lottie Dod, circa 1890.\" width=\"696\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lottie Dod, c1890.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: W and D Downey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though initially played in grand country houses, tennis soon migrated to cities and towns, where it appealed to middle-class people of an \u201cintellectual and artistic\u201d bent.&nbsp;It was also popular among men of the cloth, and indeed the third Wimbledon&nbsp;was won by the Rev John Thorneycroft Hartley \u2013&nbsp;the only vicar ever to lift the title.&nbsp;Such men were attracted to tennis, Berry suggests, largely because it released them from the stifling masculine codes of the day. On court, men could be more expressive than normal. This, I think, remains true today: \u201cmanly\u201d men rarely have much time for tennis.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tennis was of course also played by women \u2013 and that truly was a radical departure. Victorian women could cycle and play croquet, but they were largely excluded from other sports: rugby, cricket, football, golf. There was a brief attempt, in the 1880s, to shut them out of tennis too, but it was quickly rebuffed. One reason, interestingly, seems to have been a specific kind of self-interest on the part of male players: because tennis was considered an effeminate sport, it suited them to have women at clubs, to help allay suspicions about their sexuality.</p> <p>If tennis attracted effeminate men, it also drew masculine women \u2013&nbsp;or at any rate those inclined to rebel against the constraints of Victorian femininity. To play tennis well, women had to be more athletic than was considered decorous, and also had to abandon \u2013&nbsp;or at least modify \u2013&nbsp;the standard mid-Victorian sporting uniform of whale-bone corsets, petticoats and aprons, and ankle-high leather boots. As Berry points out, the early female tennis players weren\u2019t so much radical by nature as radicalised through the act of devoting themselves to sport.&nbsp;The most remarkable figure of this generation was Lottie Dod, who won her first Wimbledon title in 1887, aged 15, and went on to win it four more times before retiring aged 21. She subsequently represented England at hockey, archery, and later volunteered for the Republicans in the Spanish civil war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c054a5ec703326a46d9167e41a1f68e7303b5a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c054a5ec703326a46d9167e41a1f68e7303b5a7/0_158_4132_2480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Osaka is the world\u2019s highest paid female athlete.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Osaka is the world\u2019s highest paid female athlete.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Since then, tennis certainly hasn\u2019t been devoid of sexism. Female players have had to get used to the inordinate attention paid to their looks \u2013 a trend that really got going in the 1920s with the appearance of the game\u2019s first female superstar, Suzanne Lenglen,&nbsp;another outsized character who would suck brandy-soaked sugar cubes between points, and received admirers in the bath following her victories. And tennis dragged its heels for too long on the issue of equal remuneration, only finally switching to it, in all four Grand Slam events, in 2007. Still, compared with other sports, it looks like a bastion of sexual equality. No other sport has consistently produced global stars of both sexes, and it is by far the most lucrative sport women play. (The top 10 highest paid female athletes in the world last year were all tennis players.) One plank of Berry\u2019s argument is resoundingly correct: tennis has often been a force for women\u2019s advancement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On issues such as class and race, tennis\u2019s reputation for elitism is deserved: its record has been shoddy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet problems emerge when he broadens his argument. Because his aim is to prove that tennis is a sport of the \u201cpeople\u201d, he also tries to demonstrate that its non-elitism extends to other areas besides gender. And here he faces a much sterner challenge. The plain truth is that on issues such as class and race, tennis\u2019s reputation for elitism is deserved: its record has been pretty shoddy. In chapters dealing with working-class and ethnic minority participation, Berry strives to show that the sport has been less monocultural than is assumed. In the interwar years, for example, tennis was briefly adopted by the Labour movement: several socialist tennis clubs were set up, as was a \u201cWorkers\u2019 Wimbledon\u201d. He also tells the story of a scheme in north London in the 1960s and 70s to produce a champion from among the city\u2019s black kids.</p> <p>Such things are interesting to read about, but the fact of their existence is not proof of their importance. I am sceptical of Berry\u2019s claim that his book reveals a \u201chidden history\u201d of tennis. Most of the progressive trends he highlights didn\u2019t amount to much. After the war, \u201csocialist tennis\u201d petered out, and a black player of note still hasn\u2019t emerged from Britain\u2019s inner cities. Britain\u2019s most successful ever black player is the current world No 50, Heather Watson \u2013 whose advancement up the tennis ladder, Berry points out, was assisted by having a millionaire father.</p> <p>Berry concludes his book with a discussion of tennis clubs. Having stopped playing the sport in early adulthood, he took it up again in middle age, and joined a club in north London. The experience, he says, was revelatory, and made him realise that tennis clubs have fundamentally changed. From being redoubts of exclusion and social climbing, they have mutated into places where the capitalist world is \u201ckept at a distance\u201d, where what people do in the wider world is entirely unimportant: \u201cStatus is earned over months and years either on court, by helping run the club or by sheer character.\u201d It isn\u2019t, perhaps, altogether surprising that a leftie like Berry should find a north London tennis club so congenial. Nonetheless, I know what he means: at the two tennis clubs I\u2019ve been a member of as an adult, one in south-east London and one in Kent, I\u2019ve encountered exactly the same non-judgmental culture. Yet it remains the case that the kind of refuge these clubs provide is only available to a small portion of the population. Here, as elsewhere, Berry seems a little too eager to present tennis as a \u201cprogressive\u201d sport.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>William Skidelsky\u2019s Federer and Me is published by Yellow Jersey.

University say they are so disillusioned by its failure to tackle racism that they no longer feel comfortable working on outreach programmes to attract others to follow in their footsteps, a leading BAME society has said.</p> <p>The Oxford African and Caribbean Society (ACS), the university\u2019s main group representing black students, said it remained committed to widening access, but more needed to be done to foster an inclusive and anti-racist environment.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot in good conscience tell any black student to apply to the University of Oxford,\u201d one student told the Guardian. \u201cThey have made a public statement in support of Black Lives Matter (BLM) but continue to alienate the black students within their university.\u201d</p> <p>Oxford has long been criticised for the lack of diversity in its student and staff bodies, and has invested large amounts of money and effort in its widening participation programmes. Student ambassadors work closely with the university organising workshops, conferences and residential programmes to encourage more black students to apply.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OxfordACS/status/1268958844887146496\">The ACS statement</a>, which was signed by student union leaders across the institution, said: \u201cThere is a general perception that the university continues to indicate that it is more offended by the identification of racism than the actuality of its lived experience...</p> <p>\u201cIt is with great sadness that we have seen a number of students disillusioned to the point that they no longer feel comfortable being involved with university access and outreach initiatives.\u201d</p> <p>Kesaia Toganivalu, a first-year English student at Magdalen College, said: \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good getting more black students to come to Oxford, the real problem is what happens to these students when they get into the environment\u2026 The university perpetuates an image of tolerance, and wanting to do better, but once you are in the door, you can be treated like a second-class citizen.\u201d</p> <p>In recent days there has been an outcry from black and minority ethnic (BAME) students who have written letters condemning the university\u2019s record on dealing with racism. It has coincided with mass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter </a>demonstrations across the globe in protest at the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, horror at the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on the BAME community, and a renewed campaign for the removal of a statue of the Victorian imperialist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/protesters-rally-in-oxford-for-removal-of-cecil-rhodes-statue\">Cecil Rhodes</a> from Oxford\u2019s Oriel College.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/students/news/2020-06-10-open-letter-oxford-students-vice-chancellor-and-heads-house\">open letter</a> signed by the heads of colleges, the vice chancellor of Oxford, Louise Richardson, admitted the university\u2019s failings. \u201cWhile much is being done by many committed people, we acknowledge that we are rightly reproached for our collective failure to address the issue of systemic racism properly, and that we&nbsp;have work to do.\u201d</p> <p>On the Rhodes Must Fall protests, Prof Richardson warned against trying to hide the past, and claimed <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/10/exclusive-nelson-mandela-would-have-opposed-rhodes-must-fall/\">Nelson Mandela </a>would have opposed the campaign. \u201cMy own view on this is that hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-52999319\">told the BBC</a>. \u201cWe need to understand this history and understand the context in which it was made and why it was that people believed then as they did.\u201d</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/oxford-college-heads-stand-with-black-students-to-fight-against-systemic-racism\">a letter </a>was published in the Guardian from the heads of all the Oxford colleges advocating the role of education in building racial equality and a post on Twitter stated: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to supporting our community in opposing racism in all its forms, including upholding anti-racist values.\u201d</p> <p>The ACS said, however, there was a discrepancy between the university\u2019s public statements on racism and the lived reality for black students at Oxford, and called for each college to appoint a designated tutor for race. \u201cAt the moment what has been declared publicly, is unfortunately at odds with the real life experiences of black students at the University of Oxford.\u201d</p> <p>Last week the university caused further upset when it <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/oxford-university-delays-admissions-data-world-events_uk_5ed8b754c5b6f3c22ef0232a\">delayed publishing its latest admissions data</a> on the diversity of its students, citing it was not the right time to share data in light of \u201cworld events\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is precisely due to these same \u2018world events\u2019 that Oxford ACS feels that we can no longer delay commenting on the realities of racism not only within Oxford, but actively upheld and enabled by the university and its colleges,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>According to the ACS, those realities include racist comments, posts and actions by students across the university. Victims who denounce racism find themselves accused of \u201cbullying\u201d and \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d, and perpetrators are allowed to evade accountability, the letter said.</p> <p>The ACS also raised concerns about the lack of welfare provisions for black students and criticised the handling of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/05/oxford-university-race-row-george-floyd-joke-hustings-event-christ-church-college\">an incident at Christ Church college</a> last week after a black student called out a racist \u201cjoke\u201d which made light of the killing of Floyd by a white police officer who knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes.</p> <p>Responding to the issues raised in the ACS letter and others, Richardson said: \u201cWe\u2019re determined to support our black students in every way we can.\u201d&nbsp;She said there would be zero tolerance&nbsp;for racist comments or behaviours by staff or students and promised measures including more black counsellors, a university fundraising initiative for scholarships for black students and a review of all equality and diversity training materials that are used across the university and colleges to ensure they are fit for purpose.</p>",
  "<h2>Top story: Call for inquiry into Covid-19 failings</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray here to round out the week with the top stories of Friday.</p> \n<p>Officials failed to stockpile gowns and personal protective equipment in the build-up to the Covid-19 pandemic despite warnings to do so, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has revealed.

We are working with the Home Office to determine what must change so that this shameful period of our history is not repeated.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of Covid-19 and the killing of George Floyd by US police officers has resulted in urgent calls for action to end the systemic and entrenched race inequalities that exist in our country.

He has organised a <a href=\"https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/windrush-never-again\">petition</a>, so far signed by over 100,000 people, calling for the full implementation of all 30 recommendations set out in Williams review.

The \u2018lessons learned review\u2019 is a damning indictment on Home Office attitudes and culture of the government in how they treated the Windrush Generation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Labour MP Yvette Cooper , chair of the home affairs committee, said she was concerned that the Home Office had made slow progress in acting to rectify the mistakes made. \u201cThe home secretary has committed to looking at the recommendations of the Wendy Williams review, but after successive home affairs committee reports raising serious concerns about hostile environment measures, casework culture and the culture of targets in the Home Office, progress has been slow. It is vital that the government immediately accepts Wendy Williams\u2019 recommendation for a full review and evaluation of the hostile environment policy and measures.\u201d</p> <p>Kimberly McIntosh, of the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cWith the immigration bill making its way through parliament, it\u2019s time to tackle the longstanding injustices that permeate our immigration system. The government should implement the full set of recommendations made in the lessons learned review and end the hostile environment policies that wrought havoc on the lives of not just the Windrush generation, but countless others.\u201d</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: </p> <p>\u201cWe are carefully considering the findings of the Windrush Lessons Learned review and will respond shortly to those important recommendations. We will also work with the EHRC on the review they have launched.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>At least $67bn of the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 can be attributed directly to climate breakdown, according to research that could lead to a radical reassessment of the costs of damage from extreme weather.</p> <p>Harvey ripped through the Caribbean and the US states of Texas and Louisiana, causing at least $90bn of damage to property and livelihoods, and killing scores of people.</p> <p>Conventional economic estimates attributed only about $20bn of the destruction to the direct impacts of global heating. Climate breakdown is known to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/20/are-hurricanes-getting-stronger-and-is-the-climate-crisis-to-blame\">making hurricanes stronger</a> and may make them more likely to occur, but separating the effects of global heating from the natural weather conditions that also cause hurricanes is complex.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-020-02692-8\">study published in the journal Climatic Change</a>, researchers used the emerging science of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/27/hadley-climate-centre-turns-30-the-human-fingerprint-is-everywhere\">climate change attribution</a> to calculate the odds of such a hurricane happening naturally or under increased carbon dioxide levels, and applied the results to the damage caused.</p> <p>Similar methods were used in a <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-020-02729-y\">separate study</a>, published last month in the same journal, that found that droughts in New Zealand between 2007 and 2017 cost the economy about NZ$4.8bn, of which $800m was directly linked to climate change. Floods caused insured losses of about NZ$470m over the same period, of which NZ$140m was linked to the climate.</p> <p>The researchers say the new tools are a more accurate way of estimating the economic damage caused by climate breakdown.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re pretty sure the climate change-related damages associated with extreme events have been underestimated in most assessments of the social cost of carbon,\u201d said David Frame, a professor of climate change at the Victoria University of Wellington and the lead author of the studies. \u201cWe think this line of research, as it matures, should provide a really valuable input.\u201d</p> <p>Friederike Otto, the director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said the method could make it possible to generate global estimates of the true cost of climate breakdown, which could have a profound effect on how governments and businesses approach the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>\u201cWe have known about the costs of climate change theoretically,\u201d said Otto. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well in the abstract, but the global mean temperature does not kill anyone \u2013 extreme events cost money and lives. Being able to attribute these impacts to climate change means being able to convey what climate change really means.\u201d</p> <p>She said it would become possible to compile an inventory of the damage that could be attributed to climate change around the world, which governments and businesses could use to bring about change. \u201cHopefully this will speed up the process of moving to net zero [carbon].\u201d</p> <p>Estimating the true costs of the climate crisis could also help developing countries seeking recognition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/dec/08/doha-climate-change-deal-nations\">loss and damage</a> they face as a result of climate breakdown, which they argue should spur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/finance-holds-climate-key-but-poor-countries-fear-missing-out\">rich countries to provide more assistance</a>. Loss and damage is likely to be one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world\">most vexed issues</a> at next year\u2019s UN <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/26/cop26-climate-talks-in-glasgow-likely-to-be-delayed-again\">Cop26</a> climate summit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/greta-thunberg-and-childrens-group-hit-back-at-attempt-to-throw-out-climate-case\">Legal actions</a> around the world would also be affected, said Tessa Khan, a co-director of the Climate Litigation Network. Activists and local governments around the world are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/04/governments-and-firms-28-countries-sued-climate-crisis-report\">taking fossil fuel companies to court</a> over their greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that they knowingly caused damage while profiting from raising carbon dioxide levels.</p> <p>\u201c[The two new studies] are opening to door to stronger evidence to persuade courts that fossil fuel companies should be held accountable for their role,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThis will strengthen the legal basis of these lawsuits.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s a new divide in the Conservative party: Waitrose or Lidl? But it\u2019s not about which supermarket you shop at. It\u2019s how you view a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/boris-johnson-trade-deal-us-chlorinated-chicken\">potential trade deal</a> with the US.</p> <p>As talks get under way across the pond, the cabinet is split between those who wish to prioritise British farmers and those who want their constituents to benefit from cheaper produce on the supermarket shelf.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a rehash of remain v leave. Instead it\u2019s about which part of the Tory voter coalition gets priority treatment: traditionally Tory rural constituencies or the post-industrial, \u201cred wall\u201d seats that the party won for the first time last December.</p> <p>A trade deal with the US has long been cited by Tory Brexiteers as the jewel in the crown of their plans for post-Brexit Britain. The idea is that such an arrangement with Washington would remove the UK from Brussels\u2019 regulatory orbit and show that the UK can negotiate its own trade deals even with the world\u2019s largest economies.</p> <p>But despite the Conservatives now having a majority of 80, senior Tories are beginning to worry that their free market dream is on life support. As the prime minister grapples with the government response to coronavirus, a battle of ideas is playing out among ministers and MPs \u2013 and to the surprise of the free marketeers, it\u2019s the protectionists who are on the front foot.</p> <p>This month Boris Johnson agreed a proposal for the trade deal that would see a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/poultry/government-plans-dual-tariff-system-for-us-chicken-imports\">dual tariff</a>\u201d system in place that could allow ministers to use high tariffs to make it economically unsustainable for US producers to supply the UK with controversial foodstuffs such as chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in real danger of a once-in-a-lifetime chance to do a trade agreement with the United States being hijacked by a bunch of Waitrose protectionists,\u201d says a senior Tory.&nbsp;The Waitrose set, as they have been dubbed, are made up of the likes of the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, environment secretary George Eustice, his predecessor Theresa Villiers and green Brexiteers such as Zac Goldsmith and Danny Kruger.</p> <p>Boosted from the sidelines by rural and organic champions such as Henry Dimbleby, this group wants British farmers and UK food standards to remain protected.&nbsp;Their concern is that farmers must not be undercut by cheaper production and lower animal welfare standards.</p> <p>Leading the charge on the free market side is the international trade secretary, Liz Truss \u2013 with a majority of the cabinet sympathetic to her position. They believe they have public support, &nbsp;with internal polling suggesting 62% of Britons back a deal.</p> <p>Those familiar with Truss\u2019s thinking insist she does not favour chlorinated chicken, but does view free trade as a way to increase consumer choice. The growing concern among this group \u2013 the Lidl free marketeers \u2013 is that chlorinated chicken is being used to shut down any debate on wider imports from the US.</p> <p>Several of the usual suspects who would be looked at to make the case have been missing in action of late, their attention focused either on China or the need for the lockdown to be eased. So it\u2019s the new intake of red wall MPs who are agitating that protectionism could deprive their voters of a tangible benefit of Brexit: cheaper food on the supermarket shelf.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that a lot of the MPs hijacking the debate represent wealthier constituencies with middle-class neighbourhoods,\u201d says one. \u201cThey might appreciate organic produce but our new voters want decent stuff on the shelf and they also want choice.\u201d</p> <p>This split between the agricultural interests and free trade goes back a long way, of course. In 1846, Robert Peel<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/07/tories-face-a-corn-law-moment-but-catharsis-is-nowhere-in-sight\"> repealed the corn laws</a> to provide cheap food for people in the new manufacturing centres. But that decision led to his resignation and a schism that kept the Tories out of power for the best part of 30 years.</p> <p>Coronavirus and the new importance placed on supply chain security&nbsp;means the argument for free trade \u2013 that many Brexiteers believed they had won in the EU referendum, Tory leadership contest and general election \u2013 is becoming harder to make. As Johnson\u2019s government becomes more interventionist and looks to make Britain more self-sufficient, arguments for free trade will have to be made again.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s final decision on the deal will come down to how he plans to sell Brexit in the post-coronavirus landscape.

What other countries have handled racism or slavery better than the US? I\u2019m not saying that waving the red, white and blue; but so often people look at America and all they see is blatant acts of racism and then they are deaf, dumb and blind to racism in their own country. I understand why the US gets the scrutiny, because supposedly it\u2019s the cradle of democracy, and we do [racism] better than anyone else!&nbsp;</p> <p>Also, because of Hollywood. Because of television. It is my belief that the US is not a leader in the world because we have more nuclear weapons than anybody; it\u2019s the export of culture. Music, dance, Apple, Nike \u2013 that\u2019s how America dominates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"George Miller\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/mad-max-australian-cinema-ozploitation\">George Miller</a></strong><br>Director</h2> <p><strong>Why do you think we are impelled to tell each other stories?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>First of all, I gotta give love!

Unlike earlier US and EU sanctions it targets the regime\u2019s backers outside of Syria; in banking, business and politics, expanding a remit to neighbouring capitals, the Gulf states and Europe, which have maintained economic links to Damascus. From 17 June, institutions, businesses or officials that finance the government of Bashar al-Assad could be subject to travel bans, denied access to capital, and face other measures including arrest.</p> <p>Ibrahim Olabi, a British barrister who founded the Syrian Legal Development Programme, an organisation that works on sanctions, said that even among some of the law\u2019s proponents there are growing concerns that a \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach could overshadow the intent of the law. He said earlier US and European Union sanctions had a more limited mandate.</p> <p>\u201cThe Caesar sanctions definitely have the potential to be a bigger deal because the US is using them to deter countries from doing business with Syria,\u201d said Olabi. \u201cThe US has recognised that Syria is a proxy arena for all the elements they\u2019re targeting.</p> <p>\u201cUsing the human rights abuses that were committed there as the vehicle helps give the US additional legal leverage for Caesar. Instead of Iranian and Hezbollah actors looking like they are being targeted on political grounds, they now could be targeted on the basis that they are supporting the unprecedented human rights abuses in Syria.\u201d</p> <p>As the Syrian economy has unravelled since March, so too has Lebanon; both countries\u2019 currencies have plunged in parallel, and prices of essential goods are now beyond the reach of many. In Syria, protests against the imploding economy have been held this week in regime strongholds such as Latakia \u2013 a rarity throughout the war. And on Thursday, Assad fired the country\u2019s prime minister, Imad Khamis, as pressure continues to grow from an increasingly desperate and vocal public.</p> <p>The ramifications of Caesar are rippling through Beirut, where traders retain lucrative ties to Syrian officials that are barely keeping Lebanese state revenues ticking over.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a disaster for the [Lebanese] government, said one Lebanese banker. \u201cThey will sanction Lebanese traders and banks. Our currency will plunge as far as theirs. One of the few places we can trade is Damascus. If that\u2019s shut down, we\u2019re doomed.\u201d</p> <p>Lebanon\u2019s currency collapse appears to have factored in the upcoming Caesar bill and Beirut\u2019s economic crisis is likely to have sent Syria\u2019s economy into free fall. The parallel plunges are being used by some US officials to claim that both governments are co-dependent \u2013 and therefore warrant the same approach.</p> <p>Over the weekend, the US special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey claimed that the crumbling Syrian currency was partly due to US actions.</p> <p>\u201cThe Syrian pound\u2019s collapse proves that Russia and Iran are no longer able to float the Assad regime while the regime itself is no longer able to manage an effective economic policy, or launder money in Lebanese banks\u201d Jeffrey said. </p> <p>Over the past month, wheat and fuel \u2013 subsidised from the fast dwindling reserves of Lebanon\u2019s central bank \u2013 have kept the Syrian economy on life support, to the chagrin of some Lebanese leaders. Smuggling lines from Iraq, meanwhile, have maintained a supply of food into most parts of regime-held Syria, where soaring prices have led to few buyers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the availability that\u2019s an issue,\u201d said Fouad Shabbana from the town of Palmyra. \u201cIt\u2019s that no one can afford to buy anything. As of yesterday, my whole [monthly] salary can buy one kilo of meat. I now get paid the equivalent of $14.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrices of goods in Syria, including locally produced ones, are rising with the exchange rate,\u201d said Elizabeth Tsurkov, Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \u201cThe inflation is so rapid that prices in the morning would be lower than in the evening. Contacts across the country reported that in the span of one month, in line with the rapid depreciation, prices of most goods rose by over 50%. This puts Syria into a small club of countries that have experienced hyper-inflation.\u201d</p> <p>Julien Barnes-Dacey, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: \u201cAssad is absolutely the prime driver of Syria\u2019s ongoing collapse. [But] the US position now appears to be fundamentally driven by great power politics and the goal of ensuring that Russia and Iran can\u2019t claim a win.</p> <p>\u201cMy fear is that Caesar will achieve the exact opposite of its stated goals, fuelling the worst impulses of the Syrian regime and wider conflict. The US self-declared maximum pressure campaign aims to bring the regime to its knees and force its backers to concede defeat but the regime knows how to brutally hold onto power and it\u2019s clear that its key backers aren\u2019t for moving.</p> <p>\u201cThe Syrian people have been brutalised for a decade now and the country is devastated by conflict but we appear to be staring into the precipice of a dangerous new stage of the conflict \u2026 which risks a devastating new unravelling.\u201d</p>",

The trust of the global football community in its international governing body is in tatters.</p> <p>Fifa now finds itself on its knees, hands clasped, seeking atonement. Their first act was in 2018 when they awarded the 2026 World Cup to the \u201cUnited\u201d bid, which exceeded its rival (Morocco) in almost every way according to <a href=\"https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/2026-fifa-world-cup-bid-evaluation-report.pdf?cloudid=yx76lnat3oingsmnlvzf\">Fifa\u2019s own report</a>.</p> <p>The governing body now has its second major opportunity following this week\u2019s release of <a href=\"https://img.fifa.com/image/upload/hygmh1hhjpg30lbd6ppe.pdf\">the evaluation report for the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup</a>. It concluded that Australia and New Zealand\u2019s joint-bid was the strongest of the three, scoring 4.1 out of a possible 5, while Japan \u2013 its nearest competitor \u2013 scored 3.9 and Colombia 2.8.</p> <p>For Jane Fernandez, the general manager of the \u201cAs One\u201d bid who has worked on its development since 2017, Fifa\u2019s comments are the strongest indication yet that Australia and New Zealand\u2019s bid is in pole position.</p> <p>\u201cBased on the ratings that came out in the evaluation report, that\u2019s exactly how it appears,\u201d Fernandez told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe purpose of the report is to inform the Fifa Council. If you look at the 2026 process, the \u2018United\u2019 bid scored the highest. Whilst it\u2019s a bit of a different voting process in that the whole of Congress voted for the men\u2019s World Cup bid, that was the way the vote went \u2013 in line with that [report].</p> <p>\u201cI was really buoyed by the fact that the overall risk rating is low, and we\u2019re the only bidder that achieved that. So that filled me with confidence that we\u2019ve done all we could do.</p> <p>\u201cOur job for now is to ensure that we\u2019re pushing forward the strengths of our bid and ensuring the Fifa Council are aware that we\u2019ve presented the most favourable bidding proposal, that we stand ready to deliver with the complete support of all governments, and we\u2019ve proposed the most favourable commercial opportunity to Fifa.\u201d</p> <p>The evaluation reports are broken into two sections: infrastructure (70%) and commercial (30%). Within these sections are weighted categories such as stadiums, team and referee facilities, accommodation, transport, ticketing revenue, security, scheduling, environmental impact, human rights and technological capacity. Following on from the 2014 World Cup in Brazil in which a number of \u201cwhite elephant\u201d stadiums were built and subsequently abandoned, sustainability and legacy has also become part of Fifa\u2019s assessments.</p> <p>According to the 2023 report, \u201cAs One\u201d comes out ahead of Japan in all but one of these categories (accommodation). While the two Asian bids received the same score for stadiums \u2013 the most heavily-weighted infrastructure category of all \u2013 Australia and New Zealand\u2019s bid edges past its nearest rival in several other ways.</p> <p>It is the only bid that has \u201ca strong overlap\u201d with Fifa\u2019s own long-term Women\u2019s Football Strategy, providing clear objectives for growing the women\u2019s game and using the sport as a platform to drive social change beyond the parameters of the tournament.</p> <p>The communication and marketing strategy of the \u201cAs One\u201d bid is, in Fifa\u2019s words, \u201cvery strong\u201d: it leans on various networks including schools, tourism, media, and other ambassadors and provides some \u201chighly innovative post-tournament legacy programmes\u201d that Fifa would consider further engagement with.</p> <p>By hosting the tournament in winter, the joint bid avoids rescheduling risks due to weather and climate events \u2013 a concern Fifa notes regarding Japan\u2019s bid, which may need to be brought forward to avoid warmer temperatures, potentially disrupting the international calendar.</p> <p>And the biggest score advantage \u201cAs One\u201d has over Japan is in the commercial space. Fifa recognises that awkward time-zones may affect European viewership, but the geographical spread of Australia and New Zealand means games can be scheduled across a larger time period and tap into a number of markets \u2013 including throughout Asia and the Pacific \u2013 and thus reach a wider audience. The financial proposition offered by \u201cAs One\u201d is also significantly boosted by guaranteed government funding to the tune of $75m, which neither Japan nor Colombia has secured.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/09/australia-and-new-zealand-womens-world-cup-bid-boosted-as-brazil-withdraw\">Australia and New Zealand Women's World Cup bid boosted as Brazil withdraw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe reports are really important because the [people] that conducted the analysis are also the team that developed the objectives of what they want the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup to deliver,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cThere\u2019s a full matrix that Fifa has developed and that\u2019s what they\u2019re assessing against. It\u2019s not just someone sitting down, reading the bids and making their own judgement; it\u2019s very specific to the needs of the tournament.\u201d</p> <p>But scepticism, naturally, remains, so far gone is Fifa\u2019s reputation. However, Fernandez is more confident that the report recommendations will be followed after Fifa changed its voting rules in the wake of the 2010 controversy. \u201cAt that point in time, the vote wasn\u2019t public,\u201d she said. \u201cWho you voted for wasn\u2019t out there. But for the 2026 [tournament], the vote was public, and it\u2019s the same for this process. It\u2019s completely transparent: the bid book is available, the technical evaluation report is available, and whoever you vote for is going to be public.\u201d</p> <p>Combined with Australia and New Zealand\u2019s impressive response to Covid-19 \u2013 which included Football Federation Australia coming to the aid of the International Olympic Committee by moving the Matildas\u2019 Olympic qualifiers to Sydney in February \u2013 the As One bid appears to be the front-runner in Fifa\u2019s own eyes. Now its Council members must decide whether it wants the eyes of the rest of the world turned on them once again.</p>",

Hamilton was a captain during the battle of Gate P\u0101 during the 19th century New Zealand wars, a series of bloody battles between M\u0101ori and the British government about disputed land purchases and colonial occupation. However, it is likely Hamilton never set foot in the city.</p> \n<p>The plans to remove the statue comes as wider conversation develops about the future of New Zealand\u2019s colonial statues.</p> \n<p>Several other statues and memorials across the country are also in the spotlight, including a statue of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/08/new-zealand-wrestles-with-250th-anniversary-of-james-cooks-arrival\">James Cook in Gisborne</a> which is erected on Titirangi, a sacred mountain. Cook led the first Europeans to set foot on New Zealand. The statue stands on the spot where Cook\u2019s crew killed nine iwi members following a misunderstanding.</p> \n<p>Even in some provincial towns like Ngaruawahia in the Waikato there are other overt signs of colonialism. Within a few months of the end of the Waikato wars in 1864, where British forces were victorious, town planners designed the layout according to the pattern of the Union Jack.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, M\u0101ori party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer called for an inquiry to identify and remove colonial monuments, statues and place names that symbolise racism and oppression.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt may not appear racist to some, but to those who it affects and to those whose history was most impacted, it does. It just simply does, and it\u2019s wrong and we should be part of that solution.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not saying first of all that they should all be pulled down. What we\u2019re saying is that there are some that no longer fit who we should be as a nation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hamilton\u2019s mayor Paula Southgate said that the global push to remove symbols of racism and oppression around the world meant it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/new-zealand-minister-says-yes-trump-is-racist-amid-george-floyd-protests\">was the right time to remove the statue in New Zealand</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore what is happening all over the world and nor should we. At a time when we are trying to build tolerance and understanding between cultures and in the community, I don\u2019t think the statue helps us to bridge those gaps.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile I appreciate the statue was gifted to the city before my time on council, we need to think about its role and potential location in the city.\u201d</p> \n<p>Last September, prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the national school curriculum would be changed to require lessons on the New Zealand wars.</p>",

  "<p>On a quiet street corner in a neighbourhood in Beijing known for families and retirees, Xue Min, 22 a recent graduate, swats her legs, fighting off mosquitoes, as she encourages passersby to browse the earrings and scrunchies she has laid out on a cloth, surrounded by fairy lights. \u201cHave a look,\u201d she says brightly to a couple, who pause briefly before moving on.&nbsp;</p> <p>Just before 10pm, two men arrive with a food cart \u2013 a gas stove, wok and counter, attached to a motorbike and begin to prepare their menu of fried rice and noodles. Xue and her neighbour, a woman selling books, toothbrushes and trinkets from abroad, murmur and watch with expectation. Business might pick up a little now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/with-an-ailing-domestic-economy-can-china-still-pursue-its-global-plans-\">With an ailing domestic economy, can China still pursue its global plans? | Richard McGregor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Soon, more people begin to stop. Two young men, carrying a bag of cans of beer, browse the books. One picks up a translation of Pride and Prejudice before opting for a collection of stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. The other buys a journal. Meng, 35, one of the food-stall owners, calls to delivery drivers as they stop their electric bikes by the kerb: \u201cHey big brother, what will it be?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>It is a scene that should belong to another era, when Beijing\u2019s sidewalks were often crowded with hawkers selling local street food and a surprisingly diverse selection of daily necessities \u2013 socks, tableware, DVDs, textbooks, lingerie and pets. Street vendors came to be viewed as backwards and poor, pushed out by many city authorities in an effort to modernise the country\u2019s urban centres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da886a6c5919669d1103b7f715506eb45e98d909\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da886a6c5919669d1103b7f715506eb45e98d909/0_407_6709_4026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vendors sell on the street near the Houhai lake in Beijing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vendors sell on the street near Houhai lake in Beijing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roman Pilipey/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But now, according to a recent speech by the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, street hawkers are the \u201clifeblood\u201d of the country and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/china-abandons-gdp-target-for-first-time-in-years-amid-great-uncertainty-of-virus\">a key source of employment in the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreak</a>. Li\u2019s remarks during a visit to Shandong province last week has created a frenzy around the idea of the <em>ditan</em>, or \u201cstreet vendor\u201d, economy.</p> <p>Stocks in companies selling vendor equipment have surged. Major Chinese tech companies began offering cheap loans to new stallowners. On the search engine Baidu, queries for \u201cstreet vendor tips\u201d jumped in the days after Li\u2019s speech, according to the company. In May, officials said a ranking of \u201ccivilised cities\u201d would no longer penalise for the presence of street stalls. At least 27 cities have pledged to support the once undesirable micro-economy.</p> <p>Soon after Li\u2019s speech, both Meng, whose wages at his day job at a restaurant have been cut, and Xue, who holds out little hope of finding a job soon, turned to street vending.</p> <p>\u201cI am looking for a job while also running a stall,\u201d said Xue, who studied human resources. She has only been out for the last three days and the profits have so far not been great. \u201cWe have come out because the policy is relaxing, and there is nothing else to do,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/us-covid-19-cases-2-million\">'An American fiasco': US hits grim milestone of 2m Covid-19 cases</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meng, who has to earn enough to send back home to Guangdong province in the south to support two sets of parents, his wife and two young children, teamed up with a coworker to buy equipment for their food stall \u2013 about 5,000 yuan ($700), or two months of their wages at the restaurant. On a good night, they can sell about 100 portions at 10 yuan each ($1.40).</p> <p>He spends his lunch hour preparing food so that he can go directly from work to setting up his food stall, and doesn\u2019t return home until about 3am. \u201cI\u2019m lucky if I get three or four hours of sleep. But there\u2019s no other way,\u201d he says.</p> <p>China\u2019s street vendors were once seen as a symbol of the country\u2019s burgeoning market economy in the 1980s and have been promoted at different times to deal with unemployment \u2013 such as in the 1990s during mass layoffs as state-owned companies were privatised. Experts say they play a key role in cities, providing employment for the lower-skilled population as well as a source for cheap food for poorer residents, many of them migrant workers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e3beaf14389c7c864643d675a18492c529aa60ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3beaf14389c7c864643d675a18492c529aa60ae/0_0_8023_5349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Beijing street food stall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Beijing street food stall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Experts say it is not clear whether government attitudes towards them have changed. \u201cIs vending being embraced in a way that views the street as a place where people, even rural people, should be able to pursue a livelihood? I\u2019m not sure. This is another top-down initiative, not a deliberative response to local expressions of need,\u201d said Amy Hanser, associate professor in the department of sociology at the University of British Columbia, who focuses on inequality and urban China.</p> <p>In the days since Li\u2019s speech, authorities have started to limit public excitement. A directive from propaganda authorities told news outlets to delete content related to the <em>ditan</em> economy to avoid \u201chyping\u201d the topic. On the social-media platform Weibo, some hashtags related to the subject appeared to be blocked. Authorities in Beijing have already said that the capital is \u201cnot suitable\u201d for street vendors.</p> <p>That skittishness may be because a loosening of policies towards the vendors would be a rare example of social control being relaxed. For most of the last decade, cities such as Beijing have come under stricter regulation, from barring \u201cuncivilised behaviour\u201d \u2013 such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/06/chinese-citys-ban-on-beijing-bikinis-leaves-men-hot-under-collar\">\u201cBeijing bikini\u201d</a>, when men roll up their shirts in the summer \u2013 to efforts to rid the city of the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/27/china-ruthless-campaign-evict-beijings-migrant-workers-condemned\">low-end population</a>\u201d of migrant workers.</p> <p>\u201cWe see Chinese society under more and more control. Everything becomes stricter, and suddenly we see some space,\u201d said Xu Jianhua, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Macau, who has researched street vending in Guangzhou. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really about so many people excited about vending. It\u2019s an opportunity to see the relaxing of control.\u201d</p> <p>Xu sees the current support for street vendors as a temporary measure in response to Covid, not a real reversal of the government\u2019s apprehension about the informal economy and set ideas about cities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/blindsided-how-coronavirus-felled-the-global-economy-in-100-days\">Blindsided: how coronavirus felled the global economy in 100 days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe overarching idea about what is modern, what is a good city, I don\u2019t think has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cModern means clean, orderly skyscrapers by big companies, and smarter cities.\u201d</p> <p>For Meng, the street stall business is also temporary. Beijing has not relaxed its policies towards vendors. As his partner quickly stir-fries rice noodles with egg, sauce and vegetables, he takes orders and serves up the food in small polystyrene bowls and a pair of disposable chopsticks.</p> <p>\u201cOur customers are very happy to see us. Some said they couldn\u2019t find any food even after a long walk. So it\u2019s very convenient,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Meng does not plan on doing this forever. <em>Chengguan,</em> or municipal police, have a reputation for abusing, and sometimes beating, street vendors. The fines are also steep. \u201cRunning a stall, there is no stability. Even if you are not caught today, you might get caught tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang</em><br></p>"
