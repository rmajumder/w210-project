  "<p>Coco Gauff\u2019s career is idling along with those of all her locked-down rivals, but her mentor, Patrick Mouratoglou, who has guided Serena Williams to 10 of her 23 grand slams, thinks the American teenager can win a major whenever the tour resumes.</p> <p>\u201cI can see Coco getting to a final and winning a grand slam,\u201d he says, \u201cand I feel she is not that far away.\u201d</p> <p>That is a serious \u2013 if hardly impartial \u2013 vote of confidence in a 16-year-old who has risen from 685 in the world 15 months ago to 52 when the WTA suspended the women\u2019s Tour this month because of coronavirus. Tennis is tentatively scheduled to return in June, although it is more likely to reappear much later than that.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/21/my-favourite-game-venus-williams-v-lindsay-davenport-2005-wimbledon-final\">My favourite game: Venus Williams v Lindsay Davenport, 2005 Wimbledon final | Tumaini Carayol</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mouratoglou has worked with Gauff at his academy in the south of France for six years but was as surprised as anyone when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/08/the-coco-bubble-pops-at-wimbledon-as-simona-halep-ousts-cori-gauff\" title=\"\">it took Simona Halep to stop her</a> in the fourth round at Wimbledon last summer. Gauff was, at 15 years and three months, the youngest in the Open era to reach the main draw. Halep, in the form of her life, went on to crush his main client, Williams, in the final.</p> <p>The French coach was less shocked when Gauff made another impressive run at the Australian Open in January. She beat Venus Williams for the second time in the first round of a slam, then the defending title-holder, Naomi Osaka, before losing, again in the fourth round, to the tournament\u2019s eventual champion, Sofia Kenin, her 21-year-old friend and compatriot.</p> <p>Mouratoglou is encouraged that Gauff is very much a work in progress. \u201cThe match against Sofia Kenin in Melbourne showed Coco needs to improve. Of course she does. She still plays at an incredible level and the self-belief she has is so strong that she can surprise and maybe win a grand slam. The Australian Open is gone, but why not another one?</p> <p>\u201cCoco\u2019s tennis is already big. She has a lot of things to her game; a big serve, unbelievable backhand, she does a lot of things. She is able to come to the net. When it is a pressure point, she is able to go for it. She will also play a return volley to put pressure on her opponents.</p> <p>\u201cShe already understands a lot of things in tennis, but still it is not enough. There is still some space for her opponents to win the points.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acb6d3dfcd4b0953ef25a4df132e6ffedd464fa4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acb6d3dfcd4b0953ef25a4df132e6ffedd464fa4/0_0_3263_2176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coco Gauff\u2019s coach believes she has the ability to win a grand slam once tennis resumes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coco Gauff\u2019s coach believes she has the ability to win a grand slam once tennis resumes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDefinitely there is still room for improvement.

  "<p>Amid coronavirus-induced stockpiling and empty supermarket shelves, politicians have been quick to assure us of the reliability of Australia\u2019s food supply systems.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/dont-panic-australia-the-coronavirus-doesnt-mean-well-run-out-of-food\">Writing for the Guardian last week</a>, agriculture minister David Littleproud slammed \u201cridiculous\u201d panic-buying, saying: \u201cIt is important to understand that Australian farmers produce enough food for 75 million people: three times what we need\u201d. Farmers, he continued, are \u201ccalmly going about the business of food production\u201d, \u201cpreparing to sow and pick their crops and making sure their produce makes it to market\u201d.</p> <p>But the reality is that the business of food production relies upon tens of thousands of workers, a huge proportion of which are seasonal workers and migrants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/dont-panic-australia-the-coronavirus-doesnt-mean-well-run-out-of-food\">Don't panic, Australia. The coronavirus doesn't mean we'll run out of food | David Littleproud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As borders close and social distancing increases in order to flatten the curve of infection rates, we need to think urgently about the workforce on whom our food supply chains rely. </p> <p>Neither Littleproud nor the agricultural industry are oblivious to the reliance on migrant workers. The agriculture minister described the need to \u201csecure labour\u201d, promising \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/two-million-temporary-visa-holders-in-australia-left-in-limbo-by-coronavirus-travel-standstill\">minor tweaking</a>\u201d to the visa system with the implication being that the some of the 140,000 working holiday makers and 7,000 seasonal workers currently in the country may have their visas extended to enable them to continue working here. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation (NFF) is seeking assurances of a continuous supply of overseas workers, particularly for the horticultural sector.</p> <p>Both the NFF and federal government talk about securing a supply of agricultural labour as if it were akin to securing a reliable supply of engine parts. But the agricultural workforce is not a collection of supply chain inputs, it is hundreds of thousands of workers \u2014 people with families, with communities, with livelihoods to sustain, and bodies as vulnerable to infections and ill-health (and in some cases more so) as any others.</p> <p>In horticulture, the challenges are significant. The industry is in the middle of the harvest season, a critical point in the production cycle when demands for labour are at their peak. Temporary migrant and local seasonal workers are picking fruit, harvesting vegetables, and sorting and packing crops in packing sheds across the country.</p> <p>Thousands of these workers are Pacific Islanders, working here under the Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP) which provides strictly curtailed visas intended to fill demands for, particularly, seasonal horticultural labour. Many groups of workers are due to return to their home countries in the coming weeks and months. I have spoken to one labour contractor who has a group of SWP workers due to fly home within days. Their flights are now cancelled with their visas currently due to expire the next day. Other groups of workers, due to arrive in Australia now to perform critical harvest labour, are unable to leave their homes as Pacific nations close their borders.</p> <p>\u201cMinor tweaking\u201d to the visa system may address part of their problem, enabling them to stay and work for longer (although, at the time we spoke, the contractor had not received any direction from the department of employment which manages the program) but it will not address the much bigger human and political challenges.</p> <p>What if Pacific Islanders (or backpackers, or other temporary migrant workers) don\u2019t want to be used as an ongoing source of labour beyond what they have already contracted to provide? If the present situation continues for six or twelve months, or longer, what kinds of incentives or coercions are going to be employed to sustain the agricultural workforce?</p> <p>For those who do continue working, what are the health implications and risks of doing so? Workers in packing sheds work in close proximity for long hours, and pickers often live in crowded, shared accommodation. These jobs, like so many low-paid manual and service industry jobs, cannot be worked from home, a fact that highlights the dramatically unequal levels of risk and vulnerability for different, often racialised, groups of workers.</p> <p>If sheds, orchards, and other food production sites shut down amid health concerns, what will be the financial impacts on agricultural sector workers \u2013 both temporary and local \u2013 who are overwhelmingly casual and without sick leave and other entitlements? Is the federal government prepared to commit to covering the costs of healthcare and any lost income due to infection of the labour force whose supply it is seeking to secure? It should.</p> <p>If and when workers do return home, how will we ensure that we are not sending potentially infected people back to countries and communities across the region whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/pacific-nations-prepare-for-coronavirus-arrival-after-devastating-measles-outbreak\">health systems are ill-equipped to manage the crises that widespread Covid-19 infection would produce</a>? Pacific nations have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/papua-new-guinea-declares-state-of-emergency-after-first-coronavirus-case\">begun to see their first cases of the virus</a>, and the impacts of widening infection could be catastrophic. Our responsibilities to the region demand that we do not endanger it.</p> <p>David Littleproud ended his piece with a call to his \u201cfellow Australians\u201d to work together and to support \u201cour farmers\u201d. One of the many, very real dangers of this epidemic is that it will amplify an inward-looking nationalism, and an intensification of all kinds of borders (physical, political, social, cultural) long after the Covid-19 threat has diminished.</p> <p>Let\u2019s by all means think about the business of food production. But let\u2019s do that in ways that do not fall back on ill-conceived notions of national self-sufficiency. What the Covid-19 pandemic and its impacts on our food systems should highlight for us is our deep enmeshment in regional and global networks, and our responsibilities to all of those who feed us.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Victoria Stead is an anthropologist and senior research fellow at the Alfred Deakin Institute, Deakin University.

But there have been serious constraints on testing, with only 3,649 performed since 21 January.</p> <p>This means that Oregon has carried out 1,161 tests per million residents, putting it behind other states, and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing\">well behind benchmarks</a> like South Korea, and raising the prospect that the extent of the outbreak is far greater than current knowledge indicates.</p> <p>For a period of weeks, the only testing was being done by the state medical lab, which is limited to <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/news/article/coronavirus-test-oregon-shortage-actual-cases/\">80 specimens a day</a>.</p> <p>The state has <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/hospitals-and-private-labs-are-the-main-reason-more-oregonians-were-tested-for-coronavirus-data-show.html\">tapped some commercial labs</a> for more testing, but OHSU told the Guardian in an email that they would not assist with testing until later this week at the earliest.</p> <p>The state has also been accused of <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/best-way-to-track-coronavirus-trend-hospitalizations-oregon-stopped-reporting-it.html\">obfuscating</a> the situation by not publishing all available data.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Seattle, the west coast center of the outbreak, lies just a few hours north along one of America\u2019s busiest interstate highways.</p> <p>Oregon\u2019s first case was recorded in Washington county, the apparent center of the state\u2019s outbreak, and home to Nike\u2019s global headquarters, and a number of campuses of the silicon chip manufacturer Intel.</p> <p>That case was announced on 28 February, just two days after the CDC announced the first recorded \u201ccommunity transmission\u201d in northern California.</p>",

The total confirmed death toll rose to 335 on Monday \u2013 a sixfold increase on this time last week.</p> \n<p>\u201cWithout a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there won\u2019t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,\u201d Johnson said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd as we have seen elsewhere, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply, if too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it\u2019s vital to slow the spread of the disease.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over the weekend, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, had appeared to take a much clearer stance on physical distancing than the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/22/police-could-enforce-social-distancing-rules-says-london-mayor\">telling the capital\u2019s residents</a> to stay at home. \u201cThis isn\u2019t advice, as far as I\u2019m concerned. These are instructions and these are rules that we should all obey to stop people dying,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, welcomed the measures. \u201cSomething did have to change. We\u2019re seeing more and more people lose their lives to this virus and the social distancing measures that the government had announced have simply not been working,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/non-key-workers-tourists-defy-physical-distancing-advice-uk\">beaches full of people</a>, parks full of people, bustling markets. So we were encouraging the PM to go further this morning: we called on him to take emergency action to enforce social distancing, and it looks like that\u2019s what he\u2019s done this evening. So we do support it, and the drastic measures he\u2019s taken tonight.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some in policing are dubious whether they currently have the powers to enforce a lockdown. One source said police were being told they would be given the powers within days, possibly being included in the emergency laws being passed through parliament now.</p> \n<p>It is seen as anathema to the British style of policing by consent, and officers being citizens in uniform: \u201cThere is absolute reluctance,\u201d said another source. \u201cIt\u2019s a total change of policing style.\u201d</p> \n<p>The chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, Martin Hewitt, said: \u201cWe are working with the government and other agencies to consider how these new rules can be most effectively enforced.\u201d</p> \n<p>The NPCC quickly squashed suggestions that police would be assisted by troops on the streets or road blocks deployed to enforce the lockdown. A spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cNeither are being considered in any way.\u201d</p> \n<p>The national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, John Apter, said: \u201cThe practicalities of policing this lockdown will be challenging \u2026 policing will do all it can to keep the public safe, but we need the public to support us. I ask that the public heed the advice and stay at home unless absolutely necessary.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis will allow police officers to concentrate on keeping the streets safe and deal with all the regular calls we receive. This is about saving lives and supporting our NHS.

The batteries should be swappable in case of a longer outage, or a patient transfer that could last two hours.</p></li> \n <li><p>Buried at the end of the government\u2019s specification document is a warning that requiring backup batteries will mean 30,000 large batteries being sourced quickly.

It needs to be got right first time.\u201d</p></li> \n <li><p>All of the ventilator\u2019s parts need to be detachable so they can be disinfected manually.</p></li> \n <li><p>They must also be fitted with an alarm that alerts medical staff in case of a fault or some other interruption or inadequacy of oxygen supply.</p></li> \n <li><p>Doctors must be able to monitor the ventilator\u2019s performance, for instance the oxygen percentage it is providing, via clear displays.</p></li> \n <li><p>Operating the machine must be intuitive, requiring no more than 30 minutes of training for a medical professional who already has some ventilator experience.

Tidal volume \u2013 the amount of air someone inhales during a normal breath \u2013 is typically about six or seven millilitres per kilogram of body weight, or about 500ml for someone weighing 80kg (12 stone 8lb).

  "<p>Scottish football doesn\u2019t need fixtures to trigger warfare. Circumstances around Rangers\u2019 financial implosion in 2012 were such that the security of legislators was a live issue and the row over where precisely the club should find itself for the next season so intense that many would now struggle to recall the outcome of that summer\u2019s European Championship (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/01/euro-2012-spain-italy-final\">Spain saw off Italy in the final</a>). Administrators warned that \u00a316m \u2013 and television contracts \u2013 could be lost if Rangers kicked off 2012-13 in the bottom tier.

Doncaster tried that trick last season before performing the kind of embarrassing U-turn that highlights why he has been at the forefront of Scottish football for more than a decade. In that period, even Doncaster must have recognised the robustness of the sport over which he presides. The Bosman ruling, 25 years ago, was a supposed death knell for Scottish football. History tells of adjustment to economic crises, social crises and world wars. Scottish football prevailed then, as it will again; whatever its form.</p> <p>Since coronavirus forced Scotland\u2019s season to a halt, fierce squabbling has surrounded whether the SPFL is entitled to close its setup as matters stand: dishing out titles, relegation and \u2013 zing \u2013 prize money according to final placings. This would be an affront to the ethos of league football, as is the concept of voiding a season, an idea rightly dismissed. \u201cAny attempt to finish the season with a significant amount of games still to play impacts upon the integrity of sport in Scotland,\u201d said the Rangers managing director, Stewart Robertson, a man fully cognisant of his customer base.</p> <p>The prospect of the SPFL distributing prize money imminently from a curtailed season naturally appeals to many clubs in these grim financial times. More sensible, surely, would be for the league to provide agreed percentages of said funds now.</p> <p>Amending 2020-21 \u2013 with rules clear from the outset \u2013 by cancelling the winter break, postponing the League Cup or a multitude of other options exist should the SPFL\u2019s board have a strong enough will. Instead \u2013 and it is very 2012 \u2013 a narrative has been allowed to permeate regarding all the things the league cannot possibly do without forcing clubs towards the wall. Weirdly, it\u2019s as if Scotland is in a unique position.</p> <p>There is no chance the SPFL would contemplate deciding a championship were the Old Firm separated by goal difference with eight and nine games to play. Celtic\u2019s present advantage, of 13 points, should not allow officials to ride roughshod over basic principles. Whenever football restarts, 2019-20 must finish.</p> <p>Instead, the prevailing mood: for Celtic, nine in a row. For Hearts, relegation; save a legitimate threat of legal action from Tynecastle.</p> <p>On-field circumstance is particularly stark in the lower leagues. How can Partick be demoted from the Championship when two points adrift yet holding a game in hand? It would be a ludicrous denial of sporting fairness. The league would also be determining only handpicked outcomes if preventing teams from competing in the promotion/relegation play-offs that are an integral part of the competition. The Scottish FA has committed to completion of the Scottish Cup \u2013 halted at the semi-final stage \u2013 come what may, which undermines consistency of a joint approach.</p> <p>Why Celtic would accept a trophy when short of standard conclusion is anyone\u2019s guess; this would be a scene worthy of jibes for decades. Celtic\u2019s fiscal power means they can wait as long as it takes for the season to resume and canter across the line. Celtic are entitled to do as they please with their revenue \u2013 and have committed \u00a3150,000 to the most vulnerable in society \u2013 but it would have taken them to unassailable high ground had a statement issued last week, calling for a \u201cfair and reasonable solution\u201d to football\u2019s hiatus, also offered to help toiling opposition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/mar/23/the-hand-of-god-revisited-football-weekly\">The Hand of God revisited \u2013\u00a0Football Weekly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Hearts announced they had asked staff to take a 50% salary cut, monthly commitments of roughly \u00a3800,000 too hot to handle, dominos were due to fall. The Aberdeen chairman, Dave Cormack, duly painted a stark scenario after the \u201chealthy financial picture\u201d of just weeks ago. Aberdeen have monthly outgoings of \u00a31.2m. \u201cWe are facing a collapse of income that is going to be almost impossible to sustain for a prolonged period,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rangers announced last November they needed \u00a310m to meet obligations before the season ends. A Europa League run, and generous key shareholders, will offset some of that but this is a business with annual staff costs well in excess of \u00a330m and no current, serious cashflow.</p> <p>Many regard discourse regarding Scottish football outcomes as tawdry as society fights a global pandemic. This game, though, is part of said society\u2019s fabric. Maybe it should even be a form of tiny comfort that such a fraught narrative continues at vertiginous pace. And it will, for a while yet.</p>",

It has never been triggered until now. <br><br>The EU statement said that ministers remained \u201cfully committed to the respect of the stability and growth pact\u201d. But now the taboo has been broken, it is unclear how quickly the EU can return to its fiscal rules. <br><br>Eurozone watchers also predict that triggering the escape clause mean more ambitious measures could be off the table, such as \u201ccoronabonds\u201d - common eurozone debt to help the most distressed member states finance health spending and repair their battered economies. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MehreenKhn/status/1242134600664715264\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dutch finance minister says effective suspension of EU budget rules is enough for governments to spend to counter  the coronavirus.

  "<p>After the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act was introduced in 1939, imposing a series of stringent and intrusive restrictions on individual freedoms, the wartime government anxiously kept a close eye on compliance. How would people respond? The answer, a <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/548/54848/never-again/9780141016023.html\" title=\"\">Ministry of Information report</a> concluded in 1942, was that: \u201cPeople are willing to bear any sacrifice if a 100% effort can be reached and the burden fairly shared by all.\u201d</p> \n<p>During the critical days to come, in the very different Britain of 2020, the present government must trust in exactly the same kind of popular resilience. The public desperately needed clear leadership, as the trajectory of the coronavirus epidemic in this country continues to track that of stricken Italy. On Saturday 793 people there died from the disease in one day \u2013 a global record. It was imperative that Boris Johnson abandoned the register of exhortation and issued clear instructions that will be enforced, thereby instituting a lockdown. A laissez-faire approach to fighting a pandemic did not work.</p> \n<p>Most people, in uniquely testing circumstances, have done their best to follow the government\u2019s guidance. A majority have broadly followed physical distancing advice, stayed at home for the most part and worked from there if possible. But the exact parameters of the permissible have remained unclear. The throngs who gathered in sunny public parks on Mother\u2019s Day weekend were in part a testament to confused messaging about going outdoors. Sadly, there was also evidence of a willingness to disregard warnings that came with no sanction attached. Soon it will seem inconceivable that, as Belfast doctors and nurses put together <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-doctors-and-nurses-in-belfast-post-message-urging-public-to-stay-at-home-video\" title=\"\">a video</a> pleading with people to stay at home, over 6,000 people gathered to <a href=\"https://www.midweekherald.co.uk/sport/toby-garrick-leads-the-mighty-green-quartet-home-at-the-bath-half-marathon-1-6572789\" title=\"\">run the Bath half-marathon</a>. All gatherings of more than two people from different households will now be dispersed.</p> \n<p>The halfway house of self-regulation has now, rightly, been vacated. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b887d344-6c8b-11ea-89df-41bea055720b?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=a75ca55d94-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_23_07_07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-a75ca55d94-189679749\" title=\"\">An analysis</a> by scientists from University College London and the University of Cambridge found that sticking to a voluntary regime could lead to between 35,000 and 70,000 excess deaths over the next year. That is clearly an unacceptably high price to pay for allowing people to choose whether or not to do the right thing.</p> \n<p>Yet again, as in previous phases of this crisis, institutions in civil society had in any case begun to perform the necessary gear change without waiting for belated orders. The National Trust has shut parks and gardens across the country. Councils such as Lambeth have closed children\u2019s play areas. There appears to be a grim acceptance that the previously unthinkable \u2013 the shutting down of sport, pubs and restaurants and the abandonment of the workplace \u2013 was only the beginning of what had to be thought.</p> \n<p>This new phase of the crisis will impose a level of constraint that none of us have ever experienced before. Plans must be put in place to help families with limited domestic resources to draw upon. It will be necessary to tend to people\u2019s mental health as well as their physical wellbeing. This is a journey without maps. But the evidence from Italy suggests that citizens are willing to cede their liberties and swap freedom for greater security once the state takes responsibility.</p> \n<p>The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, locked his citizens down two weeks ago. There, as in Britain, the spread of Covid-19 was initially greeted with misplaced stoicism and declarations that life must go on. The leader of the governing Democratic party, Nicola Zingaretti, was photographed sharing an aperitif with students in Milan. That kind of breezy defiance was swiftly replaced by fear, as images of overwhelmed hospitals came to dominate the evening news. Enforced by fines for those who left their homes without good reason, lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/a-warning-to-europe-italy-struggle-to-convince-citizens-of-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">brought clarity and, overwhelmingly, compliance</a>. On Sunday, Italian health officials cautiously welcomed the news that, after the horrific high of the day before, the daily toll had finally fallen back and rates of infection had slowed. On Monday both rates fell again. These are the first positive signs after a fortnight of national sacrifice.</p> \n<p>As things stand, Britain is believed to be two weeks behind Italy in this nightmarish experience. Yet the government has waited to impose a similar level of self-restraint. It is right to take this action now.</p>",

Athletes have led the way on this and the IOC have trailed far them. That has to change.\u201d</p> <p>Warner also urged the IOC to heed the voices of Paralympians who are particularly worried about Covid-19. Athletes with a degree of paralysis from the chest downwards have reduced lung function, which means they are more vulnerable should they catch an infection. \u201cAthlete welfare must always be our top priority,\u201d Warner said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/polly-swann-continues-tokyo-preparation-in-isolation\">Polly Swann: 'We have to believe there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Opposition to holding the event in July has risen sharply in recent days, with US Track and Field and UK Athletics among those calling for a delay.

  "<p>Difficult and almost impossibly daunting as it may seem, the world is faced with not one but two existential crises and two races against time: the coronavirus and the climate emergency. Dealing with both is going to require extraordinary focus and resolution.</p> <p>Already there is a whiff of political opportunism in the air. Last week, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, said that the \u20ac1tn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">European Green Deal</a>, unveiled and enshrined in law by the European commission barely three weeks ago, should be <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/czech-pm-urges-eu-to-ditch-green-deal-amid-virus/\">put to one side</a>. Member states, he advised, should concentrate all resources on combating a pandemic which, one by one, is shutting down societies and economies. Along with other eastern European states such as Poland, the Czech government has been reluctant to acknowledge the scale of action required to combat global heating, which would have a severe impact on fossil fuel industries in their countries.</p> <p>The extreme urgency of defeating Covid-19 scarcely needs stating. But Mr Babi\u0161\u2019s broader suggestion has been rightly rejected. \u201cThis is one of the very reasons why we presented the climate change law: to avoid that climate action, a generational task, is obfuscated by more pressing and immediate challenges,\u201d said a Brussels spokesman. Frans Timmermans, the Dutch commissioner who is leading the EU response on the climate emergency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/focus-coronavirus-shows-need-climate-law-says-eu-official-frans-timmermans\">has made the same point</a>. </p> <p>The new climate law commits member states to zero emissions by 2050. A stringent new target is also to be set for 2030, which will be enshrined in the law. </p> <p>Mr Timmermans has said that the climate law will act as a \u2018\u201ccompass\u201d for the next 30 years as EU member states seek sustainable forms of growth. In these extraordinary times, local imagination and creativity in developing a sustainable future will be at a premium. There are at least some hopeful signs that such thinking is taking place.</p> <p>In the city of Utrecht, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/forward-thinking-utrecht-builds-car-free-district-for-12000-people\">plans have been unveiled</a> for the largest purpose-built pedestrianised residential area in Europe, which will attempt to harness the virtues of the sharing economy. The Merwede estate will house 12,000 people on a 60-acre site. Transport will be provided by bus and train networks and a shared pool of bikes and cars \u2013 one car for every three families. Schools, shops, sports and medical services will all be within walking distance, and water from the local canal will be used to heat the area. The intention is for the district to become close to energy neutral.</p> <p>Utrecht is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Netherlands and is projected to add 100,000 people to its 350,000 population by 2040. In terms of factoring in a necessary environmental dimension to new construction, Merwede looks like best practice. It is the kind of project that is relatively small scale, but repeatable. It helps of course that the Dutch have a historically passionate relationship with the bicycle. But as the EU attempts to hold the line on implementing its green deal, many more Utrechts will be required.</p>",

He said: \u201cAlthough the tiny fossils are near the limits of resolution they both tantalisingly suggest a creature very close to the earliest known ancestor of all advanced animals and, even more intriguingly, a likely association with small traces made as the animal forged through the sediment in search of food.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Let\u2019s be clear: these are weird and scary times. It\u2019s strange, amid all the ominous health concerns and precarity, to care about television. But it is, as untold millions retreat to their homes for at least the next couple weeks, a uniquely boon time for streaming content. So it is that today, in a week of unprecedented excuses to binge soapy genre TV, Netflix dropped Freud, the streamer\u2019s ridiculous \u201chistorical\u201d fiction thriller which recasts the legendary psychologist as a coked-up, seance-enthused witch hunter who uses hypnosis to solve crimes in 19th-century Vienna. Because \u2026why not?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/self-made-review-octavia-spencer\">Self Made review \u2013 Octavia Spencer sparkles in inspiring Netflix drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The eight-part show, created by Marvin Kren, Stefan Brunner and Benjamin Hessler, keeps things (somewhat) grounded for about half an episode \u2013 the doctor, played as a tightly wound and righteous young striver by Robert Finster, practices his dramatically lit hypnotism routine on his housekeeper, Lenore (Brigitte Kern). And it is a routine \u2013 debt-riddled and with hypnotism skills lagging far behind his complex theories of psychological repression, the good doctor has resorted to training Lenore to perform a trance for his colleagues at his academy to prove the \u201chaughty fools\u201d of the establishment wrong. An outsider for his theories of the unconscious and his status as a \u201cJewish charlatan\u201d, Freud is anxious to prove his worth, most especially to his long-distance fiancee, Marta, whose mother disapproves of his \u201cmedical\u201d practice (as conveyed via clunky voiceover while Freud pens love letters). He also has less professional priorities, as evidenced by the line, and I quote, \u201cPerhaps you would like some cocaine?\u201d before the intro rolls.</p> <p>Things swiftly take a turn for the weird, when a mutilated prostitute lands, literally, on Freud\u2019s desk, courtesy of Inspectors Kiss (Georg Friedrich) and Poschacher (Christoph F Krutzler). Kiss, a gravelly voiced, archetypically repressed man, immediately suspects Georg von Lichtenberg, his former military superior, in part because he knew the woman, and in part because Kiss is intimately aware of his sadistic streak; the inspector\u2019s lingering trauma, in the form of a cramped shooting hand, from the heinous orders he obeyed under Von Lichtenberg\u2019s command offer Freud a chance to demonstrate that his idea of the embodied, active unconscious has some merit.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQfcZ9Ak2nU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VQfcZ9Ak2nU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Freud slips from weird into downright ludicrousness when the doctor attends a seance hosted by Count Viktor (Philipp Hochmair), styled as Green Day crossed with Viennese nobility, and his mysterious wife, Countess Sophia (Anja Kling). Their ward, Fleur Salome (Ella Rumpf), a Hungarian medium who looks uncannily like Eva Green, suffers a bad trip into the alternate realm, one haunted by a blood-stained demon; particularly susceptible to Freud\u2019s amateur hypnotism and charms, she becomes his key patient in the quest to explain the unconscious \u2026 and partner in a steamy affair.</p> <p>The plot takes about two episodes to cohere into any sense, by which point it\u2019s clear the mastermind of several violent, madness-induced crimes is Countess Sophia, whose hypnotic powers dwarf Freud\u2019s and rely on a psychosexual combination of touch and verbal manipulation. As Countess Sophia\u2019s plans swell from a young girl\u2019s kidnapping to a confusing plot sowing chaos in the Austrian state, the show sinks deeper and deeper into engaging-enough lunacy. How much you enjoy this depends on how much you enjoy pulpy, gratuitous Netflix shows which make no claims to prestige TV or the concept of restraint. Among the things Freud throws at the wall: blood-soaked nude figures, a torture chamber deep in the canal tunnels, hypnotism-induced seizures, disastrous duels, Egyptian mummies as props, a cannibalistic opera singer, use of the shaky cam, dinner parties frozen in mid-air, and, naturally, Freud vomiting a particularly large dose of his cocaine beverage.</p> <p>There are plenty of subplots here, most notably a political insurrection against the emperor whose logic is difficult to follow and ultimately irrelevant; the main show is the slurp of creepy, disturbing manifestations of repressed psyches coalescing into, by the later episodes, a nonsensical yet amusing horror show.</p> <p>Like other absurd revisions of famous stories, such as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter or Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Freud is arguably better the more it leans into its ridiculousness. There is little entertainment value in watching Freud stumble his way to a theory of hypnosis or deal with his own repressed demons and feelings of worthlessness; it is, however, baseline compelling, in a mindless, \u201cI\u2019m stuck inside and would like to plunge my brain into inane nonsense\u201d type of way, to watch Freud and Fleur piece together Countess Sophia\u2019s plan through a series of unsettling trips into hypnosis and horror.</p> <p>All of which is to say: whatever suppressed pulp instinct you might have during this time of world crisis, it probably gets some airtime during this show. Which makes the concept of a review irrelevant \u2013 you either have an appetite for this kind of mindless stew of drunk history or you don\u2019t. And given the upside-down surreality of the real world right now, a coked-up Freud might be a deceptively hot ticket.</p> <ul> <li><p>Freud is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>London\u2019s ExCeL centre will be turned into a makeshift 4,000-bed \u201cfield hospital\u201d under NHS plans to cope when the peak of the coronavirus epidemic leaves thousands fighting for their lives.</p> \n<p>In a complex operation, the conference centre will be turned into a massive critical care unit far bigger than any such facility already in existence in any NHS hospital. Staff will help those who are struggling to breathe, many of whom will be anaesthetised, intubated and put on a ventilator because their lungs have failed.</p> \n<p>It will be staffed by a combination of military medical personnel and NHS staff. NHS planners think they will need to press it into service in around a month\u2019s time, when on current trends all the critical care beds in London hospitals are likely to be full, mainly with patients with Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The plan to convert the ExCeL has been put together by senior NHS England officials who oversee services in London. They are rushing to expand the availability of critical care beds in the capital, which has seen proportionately many more confirmed cases of coronavirus, deaths from it and also people left in intensive care because of it than anywhere else in Britain.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe ExCeL will become a field hospital of 4,000 critical care beds,\u201d said one NHS official with knowledge of the plan. \u201cIt will be staffed by military medics but it\u2019s still unclear where all the nurses needed will come from.\u201d</p> \n<p>The venue, which opened in London\u2019s Docklands in 2000, usually stages a wide range of conferences, trade fairs and sporting events, such as boxing matches.</p> \n<p>NHS England London region planners have been forced to prepare to use the ExCeL as an auxiliary or overflow hospital because of the sheer number of people the virus will soon be leaving seriously ill. They fear that, with the number of people left in intensive care with Covid-19 doubling across Britain every three or four days, such a dramatic move will be needed to save lives.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s doubling everywhere every few days, and because London is two weeks ahead of the rest of the country in the severity of the impact of the disease, the ExCeL is part of the plan because that doubling means we aren\u2019t going to have the beds,\u201d the official added.</p> \n<p>One intensive care consultant said the conversion would be difficult to achieve, given the scarcity of trained critical care staff and ventilators. \u201cThat would be the biggest ICU on the planet. I\u2019m not sure how feasible this is, given how much equipment, power and facilities are required,\u201d the medic said.</p> \n<p>Some of the staff of the ExCeL field hospital may be those who usually work in private healthcare. NHS England concluded a deal with the sector at the weekend for it to put its resources at the disposal of a health service that leading doctors privately fear may well be overwhelmed by what some have said will be a \u201ctsunami\u201d of people who cannot breathe because of the infection.</p> \n<p>There is also speculation that the coming peak of the coronavirus epidemic could force the NHS to also use the O2 concert arena, which is nearby, although across the Thames from the ExCeL.</p> \n<p>Asked about the planned future use of the ExCeL, NHS England did not deny the plan.</p> \n<p>In a statement the NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said: \u201cNHS staff are working round the clock gearing up to deal with this unprecedented global health threat. As well as ramping up treatment capacity across all NHS hospitals, we\u2019re getting on with other options too, including new facilities as well as a landmark deal with private hospitals which has put 20,000 staff, 8,000 beds and 1,200 ventilators at our disposal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/london-map\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cBut it remains absolutely vital that this huge mobilisation by the NHS is matched by action from the public which means following medical advice to the letter \u2013 please stay at home to save lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>A government spokesperson confirmed: \u201cTo assist NHS England to prepare for a number of scenarios as the coronavirus outbreak unfolds, a team of military planners visited the ExCeL centre in London to determine how the centre might benefit the NHS response to the outbreak.\u201d</p> \n<p>The ExCeL centre has 87,000 sq metres of space, drive-in doorways, and a waiting area for 300 vehicles.</p> \n<p>It is usually used as an exhibition and conference centre and was host to several events during the 2012 London Olympics.</p>",

  "<p>Rail franchising is being suspended \u201cfor a limited period, initially six months,\u201d said the Department for Transport. Are you sure? It seems more likely the whole franchising model, as understood since privatisation in the 1990s, is now finished for good.</p> <p>Who, after all, will want to revive a system that the government\u2019s own adviser, the former British Airways boss Keith Williams, last year described as unfit for purpose even in happier times? Train operators themselves surely won\u2019t be lobbying for the return of their franchises on the same financial terms.</p> <p>For starters, many were making losses on high-profile routes \u2013 witness FirstGroup on its South Western Railway operation. More significantly, revenue assumptions that underpinned even profitable routes will now be blown to pieces. The pace of economic recovery, and thus the volume of passengers, will be one huge unknown. Then there\u2019s the impact on commuter routes from the current enforced experiment in working from home. Behaviour will change; fewer \u00a33,000-a-year season tickets will be sold.</p> <p>From the government\u2019s point of view, rail franchising was already heading into the sidings, shunted there by unhappy passengers, over-complexity and an evaporation of bidders. Williams\u2019 review may now never be published, but its direction was clear. Management contracts, in which private sector firms shoulder fewer revenue risks and accept low-margin fixed fees, seemed to be one preferred way forward.</p> <p>This is the model, in rough form, that has been adopted now in emergency, thereby disproving the notion that old-style franchising could only be dismantled gradually. The task, it turns out, could be achieved over a weekend.</p> <p>Those screaming about how train operators have been let off the hook, and how losses will be dumped on the state, should calm down. The government had little choice. With the collapse in passenger numbers, train operators would soon have been handing back their franchises anyway, as they\u2019re entitled to do by forfeiting bonds. Sudden failure would have caused chaos. The DfT doesn\u2019t have a crew of \u201coperators of last resort\u201d on standby. Previous outright nationalisations, such as East Coast and Northern rail, were organised affairs.</p> <p>The medium-term ambition should be to replace rail franchising with a more flexible system that is better connected to infrastructure upgrades. Management contracts won\u2019t be the only useful model. Local commuter routes can be better controlled by local transports bodies, for example. The DfT should start planning immediately. Old-style franchising is finished.</p> <h2>Stagecoach sets a fine example</h2> <p>Boardrooms, take note: when announcing job losses and pay squeezes, remember to state what the directors are doing by way of solidarity. Well done Stagecoach, then, for saying board members will halve their salaries and fees \u201cfor a period of time\u201d, which presumably means the duration of the crisis.</p> <p>A few other companies have made similar noises in the past week, but such announcements are not yet the norm. They need to become so.</p> <p>The Treasury will soon be underwriting the payroll costs of a lot of companies, at enormous long-term cost to the public purse. Public opinion is not going to tolerate public company directors paying themselves as if nothing has changed.</p> <h2>Shell\u2019s doomed defence of the dividend</h2> <p>Shell famously hasn\u2019t cut dividend to shareholders since the second world war and, even with a global recession looming and the price of a barrel of Brent at $30, management still isn\u2019t ready to throw in the towel on a payment that cost $15bn last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Monday\u2019s statement on measures \u201cto reinforce business resilience and financial strength\u201d was filled with cuts to capital spending and operating costs plus a halt to share buybacks. None of that is surprising given that Shell\u2019s financial plans had been based on oil being about $65 a barrel. Yet the dividend, it seems, will be defended until all other options are exhausted.</p> <p>The fight seems doomed to end in defeat, however, which is why Shell\u2019s shares stand at their lowest level since the mid-1990s. The 14% notional dividend yield signals the market\u2019s view that a cut is inevitable.</p> <p>This prospect will be terrifying to many income-seeking pension funds. They were sure of Shell. Even a halved dividend will have been mentally filed as a low-probability risk. Given the mass of missed dividends piling up elsewhere, this sudden loss of income is going to be yet another problem.</p>",

  "<p>Until last week, Britain\u2019s rowers were some of the few sportspeople in the country still engaged in full\u2011blooded competition. Great Britain\u2019s squad trials for Olympic selection were held behind closed doors but brutally fought. It was, says the Olympic silver medallist Polly Swann, one of the closest trial meetings she has experienced in her career.</p> <p>Swann\u2019s pairs race was a \u201creal ding-dong\u201d against a pair including her own housemate, Rebecca Shorten. Sometimes, she says, trials can be more stressful than international competition. \u201cYou have to try to beat your friends, and you know how much it means to them.\u201d The 31-year-old Swann and her partner, Emily Ford, were squeezed out in the last 200m.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/tokyo-2020-olympics-in-doubt-as-canada-becomes-first-team-to-pull-out-over-coronavirus\">Tokyo 2020 Olympics in doubt as Canada becomes first team to pull out over coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Swann is now off the water for the foreseeable future. On Saturday, Caversham closed its training facilities and moved all its athletes to at-home training programmes. Covid-19 had already caused the cancellation of all World Cup rowing and while the European Championships in June remains for now, the probable postponement of the Olympic Games is dominating the International Rowing Federation\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Having recently completed the medical degree she began 13 years ago, Swann has no illusions about the seriousness of the pandemic and yet her desire to compete at the Olympics remains as strong as ever. \u201cWe have to believe there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Olympics is almost like a drug. That\u2019s why athletes are able to put our lives on hold, move away from our loved ones, get up at ridiculous o\u2019clock in the morning. So until there\u2019s any kind of announcement that says there\u2019s a postponement, we have to trust the Olympics will go ahead and we\u2019d be silly not to do everything we could to prepare.\u201d </p> <p>Isolation plans for the rowers had already been drawn up: exercise bikes and rowing machines will now take up space in lounges or bedrooms but Swann is used to awkward training regimes. Having resumed her medical studies after finishing second with the women\u2019s eight in Rio, a sense of unfinished business drew her back to the sport. Trying to fit a bursting schedule of hospital rotations, exam revision, gym work and sleep into each 24-hour cycle nearly broke her.</p> <p>The week before her finals, a 5km indoor session left her in tears. \u201cMy coach was saying: \u2018Polly, you\u2019ve just got to do it.\u2019 And I said: \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can.\u2019 At the time it felt like the worst thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. Now I\u2019ve got a bit of perspective. It wasn\u2019t a global pandemic, put it that way.\u201d</p> <p>Swann grew up in Edinburgh; her mother is a former midwife and her father is a doctor, providing frontline help during the crisis. Swann, who is not yet registered with the GMC and will need a training post before she can practise, never imagined doing anything other than medicine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"088a8b9c9b719884251908009b5b05af347f3d77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/088a8b9c9b719884251908009b5b05af347f3d77/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polly Swann describes the Olympics as being \u2018like a drug\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polly Swann describes the Olympics as being \u2018like a drug\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At school she showed some sporting aptitude, but her height made her \u201cungainly\u201d \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t know where my legs and arms were in space and time,\u201d she says, laughing. Struggling with hockey \u2013 she had an extra-long stick but still found reaching the ball on the ground difficult \u2013 she swapped to rowing and was quickly smitten.</p> <p>Back injuries kept her out of contention for the 2012 Games; the following year, she found herself paired with Helen Glover, who had won Britain\u2019s first gold in London with Heather Stanning. \u201cWe first got into a boat together in January of 2013 and I just remember being petrified,\u201d says Swann, who remembers thinking: \u201c\u2018Do <em>not</em> make a mistake.\u2019\u201d But Glover was a perfect mentor who \u201cpoured her heart into rowing\u201d and by August that year they had won the world championships together.</p> <p>When Glover reunited with Stanning for their second Olympic gold in 2016, Swann took a place in the women\u2019s eight, who nearly pulled off one of the most dramatic comebacks seen on the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon. Up against a USA boat unbeaten for a decade, the GB eight\u2019s strategy was simple: start fast and stay with them. They did neither. At the halfway mark Britain were last.</p> <p>Swann remembers thinking all was lost when cox Zoe de Toledo made a bold call and began their sprint finish nearly a kilometre early. A surge of energy coursed through the boat, which soared up the field. \u201cYou get this all-encompassing belief from moving through the other boats,\u201d Swann says. \u201cWithin 300m I was like \u2018We\u2019re going to win the Olympics.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWe were coming hot and heavy on the Americans and then with 100m to go my legs gave in and my lungs were exploding. I could hardly move.\u201d</p> <p>USA took gold by two seconds but Swann and her teammates were thrilled with their fighting silver.</p> <p>Swann still wants a gold but her attitude to the Olympics has changed. Desperate just to make the team in 2016, she feels Tokyo would be, by comparison, \u201ca bonus \u2013 the one I get to enjoy\u201d. Which boat she may compete in remains a matter for the selectors. Swann enjoys the art of pairs racing \u2013 \u201cyou really get to feel the glide of the boat and how to move it well\u201d \u2013 but also enjoys the sprint style of the eight, a charge she calls \u201cvicious and electric\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-sport-premier-league-tokyo-olympics\">Enough of this epic delusion: coronavirus makes sport in front of fans a long way off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The anxiety caused by the virus cannot be avoided \u2013 not in a sport overseen by a 73-year-old coach who must take special precautions to self-isolate as per government advice.

A natural extrovert who thrives on teamwork, Swann finds the prospect of physical distancing challenging but she already has plenty of her favourite tea in the house and has made a deal with Shorten that they will learn the guitar together.</p> <p>Whether she can fingerpick by the summer is uncertain; whether the Olympics will happen even more so. But it\u2019s a guarantee Swann and her fellow rowers will not sacrifice an iota of their training, wherever they have to do it. \u201cWe know the rest of the world will do the same,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s something quite powerful behind that motivation.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>When Carlton\u2019s Lucy McEvoy kicked a goal late in the fourth quarter on Sunday afternoon against the Brisbane Lions, she, along with the rest of the AFLW community, had no idea it would be the last goal of the season.</p> <p>The 2020 season is officially over after a tumultuous and confusing fortnight. Late on Sunday afternoon the AFL chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/22/afl-nrl-and-a-league-press-on-despite-restrictions\">the season would conclude immediately</a> and that no premiership would be awarded.</p> <p>McLachlan cited the conference system and the unfinished finals series as influences on the decision not to award a premiership. Instead, the 2020 season will come with an asterisk. Season not completed.

Tears were shed as the players lamented their missed opportunities. In Brisbane, the Lions\u2019 training was interrupted and the team were called together only to be told that the club didn\u2019t know if they were playing or who they were playing. All of this played out via the club\u2019s respective social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram, meaning fans felt some of the confusion and distress too.</p> <p>When it was finally confirmed late on Wednesday night that the top four teams of each conference would go through to the finals \u2013 an increase from the original plans for the season of the top three teams from each conference \u2013 the lasting feeling was of an organisation struggling to keep up with what is and continues to be an unprecedented situation. That feeling never really went away.</p> <p>McLachlan said on Wednesday night that the league was operating on \u201cclear instructions\u201d from the government that \u201call parts of society need to keep moving forward and we simply cannot stand still\u201d and so the show would roll on, just in a very different outfit.</p> <p>It seemed an incredible decision given the global situation and the choices made by other major sporting organisations to postpone or cancel their seasons. Advice from health professionals pushed for social distancing. How exactly do you do that on a footy field?</p> <p>The AFL\u2019s decision on Sunday came not long after the Victorian state government announced it would implement a shutdown of all non-essential activity across the state. New South Wales and ACT will do the same. The Western Australian government announced it would follow Tasmania\u2019s lead and close its borders to interstate travel and impose a 14-day period of self-isolation for any arrivals. South Australia and the Northern Territory will also close their borders.</p> <p>While plenty of questions will be asked about the decision to cancel instead of postpone the season \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 operating a national sporting competition in such an environment was simply untenable.

  "<p>Electric vehicles produce less carbon dioxide than petrol cars across the vast majority of the globe \u2013 contrary to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/26/yes-electric-vehicles-really-are-better-than-fossil-fuel-burners\">claims of some detractors</a>, who have alleged that the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted in the production of electricity and their manufacture outweighs the benefits.</p> <p>The finding is a boost to governments, including the UK, seeking to move to net zero carbon emissions, which will require a massive expansion of the electric car fleet. A similar benefit was found for electric heat pumps.</p> <p>In the UK, transport is now the biggest contributor to the climate crisis and domestic heating has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/13/hammond-says-gas-heating-will-be-replaced-by-low-carbon-systems\">stubbornly stuck on natural gas for much of the country</a>.</p> <p>Across the world, passenger road vehicles and household heating generate about a quarter of all emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. That makes electric vehicles essential to reducing overall emissions, but how clean an electric vehicle is also depends on how the electricity is generated, the efficiency of the supply and the efficiency of the vehicle.</p> <p>That has made some individuals and governments question whether these technologies are worth expanding. The study, <a href=\"https://nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0488-7\">published on Monday in the</a><a href=\"https://nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0488-7\"> journal Nature Sustainability</a>, produced a decisive yes.</p> <p>Scientists from the universities of Exeter, Nijmegen and Cambridge conducted lifecycle assessments that showed that even where electricity generation still involves substantial amounts of fossil fuel, there was a CO<sub>2</sub> saving over conventional cars and fossil fuel heating.</p> <p>They found that in 53 out of 59 regions, comprising 95% of the world, electric vehicles and domestic heat pumps generate less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel powered cars or boilers. The only exceptions are heavily coal-dependent countries such as Poland.</p> <p>In countries such as Sweden, which gets most of its electricity from renewable sources, and France, which is largely powered by nuclear, the CO<sub>2</sub> savings from using electric cars reach as high as 70% over their conventional counterparts.</p> <p>In the UK, the savings are about 30%. However, that is likely to improve further as electric vehicles grow even more efficient and more CO<sub>2</sub> is taken out of the electricity generating system.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2011/jul/18/renewable-heat-technology-energy-bills\">Heat pumps</a> use electricity and heat exchange systems \u2013 similar in principle to those found in fridges \u2013 to take advantage of the difference in temperature underground and at the surface, in the case of ground source heat pumps, and between the outdoor air and indoors in the case of air source heat pumps. If they were widely used, the study found, they could reduce global carbon emissions by up to 0.8 gigatons a year by 2050, or the equivalent of Germany\u2019s emissions today.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that electric vehicles or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/06/eco-guide-to-heating-your-home\">heat pumps</a> could increase emissions is essentially a myth,\u201d said Florian Knobloch of Nijmegen University in the Netherlands, the lead author of the study. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of disinformation going around. Here is a definitive study that can dispel those myths.\u201d</p> <p>Jean-Francois Mercure, of Exeter University, a co-author of the study, added: \u201cThe answer is clear: to reduce carbon emissions, we should choose electric cars and household heat pumps over fossil fuel alternatives.\u201d</p> <p>Among the detractors has been Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg, the climate controversialist, who argued in a column published in newspapers around the world last week that electric cars were \u201csimply expensive gadgets heavily subsidised for the wealthy to feel good while doing very little for the planet\u201d.</p> <p>Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cElectric vehicles and heat pumps are absolutely critical for meeting climate goals so it\u2019s good to see this favourable report. In the UK, both technologies will continue to make big carbon savings alongside our switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy to power the electricity grid.\u201d</p> <p>But he warned that insulating homes and improving public transport remained important goals, alongside electric vehicles and heat pumps, and called for much more government action to realise the benefits.</p> <p>\u201cWhere the UK is dragging its feet is supporting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/14/councils-stall-on-adding-charging-points-for-electric-vehicles\">necessary rapid rollout of electric cars</a> and heat pumps as well as the infrastructure to support them,\u201d he said.</p>",

EFSA [the European Food Safety Authority] has said that the stresses associated with handling and transport may cause latent infections to proceed to clinical disease.

On top of that they expose all the animal handlers, truck drivers and others to risk.\u201d</p> <h2>Meat supply fears</h2> <p>The border crisis has added to growing anxiety about the meat supply chain. Any shutdown of slaughterhouses could lead to supply restrictions, price rises and problems for farmers, say experts.</p> <p>\u201cThe slaughterhouse system is extremely vulnerable because although there is an increasing amount of automation, they are still largely dependent on human labour,\u201d said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst with IHS Markit\u2019s Agribusiness Intelligence. \u201cIf someone is ill on the line, then does the whole line have to self-isolate and for how long? The plant will have to be shut down and deep cleaned. And then if there are not enough inspectors, or if staff just don\u2019t come in, they will also have to shut down.\u201d</p> <p>If there are no vets or inspectors available, the plant cannot operate. And the stringent hygiene requirements mean that a shortage of gloves and other sanitation equipment of the type currently needed by medical staff could mean shutdown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/something-is-wrong-meps-say-eu-is-failing-to-regulate-live-animal-exports\">\u2018Something is wrong\u2019: why the live animal trade is booming in Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Slaughterhouses are acknowledged to be the vulnerable point in the meat supply chain.

  "<p>To stop the spread of the coronavirus, the UK prime minister has urged people to steer clear of each other when they leave their homes.</p> \n<p>So what is the new outdoor etiquette?</p> \n<p>From jogging in the park, to queuing in supermarkets, experts say Britons have to ditch their usual reserve \u2013 and get used to telling people to \u201cmove away\u201d.<br></p> \n<h2><strong>The </strong><strong>supermarket queue</strong></h2> \n<p>Social distancing means leaving 2 metres space between people. That is just under 6ft 7in \u2013 a little less than the height of the former England striker Peter Crouch, or roughly the length of two standard supermarket trolleys.</p> \n<p>Some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrentToderian/status/1240443980338188288\">supermarkets are helping shoppers by placing sticky-backed markers on the floor</a> 2 metres apart.</p> \n<p> \u201cIf someone comes up behind, it\u2019s tricky. It may create a slightly tense situation,\u201d said <a href=\"https://medium.com/@michael.g.head\">Dr Michael Head</a>, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p> \u201cWe should be emboldened and empowered to be able to say to them: \u2018Please just take a step back.\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not used to doing it. We are quite reserved as a nation. Maybe in other countries it might be easier.\u201d</p> \n<p>Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the <a href=\"http://www.brc.org.uk/\">British Retail Consortium</a>, said retailers were employing measures to help shoppers keep their distance. \u201cThese include controlling the flow of customers into stores, placing floor distance guides for those queuing inside stores, and communicating with customers to remind them of the importance of social distancing.</p> \n<p>\u201cHowever, the focus for staff remains ensuring customers have access to goods on shelves; customers must play their part in ensuring responsible and safe shopping by keeping 2 metres apart wherever possible \u2013 both inside stores and if queuing outside \u2013 and everyone should feel confident in asking fellow customers to do the same.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Jogging</strong></h2> \n<p> In the UK, jogging and running are among few outdoor activities still available. For some, however, the thought of encountering a heavily perspiring runner who is exhaling heavily as they overtake at close quarters on a narrow path may cause alarm.</p> \n<p>Runners should keep their distance too, though the risk of passing on the virus is small.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere will be a risk there, but it will be a very small risk,\u201d said Head. \u201cYou are running up behind someone and past them. The time you will be close to them will be minimal. So the risk of transmission at that precise point will be very, very tiny.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe definition of a contact thus far is within 2 metres for 15 minutes. So if you are on public transport, or stuck in a restaurant with someone, that has the potential to be a contact there. If you are running past someone for a few seconds, in an outdoor space as well, the risk of transmission at that point is tiny.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/coronauk-zip/giv-3902nQ1IbOzUpOAS\" data-alt=\"UK coronavirus hotspots\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/coronauk-zip/giv-3902nQ1IbOzUpOAS\">UK coronavirus hotspots</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Runners, however, are known to spit \u2013 and that poses a different problem.</p> \n<p>The issue was addressed by <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/health-nutrition/a31488775/spit-snot-etiquette-for-cyclists-coronavirus/\">Amy Treakle, an infectious disease specialist</a> with the Polyclinic in Seattle, who has said: \u201cCovid-19 is spread by respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, and transmission may occur when these droplets enter the mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby. Spit contains saliva but could also contain sputum from the lungs or drainage from the posterior nasopharynx.\u201d</p> \n<p>She has also advised against shooting mucus out of your nose. The new etiquette, in short, is do neither \u2013 at least around anyone else.</p> \n<h2><strong>Walking</strong></h2> \n<p>Spring sunshine led to thousands leaving towns and cities for Britain\u2019s beaches and wide open spaces.</p> \n<p>Such crowds present serious risk. Even those who eventually managed to find a deserted spot would probably have had to negotiate a busy car park.</p> \n<p>The walking charity Ramblers UK advises people to only walk locally, in places that can be accessed without a car or public transport.</p> \n<p>\u201cAvoid busy places, including popular parks, beauty spots or beaches,\u201d it said. Keep 2 metres apart and \u201cavoid touching gates, fences etc\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you do, clean your hands with anti-bac and wash your hands as soon as possible.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Head said: \u201cIf you have anxiety, for example, and you\u2019ve gone out for a walk to reduce that anxiety, what you don\u2019t need is to have to ask people to get out of your way. It\u2019s a tricky thing to do anyway.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to all of us to recognise that other people might not be willing to speak up , and not to put them in that position where they need to speak up.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Touchscreen tills</strong></h2> \n<p>These tills are a great place for viruses and bacteria to be passed from person to person, according to infectious disease epidemiologists. The British Retail Consortium has stressed that stores have increased the number of deep cleans and are implementing other measures.</p> \n<p>Should you whip out the anti-bacterial wipes or don the rubber gloves?</p> \n<p>\u201cI think we need to try as far as possible not to be embarrassed by little things that we might previously have been embarrassed about,\u201d said Head. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine to wash your hands in public before and after touching door handles and screens. It\u2019s a key message that people need to carry on doing.\u201d As for gloves: \u201cIf people feel reassured by that, then wear gloves.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>According to official statistics, China has defeated the coronavirus. Over the last five days, health authorities have reported only one new locally transmitted case of Covid-19 \u2013 a patient in Guangdong province infected by someone travelling from abroad. In Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak and the country\u2019s worst-hit area, officials on Monday reported a fifth day without new cases.</p> \n<p>The figures are a sharp drop from just a month ago when recording a daily increase of fewer than 2,000 new infections was a milestone.

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

On why such cases are not included as confirmed cases, the commission said that patients were quarantined for 14 days and if they began to show symptoms they would be designated as confirmed and that data would be published.</p> \n<p>\u201cA small number of asymptomatic infections may progress to becoming confirmed cases, but the vast majority [of patients] will heal by themselves,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>Critics also question why recovered patients who retest as positive are not counted. Data from quarantine centres in Wuhan showed that the possibility of recovered patients testing positive again was between 5% and 10%, according to the state-run Global Times.

Some factories are working round the clock to produce the ventilation equipment the US and EU need. \u201cThere\u2019s literally no country in the world that doesn\u2019t want to buy a ventilator from China right now.\u201d said Li Kai, the director of Beijing Andromedae. \u201cWe have tens of thousands of orders waiting. The issue is how fast we can make them.\u201d</p> \n<p>It may be easier for China to show this enterprise, because as the country seemingly first in and out of the epidemic, it is further ahead on the learning curve. </p> \n<p>Following a phone call between Xi and the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, China has shared the genome sequence of the virus and its scientists have sped up publication of papers on it. </p> \n<p>Beijing\u2019s international standing has only been helped by floundering in Washington, and Donald Trump\u2019s determination to indulge in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">nationalistic blame game</a>.</p> \n<p>As the personal stakes have risen for the US president, so has his anti-Chinese rhetoric. He has also defended his decision to repeatedly refer to \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d. </p> \n<p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who has described the Chinese Communist party as the biggest threat to world security, went further, attacking China\u2019s lack of transparency and accusing it of putting countless lives at risk.</p> \n<p>Chinese officials for their part have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\">blamed the outbreak o</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\">n the US</a>. The Chinese ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, did however use an interview on HBO at the weekend to reiterate his statement of 9 February that it would be \u201ccrazy\u201d to spread conspiracy theories that the virus had been created in a US military laboratory.</p> \n<p>The danger is that not enough diplomats in Beijing or Washington will show the same maturity.</p>",
  "<p>It has been said repeatedly, recently, that football, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-sport-premier-league-tokyo-olympics\" title=\"\">like many other things</a>, no longer exists in a bubble. No area of society is able to stay immune from this crippling disease. There will be casualties in every sphere of life. Football is no different. Women\u2019s football is no different.</p> <p>Amanda Vandervort, the chief women\u2019s football officer for Fifpro, the global players\u2019 union, said the coronavirus pandemic could be \u201ca major setback to the growth and progress we\u2019ve made as an industry\u201d and called for a \u201csmart and collaborative approach, a common vision that unites national strategies and implements regulatory interventions to ensure we minimise setbacks.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/22/ioc-expected-to-make-decision-on-tokyo-2020-olympics-within-four-weeks\">Olympics postponement on the cards as IOC gives itself four-week deadline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having spoken to sources at Women\u2019s Super League and Championship clubs, a picture has emerged of the challenges clubs, players and the FA face in trying to mitigate an inescapable crisis.</p> <p>Women\u2019s teams in England operate overwhelmingly at a loss with, generally, parent clubs of varying financial strengths footing the bill. With clubs across the men\u2019s pyramid facing the financial consequences of postponed games, it is inevitable women\u2019s teams will, apart from those associated with the biggest Premier League clubs, be impacted.</p> <p>For the majority of women\u2019s teams, turnstile and other matchday income does not cover the cost of ground contracts or hire, staffing and travel. The broadcast rights for the women\u2019s game are owned by BT Sport and the BBC, who cover their costs rather than paying for rights. This means postponements are significantly less impactful on women\u2019s teams. The biggest losses will be felt through covering player, coaching and staff contracts through an extended season and a potential loss of sponsors.</p> <p>They face the same questions as the men\u2019s game. Who wins the league? Who gets a Champions League place? Who gets relegated? Who comes up? Except the financial implications of those decisions, or that of a voided season, are insignificant by comparison.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/lauren-hemp-england-shebelieves-cup-manchester-city-chip-shop\">'I got noticed in my chip shop': Lauren Hemp out to catch eye with England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That puts pressure on the FA to maintain a united stance on the resumption, or not, across professional football; the Premier League, EFL, Women\u2019s Super League and Women\u2019s Championship. There is a logic to a united position: split things up and they could be accused of mixed messages at a time when clarity in society is sought after.</p> <p>However, the huge sums of money involved in the men\u2019s game and the consequences of season cancellations or premature conclusions are very different to the problems faced in the women\u2019s. And, even with the best will in the world, it is impossible to not see the teams who have the most to lose or gain, those in the Premier League, dominating decisions.</p> <p>There is widespread sympathy towards the situation the FA is having to deal with. It does appear that support for women\u2019s teams may be on the cards, with clubs being asked to submit their expected losses and costs to the governing body.</p> <p>An FA spokesperson said: \u201cThese are unprecedented and challenging times for all industries around the world and football is no different. We continue to work tirelessly with the football community, across every level of the game, to assess the impact of coronavirus, while taking the important steps to support the welfare of clubs, players, staff and supporters.\u201d</p> <p>The lack of a definitive decision on the season is stopping clubs from being able to plan for the future and provide answers to players and staff. On the other hand though, one source voiced concern that the outbreak could be a perfect storm for some clubs that would see it as an excuse to cut loose their women\u2019s teams and that wrapping up the league now could prompt a dismissal of players and staff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66a78120e7ea4cc2f6337502150e4ea6872dafef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66a78120e7ea4cc2f6337502150e4ea6872dafef/0_67_3535_2122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Action from Sheffield United\u2019s game against Blackburn in the Championship in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Action from Sheffield United\u2019s game against Blackburn in the Championship in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Currie for The FA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Either way, players stand to lose. Footballers in the top two tiers of the women\u2019s game are rarely on contracts of more than one year. Bar a handful at the very top, they are not yet afforded the security of lengthy contracts familiar in the elite men\u2019s game. With the majority of contracts ending in June, and some only paid until the season was set to end in early May, players have been anxious to learn their fates and it is not implausible that, should the FA seek to play out the league season, players could find themselves playing their remaining games for other teams.</p> <p>Many players at Championship level on semi-professional contracts have second jobs and will also find their off-field employment impacted too. Scarily, these are players in one of the most secure footballing environments for women in the world.</p> <p>Vandevort highlighted the extent of the struggle globally. \u201cAfter speaking with a number of players over the past several days, a few things have become clear to me,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst, communication is all over the map and, for the players, crisis management is happening largely at a club-by-club level. Some clubs are communicating consistently and clearly with their players, while others seem to barely share any information at all.</p> <p>\u201cSecond, there is a great deal of variance on whether clubs are allowing players to leave and return to their homes and families. In such a time of a global pandemic, players deserve the ability to make the choices that are best for their individual health and well-being. Lastly, we\u2019re hearing situations where player contracts are already being cancelled, and others where clubs have already restructured their budgets to eliminate women\u2019s football altogether.</p> <p>\u201cThese times are unsettling and players are finding themselves in precarious positions regarding where they\u2019ll be throughout the quarantine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vandevort said players should continue to contact Fifpro, but is also keen to direct them to local player associations. \u201cWe welcome players to get in touch with us if they have questions, but as a first point of contact wherever possible, I\u2019d advise players to first reach out to their domestic unions since they\u2019ll be most familiar with local labour laws and domestic footballing environments. It\u2019s also worth sharing that over the last few years many of the advances in women\u2019s football have come when players and their national unions have worked together to achieve progress.</p> <p>\u201cFrom Denmark, to Ireland, Colombia, Chile, Cyprus, Spain and the US, women have achieved progress collectively. On an individual basis it can be challenging but with teammates alongside you can become much more influential and can create long-lasting positive impacts.\u201d</p> <p>It is highly likely teams will fold and players be discarded. Collective organising and experience sharing could be key in helping players navigate through this tumultuous period. Hopefully, clubs and governing bodies will rise to the challenge of providing support.</p>",
  "<p>Those of us who have been tracking the novel coronavirus since December can easily identify its key milestones. There was mid-January, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/20/coronavirus-spreads-to-beijing-as-china-confirms-new-cases\">human to human transmission</a> of coronavirus was confirmed. Then later that month Hubei province hit 500 cases, the unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">lockdown</a> extended to almost 60 million people, and the Lancet published a study showing that a third of patients require admission to intensive care, and 29% get so bad that they need ventilation. By the end of February, a sobering WHO-China joint mission <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/joint-mission-press-conference-script-english-final.pdf?sfvrsn=51c90b9e_2\">press conference</a> illustrated the massive policy response in China \u2013 and, on 29 February, the UK saw its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51683428\">first case</a> of local transmission.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/hancock-socialising-uk-slowing-coronavirus-effort\">Hancock accuses those still socialising in UK of being 'very selfish'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the UK we have had nine weeks to listen, learn and prepare. We have had nine weeks to run outbreak simulations, set up supply chains to ensure sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, and bring about the availability of rapid, cheap tests. We have had nine weeks to establish algorithms to support contact tracing, and start mass awareness campaigns not only about hand-washing, but about the risks that the virus would pose to social and economic activity if not taken seriously by all. Countries such as Senegal were doing this in January.<br><br>The UK\u2019s head start in managing the outbreak continued as our confirmed case count remained lower than our neighbours\u2019. However, on 12 March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-governments-coronavirus-advice-and-why-it-gave-it\">Boris Johnson announced</a> that all minor testing and contact tracing would stop and passive self-isolation would be introduced for those with symptoms, all part of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">herd immunity strategy</a> supposedly endorsed by the \u201cbest science\u201d. After a backlash from scientists, the government clarified that it was not explicitly pursuing herd immunity, but would be taking measures at the \u201cright time guided by the evidence\u201d, all according to a plan which it did not share with the public.<br><br>On 17 March, Imperial College <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">released a study</a> noting that it had revised the model the government had been using, and stating that suppressing the virus was in fact the best way to avoid a vast number of people dying. The earlier model did not include the ICU data shared in the Lancet on 24 January. Instead, it was similar, but much later information from Italy, that changed their recommendation.<br><br>So, at the end of week, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/new-data-new-policy-why-uks-coronavirus-strategy-has-changed\">UK government did a 180-degree turn</a>, reversing what it had said only days previously. It made the decision to take the same measures other countries had in order to delay the spread of virus: closing schools except for the children of key workers, closing pubs and other gathering places, asking households to self-isolate for 14 days and focusing on scaling up testing to 25,000 tests per day over the next month. However, capacity issues and lost time mean that testing will take time to ramp up, PPE supply chains are strained, and all while patient numbers continue to increase as we follow Italy\u2019s path.<br><br>The twists and turns described above have created a climate where the public do not trust that the government is responding in their best interests. Many cannot say what the government\u2019s strategy is, or are confused about how serious coronavirus is for their health. Communication during a crisis must be clear, transparent, open and responsive. The confusion over herd immunity, for example, has made people reasonably think that the government wants everyone to get the virus to protect the economy, that it is not taking more decisive action because this is not a serious threat, or that the government does not know what it is doing. None of these are the whole story, but such perceptions are certainly not helpful in a crisis.<br><br>We had a choice early on in the UK\u2019s trajectory to go down the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/south-korea-rapid-intrusive-measures-covid-19\">South Korean path</a> of mass testing, isolating carriers of the virus (50% of whom are asymptomatic), tracing all contacts to ensure they isolate as well, and at the same time taking soft measures to delay the spread. Instead, we watched and waited, and whether it was academic navel-gazing, political infighting, a sense of British exceptionalism, or a deliberate choice to minimise economic disruption over saving lives, we have ended up in a position where we are now closer to the Italy scenario than anticipated, and are faced with taking more and more drastic measures.<br><br>Perhaps the delay was due to fears about a second wave of the virus, next winter. But why not then work on buying time for the NHS to prepare, for health staff to get PPE, to make testing available, to boost beds and equipment, to trial antiviral treatments, or get us closer to the point that one of the vaccine candidates being investigated might actually work. Why not use the time to learn more <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-13/china-japan-korea-coronavirus-reinfection-test-positive\">about re</a><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-13/china-japan-korea-coronavirus-reinfection-test-positive\">infection</a> by the virus, about immune response, which seems to affect who needs ICU care, and about who recovers spontaneously? To understand where this virus came from, whether it is indeed seasonal, and how it could mutate? Why give in at such an early stage unless the goal is to get through this outbreak quickly so that whoever is left can help get the economy back to normal? It is still not clear who exactly is advising the government, who <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage\">sits on </a>the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, and what factors the prime minister and his colleagues are taking into account in his decision-making.<br><br>Where does all this leave us now? Given that we lost the window of containment several weeks ago, the only feasible path forward seems to be to put in stringent physical distancing measures to delay the spread of the virus. But these alone will not be enough. We also need to backtrack and start doing the mass testing, tracing and isolating that are integral to breaking chains of transmission. Putting these measures in place does not mean that we will immediately solve NHS capacity challenges, or that we will not see a massive rise in patients dying. They will, however, help to slow down the spread. We must also continue to push for the protection of the health workforce and frontline responders who are exposed to high viral loads. And we must race to make up for the time lost during two months of passivity.</p> <p>\u2022 Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p>",

  "<p>\u201cEvery time you get depressed, comedy will be there to drag your ass out of it,\u201d said Robin Williams in 1996. It is a gut-punch of a quote, considering that depression was one of the factors that led to his death 18 years later (although his wife has said the main reason for his suicide was probably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/03/robin-williams-disintegrating-before-suicide-widow-says\">the debilitating brain disease diffuse Lewy body dementia</a>). It also speaks to a nagging sense that there is some truth to the \u201ctears of a clown\u201d cliche: that many of those who seek to make us laugh are masking private sadness.</p> <p>The list of comedy greats who have had some form of mental illness is long: Richard Pryor, Spike Milligan, Caroline Aherne, Stephen Fry, Joan Rivers and Kenneth Williams to name a few. The doubters say that it is no more common among comics than anyone else \u2013 they are just more cognisant of the bad stuff in the world and have the outlet to talk about it.</p> <p>So what of today\u2019s comedians? Is comedy dragging their ass out of anything? \u201cIt\u2019s where I found all my joy when I was having a tough year, with heartbreak and losing a close family member,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/09/suzi-ruffell-review-warwick-arts-centre\">Suzi Ruffell</a>, who has appeared on TV shows including Mock the Week and The Last Leg. \u201cPerforming was the one thing that was just mine. On stage, I was talking about how shit things were and people were laughing, and I often think that is them saying: \u2018Me too, I\u2019ve felt that.\u2019 If it wasn\u2019t for that, my healing process would have taken a lot longer.\u201d</p> <p>For John Robins, a BBC Radio 5 live DJ and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/26/edinburgh-fringe-comedy-award-shared-hannah-gadsby-john-robins\">Edinburgh Comedy award winner</a>, the stage is a safe place and \u201can island of control\u201d \u2013 but the process of writing comedy helps him more than the performance, he says: \u201cStandup is my way of making sense of my life and how I feel about myself. Often, I don\u2019t really get a handle on what\u2019s happening until it\u2019s found a life in a routine.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nonsense written about \u2018comedy as therapy\u2019 \u2013 the therapy is the writing bit that happened eight months ago, the practice that happened six months ago, the honing that happened four months ago. There have been moments when I\u2019ve been writing difficult bits, I\u2019ve been sitting in my kitchen in floods of tears because I didn\u2019t realise the way I felt until I wrote it down. By the time most people see it, I\u2019m totally over that bit.\u201d</p> <p>It is a timely moment to revisit the subject of comedy and mental health, as some of its moving parts have shifted in the past decade. First, standups have been increasingly open about their mental health and traumatic episodes in their life. Some tackle this in an unobtrusive way, letting the stories of life\u2019s ups and downs speak for themselves, but many (notably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/22/kim-noble-youre-not-alone-review-soho-theatre-london\">Kim Noble</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/16/hannah-gadsby-trauma-comedy-nanette-standup-netflix\">Hannah Gadsby</a>) have laid it bare in shocking detail. Last year, the documentary <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBV-7_qGlr4\">Laughing Matters</a> got comics (such as Sarah Silverman and the US Office\u2019s Rainn Wilson) off the stage to tell their stories without the jokes in between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"31b4e5d81189e8509e5292d5e1eb094553ba437d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31b4e5d81189e8509e5292d5e1eb094553ba437d/0_0_2595_3896/667.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Gadsby with her Emmy for her disarmingly honest Netflix special Nanette\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the mainstream ... Hannah Gadsby won an Emmy in 2019 for her disarmingly honest Netflix special Nanette.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second big change has been the rise of social media, which has increased exposure for all, but especially those in the public eye. Third is the conversation around mental health, which has become far more sensitive, sophisticated and widespread. When a major broadcaster has a <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/pick-week-itvs-silent-ad-break-golden/1661868\">\u201csilent ad break\u201d</a> to encourage people to check in with each other \u2013 as ITV did last autumn \u2013 you know mental health has gone mainstream.</p> <p>Broadcasters are doing their bit again this week, with <a href=\"https://dave.uktv.co.uk/shows/comedy-against-living-miserably/\">Comedy Against Living Miserably</a>, a three-part series on Dave in association with the mental health charity Calm. In each show, comics \u2013 including Ruffell, Robins, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/02/nish-kumar-i-have-not-got-over-brexit\">Nish Kumar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/11/kiri-pritchard-mclean-review-pacey-lean-precision-tooled-set-from-increasingly-impressive-comic\">Kiri Pritchard-McLean</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/23/darren-harriott-review-edinburgh-2019\">Darren Harriott</a> \u2013 will speak about everything from grief to anxiety to gaslighting and perform material on these subjects. As Robins says: \u201cMental health is life. As a standup, you\u2019re talking about your life, your experiences, good and bad. Everyone has mental health.\u201d</p> <p>But for all the introspection that comes with standup, this generation of comics are a responsible lot. Ruffell and Robins are aware of how much their comedy can benefit their audiences, too \u2013 especially at a time like this, which feels bleak and lonely for so many. Robins says people have told him (\u201cthe partners, usually\u201d) that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/may/05/making-waves-radio-djs-men-and-mental-health-john-robins-elis-james\">his radio show with fellow comedian</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/may/05/making-waves-radio-djs-men-and-mental-health-john-robins-elis-james\"> Elis James</a> has got them through a tough time. Off the back of that, Robins and James started a podcast, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07rq6vh/episodes/downloads\">How Do You Cope?</a>, that is aimed squarely at the subject of mental health.</p> <p>Ruffell\u2019s experience of how her comedy can help others will be an eye-opener to many: \u201cI\u2019ve had people travel 100 miles [to one of my shows] because they wanted to bring their gay teenage daughter to see me, because she doesn\u2019t have a gay network at all. On more than one occasion, I\u2019ve had a teenager say to me: \u2018When you\u2019re on TV, it reminds my mum that I\u2019m normal.\u2019 So it\u2019s really important that they get to see someone like them under a spotlight talking about their experiences.\u201d</p> <p>Robins recognises, however, that comedy has limits in its influence. As a comic on stage, the best he can hope to achieve is \u201cthousands of tiny impacts\u201d. The same applies to many mental health campaigns, he says \u2013 the hashtag slogans #bekind and #reachout are \u201cabsolutely vital right now\u201d, but a drop in the ocean in the context of \u201cservices that are so stretched and so cut that they barely exist\u201d. He says: \u201cThe best way to actually improve the nation\u2019s mental health is to pay your taxes, encourage companies to pay their taxes and vote for a government that will spend that money in the most useful way, regardless of what political colour you are.\u201d</p> <p>The flip side of all this is that being a standup can also exacerbate mental health problems. It is a solitary job, with unpredictable results from one night to the next and little security in the long term, which is hardly a recipe for a settled existence. Robins says that writing a show requires \u201cholding yourself in places of anxiety, frustration or anger, and that isn\u2019t a healthy place to be\u201d. The Laugh Factory comedy club in Los Angeles has gone as far as getting an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/28/21142319/comedy-therapist-laugh-factory\">in-house psychologist</a>, who was hired because \u201crecognised that comedians needed more support than he could provide\u201d.</p> <p>And then there is social media. Being active online is almost obligatory for comics today \u2013 and a necessity now that the possibility of performing live is gone for lord knows how long. The Faustian pact they make is that they give more of themselves away; they are \u201con\u201d when they are padding around at home, not only when they are on stage. \u201cPeople want a fuller idea of what a comic is these days,\u201d Ruffell says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind sharing a bit more, but not everyone does, and if I see another comic sharing too much or tweeting certain things I\u2019ll send them a text just saying: \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 We do have to look out for each other. For the sake of my mental health I have to tweet and not scroll.\u201d</p> <p>More alarmingly, she says: \u201cThe thing that\u2019s affected me the most [from social media] is the element of threat. I had this troll that just kept on saying: \u2018I\u2019m gonna rape you straight.\u2019 That\u2019s a really weird thing to read when you\u2019re at a train station, travelling home by yourself. Sometimes it happens on the way to a gig and you have to go on stage and be all: \u2018Hey! How\u2019s everyone doing?!\u2019 It\u2019s an extra thing people don\u2019t consider that wears away at you.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/12/eurydice-dixon-killer-to-spend-life-behind-bars-after-failing-in-appeal-bid\">The </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/12/eurydice-dixon-killer-to-spend-life-behind-bars-after-failing-in-appeal-bid\">murder of the Melbourne-based comedian Eurydice Dixon in 2018</a>, after a gig, shows that comics must tread the difficult line between taking such threats seriously and living their lives.</p> <p>But these are boom times for standup. There are more touring comics than ever before and more TV opportunities. The nature of the form means that, the second a comedian get on stage, with the spotlight and the mic, they have authority \u2013 and we in the audience or at home put them on a pedestal. The fact that many comics want to use this soft power for good is a start. As Ruffell says: \u201cI just hope there are people out there who watch the show and feel less alone.\u201d</p> <p><em>Comedy Against Living Miserably starts on Dave on </em><em>24 March</em><em> at 9pm</em></p> <p><em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

  "<p>During the social confinements caused by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a>, many theatre-goers will be relying on television for entertainment. However, when the stages eventually reopen, a lot of audiences will, paradoxically, still find themselves watching TV.</p> <p>While movies have long been a source of theatrical material, old TV series have started to rival them as inspiration for adaptations. Among the most anticipated of the stage productions currently furloughed is a recycling (appropriately) of The Good Life, the 70s BBC sitcom about a suburban couple who adopted a green lifestyle decades before it became fashionable.</p> <p>Theatre shows currently suspended include a UK tour of the sitcom Some Mothers Do \u2019Ave \u2019Em and a musical version of Only Fools and Horses. Longer term, a musical of The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin is in preparation at Birmingham Rep.</p> <p>Why has theatre become so drawn to classic sitcoms? Jeremy Sams, adapter-director of The Good Life stage remake, says: \u201cThere can be a pragmatic reason. The reason they\u2019ve put on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/02/pretty-woman-the-musical-review-piccadilly-theatre-london\">Pretty Woman: The Musical</a>, for example, is that the people who went to see the original movie are now rich enough to pay West End theatre prices.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b07748d48d1ea3d1e627a1d474b136feae3ee9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b07748d48d1ea3d1e627a1d474b136feae3ee9c9/1399_750_4199_2519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Made to a 70s template \u2026 The Upstart Crow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Made to a 70s template \u2026 The Upstart Crow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Viewers of 70s sitcoms may similarly have economically matured. But a major creative motivation is that TV sitcoms and stage comedies are close artistic siblings. Most scenes in the original shows were performed in big auditorium studios, in front of hundreds who had applied for tickets. Another recent TV-theatre transfer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/17/the-upstart-crow-review-gielgud-theatre-london\">The Upstart Crow</a>, though screened much more recently, was specifically made to a 70s live-audience template.</p> <p>\u201cThe rules of stage comedy,\u201d says Sams, \u201care very similar to those of sitcom, in terms of settings and numbers of characters.\u201d</p> <p>Although often assumed to be a canned laughter track, British studio audience laughter was usually real, though sometimes electronically enhanced. So, to maximise audible reaction, episodes were often structured like a stage farce. Some Mothers Do \u2019Ave \u2019Em, in which Michael Crawford played the accident-prone and unemployable Frank Spencer, specialised in spectacular stunts, with the character tumbling down stairs or his house falling down around him.</p> <p>As a result, Guy Unsworth, who adapted and directed the stage version, feels that he is bringing stage-farce conventions back home. \u201cI think the live studio audience was absolutely key because it gives these scripts a theatrical energy. TV is often shot very safely in many takes. But the stunts had a real sense of danger, because they were designed to make the studio audience gasp. So I was fascinated by doing those in theatre.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4ce98ee549fa6870b90c065763ac3cac3cb8af3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4ce98ee549fa6870b90c065763ac3cac3cb8af3/0_4_2025_1215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cat\u2019s whiskers \u2026 Felicity Kendal and Richard Briers in 70s favourite The Good Life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cat\u2019s whiskers \u2026 Felicity Kendal and Richard Briers in 70s favourite The Good Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The estates of the writers of The Good Life, John Esmonde and Bob Larbey, allowed Sams to use any material he wanted from the 30 broadcast episodes.</p> <p>\u201cI sat down to construct it as a play,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it seems to be in the DNA of sitcom that it falls into half-hour chunks. So I effectively now have four half-hour acts, with an interval after two, that lead into each other and form a single story.\u201d</p> <p>He has substantially redeployed three episodes from the series \u2013 including those in which Tom and Barbara first decide to go green, a baby pig is born and Margot sings in an amateur production of The Sound of Music \u2013 and shaped a storyline of his own around two dinner parties.</p> <p>In the case of Some Mothers Do \u2019Ave \u2019Em, the TV writer Raymond Allen, 80 this month, was available to be involved in the stage version, but chose not to be. \u201cHe was really keen on the idea,\u201d says Unsworth, \u201cbut didn\u2019t know how to make it work on stage. So he has been incredibly supportive but also trusted me to do it.\u201d</p> <p>From the 23 available episodes, Unsworth has framed a play around an episode in which Frank discovers that he is going to be a father, and a Christmas special in which the BBC comes to audition Frank for a TV talent show. At the performance I saw, the show was regularly stopped by laughter or applause at the crossed-purpose dialogue, a signature of the TV show, in which, for up to 15 minutes, some characters think \u201cit\u201d refers to one thing (often sex) while the rest of the cast and the audience are aware of the real definition. As when the local priest fears he is being told elaborate details of the night of the Spencer baby\u2019s conception, rather than an account of domestic renovations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ad87069ac6f362c3fbf246cfb78a3325afd147cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad87069ac6f362c3fbf246cfb78a3325afd147cf/0_81_1284_1843/697.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Ooh Betty\u2019 \u2026 Michael Crawford in Some Mothers Do \u2019Ave \u2019Em.\" width=\"697\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Ooh Betty\u2019 \u2026 Michael Crawford in Some Mothers Do \u2019Ave \u2019Em.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC Two</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI found the sequences of misunderstanding really interesting,\u201d says Unsworth. \u201cWhat a character falsely thinks \u2018it\u2019 to be can be really quite daring and out there, because the audience knows that the real explanation is completely innocent, so it somehow makes it OK.\u201d</p> <p>However, because TV peak-time of the past was significantly less sensitive to stereotype and offence than is contemporary culture, I was interested in how much of the source material had proved unspeakable now? Some Mothers, says Unsworth, didn\u2019t really have \u2019em. \u201cI went through every single episode, and maybe there are a couple of lines that might be a bit iffy now. But, considering that vintage of sitcom, and how really dodgy many of them are, Some Mothers exists in quite an innocent world.\u201d</p> <p>Sams was startled by the casual homophobia of The Good Life on TV: \u201cSomeone will cock a wrist to suggest that someone might be gay, in a way I have never seen any gay person do ever. And there is a tight-fisted restaurateur in one episode who can be seen as an offensive Jewish stereotype. That sort of stuff passed without notice in those days. It was part of the weather. So I\u2019ve cut those.\u201d</p> <p>In performance, a crucial question is whether the performers are giving their own interpretation of the character, or an impersonation of the original TV actor. In a recent one-off TV revival of Are You Being Served?, for example, no one seemed to have decided if the new cast was playing John Inman or his character Mr Humphries, Mollie Sugden or Mrs Slocombe.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have actually asked me, \u2018Who\u2019s playing Felicity Kendal?\u2019, or \u2018Who\u2019s playing Penelope Keith?,\u201d says Sams. \u201cIt can\u2019t be like that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/01/katherine-parkinson-felicity-kendal-wellies-the-good-life-the-it-crowd-actor\">Katherine Parkinson: \u2018Felicity Kendal\u2019s wellies are big ones to fill\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He has cast Katherine Parkinson as Barbara, with further casting to be announced soon. \u201cIn auditions, there were actors who didn\u2019t know the TV show, and so just treated it as the script for a new play. And that was fantastic. Because that\u2019s what I\u2019m aiming for.\u201d</p> <p>Unsworth says that he and his lead actor, Joe Pasquale, \u201cworked on that issue from the very beginning. Michael Crawford was absolutely amazing on screen. But I felt Joe had to be someone very different. I was saying all the time, \u2018Play him as a character.\u2019 If you are spending two hours with someone on stage, you have to believe in them as human beings. And an impression, however skilled, wouldn\u2019t be as good as the original.\u201d</p> <p>Raymond Allen has given the live Frank Spencer an active recommendation (\u201cHe\u2019s seen it 16 times,\u201d says Unsworth. \u201cHe\u2019s thrilled by it\u201d) and the Esmonde and Larbey estates have enthusiastically approved Sams\u2019 adaptation.</p> <p>Preparing his production, Sams is most exercised by staging the menagerie that the Goods assemble to achieve self-sufficiency. Will they be animatronic animals? \u201cI\u2019ve written a part for a goat, which is very important. At the moment, I\u2019m trying to work out how to do it without a real one. Partly because a goat ends up costing more than a performer, once you pay for the goat wrangler and the goat dressing room, and so on.\u201d</p>",

In the essay From Stones to Stars, which concludes her posthumously published and single poetry collection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/nov/25/bestbooksoftheyear.bestbooks\">A Responsibility to Awe</a>, Elson contrasted the discomforts of working in such a male-dominated environment with her pleasure in the openness and congeniality of Princeton\u2019s poetry community. But she went on to add a significant qualification, that \u201cthe discussions there were also a reminder that, although I loved the unlimited licence to invent, I also loved the sense of exploring not an inner, but an outer world, that was really there, in some objective sense\u201d. This week\u2019s poem seems to accommodate this dilemma, by working on a borderline between inventive \u201cpoetic\u201d figures and more objective description, while never fully letting go of the former.</p> <p>The opening lines are simple and striking. The speaker doesn\u2019t merely lie on her back to look up at the night sky, as any non-astronomer might do, but, childlike, she \u201ceats\u201d the stars. She goes on to tell us how she eats them: she sucks them, and finds the taste \u201cpepper hot and sharp\u201d. This is purposefully visceral and immediate, and a summons to the child star-lover in herself, a tuning-in to the old excitement before academia took over.</p> <p>She continues the \u201cnutrition\u201d metaphor with the word \u201cstir\u201d in the third stanza, but a change of approach is heralded as we\u2019re invited to follow her into the early universe: \u201cNo outer space, just space.\u201d And now poetic diction is reduced, the whole imaginative process more restrained. The biblical creation narrative is recalled, when <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&amp;version=KJV\">the earth was \u201cwithout form, and void\u201d</a> \u2013 yet the description, especially that of \u201cthe not yet stars\u201d, feels logical and objective.</p> <p>The alternative to stargazing and imagining, proposed in the fifth stanza, is \u201cTo lie down here on earth / Beside our long ancestral bones \u2026\u201d Because of the placing of the conjunction in the first line \u2013 \u201cAnd sometimes it\u2019s enough\u201d \u2013 the activity is subtly emphasised. It\u2019s at least as important as looking up at the stars to be aware of the horizontal neighbourhood, that of our \u201clong ancestral bones\u201d. The pun on \u201clong\u201d is beautifully judged here.</p> <p>Elson doesn\u2019t refute biological \u201cscience\u201d. Dead matter is transformed, but kept interestingly visible in the reference to \u201ccobble fields / Of our discarded skulls\u201d. It\u2019s an imaginative truce with fact, followed by speculation, and recourse to the soul-as-butterfly myth. Inevitably, the \u201cbright wings\u201d connect us to the \u201cbright mist\u201d in stanza four, as if a new creation might transpire from death.</p> <p>Antidotes to Fear of Death is undated, and may have been written before the poet was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the disease from which she died at the age of 39. It\u2019s the kind of intense engagement with death that an imaginative young writer might make, regardless of personal circumstance. As an act of generosity, like so much of Elson\u2019s work, it includes readers by its imaginative accessibility and universal theme. Although \u201cantidote\u201d is a strong word, the poem has some power to challenge the individual\u2019s fear of extinction with a wider, less egocentric focus on space and time. It lies just outside religious consolation, and just outside \u201cscientific\u201d detachment. Imagination is all we have to suggest alternative universes, a quality required for survival, for poetry, and for the hypotheses of science.</p> <p>A Responsibility to Awe was first published in 2001, and was reissued in 2018 as a <a href=\"https://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781784106553\">Carcanet Classic</a>.

Its hospitals are overflowing far beyond capacity. Military trucks are transporting dead bodies to cemeteries in the country. The grim truth is that the UK is two weeks behind Italy, following a similar trajectory, with <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/healtheqt/hospital-beds.htm\">significantly fewer hospital beds</a>.</p> <p>The British government has failed to properly digest the lessons from the countries which were infected before us.

Given the exponential rates at which this disease spreads, hospitals are on track to be decimated in a few weeks\u2019 time. Unnecessary deaths will happen because our hospitals are just too full.</p> <p>There is no doubt those in government are working incredibly hard, under immense strain, in unprecedented times. However, a picture is emerging that a combination of complacency and British exceptionalism may have cost lives which could have been saved if we acted more boldly. Despite what decision-makers may have thought, Britain is not naturally more resilient than Italy. Johnson should also have recognised the danger emerging in London by including its mayor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2020/mar/22/please-please-please-stop-mixing-sadiq-khan-urges-londoners-to-stay-home-video\">Sadiq Khan</a>, in the coronavirus Cobra meetings from the start. </p> <p>An examination of what went wrong in the UK government\u2019s management in the early stages of this crisis will come at a later date.

We must support everyone trying to make this happen \u2013 in the NHS, in universities and research centres, in manufacturing and distribution \u2013 to speed things up. Health workers must be prioritised for tests. Without doing so, we do not know how many staff are self-isolating unnecessarily when hospitals need them.</p> <p>An enforced lockdown in London, and other hotspots, will rightly discomfort anyone with even the faintest liberal disposition.

That meant Italy had missed many more cases than Australia, he said. </li> \n   <li><strong>Testing criteria in Australia will change in the next week</strong> as the number of overseas travellers drops dramatically, Kelly says. Testing has to date been focused on overseas travellers, but mandatory quarantine requirements and travel bans mean the number of travellers arriving had fallen significantly.</li> \n   <li><strong>Norman Swan </strong>suggested Australia was <strong>still missing asymptomatic cases of Covid-19</strong>, because it was not testing widely enough.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>We will leave our Australia-specific coverage of the coronavirus crisis there for tonight.

At all costs, we must prevent any Aboriginal deaths in custody from Covid-19. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Natsils also warned against blanket lockdowns or solitary confinement by prisons trying to manage a possible outbreak.

That means that if you contact Centrelink today about wanting to apply for unemployment benefits, but are unable to complete your application, <strong>you will be back paid from that first contact</strong>. (The government actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/13/coalition-warned-welfare-overhaul-could-worsen-poverty-and-unemployment\">abolished this in 2018 to save money</a>.)</p> \n  <p>Crucially, Robert said <strong>people starting a new Jobseeker Payment claim could verify their identity over the phone,</strong> rather than by submitting their documents at a Centrelink office. This change was slated for April and has apparently been brought forward.</p> \n  <p>That is, <strong>you do not need to go to a Centrelink office to complete your claim</strong>. In fact, Robert said there were fewer staff at the shopfronts due to social distancing rules.</p> \n  <p>This does not get around the fact that getting through over the phone to Centrelink can take hours, let alone at a time like this.</p> \n  <p>Robert also said he was extending Centrelink call centre opening hours to 8am to 8pm (NSW time). The government is hiring up to 5,000 new staff at Services Australia to cater with demand, but it remains to be seen how quickly these employees can start.</p> \n  <p>Now, onto the <strong>MyGov website</strong>. Robert said the website suffered a DDoS attack (when a website is flooded with hits, essentially a cyber attack) but wouldn\u2019t give any more details.</p> \n  <p>He said the government had MyGov\u2019s upgraded capacity by 10 times.

Many health groups and medical associations have been calling for increased support to roll out the technology more widely and rapidly.<br><br>The federal government<a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-national-health-plan-primary-care-bulk-billed-mbs-telehealth-services\"> introduced temporary Medicare Benefits Schedule and Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs items to allow doctors, nurses, midwives and mental health professionals to deliver services via telehealth</a>, provided those services are bulk billed, so that people in self-isolation or quarantine can get health care.<br><br><strong>This is a temporary six-month measure</strong>. People who meet the testing guidelines for Covid-19, people aged over 70, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged over 50, people with chronic health conditions or who are immunocompromised, and parents with new babies and people who are pregnant can access the bulk-billed Telehealth services.<br><br><strong>The thousands of doctors who have signed the letter say this is too restrictive.</strong><br><br>It comes \u201cwith special criteria that make it so ineffective it\u2019s practically useless,\u201d the letter says. \u201cDefining \u2018special groups\u2019 who are eligible for bulk-billed telehealth, leaving all others out in the cold - when normally all medical care attracts a rebate is simply un-Australian and tone deaf, especially when many of our community are losing their jobs and facing<br>financial hardship.<br><br>\u201cThe symptoms of coronavirus are identical to those of many other viruses. As the virus spreads in the community, it will be increasingly difficult to tell them all apart. By allowing telehealth access for all it will enable pre-emptive remote screening, without the risk of onward transmission.

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic is shutting down industrial activity and temporarily slashing air pollution levels around the world, satellite imagery from the European Space Agency shows.</p> \n<p>One expert said the sudden shift represented the \u201clargest scale experiment ever\u201d in terms of the reduction of industrial emissions.</p> \n<p>Readings from ESA\u2019s Sentinel-5P satellite show that over the past six weeks, levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over cities and industrial clusters in Asia and Europe were markedly lower than in the same period last year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/02/coronavirus-no2-article/china\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nitrogen dioxide is produced from car engines, power plants and other industrial processes and is thought to exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma.</p> \n<p>While not a greenhouse gas itself, the pollutant originates from the same activities and industrial sectors that are responsible for a large share of the world\u2019s carbon emissions and that drive global heating.</p> \n<p>Paul Monks, professor of air pollution at the University of Leicester, predicted there will be important lessons to learn. \u201cWe are now, inadvertently, conducting the largest-scale experiment ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we looking at what we might see in the future if we can move to a low-carbon economy? Not to denigrate the loss of life, but this might give us some hope from something terrible. To see what can be achieved.\u201d</p> \n<p>Monks, the former chair of the UK government\u2019s science advisory committee on air quality, said that a reduction in air pollution could bring some health benefits, though they were unlikely to offset loss of life from the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt seems entirely probable that a reduction in air pollution will be beneficial to people in susceptible categories, for example some asthma sufferers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could reduce the spread of disease. A high level of air pollution exacerbates viral uptake because it inflames and lowers immunity.\u201d Agriculture could also get a boost because pollution stunts plant growth, he added.</p> \n<p>The World Health Organization describes NO2 as \u201ca toxic gas which causes significant inflammation of the airways\u201d at concentrations above 200 micrograms per cubic metre. Pollution particles may also be a vector for pathogens, as well as exacerbating existing health problems. The WHO is now investigating whether airborne pollution particles may be a vector that spreads Covid-19 and makes it more virulent.</p> \n<p>One of the largest drops in pollution levels could be seen over the city of Wuhan, in central China, which was put under a strict lockdown in late January. The city of 11 million people serves as a major transportation hub and is home to hundreds of factories supplying car parts and other hardware to global supply chains. According to Nasa, nitrogen dioxide levels across eastern and central China have been 10-30% lower than normal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/02/coronavirus-no2-article/korea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>NO2 levels also dropped in South Korea, which has long struggled with high emissions from its large fleet of coal-fired power plants but also from nearby industrial facilities in China.</p> \n<p>The country has avoided putting entire regions under lockdown but is meticulously tracing and isolating suspected coronavirus cases.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/02/coronavirus-no2-article/italy\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The changes over northern Italy are particularly striking because smoke from a dense cluster of factories tends to get trapped against the Alps at the end of the Po Valley, making this one of western Europe\u2019s pollution hotspots.</p> \n<p>Since the country went into lockdown on 9 March, NO2 levels in Milan and other parts of northern Italy have fallen by about 40%. \u201cIt\u2019s quite unprecedented,\u201d said Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Service. \u201cIn the past, we have seen big variations for a day or so because of weather. But no signal on emissions that has lasted so long.\u201d</p> \n<p>The source is not yet clear. One possibility is a slowdown of activity in Italy\u2019s industrial heartland. Another factor is likely to be a reduction in road traffic, which accounts for the biggest share of nitrogen dioxide emissions in Europe.</p> \n<p>Peuch said satellites were now starting to pick up similar signals in other European cities that are entering into lockdowns, though the data needs to studied over over a longer period to confirm this is a pattern.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/02/coronavirus-no2-article/uk\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Although the UK is more than a week behind Italy in terms of the spread of the disease and the government\u2019s response, roadside monitors already show significantly reduced levels of pollution at hotspots such as Marylebone in London.</p> \n<p>Road traffic accounts for about 80% of nitrogen oxide emissions in the UK, according to Monk. For the average diesel car, each kilometre not driven avoids 52 milligrammes of the pollutant entering the air.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I think will come out of this is a realisation - because we are forced to - that there is considerable potential to change working practices and lifestyles.

  "<p>At first it was only elderly people. The narrative about coronavirus, fanned by the details of every sad death announced, was that the virus was mainly a concern for those over 70, or people with serious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/underlying-conditions-coronavirus-health\">underlying health conditions</a>. These were the groups initially urged to socially distance themselves.

Crucially, although the majority of younger people and children will develop symptoms little worse than flu, they could be invisible carriers of the virus \u2013 and play a key role in its spread.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you can\u2019t easily tell if someone has a cold or coronavirus, infection control is far more difficult</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Compared to other European countries, the UK was slow in closing schools \u2013 waiting until there had already been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">104 deaths due to coronavirus</a> to take action. Studies from China showed children were <a href=\"http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/fileCCDCW/journal/article/ccdcw/2020/8/PDF/COVID-19.pdf\">rarely diagnosed with novel coronavirus</a>, and therefore presumably had little role in the spread of the disease.</p> <p>But most of the diagnostic efforts in China, especially in the early phases of the outbreak, were heavily skewed towards hospital admissions. The majority of hospitalised cases <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130\">involved adult patients</a>. Did this mean that children and young people weren\u2019t infected, or merely that they suffered more mild symptoms, which were going undetected?</p> <p>Like many of my colleagues, I could see no obvious reason why children weren\u2019t being infected: this was a virus spread by the respiratory route, not through a process unique to adults. If significant numbers of children <em>were</em> infected and suffered very minor cold-like symptoms, then their potential to spread the virus was immense.</p> <p>One of the key differences between the novel coronavirus and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/experience-of-sars-key-factor-in-response-to-coronavirus\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/experience-of-sars-key-factor-in-response-to-coronavirus\">ars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/15/mers-next-global-pandemic\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/15/mers-next-global-pandemic\">ers</a> is that people with Covid-19 may have only mild symptoms \u2013 making it more difficult to detect. With Sars, most people infected quickly developed pneumonia. Identifying and isolating people with severe symptoms is a relatively easy task, and this made infection control through case identification and contact tracing comparatively easy.</p> <p>The current coronavirus is different. In more than 85% of confirmed cases symptoms can go undetected or be easily confused with the common cold of mild flu. Its biggest weapon \u2013 the thing that has, <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221\">according to one study</a>, allowed it to spread so easily \u2013 is this ability to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/06/hidden-coronavirus-cases-could-thwart-containment-efforts-experts-warn\">cause mild disease</a> in the majority of people it infects. When you can\u2019t easily tell if someone has a cold or coronavirus, case identification and infection control are far more difficult.</p> <p>Far from being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/what-we-know-about-coronavirus-so-far-and-how-it-can-affect-your-child\">uninfected by this virus</a>, children could in fact be its unseen carriers, important links in community transmission chains. But there\u2019s still an important piece of the jigsaw missing. While many of us suspect that children have a key role to play in this outbreak, hard evidence to support this belief is still lacking.</p> <p>In perhaps the largest <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2020/03/16/peds.2020-0702.full.pdf\">study</a> of its type, Chinese researchers examined infection outcomes in more than 2,000 confirmed or suspected childhood cases of Covid-19. Just over half of the children had mild cold-like symptoms, or no symptoms at all.</p> <p>Severe and critical diseases, where body oxygen levels are low and various organs are under threat, were seen in around 5% of the children studied, with the youngest (under one year old) most at risk. There are still significant gaps in this analysis. Importantly, most of these were suspected rather than confirmed Covid-19 cases. But this study does at least reaffirm that most infections in children are mild.</p> <p>Judging from past pandemics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-schools-to-be-closed-indefinitely-and-exams-cancelled\">school closures</a> can be an effective way to reduce the spread of a virus \u2013 particularly when they form part of a larger programme of social distancing measures. Every school day, children congregate en masse, often in close proximity, and then return home, taking with them any new infection they\u2019ve picked up. Intuitively, reducing this cycle should help slow the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/covid-19-activists-helping-elderly-vulnerable-people-political\">The fight against Covid-19 is being waged street by street | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By assuming that the young and healthy weren\u2019t at risk, the UK government may have underestimated the effects of coronavirus. Indeed, reports of hospital admissions show that even among younger people this is a virus that can cause serious disease. A <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_w\">study</a> from the US shows that 38% of 508 patients hospitalised with coronavirus were aged between 20 and 54 (children under 19 accounted for less than 1% of the total admissions). Of these 508 patients, 121 were admitted to intensive care; nearly half of this group was under 65.</p> <p>As with most things in this pandemic, the idea that coronavirus only threatens older people is an oversimplification. Younger people and children are less likely to die from coronavirus, but their mild symptoms could make them contagious carriers of the virus \u2013 and they are more difficult to spot.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Ball is professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham</p>",

But, he stressed, it would probably still take six months for it to be developed, ramped up, and tested on the population.</p> <p>Meanwhile a vaccine might not be ready for 18 months, given it will have to go through the necessary safety trials.</p> <p>\u201cWe still have very little understanding of how prevalent Covid-19 is in the population,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it may be that when we do have those tests, we\u2019ll find out that, actually, there are huge numbers of people who have been exposed and have been asymptomatic and they are immune. That could be a game changer. But we just don\u2019t know at this point. And it would be very reckless to assume that everything is going to go right after that.\u201d</p> <p>Even if football returns behind closed doors \u2013 the best\u2011case scenario \u2013 there are obvious issues. If a single player tests positive for the virus then their whole squad will have to self-isolate for a fortnight, elongating the season further. And having ambulances at matches will be seen as hugely irresponsible if the NHS is still under severe strain. As the scientist put it: \u201cWe are in a very bad place. And we haven\u2019t even spoken about the impact on the economy. Potentially you\u2019ve got people not being able to afford to go to football matches.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed as the crisis grows I wonder if our top clubs will start feeling a responsibility to help those lower down the food chain. If the Premier League clubs can fork out \u00a3250,000 each for Richard Scudamore\u2019s \u00a35m golden goodbye then surely they can find a pot of money to help lower league clubs.</p> <p>More top players should also thinking about giving back. Every fan feels that they have a symbiotic relationship with their club; and without supporters paying for Sky Sports subscriptions and season tickets players\u2019 salaries would be nowhere near as astronomical.</p> <p>Maybe before posting videos on social media from their lavishly decorated houses more players could put their hands in their pockets? It\u2019s not as if they can\u2019t afford it. According to the recent Global Salary Survey, the average basic pay for a Premier League first-team squad member is \u00a361,024 a week \u2013 and that is before appearance fees, bonuses and any benefits. That\u2019s a cumulative \u00a330m a week in basic wages for the Premier League teams\u2019 25-man squads. Imagine the difference if every player offered to give up one week\u2019s pay to charity? True, over the weekend Manchester United and Manchester City players donated a combined \u00a3100,000 to help food banks. That news was welcome, but it was still a drop in the ocean.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/21/usa-track-and-field-tokyo-olympics-postponed\">USA Track and Field joins swimming in calling for Olympics postponement</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At least on Sunday the International Olympic Committee acknowledged for the first time that the Tokyo Games could be delayed. The IOC has set itself a four-week deadline to decide. But given the widespread restrictions on public gatherings and closed training facilities are making it impossible for many athletes to prepare, Tokyo 2020 will surely morph into Tokyo 2021. Even if the virus has subsided in Japan come the summer, it will almost certainly linger in other countries. Would it really be wise to allow 10,000 athletes and close to a million spectators to fly in from across the globe?</p> <p>The expert repeatedly emphasised how uncertain the future looks. There could be a second or third wave of the virus. It could mutate into something worse. However, when I asked him whether there was any chance that this season\u2019s Premier League and Champions League might be finished soon, or the Olympics could take place as planned, he was absolutely clear. \u201cI think it\u2019s delusional to think it\u2019s going to happen. If people are saying that they\u2019ve got absolutely no idea about what\u2019s about to hit them.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>After a bumpy start, this year\u2019s Drag Race is swiftly proving to be a divisive season. And you know what, I love it. Viewers may claim to hate divisiveness and controversy, but much like Peter Andre circa 2004, Blake Lively\u2019s hair, Kit-Kat Chunkies, Rishi Sunak, and kebab flavoured crisps (available at obscure Turkish corner shops everywhere) we all secretly crave it. But that\u2019s a self-isolation confessional for another time.</p> <p>So as Nicky would say \u2013 vous \u00eates pr\u00eat? (Get that girl a sponsorship deal \u2013 we can see it now, Nicky Doll in a sleek red and white number, storming out of Pret with an egg &amp; cress sandwich dribbling down her chin, screaming \u201cVOUS ETES PRET?\u201d at passers by).</p> <p>It begins with the Sherry Pie statement AGAIN. They really are going to show it every single episode. For a loooooong time. Is this a good idea? Will the show suffer if viewers are constantly reminded it was fairly heavily built around a contestant with the moral capacity of a stockpiling stoat? Side bar: We have it on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/race-chaser-with-alaska-willam/id1408740329\">good authority</a> that the show has in fact done a swift re-edit of this season to bury the Pie (is that a euphemism? It sounds like one. If it wasn\u2019t before, it is now). Sherry only appeared in the interview room clips ONCE in episode three, and yet won the main challenge. Wild!</p> <p>Jaida touches on \u201cmixed emotions\u201d while simultaneously looking utterly, confidently emotionless. Aiden rightly brings up the fact that she chose her team well in the last episode. Brita is being arrogant and abrasive again. We thought we loved Brita in episode 1 but now we\u2019re \u2026 not so sure.</p> <h2>Bee-Yonce</h2> <p>This week\u2019s minichallenge involves getting into \u201cbee drag\u201d and doing a dance called \u201cthe beehive jive\u201d to raise awareness for the planet\u2019s declining bee population.

The producers have got those fridge magnets out again!</p> <p>This is great though. They\u2019ve clearly clocked that the best bit of the show by far is the runway. Also interesting that the third look has to be designed and built from scratch. Like the good old days! We can\u2019t wait for Heidi\u2019s. Gigi is worried that Nicky \u201chas her concept together\u201d. That\u2019s the thing with concepts, Gigi! They have a nasty habit of coming together! Brita also has a concept, but doesn\u2019t know how to bring it together. Concepts, concepts, concepts.</p> <p>Rock M Sakura performs an incredible cosplay trick, crafting a cast of her body from duct tape, which she then uses as the base of her outfit. Brita says she\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d and that it looks like \u201ca science fair project gone wrong\u201d.

  "<p>It is high season on Espadilla beach in Costa Rica\u2019s Manuel Antonio national park. Normally, spring breakers, honeymooners and retirees from around the world would be jostling for space on the pristine white sands overlooked by rainforest-covered hills.</p> <p>But Costa Rica closed all its beaches on Friday to help contain the spread of the coronavirus. Locals tell of mass sackings and the cancellation of thousands of hotel reservations. The shorefront is blocked off with yellow hazard tape and the vultures that linger on the beach each morning seem increasingly ominous.</p> <p>The coronavirus outbreak has paralysed the global tourism industry, leaving thousands of travellers scrambling to return home and devastating economies that depend on visitors.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Deaths approach 15,000 globally</h2> <p>Coronavirus-related deaths worldwide are approaching 15,000, Johns Hopkins University reports, with the current toll at 14,706. Confirmed cases of Covid-15 reached 339,259 on Monday, with the number of recoveries currently amounting to just under a third of these, at 98,834. New York state accounts for 5% of confirmed global cases, and half of US cases.</p> <h2>Wuhan\u2019s residents start to emerge from crisis</h2> <p>Residents living in the city of 11 million people at the heart of the virus outbreak have been allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/wuhan-eases-coronavirus-lockdown-as-restrictions-intensify-outside-china\">leave their residential compounds in small groups for the first time</a> in weeks. Public transport is resuming and people are being allowed to return to work if the are certified healthy. Non-residents, stranded there since stringent travel restrictions went into effect on 23 January, can also begin applying to leave the city. China reported 39 fresh virus cases from Sunday, all imported from overseas.</p> <h2>America falls silent as Trump defends virus response</h2> <p>By the end of Sunday, nearly one in three Americans were under orders to stay home as Ohio, Louisiana and Delaware became the latest states to enact broad restrictions and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/new-york-coronavirus-cases-worldwide-covid19\">shutdown of non-essential services began in New York</a>. On Sunday, Donald Trump said he had released funds to activate the National Guard in New York, California and Washington state \u2013 three of the states hardest hit by Covid-19 \u2013 and ordered the set-up for \u201clarge medical stations\u201d in those states. The president sought to defend against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/trump-coronavirus-response-criticism-us-cases\">claims of a sluggish federal response</a> to the crisis as the death toll in the US rose to 417, with more than 33,000 cases.</p> <h2>New Zealand prepares for lockdown</h2> <p>Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has announced the entire country should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/kiwis-go-home-new-zealand-to-go-into-month-long-lockdown-to-fight-coronavirus\">prepare for at least four weeks of self isolation</a> from Wednesday.

Ardern said: \u201cThe worst-case scenario is simply intolerable, it would represent the greatest loss of New Zealanders\u2019 lives in our history and I will not take that chance.\u201d</p> <h2>Tokyo Olympics in doubt</h2> <p>Canada has said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/tokyo-2020-olympics-in-doubt-as-canada-becomes-first-team-to-pull-out-over-coronavirus\">will not send athletes to Tokyo Olympics</a> in July, calling for a postponement as a matte of public health rather than athlete health. New Zealand said it would consider boycotting the Games, too, and Australia told its athletes to prepare for the games to be held in 2021 instead. It follows remarks by Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, on Monday that postponement could be an option.</p> <h2>Weinstein infected</h2> <p>Harvey Weinstein has tested positive for coronavirus, according to the head of the New York corrections officers union. Weinstein, 68, has been placed in isolation at Wende correctional facility, said Michael Powers, president of the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association. The former movie producer, who is serving a prison sentence for sexual assault and rape, has tested positive for Covid-19.</p> <h2>Germany, and Merkel, isolate</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/merkel-quarantined-as-doctor-who-vaccinated-her-tests-positive\">Angela Merkel has gone into quarantine</a> after a doctor who gave her a vaccine tested positive for coronavirus.

With few means of medical intervention, and several other risk factors such as malnutrition, high population densities, communal living and lack of access to water and washing facilities, the rates of mortality could dwarf what has been seen so far in the west. And economically, the virus risks ushering in an ice age.

The poor, the uninsured, the disenfranchised, the information-poor and the less mobile are sitting ducks. Many western economies, including the US and the UK, have slowly pushed these people to the margins, while restricting employment benefits such as holiday pay, sick leave, and private insurance to an increasingly exclusive class. One of the reasons the British and US governments have been so slow to provide free testing, medical care and bailouts for those who\u2019ve lost work is that these inequalities are now hardwired into the system. They cannot be undone overnight even when lives depend on it.</p> <p>The global economy is set up in much the same way, with winners who hoard the spoils, and losers who scratch around for the leftovers. If wealthy single countries cannot scramble to save their own people, there is no hope for any effort to extend help to countries with a fraction of the resources.</p> <p>But here is the tragic catch for those who think that this structural imbalance is not our problem. In this instance, national and international inequalities cannot persist without everyone losing. The realisation is just beginning to dawn upon lawmakers that the rich cannot be barricaded against the poor, no matter how high the barriers to the fortress are. Limiting the spread of the virus entails ensuring that everyone in the pool, be it local or global, is given the ability to test, self-isolate if need be, and receive treatment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-exposes-society-fragility-find-solutions-that-will-endure\">Coronavirus exposes society\u2019s fragility.

Albanese is strongly of the view that Morrison has, throughout this coronavirus crisis, been a day late and a dollar short.</p> <p>But those arguments, or at least the full-throated version of them, can wait for a safer place in the future. Question time on Monday was emblematic of that conversation, that interrogation, that rebuttal, both present and deferred.</p> <p>\u201cToday we feel the weight of our nation\u2019s need,\u201d Albanese told the chamber on Monday. \u201cNever has our duty been so urgent.</p> <p>\u201cI lead a Labor team determined to be constructive and Labor stands ready to play our role. We want to help the government to get it right and this parliament to get it right.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When Melbourne musician Angie McMahon launched into her live cover of Lana Del Rey\u2019s Born To Die \u2013 filming herself on her home piano on Saturday night \u2013 the comments underneath lit up with that <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/love-death-and-begging-for-celebrities-to-kill-you\">brand of fandom hyperbole</a> that expresses joy as a death wish.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d said one. \u201cWe are all dead,\u201d said another. \u201cCall an ambulance,\u201d said a third, before Sydney artist Alex the Astronaut chimed in: \u201cEveryone stop it plz stay alive.\u201d</p> <p>At a live gig, McMahon\u2019s voice can electrify a room. But on Instagram this weekend \u2013 her hair a messy plait down one side of a crinkled T-shirt, phone camera propped on top of her upright, her face cropped so closely it felt like Facetiming a friend \u2013 the performance felt personal, and even more intense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/20/livestreaming-schedule-music-art-literature-and-events-from-australia-and-beyond\">Livestreaming schedule: music, art, literature and events from Australia and beyond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than 2,000 people had tuned in to watch her set; 2,000 people who had mostly been inside for at least a week now, following a global catastrophe as it unfolded in a scroll of increasingly frightening headlines on our phones.</p> <p>These last few days had been particularly bad. Confined to our homes with all plans cancelled, borders closed and services stalled, there was little else to distract us from an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/22/the-coronavirus-story-is-unfathomably-large-we-must-get-the-reporting-right\">unfathomable crisis</a> that was getting more dystopic by the day.</p> <p>But for those who tuned in to Isolaid this weekend \u2013 a two day Australian music festival which ran via Instagram\u2019s live story feature \u2013 there was solace to be found. We were all there in the same place, going through the same thing, despite being alone. I didn\u2019t expect to be so caught up in it. I didn\u2019t expect to feel such relief.</p> <p>Organised by Emily Ulman, Rhiannon Atkinson-Howatt (Merpire) and Shannen Egan to raise funds and awareness for industry non-profit Support Act, Isolaid featured 74 acts playing 20-minute sets, livestreaming from their bedrooms, their home farms, the bedraggled living rooms of their inner-city share houses. After each set, the performer would throw to the next \u2013 and we would scrabble for the right account to tune into.</p> <p>Most artists pulled a crowd of around 4-600, including a bunch of other musicians, managers, label folk and promoters who were lighting up the comments with love hearts and applause emojis. The live performance industry was one of the first to be decimated by coronavirus: according to the user-generated data compiled by <a href=\"https://ilostmygig.net.au/\">I Lost My Gig</a>, cancelled gigs have cost them more than $280m already.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-leaves-roadies-and-events-crew-devastated-its-the-first-industry-to-stop-dead\">Coronavirus leaves roadies and events crew devastated: 'It's the first industry to stop dead'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why Isolaid felt like the first laugh after a big cry. The energy was fun, hilarious and occasionally chaotic. Musicians stopped songs to read the comments, and brought dogs in to distract us while they tuned. Denise Le Menice gave a brilliant set from WA, filling in for Moaning Lisa who had to cancel last-minute. \u201cThanks for clapping \u2013 not that I can hear!\u201d she laughed manically, before trying to auction off a signed roll of toilet paper for $20, drink in hand. \u201cCheers to the coronavirus, you little fucking dickhead!\u201d</p> <p>Just like at every other music festival, I ran into friends, discovered a bunch of new bands, saved the schedule as my screen lock and got FOMO each time I had to miss a set. Unlike every other music festival, I was wearing pyjamas and eating from crockery. I propped my screen up on the kitchen counter to watch a few sets as I cooked a salmon steak. Each performance was ephemeral, one-time-only; Instagram stories delete themselves after 24 hours. \u201cTake care of each other,\u201d musicians told us, over and over again. \u201cStay home. Stay away from people. Stay sane.\u201d</p> <p>And they were there for each other too. \u201cI\u2019m so nervous,\u201d said Eilish Gilligan, before premiering a yet-to-be-recorded song written with Japanese Wallpaper and Alex Lahey.</p> <p>\u201cOMG YES EILISH,\u201d wrote Lahey in the comments. \u201c10/10,\u201d commented Ball Park Music. \u201cWe stan Eilish more than anything else in this whole world,\u201d said Cry Club.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the most connected I have felt in many, many days,\u201d McMahon told us from her living room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43f98da7f78cfa8c385afc032de8f0c2c048028f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43f98da7f78cfa8c385afc032de8f0c2c048028f/0_561_828_630/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hannah Blackburn invited her band in through the window.\" width=\"500\" height=\"380\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah Blackburn invited her band in through the window.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each \u201cstage\u201d was set differently. Hannah Blackburn played alone in her bedroom before inviting her band in: David Western came in via a ladder through the window, carrying three beers and a banjo and followed by drummer Jess Ellwood, who was handed a jar full of cash to use as percussion.</p> <p>Grace Turner\u2019s floor was strewn with roses and moodily dappled with vintage lamps; Alice Skye moved her camera from a Casio in the grass on her family farm to the upright in her living room. Zoe Fox\u2019s hysterical set, filmed by Melbourne artist Didirri, featured costumed extras and Instagram filters that turned her into a surprise pickle. It ended with a cross to the next artist, Ro, who performed from the next room \u2013 before another cross to Didirri\u2019s set. His cover of Times They Are a Changin\u2019 was both impossibly hokey and weirdly perfect. This share house was having the best time.</p> <p>Liv Cartledge, Clews and June Jones gave us lo-fi sets with stunning vocals; Lupa J and Harvey Sutherland made big parties in home studios; Rat Hammock and Good Morning had full bands, sensibly spaced out. Housemates applauded in the background. There were a great many dogs. Emma Russack\u2019s mum played piano behind her, and Cry Club offered a stripped back version of their social distance anthem: Don\u2019t Fucking Touch Me.</p> <p>On Sunday night Julia Jacklin sang the most prescient lines of the weekend: \u201cYou\u2019ll go outside, enjoy the sun / soon you\u2019ll feel fine to see everyone\u201d (Comfort); \u201cYou can love somebody without using your hands\u201d (Head Alone); and, \u201cI know I\u2019ve locked myself in my room / I\u2019ll open up the door and try to love again soon\u201d (Pressure to Party). Her set was watched by more than 2,700.</p> <p>Around the same number had tuned into Stella Donnelly the night before. Donnelly is staying with her partner and his dad and dog, away from her own family in Western Australia, whose borders have just closed. \u201cMy mum\u2019s still a punk, and you\u2019re still shit,\u201d she drawled in a verse from Seasons Greeting \u2013 before breaking from the song to speak directly to the camera: \u201cMiss you, Mum.\u201d</p> <p>According to the organisers, the festival raised $12,000 for Support Act \u2013 and they\u2019re booking a follow-up for next weekend already. As musicians keep searching for a way to make money from performing for us online, initiatives like this could help the industry in other ways \u2013 and give the rest of us what we need too: music, joy and company in an isolated time.</p>",

Altogether 124 have been hospitalised with 34 requiring intensive care - double the figure over that released yesterday. Most of those who have contracted the virus are in Athens. The average age of those hospitalised is 64. <br><br>Greece was among the first EU member states to announce draconian measures to stem the virus, starting with the closure of schools on March 10, followed by the shutting of nightclubs, gyms, cinemas and theatres two days later and cafes, restaurants, bars and shopping malls on March 13. All retail shops were ordered closed on March 18. In his address, Mitsotakis thanked the vast majority of Greeks for upholding the restrictions, chastising the \u201cfrivolous few [who] undermine the safety of most.\u201d </p> <p>Greeks could be seen in droves converging on beaches on Saturday to enjoy the warm weather. A mass exodus of residents from Athens and other urban centres to villages in the countryside has also alarmed authorities who fear transmission rates spreading to remote areas nationwide. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T17:58:13.354Z\">at 5.58pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e779cd58f08a08573fbf623\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T17:15:03.890Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our UK focussed coronavirus blog is reporting on Boris Johnson\u2019s daily press conference which is currently happening.

A mass exodus of Greeks from Athens, and other urban areas, to villages in the countryside has also caused consternation.

Speaking on the occasion of the New Year and Eid al-Mab\u2019ath, the 80-year-old said \u201cyou Americans are accused of engineering coronavirus\u201d, adding: \u201cI do not know how true this claim is, but as long as the accusation stands, which sensible person would trust you to accept your offer of help.</p> <p>\u201cPossibly your (offered) medicine is a way to spread the virus more,\u201d he said. \u201cOr if you send therapists and doctors, maybe so they want to see the effect of the poison in Iranian society, so they can complete their information. It is said that part of the virus was produced against the Iranian people.\u201d</p> <p>His tone contradicted that of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who had the day before sent a heartfelt plea to the American public to set aside their differences with Iran and work together to fight the virus, including by the US suspending economic sanctions on Iran.</p> <p>The supreme leader was immediately challenged by Iranian reformist politicians such as Mahmoud Sadeghi to produce evidence to back his claim.</p> <p>Khamenei\u2019s controversial belief in an American biological conspiracy came as the Iranian health ministry said the new infections in Iran in the past 24 hours had reached 1,865, with a further 129 deaths. The official figures show the number of deaths by day stabilising.</p> <p>The total number of infected people had reached 21,638. The health ministry spokesman said 7,913 people had recovered.</p> <p>The official figures have been widely challenged on the basis that the recording of the number of deaths includes only those who died after being tested for the disease. The World Health Organization has said the figure may be only a fifth of the true number who have died. The official death toll shows no obvious pattern since for the last three days it has risen only from 220 to 240, yet the infections are rising.</p> <p>Iran also continued to send out contradictory messages about whether it could overcome the virus without sanctions being lifted. The letter from the president underlined the need for US sanctions being lifted. Khamenei has insisted the country can survive independently.</p> <p>The US state department hit back at claims it was preventing medicines reaching Iran, saying: \u201cDear Iranians, as your government will not tell you the truth, we say: on March 2, Iran, which instead of acting like any normal government around the world, refuses to make your economic system transparent. The reason the regime is hiding its economy is because it is corrupt.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In Tehran province the deputy mayor, Hamid Reza Goudarzi, after weeks of controversy has announced that all shops but essential food shops and pharmacies must close, and those that refuse to abide by the instructions will be punished.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund has still not responded to an Iranian request for a $5bn loan to help fight the virus.</p> <p>Qom News, an agency covering Qom, one of the centres of the disease, reported on Sunday: \u201cIn every house black cloth hangs from the walls of houses and the sound of crying in mourning houses resounds.

If Southwell were chosen, for example, it could take 110 horses in its stables and benefit from another 35 potential runners at Scott Dixon\u2019s base within walking distance. That would avoid the need for runners to be driven long distances to the track from training centres around the country and so there would be no breach of the government\u2019s advice against unnecessary travel.</p> \n<p>Dixon has made arrangements to keep his stable functioning and his horses cared for during the crisis. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six staff living on the site now,\u201d the trainer said on Sunday, \u201cand strict procedures are in place, trying to keep everyone healthy. We\u2019re doing a group shop for everybody to reduce the need for anyone to go out and obviously we keep doling out the hand sanitiser.\u201d<br><br>Meanwhile, Saturday\u2019s Dubai World Cup has become the latest sporting event to be lost due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers having accepted on Sunday that the sensationally valuable night\u2019s racing could not be staged. The event, with a total prize fund of around \u00a330m, had been due to be held behind closed doors at Meydan and was scheduled to be part of a packed 11-race broadcast on ITV4.<br><br>Only one day earlier, officials were insisting World Cup night would go ahead, despite other sporting fixtures in the UAE having been suspended on Thursday. But a statement was issued at lunchtime on Sunday, saying: \u201cTo safeguard the health of all participants, the higher organising committee of the Dubai World Cup 2020 has decided to postpone 25th edition of the global tournament to next year.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"45916529-e7f8-4856-856a-b082661a24b5\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Naas</b><br><b>2.00</b> Poetic Flare <b>2.30</b> Knight Of Malta <b>3.00</b> Dark Vader <b>3.30</b> Elusive King <b>4.00</b> Sir Dragonet <b>4.30</b> Even So (nb) <b>5.00</b> Russian Emperor (nap)</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Benbatl, a winner at Newmarket last autumn, had been the 2-1 favourite for the World Cup, in which he was expected to clash with the US-based Pegasus World Cup winner, Mucho Gusto. Those lined up for other valuable races on the card included the Melbourne Cup winner, Cross Counter. Most of the visiting runners were reported to have arrived in Dubai by the end of last week.</p> \n<h2>Monday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>What fun, in our reduced circumstances, to be allowed to play a round of that great springtime game, How Far Forward Is Aidan O\u2019Brien? The dominant Flat trainer quite often makes a steady start to the year, while continuing to win some prizes by sheer weight of ammunition, so how will it be today when Flat racing on turf returns at Naas?</p> \n<p>The opener is a two-year-old maiden in which, of course, O\u2019Brien has the favourite. But, as the Racing Post points out, he hasn\u2019t won this race since 2004 and the breeding of his runner today, Lipizzaner, does not suggest a penchant for soft ground. <strong>Poetic Flare (2.00)</strong>, from the Jim Bolger yard that has often done well on opening day, is down to 5-2, which is just about OK.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Brien may have more luck through<strong> Sir Dragonet (4.00)</strong> and <strong>Russian Emperor (5.00)</strong>. This ought to be a big year for Sir Dragonet, who memorably hosed up in the Chester Vase, showing an aptitude for this kind of ground, and was beaten less than a length in the Derby. He even ran well on quick ground in the Leger. Odds of 8-13 don\u2019t thrill, given that we can\u2019t be sure how ready he is, but the unexposed Brogue requires more of a leap of faith.</p> \n<p>Russian Emperor is 6-5 for the maiden at the end of the card. He was an eye-catcher on his only start so far, when third to a more fancied stablemate in July, and could take a major step forward here.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewNJHawkins/status/1152577086927724545\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Check out Atlantic Jewel's son Russian Emperor finishing third on debut in a 2yo maiden over 1400m at the Curragh tonight.
