  "<p>For Zia Wassan there is the devastating grief of losing his father - his protector and anchor in life. But underneath that grief, that sense of undeniable loss, there is something else \u2013 a feeling that things could have turned out differently.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad went before his time, he shouldn\u2019t have died,\u201d says the 35-year-old. Zia\u2019s father, Choudhary Aslam Wassan, 67, a popular and charismatic former food business pioneer and political campaigner from Birmingham, died from coronavirus last month. His son says the disease has also claimed the lives of at least 10 of his father\u2019s friends \u2013 middle-aged Asian men with underlying health conditions \u2013 in recent weeks.</p> <p>These men are among thousands of people of BAME backgrounds who find themselves at the forefront of a disturbing statistic. They are over-represented in the Covid-19 death toll by 27%. This means that for every four fatalities you would expect to see among BAME people an additional Covid-19 related fatality has occurred. Of patients who died in hospital up to 19 April, 19% were BAME, while these groups make up only 15% of the general population in England.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/bame-covid-19-deaths-demand-a-broader-inquiry\">BAME Covid-19 deaths demand a broader inquiry | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Zia, this statistic and the untimely deaths of his father and his friends are not only shocking but require in-depth investigation. He says there is a distinct feeling of vulnerability in communities like his \u2013 inner-city, historically impoverished areas with high levels of health issues, and more needs to be done within these communities to stop the transmission and subsequent deaths from the disease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5693a5064e4d3b7167eafa9800f61f696f4cb008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5693a5064e4d3b7167eafa9800f61f696f4cb008/0_367_739_922/401.jpg\" alt=\"The Wassan family\u2019s death notice for Choudhary Aslam.

We 100% need answers. This is not adding up - why are so many Asian men dying. It is not normal. There is something behind this and it\u2019s my strong view that it needs to be investigated,\u201d he says.</p> <p> \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense. We need to know why they are not coming back from hospital. My dad definitely went before his time and I\u2019d say a good 10 of his friends have all died in a similar way. They had underlying health problems, got a fever, ended up in hospital and then didn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p> <p> Wassan, a great-grandfather, first started displaying symptoms of the disease on 20 March. Before lockdown he had been travelling around the country, including attending a funeral.</p> <p>\u201cHe first just got a cough and was told to self-isolate. He was in good health but was a type-2 diabetic so we were hoping he would be given antibiotics, but the GP decided not to,\u201d said Zia. He said that although antibiotics are not considered effective treatment for Covid-19, other family members displaying symptoms who had received them had survived.</p> <p>\u201cHe carried on following the rules but then his cough started to get worse and he had a fever. He was worse and then we called an ambulance. Within two hours of getting to hospital they had taken him away to intensive care. Nobody could see him or be with him.</p> <p>\u201cThen later, he phoned me and said he was being told that he wasn\u2019t getting better and they would need to put him to sleep and on to a ventilator \u2013 that\u2019s the last time I spoke with him. He told me to look after my mum and the family: \u2018Take care of yourself, and I will see you in three days,\u2019 but that was the end.\u201d </p> <p>Wassan would never return to his home in the Handsworth area of Birmingham. His ventilator was switched off after he showed no signs of recovering. He died in the City hospital on 29 March.</p> <p>Zia\u2019s mother, Tanvir, was herself briefly hospitalised with symptoms of the virus, while other members of the family have also been ill. They are all now recovering at home with Zia currently in self-isolation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f25bef5ab5c582a9db9d8671eeed4e48a8bdf18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f25bef5ab5c582a9db9d8671eeed4e48a8bdf18/147_412_572_714/401.jpg\" alt=\"A mourner attends Choudhary Aslam Wassan\u2019s grave.\" width=\"401\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mourner attends Choudhary Aslam Wassan\u2019s grave.

I don\u2019t understand this because he was in a high-risk category. This must be happening to lots of other Asian families too. They need to be treated with more care if it is emerging that they are at higher risk, surely.\u201d</p> <p>The Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood, who had known Wassan for around 30 years, backed calls for an investigation into the disproportionate number of deaths in BAME communities. Mahmood, who has previously said older Muslim and Sikh people in the area were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/sharp-rise-in-number-of-coronavirus-cases-in-west-midlands\">struggling to adhere to government guidelines</a> surrounding physical distancing, said some communities would bear the brunt of the disease.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are seeing play out here is the result of years of austerity cuts within NHS services in these poor, deprived areas like Handsworth and Lozells. Where historically these communities have not been supported and which has now made them devastatingly vulnerable to this disease. It is an absolute disaster, we need to protect these people,\u201d he added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3c3165f98e7945eac0bb987f7f4ba38c6fe32e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3c3165f98e7945eac0bb987f7f4ba38c6fe32e3/49_355_625_780/401.jpg\" alt=\"Choudhary Aslam Wassan and his young family after he moved to Birmingham from Pakistan aged 21 in the 1970s.\" width=\"401\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Choudhary Aslam Wassan and his young family after he moved to Birmingham from Pakistan aged 21 in the 1970s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wassan, came to Birmingham from Pakistan in the 1970s, aged 21, with his brother Ashraf Wassan, and devoted his life to the city.

  "<p>Finally. Someone with actual power and clout prepared to stand up to the despotic thugs of Saudi Arabia, and lobby the Premier League to block the proposed takeover of the cherished community institution Newcastle United. But wait. Who are these mysterious philanthropists, these heroic knights of human rights? Angels of justice, reveal yourselves at once! Oh. Hello there, Qatar. Right. That\u2019s a bit awkward.</p> <p>Still: any port in a storm, as they say. And the news that the most significant opposition to the purchase of Newcastle comes not from the Premier League or from Newcastle fans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/bein-sports-asks-premier-league-to-block-saudi-newcastle-deal-over-piracy\" title=\"\">but from beIN Sports</a>, the home of Richard Keys and Andy Gray and in effect the media arm of the Qatari government, should at the very least offer us pause for thought. These are disorienting times, and so perhaps it\u2019s only to be expected that a few unholy alliances are going to be formed along the way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/government-not-set-to-intervene-in-saudi-led-newcastle-takeover-football\">Government unlikely to block Saudi-led Newcastle United takeover</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just take Keys himself as an example, who on his beIN show this week has been gravely opining on the proposed Saudi takeover of Newcastle, opposing it on \u2013 wait for it \u2013 ethical grounds. \u201cIf you are a host country, then I think you have a right to say: look, here are the rules,\u201d Keys said, still somehow managing to avoid making eye contact with the elephant stampeding through the studio. \u201cAre we to look away and forget everything?\u201d</p> <p>You know your takeover is going through a rough patch when Richard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/26/andy-gray-richard-keys\" title=\"\">\u201cDid you smash it?\u201d</a> Keys is lecturing you on moral rectitude. When you run an absolute monarchy, you\u2019re probably not overly accustomed to dissent, and certainly not from a former TV-AM presenter who looks like he smells faintly of the inside of a Rover 800.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that Qatar\u2019s objections to the Newcastle takeover do not rely on this same rock-solid logic. The letter that beIN has sent to all 20 Premier League teams, as well as its chief executive, Richard Masters, wisely steers clear of morality altogether, which is probably just as well given the mere mention of the word would probably have sent most chief executives hunting for a dictionary. No, if the first rule of writing is to speak your reader\u2019s language, then beIN has pitched its perfectly: underlining the grave threat posed by Saudi Arabia to the league\u2019s broadcast revenue streams.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Welcome to the new orthodoxies.

Essentially, it\u2019s the large-scale equivalent of the oldest pub trick in the book: sticking up a foreign satellite dish to circumvent the Saturday broadcast blackout and show the 3pm kick-offs illegally. And who says Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t understand English football culture?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14abfc2b1d39d7d3442ca55911dba5fc648e25c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14abfc2b1d39d7d3442ca55911dba5fc648e25c9/0_163_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The broadcaster Richard Keys (pictured in 2011) has expressed opposition to Newcastle\u2019s takeover, making him an unlikely ally of human rights campaigners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The broadcaster Richard Keys (pictured in 2011) has expressed opposition to Newcastle\u2019s takeover, making him an unlikely ally of human rights campaigners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here, though, the stakes are far higher: beIN is the Premier League\u2019s biggest overseas broadcast partner, with a deal worth \u00a3500m. And there is of course a far larger context at work here, one with its roots in the vast proxy war between Qatar and Saudi Arabia being waged on several fronts. Already, some of the less self-aware Newcastle fans on social media are busily trashing Qatar\u2019s own human rights record as a reason not to care about Saudi Arabia\u2019s.</p> <p>Equally, though, Qatar\u2019s heavy-handed intervention may just harden the significant body of opinion within Newcastle\u2019s fanbase that are delighted to see the back of Mike Ashley yet harbour deep concerns about who they may be letting through the door. Taking on Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch is one thing. But if Qatar can be reframed as the real enemy here, then perhaps a few Newcastle fans will be persuaded to swing behind their prospective new owners as the most biddable of a bad bunch.</p> <p>This, in a way, was always the danger of opening up the Premier League so accommodatingly to the toxic influences of global geopolitics. Partly, of course, it is simply a reflection of how wars are fought these days: not just on the ravaged battlefields of Yemen but in the commercial real estate offices of Manhattan and London, the bully-pulpits of social media, and now the Zoom meetings of English football. The Premier League has long sold itself on the basis of tribal conflict, endless narrative and wall\u2011to\u2011wall entertainment. Perhaps establishing itself as a theatre for actual war is simply the next logical step.</p> <p>And so, welcome to the new orthodoxies of English football. Saudi Arabia is good. Amnesty International is bad. New signings are more important than murder, broadcast rights are more important than women\u2019s rights, and a sense of basic humanity is ultimately expendable if you can scrape into next season\u2019s Europa League. It\u2019s a manifesto, to be sure. Just don\u2019t expect anyone with a scintilla of decency to feel warmly about it.</p>",
  "<p>Earth Day demonstrations scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic are being replaced with digital activism via the online gaming community to exploit an as yet untapped audience for action against climate change.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2020/\">Earth Day, 22 April 2020</a>, had been years in the planning but the large global demonstrations to mark the event\u2019s 50th anniversary were brought to a halt by Covid-19. In a swift pivot from the physical action which was to have been spearheaded by half a million people gathering in Washington DC, organisers sent their movement into the digital sphere.</p> <p>In an attempt to capture huge audiences they have collaborated with the online gaming community, sending messages about the need to tackle climate change.</p> <p>This week, the two million people who play the digital card game Solitaire Grand Harvest were greeted with climate messages and additional games designed to spur players into thinking about ways they could help the environment. The game already has a \u201cgreen\u201d tinge: players grow virtual plants and harvest crops on a \u201cfarm\u201d in its challenges.</p> <p>Jillian Semaan, food and environment director at the Earth Day network, said: \u201cWe had to completely change what we were doing to mark the day, and this seemed like a natural fit with Solitaire Grand Harvest and something we were really excited about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9d2215a908b9ace4295ff8046f98d694331267b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9d2215a908b9ace4295ff8046f98d694331267b/311_662_5215_3131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Covid-19 masks at an Earth Day event in Seoul, South Korea, linking ecosystem destruction to the root causes of the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Covid-19 masks at an Earth Day event in Seoul, South Korea, linking ecosystem destruction to the root causes of the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AF/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is the first time we have reached out through the gaming world. Measuring success is always challenging, but what we hope is that these additional games will allow people to see that what we produce, what we consume and what we waste has an impact.</p> <p>\u201cIf this translates, once the lockdowns are over, into people going out and engaging more with the environment, in beach cleans, reducing waste, that is the connection we want to make.\u201d</p> <p>Players of Solitaire Grand Harvest this week are greeted with the introduction: \u201cAs y\u2019all know, our farm is full of different landscapes, just like the planet we live on. So, in honor of the International Earth Day we\u2019ve decided to pay homage to mother nature with some special challenges, unique surprises, and HUGE rewards \u2013 all related to environmental protection and recycling.\u201d</p> <p>Yuval Dor, owner of Solitaire Grand Harvest, said: <em>\u201c</em>I think games are a fantastic way to deliver serious messages but in a fun way, without the feeling that you are been lectured.</p> <p>\u201cIn a time like this when gathering is not allowed, and many of the physical activities that usually take place are impossible, digital spaces are more relevant than ever to convince people to take action ... completing virtual missions like cleaning beaches, replanting forests and recycling competition will engage our players in a fun way, to the importance of giving back to the planet and take action, even remotely. \u201c</p>",

It would therefore be \u201cwholly unrealistic\u201d to think that restrictions would be relaxed any time soon and some \u201cvery socially disruptive\u201d measures would almost certainly have to remain in force for the rest of the year, he said. Whitty added that coronavirus was not going to be eradicated, so we must accept we will be working with it globally for the foreseeable future.</li> \n   <li><strong>We are at the peak of the outbreak, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the Commons. </strong>But this was put into further perspective by Chris Whitty at the press briefing, who highlighted that the peak was an \u201cartificial peak\u201d as it was the result of the lockdown. The first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, also reiterated that the biggest risk was a second spike. This all reinforces that an \u201cexit strategy\u201d from physical distancing measures is proving more and more difficult to devise.</li> \n   <li><strong>A contact-tracing system will be in place \u201cin a matter of weeks\u201d, Hancock also said.</strong> He said the effectiveness of \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d every new case as a method rested on the incidence of transmission in the community.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK\u2019s hospital death toll surpassed 18,000, as a further 759 deaths took the total to 18,100.</strong> The ONS said there had also been 1,043 coronavirus-related deaths in care homes in England and Wales by 10 April. In a joint statement with the CQC, the government conceded that the true number \u201ccould be double\u201d. Chris Whitty also said he thought the ONS figures were \u201can underestimate\u201d. And analysis from the Financial Times suggested the real UK death toll could be as high as 41,000.</li> \n   <li><strong>The EU denied the UK government\u2019s claim that a mix-up was to blame for its non-involvement in its coronavirus procurement scheme.</strong> The European commission said the UK was well aware of the initiative when it decided not to participate, contradicting the government\u2019s claim that it didn\u2019t get involved because of a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about eligibility. Facing questions from the Commons foreign affairs committee, Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, said it was a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, though he later issued a retraction and said non-involvement had been due to a \u201ccommunication problem\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Welsh government is to fund free \u201cschool meals\u201d for disadvantaged children during the summer holidays.</strong> It is the first UK nation to make such a pledge.</li> \n   <li><strong>And the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged the government to ban evictions over rent arrears built up as a result of the coronavirus crisis.</strong> He also called for an increase in housing benefits and that the government should cover, for the duration of the crisis, any shortfall in payments by private renters.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thank you so much to everyone who got in touch throughout the day with news tips, suggestions, comments and advice.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us on the UK side, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow to bring you all the latest updates on the pandemic.

On vaccines he said he was \u201cvery hopeful that we will have vaccines which have proof of concept much earlier than a year\u201d. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But there is a long path between having a vaccine that\u2019s proof of concept, and until we have either a vaccine or a drug ... what we will have available to us are social measures.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government could not allow the R number, the reproduction number (the rate at which the virus spreads), to get above 1 for any extended period of time.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We cannot allow R, the force of transmission, to go above one for any extended period at any point because, if it does, exponential growth of this will continue, it\u2019ll resume and we will get back to a situation where the NHS could have its emergency services overwhelmed. It does not take very long from where you get from bad numbers to really bad numbers ...</p> \n   <p>What we are trying to work out is what are the things that add up to an R of less than one.

I have said repeatedly, the fact that the ONS said in their last weekly report, 826 deaths, every one of them a tragedy, but I think that could be an underestimate. What we need to look at, in these data and other data, if we want to get a true picture, is - and I\u2019ve said this right from the beginning - is the all-cause, seasonally adjusted mortality over time. </p> \n   <p>And that is because, as I\u2019ve said here before, deaths from Covid will be a combination of direct deaths from the virus, and also indirect deaths, if for example people are nervous about going into hospital. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said coronavirus was peaking, but that it was an \u201cartificial peak\u201d, because it was the product of the lockdown.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that the public should not expect the number of Covid-19 deaths to \u201cfall away\u201d suddenly.</strong> As he presented a new graph (see below) he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is important for people to fully understand that ... even in those countries which started their epidemic curve earlier than in the UK, and which are still ahead, the downward slope from the point which we change is a relatively slow one.</p> \n   <p>We should anticipate the same situation in the UK.

But the government did not implement that for another three and a half weeks, he said. He said that showed the government was not following scientific advice - a claim <strong>Dominic Raab,</strong> the foreign secretary and first secretary of state rejected.</p> \n  <p>Gardiner was referring to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873723/03-potential-effect-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions-npis-on-a-Covid-19-epidemic-in-the-UK.pdf\">this paper (pdf)</a>, one of several Sage papers published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage-coronavirus-covid-19-response\">in a batch</a> when the government was under pressure to reveal the scientific advice it was getting.</p> \n  <p>The document does indeed show that the government has failed to follow the scientific advice (or at least the advice set out by Sage in that 26 February). However, it shows the scientists arguing <em>against</em> the hard lockdown measures subsequently announced by Boris Johnson on 23 March.</p> \n  <p>Here is the key extract. (I\u2019ve added the bold type, to highlight the key passage.)</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the event of a pandemic, without action, the NHS will be unable to meet all demands placed on it. Demand on beds is likely to overtake supply well before the peak is reached. Any interventions that could delay the peak, and/or reduce the size of the peak, whilst increasing the duration of the pandemic, are likely to be helpful, provided the pandemic is not extended into the late autumn/winter.</p> \n   <p>Any of the measures listed below could potentially flatten the peak of the epidemic and extend it to some extent. A combination of measures would be expected to have a greater impact, but the impacts are not strictly additive. SPI-M-O [the scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling] believes that combining all four measures, as a long-term policy, might have a similar impact to that seen in Hong Kong or mainland China - reducing the reproduction number to around 1. <strong>However, this would result in a large second epidemic once measures were lifted. Implementing a subset of measures (eg, the first three) would be expected to have a more moderate impact - still substantially reducing peak incidence, while making a second wave of infection in autumn less likely. This might be the preferred outcome for the NHS.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The four interventions were, in order: school closures; home isolation for people with symptoms; voluntary household quarantine when someone in a family has symptoms, and \u201csocial distancing\u201d (described as people reducing contacts outside the home and workplace by 75%).</p> \n  <p>The document does not call for any of these measures to be introduced immediately. And it stresses that ultimately what should happen is a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d, although the paragraph quoted above clearly implies that at that point the Sage scientists favoured measures 1 to 3, but not 4 (social distancing).</p> \n  <p>In the same document they argue that there might be advantages to allowing \u201cthe majority of the population ... [to] develop immunity, hopefully preventing any second wave, while reducing pressure on the NHS\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Johnson did reject this proposal. He abandoned \u201cherd immunity\u201d (the concept endorsed here) and opted for a hard lockdown that went much further than the \u201csocial distancing\u201d plan outlined in this document.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea067a78f08a1178d5afce0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/carolinedavies\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T15:52:49.244Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Buckingham Palace</strong> has announced the postponement of investitures due to be held in June and that the annual Garter Day service at Windsor Castle has been cancelled.</p> \n  <p>In a statement, the palace said this was \u201cfor practical reasons in the current circumstances\u201d.

Snap verdict</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That was Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first outing as Labour leader at PMQs, but just as importantly this marked the debut for a whole new way of running this question session: a \u201chybrid\u201d system, with most MPs participating by Zoom. Both probably amount to a distinct improvement on what came before.</p> \n  <p>First, the process. On a technical level it mostly worked well. One MP did not manage to dial in in time, and another got cut off early. But overall it went smoothly.</p> \n  <p>More importantly, PMQs without 400-odd MPs in the chamber makes everything quieter, calmer, more intelligible and more grown-up. For once the proceedings sounded like the question time sessions that take place in the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly. Without the jeering and the aggro, it lacked gladiatorial edge, and frankly it was probably a bit more boring than the old PMQs. But boring is a much underrated virtue in governance. It will be be very interesting to see whether the Commons ever reverts to how it operated before when (or more probably if) this is all over.</p> \n  <p>In the old PMQs, MPs worked on the assumption that there was always a \u201cwinner\u201d. (Journalists like me wrote it up in those terms too, because that was how the participants viewed the proceedings.) Under Zoom PMQs it is much harder to imagine anyone \u201cwinning\u201d old-style, but if Labour had to choose someone well-suited to parliament in serious/boring mode, it is hard to imagine anyone better than Starmer, and he will chalk today\u2019s outing up, not as a triumph, but certainly as a success. His questions were clear, forensic and focused, he avoided bland or trite sloganising and he adopted a measured tone consistent with responsible, constructive opposition. Quite what the public will make of this when the alternative is Boris Johnson remains to be seen, but high-grade seriousness is what Starmer offered in the Labour leadership contest and it is what he delivered today.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T13:11:18.364Z\">at 2.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea02e288f0898fe360d5f5e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T11:46:25.468Z\">12.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Deaths in Scotland rise by 77 to 1,062</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A total of 1,062 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19, up by 77 from 985 on Tuesday, the first minister, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> said.</p> \n  <p>The figures are lower than the 1,616 deaths given earlier by the National Records of Scotland <em>(see 12.22pm)</em> as they do not include suspected and probable coronavirus infections.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon said 9,038 people had now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 366 from 8,672 the day before.</p> \n  <p>There were 155 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of 11 from Tuesday, she added.</p> \n  <p>There were 1,776 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, down from 1,866 yesterday.</p> \n  <p>And since 5 March, 1,813 patients who tested positive have been discharged from hospital.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T12:06:53.856Z\">at 1.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea02c0d8f084784dca57d77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T11:36:44.820Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>James Sunderland,</strong> a Conservative, asks Raab what are the ingredients that will take the country through this.</p> \n  <p>Raab says the critical ingredient is for the country to come together.

Under the assumption we\u2019d be leaving at that time, we took full advantage of the four open days to say goodbye \u2014 an evening of song with our host families, one last night swim off the sea wall and a trip to the island Savai\u2019i.

The report says energy demand was down just 4% compared with previous years, mostly due to mild weather. Comparatively, the US and parts of Europe have seen a 20% to 30% fall in electricity use as economies have shut down.</p> <p>Dylan McConnell, from the University of Melbourne\u2019s climate and energy college, said the 49% decline in wholesale electricity prices should equate to about a 15% cut in power bills for households and industry if retailers passed it through in full.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a lag between wholesale and retail, but if competition is working you would expect these price reductions to flow through to retail prices over the next couple of months,\u201d he said.</p> <p>McConnell said the sharp rise in system costs due to extreme events was a warning of what lay ahead if the electricity grid was not built to deal with global warming. \u201cIt serves as a good illustration of how we need to account for the impacts of climate change in a more comprehensive way,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/04/australias-path-to-net-zero-emissions-lies-in-small-stimulus-friendly-steps\">Australia\u2019s path to net-zero emissions lies in rapid, stimulus-friendly steps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>System issues in the national electricity grid are usually only about 1% to 2% of total energy costs, but reached 8% in the first quarter this year. About three-quarters of the record system cost was due to a major storm knocking out transmission lines in western Victoria on 31 January, cutting the state off from South Australia for 18 days. It forced the market operator to require energy companies to boost power reserves in both states.</p> <p>New South Wales and Victoria were cut off from each other for seven hours on 4 January by the unprecedented east coast bushfires.</p> <p>Electricity demand \u2013 how much is drawn from the grid \u2013 reached record lows for this time of year in Victoria and South Australia due to sunny conditions helping rooftop solar generation and mild temperatures leading to less use of air-conditioning. Rooftop solar also drove Western Australia to its lowest power use from the grid for a second consecutive quarter.</p> <p>The report says average gas prices fell from $9.75 a gigajoule a year ago to $5.63, mostly due to more gas being available and a slump in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/13/australias-booming-lng-industry-stalls-after-fall-in-oil-prices-amid-coronavirus\">international oil prices</a>.

It has consciously decided that those in Australia on temporary visas are undeserving of support.</p> \n<p>There are far stronger arguments why Australia should take a broader view of who is \u201cAustralian\u201d, who are members of this community and who should be afforded this community\u2019s protection.</p> \n<p>First is the humanitarian imperative.</p> \n<p>These are extraordinary times.

There exists an obligation to offer some measure of assistance to people in this country in a time of unprecedented crisis.</p> \n<p>The entreaties that people should \u201cmake their way home\u201d are politically alluring but simplistic and impractical. Many simply cannot: they cannot afford flights home; the borders of their country have been sealed shut \u2013 even to citizens; transit countries will not allow them to pass through; or they have come to Australia seeking protection and cannot safely go back.</p> \n<p>Others have lived in Australia for years and have built families and lives and communities here, there is no other \u201chome\u201d to go back to.</p> \n<p>Australians too, are stranded overseas. The case for reciprocity is strong. Australia should treat its visitors the way it would like its citizens who are caught overseas at this critical time treated.

  "<p>As I sit on a garden chair with my laptop perched on an outdoor table in a last-ditch effort to stop my dog digging the lawn, it\u2019s timely that I\u2019ve been asked to write about setting up a home workstation that doesn\u2019t ruin your back, for people self-isolating during the coronavirus crisis (come to think of it, my back is aching a little).</p> \n<p>So, how can I fix it?</p> \n<h2><strong>It\u2019s not just about the chair</strong></h2> \n<p>The first step to working from home safely is figuring out how you\u2019re going to approach work, says an ergonomics expert, <a href=\"https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/display/joakman\">Jodi Oakman</a>, an associate professor at La Trobe University, Melbourne. She stresses the importance of a holistic approach to organising the work environment before tackling the workspace.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhere are we going to do it and how am I going to do it? What hours am I going to do? Can I do all of my job?\u201d</p> \n<p>Careful planning, for instance, getting up earlier to get through tasks before the rest of the household stirs, can reduce the likelihood of injury and improve productivity Oakman suggests. \u201cBack pain is caused by work-related stress as well as work-related physical factors,\u201d she explains.</p> \n<p>That includes setting boundaries to create some distinction between home and work. For some, this could mean getting dressed in work gear or communicating \u201cI\u2019m at work\u201d by putting on a headset in a shared environment, or setting clear working hours and sharing them with managers and colleagues.</p> \n<p>A rehabilitation consultant, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-davis-119843157/?originalSubdomain=au\">William Davis</a>, emphasises the importance of a strict routine to avoid stress-related injury. \u201cIn this isolation environment when everyone\u2019s working from home, it\u2019s very easy to fall into the habit of doing an extra two or three hours a day. And I would advise against it from a stress-wellbeing point of view.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some people might have to acknowledge they can\u2019t juggle everything from home and adjust their working hours accordingly. \u201cMany people are moving into home schooling,\u201d says an occupational health physiotherapist, <a href=\"https://phwgroup.com.au/phw-group-team/\">David Hall</a>. \u201cSome of us with kids and trying to work from home. It\u2019s like being squeezed like a lemon \u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t try and be a hero. Just be gentle on yourself and don\u2019t \u2026 feel like you\u2019ve got to be like the best home schooler and the best worker; just set realistic expectations about what all that means.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>OK, let\u2019s get to the chair \u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>All the experts agree that, ideally, a chair should have a height adjustment, to avoid unnecessary muscle strain that causes aching necks and backs. If you can\u2019t afford to buy a proper office chair, Hall says there\u2019s often a spare one somewhere that\u2019s not being used by a friend or neighbour, so ask around.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s important that the chair facilitates good posture \u2013 many chairs that aren\u2019t ergonomically designed go out at too far an angle, Davis explains. He recommends asking someone in the house to take a photo of you sitting, so you can check whether your torso and head are in a straight line.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2cb80db01dd889814a8f48b725b8308ca23f647\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2cb80db01dd889814a8f48b725b8308ca23f647/0_119_5760_4310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The right posture for working at a computer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When sitting, \u2018ideally you would have the shoulder almost directly above the hips\u2019.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phanie/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The chair should support your lower back, so the spine is in its natural S-shape. If not, Davis recommends adding a cushion or rolled-up towel. This lumbar support is not designed to take all your weight, just to act as a reminder to sit in an upright, S-shaped position.</p> \n<p>The chair should also allow the knees and elbows to be at right angles, to minimise unnecessary muscle strain.</p> \n<p>If the chair is too high and your feet aren\u2019t supported, Davis recommends using a stable surface to prop them up, like a box or ream of paper. The desk should support the elbows \u2013 if that\u2019s too high and you can\u2019t lift the chair, try sitting on a pillow or a cushion.</p> \n<h2>Keep your eyes up</h2> \n<p>Your keyboard and mouse should be about 8cm to 10cm from the edge of your desk, and the top of the monitor should be about one arm\u2019s length away, at eye level to avoid leaning forward or back.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0109a84348296f63ff5db3a7500751e1f2f7a399\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0109a84348296f63ff5db3a7500751e1f2f7a399/265_169_2714_2855/951.jpg\" alt=\"If you must use a laptop at home, experts suggest raising it to eye level using a shoe box or books, and using an external keyboard and mouse\" width=\"951\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you must use a laptop at home, experts suggest raising it to eye level using a shoe box or books, and using an external keyboard and mouse.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alyx Gorman</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This can pose problems for users of laptops, which are best suited to occasional work and checking emails while travelling. People who don\u2019t have other options should source an external keyboard and mouse so they can raise the laptop to eye level using something like a shoebox, to prevent hunching over. Similarly, any reference documents that make you look down should be raised \u2013 Davis uses his mother\u2019s old recipe book holder for this.</p> \n<h2><strong>Movement is your friend</strong></h2> \n<p>If there really are limited options for achieving the ideal work position, Oakman says you should do your best to change positions and move between sitting and standing frequently.</p> \n<p>As an exercise physiologist, Davis says regular rest breaks are critical, making sure to get out of the chair every 30 to 45 minutes \u2013 if only briefly, to move around, stretch and change position. This will shift the strain between intervertebral discs, the spine\u2019s shock absorbers.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe most common time you see injuries, even for healthy workers in a sedentary office job or home setup, is with prolonged sitting,\u201d he says. A common example is when someone\u2019s focused on typing for two or three hours, \u201cloading their postures\u201d. Then, when they bend down to pick something up, their back cracks.</p> \n<p>Other ways to facilitate more movement include taking phone calls standing up, or walking around wherever possible.</p> \n<h2><strong>What about a standing workstation?</strong></h2> \n<p>Standup desks are great, Davis says, mostly for facilitating frequent postural change without having to move away from the desk. But they tend to be expensive, so he wouldn\u2019t recommend running out to buy one. If you have a bench or ledge at an appropriate height to set up a monitor or laptop, he suggests you could use it to work standing up for 15 or 20 minutes every hour or two \u2013 the maximum he recommends standing is for 20% to 30% of the working day.</p> \n<p>As far as fit balls go, Davis has no problem with using them for their intended purpose \u2013 which is exercise. But they\u2019re not designed to be used as a chair and cause similar problems to sitting and standing, if you end up in a static posture for prolonged periods. Using them for five to 10 minutes at a time would be his maximum recommendation.</p> \n<h2><strong>Workouts will help</strong></h2> \n<p>Exercise has numerous physical health benefits, Davis says, and is also a brilliant way to strengthen muscles and protect your back, especially through a strong core workout and body weight exercises. But he warns that you should build up, cautioning against isolation crazes on social media where people are doing 1,000 repetitions a day. \u201cIt\u2019s walk before you run.\u201d</p> \n<p>Oakman stresses the importance of getting out and moving for physical and mental health. \u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019re allowed outside is to exercise, and you need to use it \u2013 that\u2019s really, really important.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>If you do have problems</strong></h2> \n<p>For people with pre-existing conditions or emerging back problems, solutions need to be tailored to the specific issue by experts, informed by a full medical and treatment history.<br></p>",

If one single virus can destroy economies in a couple of weeks, it shows we are not thinking long-term and taking risks into account.\u201d</p> <p>The teenage campaigner, who initiated the global school strike movement, was filmed at the Nobel Prize Museum in Stockholm in digital conversation with Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the earth systems scientist and director of the Potsdam Institute.</p> <p>He said there was a strong correlation between the pandemic and the environmental crisis: deforestation and the wildlife trade heighten the likelihood of viruses leaping the species boundary; air pollution increases human vulnerability by weakening respiratory systems; and the expansion of air travel allows epidemics to spread more quickly. \u201cThe scientific evidence shows they are interconnected and part of the same planetary crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are living beyond the carrying capacity of the planet so we are putting human health and the health of nature at risk.\u201d</p> <p>The lockdown has reduced emissions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/22/brent-crude-oil-price-hits-21-year-low-amid-glut\">hurt the oil industry</a>, which is the biggest source of the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet to dangerous levels.

But Thunberg alluded to these dangers.</p> <p>\u201cDuring a crisis like this there is a big risk that people try to use this emergency to push their own agenda or their own interests. We need to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot stress enough how important it is that we are active democratic citizens so a crisis like this doesn\u2019t slide in the wrong direction.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, marked Earth Day by declaring the pandemic to be the biggest threat the world had faced since the second world war, though he said the environmental emergency was deeper.</p> <p>He said post-pandemic recovery should focus on six goals: the creation of clean, green jobs; taxpayer support for sustainable growth; an economic shift from grey concrete to green nature; investment in the future rather than the past with an end to fossil fuel subsidies; the incorporation of climate risk into the financial system, and international cooperation.</p> <p>A new opinion poll suggests there is strong support for this view. Sixty-six per cent of Britons believe the climate is as serious a long-term crisis as Covid-19 and 58% agree it should be prioritised in the economic recovery.

  "<p>In early 2013, when the Philippines <a href=\"https://pca-cpa.org/en/cases/7/\">brought an international case</a> against China for violations of its rights under the law of the sea, a five-member arbitral tribunal was selected, with Thomas Mensah appointed as president. With China making extensive claims to resources falling within a \u201cnine-dash line\u201d (the undefined, vaguely located demarcation line used by China but disputed by other countries) across vast swathes of the South China Seas, the case was politically explosive for the whole region and beyond. </p> <p>Mensah\u2019s appointment reflected the esteem with which he was held, a deep knowledge of the law coupled with a recognition of his pragmatism and principle, and his fearless independent spirit. Three years later, under his guidance, the tribunal rendered a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/jul/12/south-china-sea-dispute-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-hague-court-ruling\">unanimous and far-reaching award</a>, decisively rejecting China\u2019s claim. The decision offered a rare example of judgment free from fear of \u201cgreat power\u201d retribution.</p> <p>Mensah, who has died at the age of 87, was the world\u2019s leading judge and arbitrator on the settlement of international maritime disputes. In 1996, when the new <a href=\"https://www.itlos.org/\">international tribunal for the law of the sea</a> (ITLOS) began to function in Hamburg, he was elected as one of its 21 judges, and then chosen by colleagues to serve as the tribunal\u2019s first president. In that role he oversaw the adoption of the rules and procedures that formed the character of the tribunal, and have stood it in good stead ever since.</p> <p>He spent 19 years at ITLOS, also serving as an arbitrator and, later, as an ad hoc judge at ITLOS and at the international court of justice. The cases he decided were varied. In 2001, when Ireland and Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/oct/27/energy.nuclearindustry\">disagreed</a> over a proposed new nuclear facility at Sellafield, in Cumbria, Mensah served as president of the tribunal. In a dispute on the delimitation of the Bay of Bengal, as judge ad hoc appointed by Bangladesh, he collaborated with his counterpart, appointed by Myanmar, and produced a joint opinion \u2013 a rare act in inter-state litigation by two \u201copposing\u201d judges. In a dispute between Argentina and Ghana, he confirmed his spirit of independence by joining in a unanimous decision against his own country.</p> <p>His final case, between Ghana and Ivory Coast, brought particular satisfaction, ending a long-running maritime boundary dispute. These and other decisions reflected his conviction that international courts and tribunals contributed to the public good by ensuring that \u201cinternational disputes are resolved peacefully, for the benefit of the parties and the international community as a whole\u201d.</p> <p>Mensah was born in Kumasi, the capital of the Asante kingdom, at a time when it had already become incorporated into Britain\u2019s Gold Coast colony. He attended Achimota school in Accra, at a time of growing nationalist consciousness, and then went to the University of Ghana as the country approached its independence, a formative period in his early life.</p> <p>In 1959 he obtained a first-class degree in law at the University of London, then headed to Yale Law School in the US, where in 1964 he obtained a doctorate. His thesis, on the right of self-determination for colonies, focused on the role of international institutions, including courts, to achieve this objective. The subject was one of enduring personal interest, one to which he remained committed throughout his life.</p> <p>From Yale he returned to Accra, to lecture in law at the University of Ghana, serving briefly as dean of the faculty of law. He might have enjoyed a successful academic career but opted instead for public service of a more practical form, in the international domain. In 1968 he returned to London to join the secretariat of the <a href=\"http://www.imo.org/en/Pages/Default.aspx\">International Maritime Organization</a> (IMO), the UN agency then based in Piccadilly, later on the Albert Embankment. He rose to the position of director of legal affairs and external relations, and assistant secretary general, in 1981. His time there coincided with growing environmental concerns, and he played a formative role in giving birth to a new subject area, the protection of the marine environment, with standards for ships and rules on liability for damage by oil pollution and other sources.</p> <p>Retirement from the IMO in 1990 opened the door to a new life, based at the family home in London. He lectured and wrote, and in 1995 was appointed Ghana\u2019s first high commissioner to South Africa. Presenting credentials to President Nelson Mandela was a significant moment. The following year he became a judge at the international tribunal for the law of the sea, subsequently being elected as its first president. This was the start of global renown as an international adjudicator.</p> <p>Anyone who came across Tom sensed his special qualities, the dignity, intelligence and biting humour coupled with a gentle humanity, an interest in the person. With a superbly mischievous twinkle in his eyes, he had no interest in baubles and honours. Much more fun to sneak off to an Arsenal game, or eat with family and friends, or just talk about the state of the world.</p> <p>Those who appeared before him as counsel appreciated the practical efficacy and intellectual acuity. Those who sat with him recognised his unique ability to forge agreement among disparate colleagues. One of his closest friends, his judicial colleague Judge Rudiger Wolfrum, explained what made it special to judge with him, particularly on the most contentious issues, such as the South China Seas: \u201cTom could listen, understand, show sympathy,\u201d he told me. \u201cHe had his own views, but he never insisted upon them to the exclusion of the views of others.\u201d</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Akosua, children, grandchildren and a great-grandson.</p> <p>\u2022 Thomas Aboagye Mensah, international lawyer, born 12 May 1932; died 7 April 2020</p>",

We are in this amazing place \u2013 we are super lucky and super grateful \u2013 while in the meantime people are dying and are in hospital.\u201d</p> <p>All the couple can do for now is \u2013 like many in their home countries \u2013 wait for the pandemic to pass. \u201cWe are just going to sit tight,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cAnd hope that by the winter and the end of hurricane season, the borders will be back open and we can carry on exploring\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>A fresh discovery of copper in an area once labelled the richest square mile on Earth because of its abundant metal deposits has raised the possibility of a revival for one of the UK\u2019s most historic industries.</p> <p>During exploration for lithium in hot underground springs in Cornwall, engineers came instead upon high-grade copper in a previously unmined area.</p> <p>Further drilling will take place to confirm the extent of the discovery in the parish of Gwennap, near Redruth, but there is cautious optimism that the discovery could kickstart something of a comeback for the industry.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting new discovery,\u201d said Richard Williams, the chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.strongbowexploration.com/\">Strongbow Exploration</a>, which owns the mineral rights at the site United Downs. \u201cIt tells us there are areas of mineralisation that are relatively close to the surface and are potentially mineable. The plan is to get back in there and do some additional drilling to find out how big the zone is.\u201d</p> <p>The copper was 100 metres down but the company believes the zone could extend close to the surface. Surrounding mines were worked to a depth of 500 metres below the surface. Williams said: \u201cThe hope is that this zone continues to that depth and continues laterally east and west.\u201d</p> <p>He said the global average grade of mined copper is about 0.5%. \u201cWe\u2019ve found in this zone the average is 8% copper \u2013 16 times the average grade. Those types of grade are pretty rare,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Cornwall has a long and proud mining history stretching back to the early bronze age. Reserves of copper, tin, zinc, silver and arsenic have all been exploited for many centuries.</p> <p>Gwennap was the richest copper producing region in Cornwall (and the world) in the 18th and early 19th centuries, earning it the title of \u201cthe richest square mile on Earth\u201d.</p> <p>As well as making fortunes for mine owners, the industry had a profound effect on the cultural life and social history of the far south-west of Britain.</p> <p>It gave the world the Cornish pasty \u2013 originally a wholesome and practical lunch for miners \u2013 and was a backdrop for Winston Graham\u2019s Poldark novels, which were turned into television hits in the 1970s and again more recently.</p> <p>In the face of competition from abroad and falling demand, mining declined in Cornwall and the county\u2019s last surviving tin mine, South Crofty, shut down in 1998.</p> <p>But in July 2016<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/18/strongbow-exploration-buy-26-tin-mines-cornwall-south-crofty\"> Strongbow Exploration took on South Crofty </a>along with additional mineral rights covering an area of approximately 15,000 hectares (37,065 acres) scattered throughout Cornwall, including <a href=\"https://www.strongbowexploration.com/projects/uk/united-downs/\">the United Downs </a><a href=\"https://www.strongbowexploration.com/projects/uk/united-downs/\">project</a>.</p> <p>Strongbow entered into an agreement with a company called Cornish Lithium in January 2017. Cornish Lithium was given the right to explore Strongbow\u2019s mineral rights for lithium in underground salt water, while Strongbow retained the right to any discoveries in hard rock that it came upon.</p> <p>The work at South Crofty continues. Strongbow recently applied for a permit to drill at the mine. Owen Mihalop, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, said: \u201cThe intention is to demonstrate that there is potential to discover a lot more, in particular tin mineralisation at South Crofty. The Covid-19 crisis has delayed that.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI think in general people in Cornwall would like to see a resurgence in the industry. The feedback we have received around South Crofty is that people would like to see that back in production. This is a historical mining area. On the whole I think people are positive about the jobs and economic benefits mining can bring.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Just say &quot;Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>A spokesperson for Cornish Lithium said: \u201cCornish Lithium continues to enjoy a strong relationship with Strongbow Exploration and is excited about the opportunities that this discovery highlights for the mining industry in Cornwall.</p> <p>\u201cSeparately, Cornish Lithium is equally encouraged by the results from our exploration drilling programme for lithium in geothermal waters at this site and are continuing to evaluate the opportunity to extract lithium in this area and elsewhere in Cornwall.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>On Tuesday\u2019s at-home Late Show, Stephen Colbert reacted to the previous night\u2019s late news: at 10pm on Monday, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/21/trump-us-immigration-ban-pause-green-cards\">announced via tweet an executive order</a> to temporarily suspend all immigration into the United States. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t necessarily agree with it,\u201d said Colbert, \u201cit\u2019s probably the safest thing \u2013 for the immigrants. Because right now America is basically a Petri dish on the floor of a bus station men\u2019s room.\u201d</p> <p>The president later claimed the 60-day ban on green cards was meant to protect American workers, \u201cbut this ban is not going to do anything to stop the spread of the virus or put Americans back to work\u201d, Colbert explained. \u201cIt\u2019s just Trump using the virus as an excuse to do what he\u2019s always wanted to do anyway.

Still, \u201cthis shouldn\u2019t shock me, but the United States of America has a president who just ordered a sweeping change in our national immigration policy via tweet\u201d, said Colbert. \u201cThat would be like Obama announcing the death of Bin Laden on TikTok.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/21/jimmy-kimmel-donald-trump-trevor-noah-stephen-colbert\">Jimmy Kimmel on Trump's protest praise: 'Irresponsible to the most unbelievable degree'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The tweet, Colbert noted, had absolutely no detail on how this ban would work, which reportedly caught some homeland security officials off-guard \u2013 and \u201cyou don\u2019t ever want to catch homeland security off-guard\u201d, he added. \u201cThat\u2019s like your doctor holding up your chest X-ray and going, \u2018Oh, I did not see that coming.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s really only one logic that explains this late-night policy drop: \u201cTrump\u2019s tweet is less about information and more about promoting today\u2019s press briefing, reality show-style,\u201d Colbert concluded, then imitated the president: \u201cHere\u2019s a teaser of my new executive order \u2013 am I really going to ban all immigrants?

And if Trump does use the virus as an excuse to freeze immigration, \u201cit will be yet another policy he\u2019s pushing through during the coronavirus pandemic\u201d, Noah continued. \u201cIn fact, his administration has already shut down visa applications, they\u2019ve paused the refugee program, they\u2019ve blocked migrants from seeking asylum, and during corona, Trump\u2019s EPA even decided to drastically cut enforcement of environmental regulations.\u201d</p> <p>Noah concluded by reminding those watching at home: \u201cWhile you\u2019re finally getting around to watching Ozark and trying to bake bread for the first time, Donald Trump is also using coronavirus as an opportunity to do all the things he always wanted to do.

Trump essentially said, according to Kimmel: \u201cDid I hold a rally in an enclosed space even though I now claim to have known it was dangerous at the time? Yes! Do I have an advent calendar, counting down the days until I can hold my next one. You bet your dirty mask I do!\u201d</p> <p>Trump also claimed to be holed up in the White House for months, but he actually made four trips in March, including to his resort in Florida, Mar-a-Lago \u2013 which incidentally laid off 153 people on Tuesday, in addition to the 560 laid off at Trump\u2019s resort in Miami. \u201cMaybe this is why he\u2019s so anxious to open for business again: <em>he\u2019s </em>getting hurt,\u201d Kimmel surmised.</p> <p>\u201cThis gives you a sense of how things are going at the White House: the president\u2019s own coronavirus taskforce \u2013 members of his own team \u2013 are reportedly actively ignoring him now,\u201d Kimmel continued. \u201cThey say the vice-poodle, Mike Pence, won\u2019t even sniff his butt.\u201d It doesn\u2019t make any sense, Kimmel joked: \u201cWhy would they ignore a president who has so many great ideas?

It argued that \u201cfan support for urban music must not eclipse the performances of other musical genres\u201d \u2013 an explicit call for less promotion and celebration of the most successful French popular music movement of all time.</p> <p>This popularity, SNEP said, would be \u201ccorrected\u201d as older listeners \u2013 who are assumed to listen to other types of music \u2013 started paying for subscriptions to streaming services. Unlike in the UK and US, SNEP does not count ad-supported streams or YouTube views towards sales \u2013 an unfortunate decision for rap, given that it is the country\u2019s most streamed genre. These constraints notwithstanding, last year French rappers were responsible for 16 of the 19 No 1 singles in France, and topped the album chart for 31 weeks.</p> <p>Domestic rap has become the soundtrack to a national identity crisis, viewed by its detractors as a threat to the cultural landscape of a country marked by bitter racial divides. Yet, after three decades of attempts to delegitimise it, many artists have come to ambivalently accept the persistent discrimination. There was no outrage at their being overlooked at the Victoires. Most musicians and industry figures I approached for comment were not prepared to speak publicly about prejudice within the industry, even while acknowledging it as omnipresent. One artist manager said: \u201cIt\u2019s not shocking, it\u2019s always been here. We work on the fringes, organise ourselves, create our own businesses and move forward.\u201d</p> <p>French rap\u2019s ascent from peripheral subculture to mainstream staple began during the golden era of 90s US hip-hop. Inspired by the political rhymes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/dec/07/public-enemy-10-of-the-best\">Public Enemy</a>, <em>rap fran\u00e7ais</em> built its reputation on vociferous social criticism, opposing racism and police brutality. The commercial achievements of the groups Supr\u00eame NTM and Iam helped make France <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5kIjAikHbs\">the largest hip-hop market outside </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5kIjAikHbs\">the US</a>, which it remains to this day.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amX9hnr32A0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/amX9hnr32A0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>While American rap edged towards consumerism, French rap continued to reflect the social chasm of life in the <em>banlieues</em> \u2013 suburban housing estates \u2013 where France\u2019s migrants had become progressively ghettoised. France had been largely white until the 1950s. An increase in migrants from the country\u2019s North African former colonies throughout the 60s and 70s paralleled a period of immense economic change intensified by the oil crisis in the 70s. As successive governments failed to temper unemployment, a prominent far-right rhetoric emerged, scapegoating migrants for the economic malaise.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-marie-le-pen\">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>\u2019s xenophobic Front National party stoked racial tensions in the 80s, proposing to change the law to favour French nationals for jobs, rap became another target. In 1995, the group <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjalUVgq32E\">Minist\u00e8re Amer</a> were<a href=\"https://www.liberation.fr/france-archive/1995/08/31/ministere-de-l-interieur-contre-ministere-amer-une-plainte-a-ete-deposee-contre-le-groupe-de-rap_140412\"> charged</a> for an anti-police song, casting the first stone in a decades-long conflict between the interior ministry and rap. The same year, Supr\u00eame NTM were arrested while performing their song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGDlobk6WXI\">Police</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/16/news/2-french-rappers-get-jail-for-insults-to-police.html\">sentenced to six months in prison</a>.</p> <p>In the 2000s, rap found a new enemy in interior minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>. The future president led a decade-long campaign against rap, bringing libel charges against <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/world/europe/23iht-rapper.4.16422288.html\">La Rumeur</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/11/arts.france\">Sniper</a>, and making it an imprisonable offence to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/07/france.jonhenley\">offend the dignity of the republic</a>\u201d. Sarkozy\u2019s issue with rap rested on its alleged anti-white racism, a declaration supported by more than 200 parliamentarians, who, following the 2005 French riots, <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2005/11/24/des-parlementaires-reclament-des-poursuites-contre-des-rappeurs_713789_3224.html\">accused</a> multiple rappers of inciting violence and racism. The same year, Sarkozy\u2019s UMP party instituted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/15/highereducation.artsandhumanities\">a law</a> requiring schools to teach students the positives of colonialism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1a02f5a8ec12d82a7eed7e35a1d092ecd8c20f90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a02f5a8ec12d82a7eed7e35a1d092ecd8c20f90/0_0_5186_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French rapper Gradur.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Political rhymes\u2019 ...

Before his campaign for re-election, his ally and interior minister Claude Gu\u00e9ant infamously declared that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20120205-france-minister-slammed-unequal-civilisations-politics-gueant\">all civilisations are not of equal value</a>\u201d.

The group\u2019s success renewed major label interest and coincided with the streaming revolution. With access and distribution democratised, a new generation of minority French youths could now break into the charts \u2013 and make money.</p> <p>SNEP integrated streams into sales in 2016, and the resulting tidal wave of domestic rap that entered the charts was typified by French-Algerian brothers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PODnRarD78\">PNL</a>, who independently sold a million copies of their album, Dans la L\u00e9gende. Like France\u2019s World Cup-winning football players \u2013 who in 2016 were up against an attempt by the French Football Federation to introduce a quota system to restrict players of African origin \u2013 France\u2019s black and Arab rappers rose from ostracised communities to provide the country with its most notable 21st-century cultural achievements. As Le Pen\u2019s daughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine</a>, made historic gains from the anti-Islam mood in the wake of the Paris terror attack in 2015, Muslim rappers such as PNL and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/05/mhd-so-many-french-rappers-are-inspired-by-american-hip-hop-im-the-opposite\">MHD</a> emerged to front a domestic rap revolution from the throes of racial intolerance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b9f22bb6104bfcc0b8f5552c80c62854d84c7b89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9f22bb6104bfcc0b8f5552c80c62854d84c7b89/0_0_2048_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PNL atop the Eiffel Tower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Domestic rap revolution\u2019 ...

MHD, who is currently awaiting trial for a 2018 murder allegation, blended contemporary trap with the pop music of his Senegal and Guinea heritage, and, Sylla says, \u201ccreated space for a new generation of Afro-French artists such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqYxVsEaypk\">Ninho</a> and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPGgnzc34tY\"> Aya Nakamura</a>, and even encouraged established rappers such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stet_4bnclk\">Booba</a> to embrace their roots\u201d. As Le Pen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/05/marine-le-pen-promises-liberation-from-the-eu-with-france-first-policies\">popularity</a> led to a run-off with Emmanuel Macron in the 2017 presidential election, France\u2019s widening schism was underscored by a record breaking year for rap: 11 No 1 albums, with SNEP handing out more than 200 gold, platinum and diamond singles sales plaques to French rappers.</p> <p>But four months into 2018, SNEP hastily<a href=\"https://www.lebureauexport.fr/en/news/2018/04/france-snep-will-no-longer-take-free-streaming-into-account/\"> reformed</a> its chart criteria, disqualifying all streams played without a paid subscription. The organisation \u2013 composed of members from all major labels in France \u2013 insisted that the change (aligning with Germany and Italy, but not the US or UK) was made to ensure a sales system more reflective of revenue. However, an A&amp;R director of a major French record label, who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity, maintains the sudden change was \u201cclearly a response to rap\u2019s unanticipated success\u201d.</p> <p>The amendments did little to impede rap\u2019s growth, which in 2018 led to nine No 1 albums and 14 No 1 singles (almost twice the number of rap hits to ever top the US Billboard 100 in a year). SNEP retorted in January of 2019, this time with another revision to album classifications that divided the number of streams of the most played song on an album in half. Still, rap\u2019s success continued. In 2019, PNL\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/05/pnl-deux-freres-review\">Deux Fr\u00e8res</a> was one of 10 No 1 French rap albums and one of five to be certified multi-platinum; former Sexion d\u2019Assaut frontman Gims <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2q5_KIs-wbY\">filled</a> the 81,000-capacity national stadium and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQK0f6wzww8\">Soprano</a> played two sold-out concerts to 100,000 fans in <a href=\"https://www.laprovence.com/actu/en-direct/5821137/2019-dans-le-retro-une-annee-marquee-par-le-double-de-soprano.html\">Marseille</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8b9bdd65e9c1485134a956bfb0770ccb8f2b0ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8b9bdd65e9c1485134a956bfb0770ccb8f2b0ce/0_0_2799_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soprano performs at Victoires de la Musique in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soprano performs at Victoires de la Musique in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Samson/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet, at this year\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKZLOOr4wGU\"> Victoires de la Musique</a>, rap\u2019s landmark achievements were whitewashed in favour of purveyors of the French <em>chanson</em> style. Aside from PNL\u2019s cursory nomination for an audiovisual award, decided by a public vote, only two rappers, both white, were nominated. Both lost. For the first time in 20 years, there was no category for urban album, previously known by the bizarre racial catch-all \u201crap, reggae or groove\u201d award. Victoires\u2019 president, Romain Vivien, <a href=\"https://www.tplmusique.org/romain-vivien-representer-la-filiere-musique-dans-son-entier/\">refuted claims</a> of a lack of minority representation,<strong> </strong>saying that the nominations merely reflected its members\u2019 sympathies, though this itself is arguably a sign of institutional racism.</p> <p>The Victoires, created by the ministry of culture as part of its objective to promote and protect French cultural heritage, were not designed for hip-hop, according to Jonathyne Briggs, author of Sounds French: Globalisation, Cultural Communities and Pop Music. \u201cRap has always been seen as something external, imported to France, only exacerbated by its connection to the culture of \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u201d, he says. Briggs believes the continued focus on traditional pop forms will do little to hinder rap\u2019s popularity, though: \u201cPop music is about conformity. Rap\u2019s nonconformity is still able to amplify discourse outside of existing structures.\u201d</p> <p>The late funk musician Manu Dibango <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2020/01/31/au-fil-des-voix-militant-pour-la-diversite-culturelle_6027994_3246.html\">lamented</a> the homogeneity at this year\u2019s Victoires, claiming the list of nominees read like a \u201cvain search for diversity\u201d. According to Olivier Cachin, a journalist and presenter of rap TV shows for 30 years, what began as indignation 20 years ago is now an irreconcilable \u201cdivorce\u201d. From the humiliation of Celtic trio <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80hMEKlLVgQ\">Manau</a> infamously besting French rap royalty Supr\u00eame<em><strong> </strong></em>NTM, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_6KlvS992Q\">Arsenik</a> and MC Solaar to the first rap award in 1999 to the inexplicable exclusions in 2020, Cachin says the message to rap was always clear: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.francetvinfo.fr/culture/musique/victoires-de-la-musique/c-est-vu-comme-une-sous-categorie-pourquoi-les-victoires-de-la-musique-et-le-rap-n-arrivent-pas-a-accorder-leurs-violons_3822861.html\">You\u2019re not welcome</a>.\u201d Many believe it\u2019s time for rap to have its own award show, such as the Mobo or BET awards; a statement ceremony that, in France, would only serve to spotlight the gross racial divide within the industry.</p> <p>A spokesperson for SNEP suggested to me that rap\u2019s presence in France is merely cyclical, pointing to pop\u2019s success in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember the biggest selling album of the year was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy1xQSiLx8U\">Ang</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy1xQSiLx8U\">\u00e8le</a>\u2019s,\u201d they said, referring to the 24-year-old Belgian singer. \u201cWhile urban music comprises much of the top albums and singles, it doesn\u2019t reflect the interests of France as a whole, which are still largely pop, rock and <em>chanson fran\u00e7aise</em>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f44e3503067b32fddc58bdd7ef189139393d9bd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f44e3503067b32fddc58bdd7ef189139393d9bd4/0_0_2953_4429/667.jpg\" alt=\"Aya Nakamura.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Demarcated down ethnic lines\u2019 ...

Malian-French <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDFupjRKwZY\">pop</a> star Aya Nakamura was inaccurately labelled \u201c<a href=\"https://snepmusique.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Global-Music-Report-2019-_Site.pdf\">the voice of French rap</a>\u201d by SNEP. When PNL submitted their album Dans la L\u00e9gende for the Victoires in 2017, they declared the project not to be urban, but <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEbJwZOkvDM\">chanson</a></em>. While they were not selected for the ceremony, their reasoning was later given as a reason for getting rid of the rap category.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanskywalker\">Lansky</a>, journalist for French rap website <a href=\"https://yard.media/\">Yard</a>, doesn\u2019t see these industry machinations as obstacles for French rap in the long-term: \u201cThe reality is that rap is the new pop, and many current artists labelled as pop, such as Ang\u00e8le, Louane and Kendji Girac, are looking to rap and related genres for inspiration.\u201d</p> <p>In the French charts so far in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-weeknd\">the Weeknd</a>\u2019s Blinding Lights provided a one-week break in nearly four otherwise continuous months of No 1 singles by black or Arab French rappers: Gradur, Gambi, Naps and Ninho. This is against the backdrop of Le Pen, whose newly named National Rally defeated Macron\u2019s La R\u00e9publique En Marche <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/eu-vote-confirms-french-far-right-marine-le-pen-national-rally-as-emmanuel-macron-main-opposition\">to win France\u2019s European </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/eu-vote-confirms-french-far-right-marine-le-pen-national-rally-as-emmanuel-macron-main-opposition\">elections in 2019</a>, preparing to challenge the incumbent president once again in 2022.</p> <p>French rap was once on the periphery of acceptable taste, loudly reporting on the cracks in France\u2019s supposed universalism. The attempts to quell it show how powerful it has now become, with its successful black and Arab rappers challenging the very idea of what it is to be French. As the anonymous A&amp;R director asserts: \u201cA genre that has been established in a country for more than 30 years cannot be qualified as a phenomenon. Today, rap is as much a part of France\u2019s culture as its cuisine, wine or bad faith.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The spectacular eruptions of the K\u012blauea volcano in Hawaii in 2018 were triggered by extreme rainfall in the preceding months, research suggests.</p> <p>Scientists say the finding raises the possibility that climate breakdown, which is causing more extreme weather, could lead to an increase in eruptions around the world.</p> <p>The 2018 K\u012blauea eruptions were one of the most extraordinary sequences in at least 200 years, according to the scientists, with rifts opening, summit explosions and collapses, and a magnitude 6.9 earthquake. But the trigger was not known.</p> <p>However, several months of unusually high rainfall preceded the eruption, with one 24-hour period setting a record for the entire US. This flood of water would have percolated down into fissures and pores in the rocks of the volcano, as far as 1.8 miles (2.9km) below the surface.</p> <p>The scientists calculated this pushed up the pore pressure inside the rocks to the highest level in almost 50 years, weakening them and allowing magma to push up from below.</p> <p>The scientists also looked at eruptions of K\u012blauea since 1790 and found that these historical events were twice as likely to happen in the rainy season. Such a link has long been thought possible \u2013 JD Dana, one of the first geologists to visit Hawaii in the late 1800s, <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1993/0445/pdf/of1993-0445.pdf\">suggested the idea</a>.</p> <p>They also ruled out magma pressure from below triggering the eruption, because the surface had barely deformed, and the gravitational pull of the sun and moon, which can trigger eruptions.</p> <p>\u201cAll the circumstantial evidence points in the same direction,\u201d said Jamie Farquharson, at the University of Miami, whose <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2172-5\">research is published in the journal Nature</a>. Rain has been linked to shallow eruptions in the past, such as at Mount St Helens in 1980, but this is the first time an impact at depth has been found.</p> <p>\u201cCritically, as our climate continues to change, the occurrence of prolonged periods of extreme rainfall is predicted to increase in many parts of the world, increasing the potential for rainfall-triggered volcanic phenomena,\u201d said Farquharson, adding that research on the phenomenon was needed on other volcanoes. <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/volcano-eruption-climate-change-mountain-landslide-glacier-global-warming-a8299821.html\">Other scientists</a> have warned that the melting of ice on volcanic peaks may also cause eruptions.</p> <p>Farquharson said rainfall could now be an additional factor taken into account when assessing the risk of a volcano erupting.</p> <p>Michael Manga, at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not part of the study, said: \u201cVolcanoes are part of a dynamic Earth system. Volcanic eruptions influence all surface environments, including climate and weather. Changes in those surface environments, such as heavy rainfall, might also influence eruptions. We are only just beginning to understand these interactions.\u201d</p>",

The centrifugal force caused him to black out at regular intervals, which at least momentarily stopped the screaming. An unfortunate business, all told, especially as The Fiver now faces a workplace tribunal and possible police charges, but at least it got us two-thirds of the way through the top story on yet another quiet news day, so every cloud and all that.</p> <p>It does however mean that it\u2019s left to The Fiver to explain the latest development in this big Toon deal.

Back in the mid-90s, a few friends and I made the trip to see Wimbledon v Southampton at Selhurst Park. That evening, extremely refreshed from the day\u2019s pre- and post-match activities, we were stumbling home past an old, derelict house, which we immediately decided must be haunted and warranted further investigation. Walking through an unlocked door into a pitch-black room, myself and one other chap dropped suddenly into a gaping hole in the floor. My mate landed badly, catching his arm across a beam of wood, which required immediate medical attention (the arm, not the wood) and subsequent operation to fix a shattered elbow \u2013 pins, screws, the whole shooting match. To this day he cannot straighten that arm. Days after the event I noticed that a button on the shirt I had been wearing had broken in half and was barely attached to the garment. I was otherwise entirely unscathed. He remains understandably unhappy that he required emergency corrective surgery and subsequent physiotherapy as a result of that ill-advised excursion, while I required a trip to the haberdashery.

  "<p>Children in Spain are to be allowed to take walks outside for the first time in nearly six weeks from Sunday after the government bowed to pressure to go further in its plans to ease lockdown measures.</p> \n<p>As EU leaders prepared for a summit to assess the damage Covid-19 has done to economies and agree a plan to revive them, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, told MPs on Wednesday that any relaxation of the rules would be \u201cslow and gradual\u201d.</p> \n<p>But the government performed a U-turn late on Tuesday night on allowing children on to the streets, after it was criticised for saying they could go out only to accompany a parent going to buy food or medicine or visit a bank.</p> \n<p>Following the backlash \u2013 including pot-banging protests on balconies \u2013 the government said children under 14 would be allowed out for walks from Sunday if accompanied by a parent. Older teenagers will be allowed out alone to buy food or medicine.</p> \n<p>Spain has recorded 21,717 deaths in the pandemic, the third highest number in the world after the US and Italy, and has already twice extended its state of emergency, originally declared on 14 March.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re living through a time of extraordinary sacrifices,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said as he asked MPs for a new extension until 9 May. \u201cWe can\u2019t let our guard down. We can start to think about a de-escalation scenario. But we must be prudent.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a further sign that the country is turning a corner, an emergency morgue set up at an ice rink in Madrid to help the city store its dead closed its doors on Wednesday.

But S\u00e1nchez said he expected consensus at the summit \u201cbecause it is indispensable\u201d.</p> \n<p>Spain has proposed creating a fund of up to \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) financed by perpetual debt, but the EU\u2019s fiscally conservative northern nations, led by the Netherlands, Germany and Austria, remain keen to keep a tight rein on spending and have rejected calls from the south for joint debt \u2013 nicknamed coronabonds \u2013 to fund recovery.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis pandemic touches all of us in every member state and in every household,\u201d the president of the European council, Charles Michel, said in his invitation to the summit. \u201cIt knows no boundaries and calls for even more coordination and unity.

The consensus is that it should total at least \u20ac1tn and target the economic sectors and European regions hit hardest by the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Germany has authorised its first clinical test of a vaccine on human volunteers.

  "<p>Fortnite for Android is available through the Google Play store for the first time, almost 18 months after owners Epic Games tried to use the game\u2019s popularity to break the app store duopoly.</p> <p>The release is an embarrassing climbdown for Epic, which has sunk significant resources into building its own independent games service, and is sure to reignite accusations of anti-competitive behaviour on the parts of both Apple and Google.</p> <p>\u201cAfter 18 months of operating Fortnite on Android outside of the Google Play store, we\u2019ve come to a basic realisation,\u201d Epic said in a statement on Tuesday evening.</p> <p>\u201cGoogle puts software downloadable outside of Google Play at a disadvantage, through technical and business measures such as scary, repetitive security pop-ups for downloaded and updated software, restrictive manufacturer and carrier agreements and dealings, Google public relations characterising third-party software sources as malware, and new efforts such as Google Play Protect to outright block software obtained outside the Google Play store.\u201d</p> <p>Epic had taken advantage of a feature in Google\u2019s Android operating system which allows users to install apps from sources other than the official app store, to build its own mobile software marketplace. The hope was that it could use that independence firstly to bypass requirements to pay Google a 30% cut of its earnings, and secondly to expand further, offering independent games for sale to users who had already installed Fortnite.</p> <p>But, the company learned, the technical ability to install software from unauthorised sources is not the same as the ability to attain an easy or pleasant user experience, and, while Fortnite remains one of the most popular mobile games, the constraints imposed by Google have limited take-up of the Android version.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope that Google will revise its policies and business dealings in the near future, so that all developers are free to reach and engage in commerce with customers on Android and in the Play Store through open services, including payment services, that can compete on a level playing field,\u201d Epic\u2019s statement continued.</p> <p>Fortnite has been distributed through the iOS App Store since its launch on that platform, in part due to the significantly greater practical difficulty of running apps any other way on it, and partly, Epic argues, due to the smaller market share of iOS devices.</p> <p>On Android, Epic even tried to force through an exception to the 30% cut it would otherwise have to pay Google, arguing that the significant market share of Android meant that the requirement to use Google\u2019s payment tools was an illegal abuse of monopoly.</p> <p>\u201cWe have asked that Google not enforce its publicly stated expectation that products distributed through Google Play use Google\u2019s payment service for in-app purchase. We believe this form of tying of a mandatory payment service with a 30% fee is illegal in the case of a distribution platform with over 50% market share,\u201d Epic said in December. Google denied the request.</p> <p>Epic has increased its mobile success in other ways. In June 2019, the company bought video chat app Houseparty, at the time a popular service among college students in America. In the past few weeks, the app has become a global phenomenon, rivalling Zoom for the most popular app of lockdown, and shooting to the top of download charts worldwide.</p> <p>Without the pressure from Epic, the question of whether app store monopolies are legal looks likely to be settled only if and when regulators turn their attention to it. In 2018, the EU fined Google \u20ac4.3bn for requiring manufacturers to include Chrome on their phones if they wanted to feature the app store.</p>",

As business is screeching to a halt, garment workers where I\u2019m based in Los Angeles are facing unique circumstances. \u2063\u2063Many earn an average of $6 an hour and face food insecurity, as well as inability to pay their rent, utilities and other bills due to loss of income.\u2063\u2063 Yet the continued demand for PPE orders means that many factories remain open.</p> <p>Many workers are navigating the sweatshop conditions they would face on any other day \u2013 except now, the risks of poor ventilation, dirty conditions and no social-distancing practices are exacerbating the risk of disease.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the world, we are seeing major brands pull out of orders using the contractual terms of force majeure. But if you look at who some of these brands are \u2013 H&amp;M, Target, Zara, C&amp;A \u2013 they have huge bottom lines.</p> <p>My hope for a post-coronavirus future is one that values those in the supply chain. Garment workers are the heart of the fashion industry but are treated the worst and often come from the most marginalised communities.</p> <p>Am I hopeful? On the one hand, many of us have been saying the same thing for years. But there is a shifting tide. It is a unique moment because consumers are paying attention and reorienting our relationship with consumption. Governments and corporations are being called out and garment workers are continuing to resist, as they always have.</p> <p>Now is the time to reimagine new systems.

Many brands have long put forth that the reason they contract to factories in places such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia is to lift workers out of poverty and bring jobs to those regions. Yet the majority of these brands have cancelled their orders and threatened to withhold payments even for finished clothing, even though they have the money. They are thus throwing these countries into economic meltdown.</p> <p>With the factory closed and workers furloughed, now is the time to be replacing old machines with new, state-of-the-art, cleaner and safer systems. I hope brands will streamline and I hope there will be some near-shoring and re-shoring and right-shoring, because we are going to keep having crises like this and supply chains are such delicately balanced systems; like dominoes, if one goes down, it all goes down.</p> <p>Brands need to not be so vulnerable by becoming more independent and, in a sense, more truly global.

Bring some manufacturing home instead \u2013 there is such great advantage to localising.

But nobody was voluntarily going to stop, because it\u2019s business. This has forced us to stop and even big conglomerates like LVMH are thinking: \u201cWhat does fashion actually mean now?\u201d This is going to make designers look introspectively and think: \u201cHow much am I going to make?\u201d</p> <p>I am hopeful that it is going to allow us to redefine the fashion schedule. I was talking to Patrick McDowell, Bethany Williams and other young designers in London about getting tired of all the stuff we had to produce. Two collections a year is enough, without all the pre-collections. The BFC could put out a statement, setting out all the reasons why it makes sense \u2013 but it would need to be an international effort.</p> <p>I hope that because of this young and emerging designers might have more of a voice in the room when big decisions are being made about the industry. Coronavirus is pushing everything online and online platforms are giving people who potentially wouldn\u2019t have had much of a say before, a massive say. Nobody is going to fashion week but Ahluwalia Studio just dropped the Matches collection through Instagram \u2013 it\u2019s so much more powerful because it\u2019s coming straight from the brand.</p> <h2><strong>Celine Semaan, </strong>designer, advocate, writer and founder of <a href=\"https://slowfactory.com/\">Slow Factory</a> and <a href=\"https://studyhall.earth/\">The Library Study Hall</a><strong>: \u2018T</strong>he systems that are thriving are those that were built around community\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ed461134a61bd3964fcd32299754294e8da04ef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed461134a61bd3964fcd32299754294e8da04ef4/0_0_1556_1945/800.jpg\" alt=\"Celine Semaan\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celine Semaan: \u2018I don\u2019t think the public or the employees will allow a return to business as usual.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Callaway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately it took a shock like this for companies to open their eyes and see that the systems they have built around profit and growth can crumble easily; there isn\u2019t any resilience and retail is being hit really hard. It feels like everything is opening up so it can be scrutinised and redesigned. We need to put the health of our ecosystems at the heart of our business systems. That means designing systems from a human, community-centred perspective rather than one that is profit-centred, like we have now with capitalism.</p> <p>Everyone can learn a lot from adopting a more resilient business model; for example, businesses already built around a slow fashion mentality and sustainable growth, such as Eileen Fisher, are not being affected tremendously by this storm. The systems that are thriving are those that were built around community, planet, kindness, and ecosystems.</p> <p>We need to design a production model that doesn\u2019t overproduce and over-manufacture because a system that yields over-consumption cannot last. I don\u2019t think the public or the employees will allow a return to business as usual. There are a lot of unions being formed, such as at Everlane, and there is growing solidarity among employees across companies. Right now we are seeing that collective action is not actually that difficult. There is only one way from here: up.</p> <h2>Orsola de Castro, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.fashionrevolution.org/\">Fashion Revolution</a>: \u2018It\u2019s a good opportunity to break the hegemony\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"08b9a016be14e88bd4a48a138fa280a45cc5c74c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08b9a016be14e88bd4a48a138fa280a45cc5c74c/0_10_1639_2047/801.jpg\" alt=\"Orsola de Castro\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orsola de Castro: \u2018I want people to focus on the positive in order to grow from it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tamzin Houghton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fashion industry is facing a massive crisis, but after a period of restriction we tend to fall back into excess.

But I also hope that we pause and realise we don\u2019t necessarily need 12 pairs of jeans and God knows how many sweatpants.</p> <p>I hope it makes us value the concept of buying less, buying better and perhaps buying a little bit less cheap; finding ways to be able to afford things that are locally made and from brands that are so small as to have innovation and sustainability embedded from the start. It\u2019s a good opportunity to break the hegemony of the big guys, so that we won\u2019t need to double check that Zara and H&amp;M really are doing what they say they are doing. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if the high street didn\u2019t return to the same-old same-old, but instead had mending services, smaller designers, tailors, rental places and swapping places.</p> <p>When we come out of this, it will be about capturing that joy of nothingness \u2013 the joy of having had less, of having been limited.

We are focusing on the most solidified, transparent aspects of our existing one and leaning into those parts. The same applies with the fibres we use - where is that being grown, woven and cut?

Eastern Europe is expected to be one of the worst-hit regions as migrant workers in western Europe and Russia are forced to cut back the amounts they send back to families in Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine and other former Soviet bloc countries.</p> <p>The World Bank said studies showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jun/15/remittances-help-migrants-families-and-the-uk\">remittances alleviated poverty in lower- and middle-income countries</a>, improved nutrition, were linked to higher spending on education, and reduced child labour in disadvantaged households.</p> <p>\u201cA fall in remittances affect families\u2019 ability to spend on these areas as more of their finances will be directed to solve food shortages and immediate livelihoods needs,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Countries that are large recipients of remittances, such as India, have also imposed lockdowns, causing widespread unemployment and hardship, often making the situation even worse for families that suffer a decline in money being sent home.</p> <p>Oil-dependent countries, which have seen crude prices tumble from more than $60 a barrel in January to less than $20 a barrel this week, have also been hit by the economic impact of the pandemic, limiting the amount of help they can offer poor families.</p> <p>Dilip Ratha, chief economist for migration and remittances at the World Bank, said migrants often worked in insecure jobs and were among the first to be let go in a crisis.</p> <p>\u201cBut it is not just that they lose their jobs, the stores they use to send cash home have also shut down,\u201d he said. \u201cMigrants typically send small amounts of cash via stores and these have closed.\u201d</p> <p>Ratha said the developed world has come to depend on migrant workers for cheap and skilled labour, and should do more to alleviate their situation. They need access to healthcare for themselves and their families and cut-price banking facilities, which would allow them to send money home without paying high fees and commissions.</p> <p>Last year, remittances reached an all-time high of $554bn. Next year, the World Bank expects a 5.6% recovery from the $445bn predicted this year to $470bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It said: \u201cThe outlook for remittance remains as uncertain as the impact of Covid-19 on the outlook for global growth and on the measures to restrain the spread of the disease.</p> <p>\u201cIn the past, remittances have been countercyclical, where workers send more money home in times of crisis and hardship back home. This time, however, the pandemic has affected all countries, creating additional uncertainties,\u201d it added.</p> <p>Remittance flows are expected to fall across all regions, most notably in Europe and central Asia, where the fall in income is expected to be 27.5%, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, with a 23.1% decline. For east Asia and the Pacific, which includes Indonesia and the Philippines, the fall is put at 13% .</p>",

  "<p> \u201cI am really angry about this,\u201d said Dr Anna Down, scanning her computer for figures to show how coronavirus has ravaged her patients living in nursing homes.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne home had 23 deaths, another lost 19, and another 13,\u201d the Ealing GP said. \u201cIn two units 50% of residents died in the space of 10 days.\u201d</p> \n<p>Down is the clinical lead at a practice with 1,000 residents on its books in 15 privately run nursing homes in the area of west London hit harder than anywhere in Britain by Covid-19 deaths in the first weeks of the outbreak. In a normal month, she might expect to lose around 28 people. In the last month she has lost 125.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I have never written so many death notifications in such a short time</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Down has a warning to the rest of the country informed by her practice\u2019s experience: reform how social care handles Covid-19 or face rising deaths and a second devastating wave of infection.</p> \n<p>Her anger goes beyond grief. Her early warnings to public health authorities about the risks to care residents were not acted on, she said; infected patients continue to be discharged into care homes from hospitals, spreading the virus; and staff shortages are blighting attempts to keep the virus isolated.</p> \n<p>High-protection FFP3 face masks requested so staff could treat residents with \u201caerosol-producing\u201d lung problems and tracheostomies never came. Carers were left to spread the disease and fell ill.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom the moment this started we highlighted where the problems were going to be and said we can get on top of this now,\u201d Down said. \u201cYet no definitive and timely action was taken across the health and social care system.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The last few weeks have been devastating on the frontline. The manager of the Ealing home where 23 people died in just two weeks described conditions as \u201cterrible\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have never written so many death notifications in such a short time,\u201d she said, on condition of anonymity. \u201cEvery member of staff is lost. They don\u2019t know what to do. In one of our units with 21 residents we lost nine people in three days. It\u2019s OK when you hear the numbers on TV. They are removed from reality. One day a resident was walking around with a mild temperature. I went home and the next morning they were dead.\u201d</p> \n<p>The manager repeated a refrain heard in care homes everywhere at the moment: \u201cThere is so much focus on the NHS but there is little done for care homes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe staffing situation is getting critical. I have seven nurses and 12 care assistants off. The care home sector needs help: staff, protection and volunteers. This has been going on since the beginning of April and I still think we are heading for the worst.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ministers admit official figures understate the scale of problems in care and nursing homes. Niall Dickson, the head of the NHS Confederation, described care this week as \u201cthe second front\u201d. It may yet become the main battleground.</p> \n<p>Official figures on Tuesday put the impact on Covid-19 on care homes at just over 1,000 fatalities to 10 April. But HC One, the biggest private provider, has alone lost almost 500 people to confirmed or suspected Covid-19 and the virus is active in 120 of its 328 homes. Given there are more than 15,000 care homes in England and Wales, Prof Martin Green, the chief executive of sector association Care England, predicts care home deaths will outstrip hospital fatalities (17,337 in England and Wales by Tuesday).</p> \n<p>Yet demands for social care to be urgently reconfigured with NHS-style \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d resourcing are yet to be met.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902y7k75pFKAYyX/\" data-alt=\"Hospital deaths\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902y7k75pFKAYyX/\">Hospital deaths</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Down has ideas, if anyone will listen. Given isolating Covid-19 sufferers within homes frequently fails, there need to be \u201chot homes\u201d for accepting Covid-positive discharged from hospitals and \u201ccold homes\u201d for those without the virus. She describes them as \u201cthe equivalent of the Nightingale hospitals for nursing homes\u201d.</p> \n<p>Down believes homes are inadequately staffed to deal with the volume and intensity of demand and need nursing support from local hospitals. Staff need to be tested \u201cearly and often\u201d, and there needs to be central management of discharged hospital patients so they are put in the safest, rather than most available vacancy.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn terms of deaths, I don\u2019t think we have peaked yet,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time people die, more people are discharged into the homes from hospital. Without a new strategy it\u2019s not going to stop.\u201d</p> \n<p>The North West London Collaboration of Clinical Commissioning Groups declined to comment.

The inequality in the US is so large. This disease has targeted those with the poorest health.

There is very weak unemployment insurance and people don\u2019t think they can rely on it.\u201d</p> <p>During an interview with the Guardian to mark the paperback publication of his book People, Power, and Profits, Stiglitz was asked whether the US might be heading for a second <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/21/100-years-on-another-great-depression-coronavirus-fiscal-response\">Great Depression.</a></p> <p>\u201cYes is the answer in short,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you leave it to Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell [the Republican Senate majority leader] we will have a Great Depression. If we had the right policy structure in place we could avoid it easily.\u201d</p> <p>Stiglitz said that as a result of Trump\u2019s mismanagement, the White House office responsible for pandemics had been closed, funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had been cut, and the US had gone into the crisis without enough testing kits, masks and protective gear. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/trump-liberate-tweets-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders\">Encouraged by Trump</a>, some parts of the US were determined to reopen in a way that would facilitate the transmission of the disease and lead to a fresh outbreak, he added.</p> <p>\u201cIn those circumstances it won\u2019t be the government enforcing the lockdown, it will be fear. The concern is that people are not going to be spending on anything other than food and that\u2019s the definition of a Great Depression.</p> <p>\u201cWe were unprepared but, even given the degree of unpreparedness, Trump\u2019s decision to make this about politics rather than about science has meant we have responded far more poorly.\u201d</p> <p>Stiglitz said that if Trump were defeated in the presidential contest in November and the Democrats took control of both houses of Congress there was a chance of the US moving in a more progressive direction, but he warned Republicans would fight dirty in order to cling on to power.</p> <p>\u201cThere is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/21/trump-adviser-republicans-voter-suppression\">voter suppression</a> and gerrymandering.

The league says teams will start training from 4 May. But there are lots of unanswered questions over the announcement.</p> \n  <p>In a press conference, <strong>Wayne Pearce</strong>, the Balmain legend tasked with heading up the league\u2019s grandly titled \u201cProject Apollo\u201d to get the season running again, said the NRL had achieved \u201ca lot more clarity around the medical process and what those protocols are\u201d and that \u201cgovernment authorities\u201d were \u201cvery supportive\u201d of their plans.</p> \n  <p>What he didn\u2019t say was what those protocols were, and which government authorities the league has been talking to. Basically, who in the government has given the league sign-off to begin playing again?</p> \n  <p>I\u2019ve been trying to find out this afternoon, with little joy.</p> \n  <p>We know that the NSW police commissioner, <strong>Mick Fuller</strong>, who is in charge of the state\u2019s response to Covid-19, previously wrote to the NRL chairman Peter V\u2019landys saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/nrl-forge-ahead-with-resumption-plan-despite-no-approval-from-nsw-government\">there was no legal obstacle for the NRL\u2019s plans to resume playing despite strict public health orders</a>. </p> \n  <p>That\u2019s because the league was given an exemption under the original PHOs issued last month, and stopped playing matches voluntarily. </p> \n  <p>However in the letter Fuller also said the league would have to develop protocols to demonstrate it could resume safely. The premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, said something similar when she was asked about it last week. </p> \n  <p>So who has signed off on the protocols? NSW Health still hasn\u2019t responded to my queries, and the NSW police seems to think there\u2019s nothing to be signed off on. </p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s what a spokeswoman told me:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As far as we are aware, there is nothing to be \u2018signed-off\u2019. The commissioner has stated previously that the letter was advice in response to their inquiry. I don\u2019t have anything further to provide you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Perhaps we\u2019ll hear more from the NSW government later tonight or tomorrow, but it seems odd that neither the NRL nor the state government has explained who is in charge of making this decision.</p> \n  <p>The NRL is also still awaiting clearance from the federal and New Zealand governments for the New Zealand Warriors to arrive in Australia on May 3, a day before the rest of the competition resumes training. </p> \n  <p>The Queensland premier, <strong>Annastacia Palaszczuk</strong>, has also previously said she would not look kindly on the three teams from her state travelling back and forth to NSW for matches.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:25:50.482Z\">at 10.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea005078f085a072d3bced8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:06:05.348Z\">10.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Need a distraction from Covid-19?

That includes private hospitals, but the state government paid private hospitals to provide capacity to the public system in the event it is needed as a result of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>In any case, it sounds now like people on the public wait list for elective surgeries could get preferential treatment over people waiting for surgery in the private hospital system because the state government bought capacity in the private system.</p> \n  <p>It will depend on the surgery, however. Mikakos noted that some of the procedures that will now be allowed, eg IVF or dental work, could still largely be happening in the private system.</p> \n  <p>When she was asked what the point was, then, of having private health insurance at a time like this when you\u2019re not getting any benefit out of it, she said part of the government funding for the private sector was to keep the private hospitals running at this time. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JennyMikakos/status/1252840162414874628\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A slowdown in new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> cases has allowed our public &amp; private \ud83c\udfe5 to carefully resume more category 2 &amp; some category 3 elective surgeries from next week. \ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2695\ufe0f \ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2695\ufe0f We thank Victorians for their patience &amp; helping save lives by staying \ud83c\udfe0 to slow the spread of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/springst?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#springst</a></p>\u2014 Jenny Mikakos MP #StayHomeSaveLives (@JennyMikakos) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JennyMikakos/status/1252840162414874628?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T09:05:48.157Z\">at 10.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ffc9c8f085a072d3bce9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T08:20:30.138Z\">9.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good evening. <strong>Graham Readfearn</strong> here taking you through the final hours of our live coronavirus coverage.</p> \n  <p>A quick check around the updates from states and territories today shows very low numbers of new cases of Covid-19 being reported. </p> \n  <p>There were no new cases reported by Queensland, Western Australia, Northern Territory or the ACT.

the community about how their privacy will be protected and how the app will be working.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Importantly, she said Victoria \u201cwon\u2019t be setting any preconditions\u201d on uptake of the app, but preconditions would be set up around other factors, such as more testing, more tracing, and response activity if there is an outbreak in a particular area.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut that

It\u2019s business investment that drives productivity which drives higher wages. So that\u2019s the problem, let\u2019s frame that up first. Look I think it is important for us to put it back on the table but along with other tax reform. It\u2019s not the only thing that needs to be done. It\u2019s important that we look at the state taxes, the productivity sapping stamp duty taxes, payroll tax. It is interesting how much payroll tax has been deferred. <br></p> \n   <p>The whole question of the right configuration of the state taxes. Whether or not we bring forward those other income tax cuts. So it\u2019s not just company taxes but it is important we have a competitive company tax rate. To the treasurer\u2019s point, we\u2019re not asking, in the Business Council, for us to have the lowest rate, we\u2019re simply asking for a competitive rate, so that we can be a magnet for investment in this country. <br></p> \n   <p>Because we already have so many advantages, but we have one disadvantage which is a tax rate that is so much higher than everywhere else in the world. As you and I have talked about many times, at the height of this debate, 63% of Australians supported lowering the corporate tax rate. It was people in this building, in Parliament House, who didn\u2019t see this as something that was in the national interest. <br></p> \n   <p>And we would be in a much better starting position on recovery if we had that 25% rate. So I think we have to put it back on the table. I think we have to stop the ideological wars about it. I think we have to be willing to have a conversation not just about that tax but about the whole tax system or as much of the tax system as we have the stomach to do reform on to make us a country that rewards innovation and incentive. <br></p> \n   <p>And obviously puts money into the pockets of Australians.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T01:04:58.836Z\">at 2.04am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f96ab8f087a826b68acae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:58:59.369Z\">1.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In case you haven\u2019t seen this as yet, or cried today, I am giving this another run, because we all need a bit of heartbreakingly lovely in our lives. <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheMancUK/status/1252235035379265538\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After noticing that Ken slept with a photo of his late wife every night, one of the carers at Thistleton Lodge presented him with this incredible gift... <a href=\"https://t.co/Q1v8V8HUFS\">pic.twitter.com/Q1v8V8HUFS</a></p>\u2014 The Manc (@TheMancUK) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMancUK/status/1252235035379265538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 20, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T01:00:26.069Z\">at 2.00am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f93e58f087a826b68ac95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/calla-wahlquist\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:46:55.340Z\">1.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A group of friends who gathered at one of their homes to play video games are <strong>among 95 people to be issued with a $1,600 on-the-spot fine for allegedly breaching Victoria\u2019s social distancing laws in the past 24 hours</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Police in Victoria said they also fined three people who, they claim, \u201cbooked a short stay accommodation so they could hand out and take drugs\u201d, as well as two people who were stopped in a car in Box Hill. <br></p> \n  <p>As we have seen in a number of these cases in recent weeks, police allege another offence was being committed at the same time \u2013 the driver of that car in Box Hill was unlicensed, the passenger was apparently brandishing a weapon.</p> \n  <p>The social distancing laws give police another reason to stop people and question their movements. <br></p> \n  <p>As <strong>Michael McGowan </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/victorians-describe-feeling-intimidated-by-police-enforcing-lockdown-laws\">reported yesterday</a>, a number of people fined in Victoria say the<strong> police were \u201cintimidating\u201d or \u201caggressive\u201d and the laws were confusing.</strong> <br></p> \n  <p> But police have the discretionary power to issue on-the-spot fines and question people\u2019s movements, and they are using that power. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:49:12.451Z\">at 1.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f93878f087a826b68ac93\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T00:45:35.408Z\">1.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JennyMikakos/status/1252753358336581632\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are 1,336 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a> cases in Victoria (2 added, 2 removed as interstate). 135 cases may indicate community transmission. 29 people are in hospital, inc 12 in ICU. 1,243 people have recovered &amp; &gt; 90K Victorians have been tested.

Is that you can either fork out the money and pay for 10,000 or 15,000 people on the dole, or you could see an underwriting of a convertible note or a loan, which provides some equity, which then eventually the gGovernment can recoup. <br></p> \n   <p>So, really when you stop to think about it and get beyond the simple headlines of saying, \u201cIs it a foreign airline?\u201d <br></p> \n   <p>Even though there are tens of thousands of local jobs, is it something that government should be just providing money for? <br></p> \n   <p>There\u2019s a big difference between paying people unemployment benefits and providing support which allows investors the certainty to make sure that we have two major airlines \u2013 Qantas and Virgin \u2013 with sustainable jobs, high-skilled jobs, here in Australia. <br></p> \n   <p>Because if we don\u2019t rescue Virgin in some form, what will happen is that, sooner or later, a foreign airline will come in. And who knows, there could be foreign crews flying over Australian air and sky, with foreign pay and conditions. <br></p> \n   <p>So at the end of the day, this is about keeping skilled jobs, this is about making investments where perhaps the taxpayer doesn\u2019t ultimately foot the entire bill. <br></p> \n   <p>So I think there\u2019s a deal to be done in voluntary administration, but I tell you what, for the regions, for our tourism, for low fares, and for the taxpayer not having to pay the massive costs if tens of thousands of people just lose their jobs, I think a deal should be done.

So there are exceptional circumstances where further restrictions might be placed on people living in residential aged care facilities in terms of access to visitors. <br></p> \n   <p>But those additional restrictions are the exception, they are not the rule, and we think it is a good thing for people to have those visits in accordance with those screening procedures and other things that are necessary to protect elderly residents in those situations. <br></p> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done out of the convenience of isolation in terms of how these facilities are run, it should always be done always only in the interests of the care of those who are living in those facilities. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T23:50:18.282Z\">at 12.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f799b8f08b5c61713e4ef\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T22:54:59.712Z\">11.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Queensland reports no new infections</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Queensland has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.</p> \n  <p>Great news.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T23:59:07.627Z\">at 12.59am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9f772f8f087a826b68ac18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T22:47:56.213Z\">11.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australia has undertaken the suppression method in response this pandemic.

That\u2019s an honest view. If, in the process of suppressing, we get to the point of eradication, then that would be a magnificent outcome.

  "<p>When news of the pandemic broke in California and we were ordered to shelter at home, many of us rifled through our closets for our bulk packages of protective N95 masks that we\u2019d worn in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/28/california-wildfires-explained-climate-change\">last year\u2019s fire</a>, and the fires the year before that, and the fires the year before that, and wondered if we should donate them to the hospitals or keep them for ourselves.</p> <p>This time, wearing masks was about protecting the vulnerable and at-risk from ourselves. But we will need the masks to protect ourselves from the fires that will likely come back this summer and fall. Presumably, there won\u2019t be any N95 masks left by that time, when we\u2019ll need protection from the smoke if we\u2019re ordered to evacuate, as we had to last year, for more than a week, when the Kincade fire scorched 77,758 acres of our county of Sonoma.</p> <p>In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-had-nation-s-worst-fire-season-2018-n981431\">fires burned</a> nearly 2 million acres in California. And in 2017, fire charred through a significant portion of my hometown. When the university where I teach recently closed for the semester because of <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/what-does-shelter-in-place-mean.html\">shelter-at-home orders</a>, it was the fourth closure in three years (the other three due to fires or smoke from fires). You could hear the weary tone in the administrators\u2019 emails, thanking us for being attentive, yet again, to the needs of our traumatised students.</p> <p>During the first disorienting week of shelter at home, we whispered to our climate emergency friends: \u201cPsst! Isn\u2019t this what we\u2019ve been hoping for? The sudden reduction in air travel? The shrinkage in fossil fuel emissions? Did you hear greenhouse gases <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/coronavirus-china-co2-climate-crisis-greenhouse-gas-carbon-emissions-coal-a9351436.html\">dropped 25%</a> in China during February? And people are taking online classes in carbon sequestration gardening techniques? And that <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/04/15/keystone-xl-oil-pipeline-canada-nebraska-court/5142991002/\">judge finally cancelled</a> a key permit for the Dakota Access pipeline?\u201d</p> <p>It felt, at first, like some sort of divine intervention. I couldn\u2019t get the <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/anna-akhmatova\">Anna Akhmatova</a> poem out of my head: \u201cEverything is plundered, betrayed, and spent / the wings of black death have flown by / why, then, do we feel so radiant?\u201d In any case, this stay-at-home remedy for the pandemic was a far superior experience to what we go through during fires. We could breathe fresh air! At least, those of us who didn\u2019t have the virus.</p> <p>But as the reality of the economic toll set in, as well as the realisation that Donald Trump was using this opportunity to roll back more environmental restrictions, and realised that marginalised people were the ones dying in largest numbers, it became evident that there was no real silver lining. All around were the same symptoms of a system heading in the wrong direction. One student wrote to me: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to things getting normal again.\u201d The only problem is that things weren\u2019t normal before.</p> <p>And when the winds pick up this October, electricity and gas provider PG&amp;E will, most likely, turn off the power for one, two or maybe more weeks to try to avoid another catastrophic conflagration due to a drought-diseased tree crashing onto a live power line and burning up the region. If we are still sheltering at home, no power means no internet, no Zoom, no Netflix. More importantly, when the fires come, where and how will we evacuate while physical distancing?</p> <p>After the fires, any illusions we had held that humanity could triumph over nature came apart. When Covid-19 erupted, it felt a little like a \u201cHold my beer. We\u2019ve got this!\u201d kind of moment, not because we had any control \u2013 quite the opposite \u2013 but because we\u2019d had an apprenticeship with our own powerlessness against the forces of nature.

We need strong voices like that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s just very important to keep women\u2019s football in the discussions at all times. There has been great development in the last years, it\u2019s had a good rhythm, and it\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t take two steps back again after a crisis like this because we\u2019re not the first priority. We just have to keep the voice strong and not lose our position. It\u2019s such a strange situation to be in so it\u2019s very hard to say where it will go but we need to push for the same evolution that we\u2019ve seen in recent years.\u201d</p> <p>This is not the first time the Lyon forward has used her platform to push the game forward, and it won\u2019t be the last. She has used her high profile to drive change, most notably in stepping back from Norway\u2019s national team over a perceived lack of support and investment in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s football, and she has a huge amount of respect for those who do the same.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a choice: you could play on and that\u2019s it but I think when you reach a certain level, a lot of responsibility comes with it. It\u2019s important to say, though, that you have to perform too. Because if you don\u2019t perform, you don\u2019t have a voice and then you won\u2019t have the same impact. Fact. So that\u2019s kind of been my biggest motivation from day one; I train every day to perform and also give me a voice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a175fe6c36ab1eb5fb52e798096c5230a6105da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a175fe6c36ab1eb5fb52e798096c5230a6105da/0_83_4093_2456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hegerberg in action for Lyon against Paris Saint-Germain at the start of the season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hegerberg in action for Lyon against Paris Saint-Germain at the start of the season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Steenkeste/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI have a lot of admiration for people who stand up for what they believe in and who actually use the voice for good.

The more voices you have, the more impact you can leave on the sport.\u201d</p> <p>It fits with her philosophy as a player. When people ask what her ambition is her answer is not individual awards and team titles; instead, something much simpler drives her. \u201cMy biggest ambition is to maximise the potential in me. To see how far I can push it as a player at the highest level; that\u2019s something that motivates me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As does watching a culture shift in Norway as young girls and boys look to her in the way she looked at the ever-modest Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r when growing up. \u201cThere was a lack of women role models when I was growing up \u2013 that\u2019s something that has changed a lot today. That\u2019s very important. I can see the impact all the success that I\u2019ve had with Lyon has not only had on young girls but also young boys in Norway. I feel that\u2019s a big game-changer.\u201d</p> <p>Hegerberg has won everything there is to win at Lyon and, with her teammates Sarah Bouhaddi and Dzsenifer Marozsan set for moves to the United States, could the Norwegian look beyond France when her contract ends in a year? \u201cI believe in staying loyal to your club,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had the most amazing years at Lyon and I have another year of my contract. It\u2019s impossible to say what the future will bring but right now I\u2019m in my own rehab bubble trying to get back on track stronger for Lyon \u2013 I have scary plans for that comeback.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The outbreak of the coronavirus has forced people around the world to change their routines and get used to spending more time than usual confined to their homes. The contestants on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/reality-bites-big-brother-contestants-emerge-to-a-world-transformed\">Sweden\u2019s version of Big Brother</a>, though, have been adjusting to this for weeks.</p> <p>When Daniel Glasman entered the Big Brother house in early February, there had been only a handful of confirmed cases of Covid-19 across Europe and no one on the continent had died with the illness. Fifty days later, when he returned to his home in Stockholm, he could not have been prepared for what awaited him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to exaggerate or anything, but I\u2019ve just gone through a really profound experience inside the house and then I come out and find the world has changed in a completely different direction,\u201d Glasman says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like when you were a kid and you were supposed to learn how to ride a bike for the first time, which is difficult enough, and then at this point I\u2019m having to learn how to ride my bicycle while being drunk at the same time.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/sweden-covid-19-policy-trust-citizens-state\">Sweden\u2019s approach to the pandemic</a> has been slightly different from most other European countries. At the time of writing, borders have not been closed, unlike in neighbouring Denmark and Norway, and those who have left the Big Brother house have been able to visit restaurants and see friends. That is not to say nothing has changed, though: nightclubs and cinemas have closed, while many other venues have opted to close voluntarily.</p> <p>Glasman was taken to dinner by friends upon leaving the house and has been able to spend some of his free-ish time getting back to relative normality, although some adjustment has been required. Some of his friends are out of work due to restaurant closures, while Djurg\u00e5rdens, the football team he supports, have been forced to postpone the defence of their league title \u2013 the new season, which was supposed to begin in April, has been put on hold until June at the earliest.</p> <p>The Big Brother housemates were given some information about the pandemic during the show \u2013 breaking from the usual rule of no contact with the outside world \u2013 and similar approaches were taken on Big Brother broadcasts in other countries, including Germany and Canada. However, there is only so much you can do to prepare yourself for an unprecedented situation.</p> <p>\u201cEven though the situation was very dire and everything had changed from when I went into the house, I was able to start mentally processing that and begin my journey back into the real world just by knowing what the situation was like,\u201d Glasman says.</p> <p>\u201cI was shocked and positively surprised at the same time, because I\u2019d imagined <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCdRFMp8Xwo\">the opening scene from 28 Days Later</a>, but there\u2019s still people out there and life goes on. I was still shocked by the scale of it all, and I still think I\u2019m processing it, because I\u2019m still getting used to it and I\u2019m not at all up to speed on the global situation. I need to take it step by step.\u201d</p> <p>Glasman estimates that he has spent between four and six hours every day responding to fans of the show on social media. He wonders whether this serves a useful purpose, in giving people escapism from the drip-feed of news coverage.</p> <p>\u201cThe outpouring of support has been an immense factor in me feeling so well coming into a world that\u2019s completely different in every way \u2013 that\u2019s just made the process so much easier for me,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going through the most dramatic situation of our generation. We\u2019ve never seen a proper war [on home soil], we\u2019ve never seen a proper crisis, we\u2019ve never seen anything on the scale or magnitude of this pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cPeople\u2019s minds have been preoccupied elsewhere, but on the other hand they have all this time on their hands in quarantine and sometimes it\u2019s good to not have 24-hour access to the news. You want to relax your mind, or do something different, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s had an effect on the viewership of Big Brother as well.\u201d</p> <p>While it is hard to predict the level of attention any Big Brother contestant will receive when leaving the show, he has done a number of TV and radio spots, even if there have been more video calls than he anticipated \u2026 and less hugging.</p> <p>Elements of the Big Brother experience are now much more relatable to the general population, only not in the way the contestants will have expected when entering the house back in February.</p> <p>\u201cI think the corona situation has put a lot of focus on just the isolation part of it,\u201d says Glasman, adding that he is being forced to adapt to changes in his own life, the lives of his friends and the world at large.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, that\u2019s put a magnifying glass to the situation we were in when we were inside \u2013 if the world hadn\u2019t changed, it would still be a pretty moving experience being locked away from it for so long, but when you add the fact that we\u2019re going through the largest human and global change in a lifetime, that makes the transition back into real life immensely different and immensely harder.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><br>There are, as always, two kinds of people in the world: those who are wondering what to do with all their free time, and those who are wondering what happened to it. The split seems to be closely correlated with the number of children who live with you.</p> <p>If you are in the former group, you, like me, may have exhausted a significant quantity of procrastination cleaning. I have vacuumed under the sofa, changed the filter on my cooker hood, and even started painting the kitchen.</p> <p>So why not introduce a digital component to the great tidy-up? Your laptop\u2019s downloads folder might not literally collect dust, but whether physical or digital, the longer you leave things to fester, the harder they become to eventually deal with.</p> <h2><strong>Turn off your notifications</strong><br></h2> <p>We all do it: it\u2019s the honeymoon period with a new app, freshly downloaded, full of possibility. It asks for notification access and you grant it. Then nine months go by, and suddenly it is flashing up a push alert for a 10% off code for an annual subscription if you refer three friends. You dismiss the notification and get on with your day, but the app keeps showing up \u2013 never enough to prompt you to action, but frustrating all the same.</p> <p>So head to your notification settings, and search for the apps you actually want to hear from. A good rule of thumb is, only give notification access to apps that will send you real messages from real people. Oh, and maybe your favourite news app.</p> <h2><strong>Clear out your photos folder</strong><br></h2> <p>It\u2019s easier than ever to take photos, and have more of them than ever are stored on our devices. So it\u2019s harder than ever to find the pictures that we want to look at.</p> <p>AI helps a bit: Apple is moderately good at letting you search for pictures by who is in them, what they are of, or where they were taken; Google does the same job better, with a privacy trade-off. But if you want a photo library that serves a purpose beyond hoarding, you will have to delete some pictures.</p> <p>Screenshots are a good target, as is clearing out all but one of every image of which you took 15 versions. And why not trim your selfie folder to just the greatest thirst traps, chucking those sunsets that don\u2019t quite match the reality of being there.

  "<p>1970 was a simpler time. (February was a simpler time too, but for a moment let\u2019s think outside the pandemic bubble.)</p> <p>Simpler because our environmental troubles could be easily seen. The air above our cities was filthy, and the water in our lakes and streams was gross. There was nothing subtle about it. In New York City, the environmental lawyer Albert Butzel<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/nyregion/new-york-city-smog.html\"> described</a> a permanently yellow horizon: \u201cI not only saw the pollution, I wiped it off my windowsills.\u201d Or consider the testimony of a city medical examiner: \u201cThe person who spent his life in the Adirondacks has nice pink lungs. The city dweller\u2019s are black as coal.\u201d You\u2019ve probably heard of Cleveland\u2019s Cuyahoga River <a href=\"https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/63\">catching fire</a>, but here\u2019s how the former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/nyregion/new-york-city-smog.html\">described</a> the Hudson south of Albany: \u201cOne great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.\u201d Everything that people say about the air and water in China and India right now was said of America\u2019s cities then.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\" data-alt=\"series box\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\">series box</a> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s no wonder that people mobilized: 20 million Americans took to the streets for the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-first-earth-day\">first Earth Day</a> in 1970 \u2013 10% of America\u2019s population at the time, perhaps the single greatest day of political protest in the country\u2019s history. And it worked. Worked politically because Congress quickly passed the <a href=\"https://archive.epa.gov/epa/aboutepa/epa-history-clean-air-act-1970.html\">Clean Air Act</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act\">Clean Water Act</a> and scientifically because those laws had the desired effect. In essence, they stuck enough filters on smokestacks, car exhausts and factory effluent pipes that, before long, the air and water were unmistakably cleaner. The nascent Environmental Protection Agency commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-us-cities-looked-like-before-epa-regulated-pollution-2019-8#barges-filled-with-new-yorks-waste-are-pulled-down-the-east-river-to-staten-island-landfill-in-the-1970s-new-york-produced-26000-tons-of-solid-waste-every-day-22\">series of photos</a> that showed just how filthy things were. Even for those of us who were alive then, it\u2019s hard to imagine that we tolerated this.</p> <p>But we should believe it, because now we face even greater challenges that we\u2019re doing next to nothing about. And one reason is you can\u2019t see them.</p> <p>The carbon dioxide molecule is invisible; at today\u2019s levels you can\u2019t see it or smell it, and it doesn\u2019t do anything to you. Carbon with one oxygen molecule? That\u2019s what kills you in a closed garage if you leave the car running. But two oxygen molecules? All that does is trap heat in the atmosphere. Melt ice caps. Raise seas. Change weather patterns. But slowly enough that most of the time, we don\u2019t quite see it.</p> <p>And it\u2019s a more complex moment for another reason. You can filter carbon monoxide easily. It\u2019s a trace gas, a tiny percentage of what comes from a power plant. But carbon dioxide is the exact opposite. It\u2019s most of what comes pouring out when you burn coal or gas or oil. There\u2019s no catalytic converter for CO<sub>2</sub>,<em><strong> </strong></em>which means you have to take down the fossil fuel industry.</p> <p>That in turn means you have to take on not just the oil companies but also the banks, asset managers and insurance companies that invest in them (and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-energy-assets-exclusive/exclusive-us-banks-prepare-to-seize-energy-assets-as-shale-boom-goes-bust-idUSKCN21R3JI\">may even own them</a>, in the wake of the current economic crash). You have to take on, that is, the heart of global capital.</p> <p>And so we are. <a href=\"https://stopthemoneypipeline.com/\">Stop the Money Pipeline</a>, a coalition of environmental and climate justice groups running from the small and specialized to the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, formed last fall to try to tackle the biggest money on earth. Banks like Chase \u2013 the planet\u2019s largest by market capitalization \u2013 which has funneled a <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2020/03/new-report-reveals-global-banks-funneled-27-trillion-fossil-fuels-paris\">quarter-trillion dollars</a> to the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement of 2015. Insurers like <a href=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/environmental/liberty-mutual-facing-mounting-pressure-to-exit-fossil-fuels-219312.aspx\">Liberty Mutual</a>, still insuring tar sands projects even as pipeline builders endanger Native communities by trying to build the Keystone XL <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/keystone-xl-pipeline-construction-2645607020.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\">during a pandemic</a>.</p> <p>This campaign sounds quixotic, but it seemed to be getting traction until the coronavirus pandemic hit. In January, BlackRock <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\">announced</a> that it was going to put climate at the heart of its investment analyses. Liberty Mutual, under similar pressure from activists, began to <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/liberty-mutual-adopts-coal-policy-in-response-to-public-pressure/\">edge away</a> from coal. And Chase \u2013 well, Earth Day would have seen activists engaging in civil disobedience in several thousand bank lobbies across America, sort of like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3MKcYUUHxw\">protest in January</a> that helped launch the campaign (and sent me, among others, off in handcuffs). But we called that off; there\u2019s no way we were going to risk carrying the microbe into jails, where the people already locked inside have little chance of social distancing.</p> <p>Still, the pandemic may be causing as much trouble for the fossil fuel industry as our campaign hoped to. With the demand for oil cratering, it\u2019s clear that these companies have no future. The divestment campaign that, over a decade, has enlisted $14tn in endowments and portfolios in the climate fight has a new head of steam.</p> <p>Our job \u2013 a more complex one than faced our Earth Day predecessors 50 years ago \u2013 is to force the spring. We need to speed the transition to the solar panels and wind turbines that engineers have worked so mightily to improve and are now the cheapest way to generate power. The only thing standing in the way is the political power of the fossil fuel companies, on clear display as <a href=\"https://psmag.com/news/trump-seeks-to-speed-up-oil-and-gas-projects\">Donald Trump</a> does everything in his power to preserve their dominance. That\u2019s hard to overcome. Hard but simple. Just as in 1970, it demands unrelenting pressure from citizens. That pressure is coming. Indigenous nations, frontline communities, faith groups, climate scientists and savvy investors are joining together, and their voices are getting louder. Seven million of us were in the streets <a href=\"https://www.ecowatch.com/global-climate-strikes-week-2640790405.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\">last September</a>. That\u2019s not 20 million, but it\u2019s on the way.</p> <p>We can\u2019t be on the streets right now. So we\u2019ll do what we can on the boulevards of the Internet. Join us for <a href=\"https://www.earthdaylive2020.org/\">Earth Day Live</a>, three days of digital activism beginning 22 April. We\u2019re in a race, and we\u2019re gaining fast.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Bill McKibben is an author and Schumann distinguished scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College, Vermont.

  "<p>We recently signed up to Mubi, which has a daily updated set of 20, usually pretty interesting, films, and I like that it shrinks the otherwise terrifying range of possibilities. Over the last week or two I\u2019ve seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/aug/19/1\">Primer</a>, Shane Carruth\u2019s rather brilliant debut, made for $7,000. It\u2019s a sort of naturalistic sci-fi, brilliantly conceived and made with such an unfussy, assured tone.</p> <p>We watched a couple of Joseph Losey films \u2013 I thought I might warm to him more but haven\u2019t. I liked the Brazilian film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/15/bacurau-review-kleber-mendonca-filho-sonia-braga\">Bacurau</a> a lot. Kleber Filho\u2019s other film, Neighbouring Sounds, is good too.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/01/how-we-made-outnumbered-claire-skinner-interview\">Outnumbered</a> with the kids. The writing is so good and the kids get a lot out of seeing versions of their own flailing parents represented on screen.</p> <p>The experience so far has confirmed what I already suspected: I am nothing like as good a parent as Ma [Brie Larson\u2019s character] in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/room-review-brie-larson-shines-in-a-dark-dungeon\">Room</a>; not as patient or resourceful. The TV would have been on 24/7 had it been me in charge. I suppose that the idea we were trying to capture is that scale is relative, that if you really pay attention to where you are there is more there than you think.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been at home so much and it is true that the place feels larger and more varied than it would crashing in at night after a day working. There are bad days but we are lucky in that we have enough space and a garden, and crucially an excellent dog. Most days are all right and it turns out that the place, or the idea of the place, is elastic enough to contain it all.</p> <p>I\u2019m not often drawn to films about contagions or global disasters or whatever. The high concept takes up so much energy when all the fundamental stuff about people is present in ordinary life. Maybe great work will come out of this moment but I\u2019d bet it won\u2019t be about the pandemic, not directly anyway.</p> <ul> <li><p>Normal People is available in full on the BBC iPlayer on 26 April; weekly double episodes begin on BBC One on 27 April.</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Yes, rappers and R&amp;B stars are still losing their minds while social distancing. As the at-home boredom grows, Cardi B is turning her streams into Bronx-flavored remakes of Pod Save America, interviewing Senator Bernie Sanders and cutting into mangos with her 4in acrylic nails. Drake\u2019s fragile ego is shining through showy displays of his mansion.</p> <p>And then there is Tekashi 6ix9ine, who has wasted no time returning to social media and buying expensive cars (where is he driving to right now?) after being released from prison early due to coronavirus fears.</p> <p>Their ability to spend hours on Instagram Live is hard to keep up with, but thankfully we\u2019re keeping track. After last month\u2019s first installment featuring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/28/cardi-b-lil-yachty-coronavirus-quarantine-isolation\">shaved eyebrows and isolation nudes</a>, here are some of the latest antics from hip-hop stars under quarantine.</p> <h2>Gucci Mane wishes coronavirus on all his haters</h2> <p>Coronavirus pandemic has been touted as helping bring the globe together, reminding many of our shared bonds. Musicians have pivoted to positivity with Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Elton John, et al appearing on feelgood TV specials. Gucci Mane has not received this memo.</p> <p>The Georgia rapper, who is collaborating with Gucci the brand, tweeted that he \u201cprays my haters die of coronavirus\u201d. Twitter users were quick to offer the rapper free psychoanalysis. \u201cOur enemies are just reflections of the parts of us we hate the most,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NaithanJones/status/1249339632661213184\">one wrote</a>.</p> <p>Gucci Mane has also taken to tweeting random platitudes during this time, as if he is workshopping lines for a self-help book. \u201cLuck favors the prepared,\u201d he wrote, and \u201cBe proactive, not reactive!\u201d Sure. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/gucci1017/status/1249315454797168641\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I pray my haters die of corona virus \ud83d\ude37</p>&mdash; Gucci Mane (@gucci1017) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gucci1017/status/1249315454797168641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Drake shows off his maxi-mansion</h2> <p>Drake decided to \u201cuplift\u201d the masses in a predictably Drake way: dancing around his empty mansion. The rapper released a showy video for his fast-rising hit, Toosie Slide, where he strolled around his mansion replete with marble counters and photos of himself.</p> <p>A few days later, he also showed off the gaudy, maximalist Toronto mansion for a feature in Architectural Digest. Featuring high-priced, hyped collaboration pieces such as a Takashi Murakami grand piano and Kaws artwork, the sprawling estate feels like Drake hired a 16-year-old Supreme obsessive to design the place.</p> <p>We can imagine the rapper sitting alone in the mansion at night with a glass of scotch by his side, the sound of his sadboi lyrics bouncing off the hollow walls.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWggTb45brM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xWggTb45brM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>Bhad Bhabie is Tarzan with a spray tan</h2> <p>A celebrity cancellation can occur even amid a pandemic. Rapper Bhad Bhabie (pronounced \u201cbad baby\u201d) was called out for sporting a fake tan so dark it bordered on brownface, and twerking on IG Live.</p> <p>Many believe the white Floridian\u2019s adoption of a \u201cblaccent\u201d (a claim white Australian rapper Iggy Azalea<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/04/how-a-white-australian-rapper-mastered-her-blaccent/\"> also faced</a>) and spray tans are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/14/blackfishing-black-is-cool-unless-youre-actually-black\">blackfishing</a>.

What is a producer battle, you might ask? Quite literally each producer plays songs he\u2019s worked on and exclaims how good it is. Confidence does not seem to be in scarcity in this career field.</p> <p>Babyface, who has created tracks for Toni Braxton, Mariah Carey and others, faced off against Teddy Riley, who is credited with creating new jack swing, discovering the Neptunes and produced for R&amp;B and pop heavyweights including Michael Jackson.</p> <p>It was set to be a big event, drawing in over 400K viewers, but the entire show was riddled with technical difficulties \u2013 mainly on Teddy Riley\u2019s side. Riley\u2019s speakers kept malfunctioning and the stream was glitchy. At one point R&amp;B singer Toni Braxton tweeted her frustrations: \u201cAre we really starting over? I\u2019m sorry I gotta make dinner, this is like watching old folks use Jitterbug phones.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, Babyface put us all out of our misery and decided to reschedule.

Of course, things started with Sanders asking Cardi how his nails look. Her response? \u201cMmm, I can tell you been in quarantine.\u201d</p> <p>Cardi did not bite her tongue during the conversation. She touched on privacy fears around contact tracing to higher stimulus checks to the outsized sway of moderate voters. She criticized Trump for not taking coronavirus seriously at first. \u201cThey put capitalism, money, goods, trading before our health,\u201d she argued, while donning an anime-style blue wig that featured two giant hair bows on each side.

  "<p>As the US grapples with when \u2013 and how \u2013 Americans can return to work about 27,000 Boeing employees are preparing to resume commercial airplane production in Washington state this week. The move is being closely watched.</p> <p>The decision came almost a month after the company halted work at facilities in the state in response to the mounting threat of the virus. Boeing is the US\u2019s largest export manufacturer and its peers are carefully monitoring the company\u2019s decision to get back to work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/boeing-culture-concealment-fatal-737-max-crashes-report\">Boeing's 'culture of concealment' led to fatal 737 Max crashes, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But with at least two weeks still to go before Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s stay-home mandate is set to expire, which involves the closure of all non-essential companies (Boeing is considered essential), and potentially even longer before comprehensive coronavirus testing is in place, some employees say they are worried for their safety and are questioning why Boeing is rushing to open its doors in the middle of a pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cPart of me feels thankful that we\u2019re still employed, but the other part of me is kind of scared,\u201d said a Boeing employee who works in production support for the 767 airplane and will return to the facility in Everett, Washington, on Tuesday. She asked not to be identified to protect her job.</p> <p>The employee, who has asthma, said she was up until 4am the previous night, worried about being able to stay healthy on the job.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just scary to me, because I know what it feels like to not be able to breathe,\u201d said the employee, who has worked for the company for over a decade. \u201cThe way this disease gets you, you just basically suffocate.\u201d</p> <p>Boeing also restarted work at production facilities in the Philadelphia area this week. Pennsylvania has a stay-at-home order in place for non-essential workers until 8 May that has led to protests by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/us-protests-lockdown-coronavirus-cases-surge-warning\">anti-lockdown groups</a>.</p> <p>In a statement released last week, Boeing said it would require face coverings, offer voluntary temperature screening and stagger start times so there will be fewer employees coming and going at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cThis phased approach ensures we have a reliable supply base, our personal protective equipment is readily available and we have all of the necessary safety measures in place to resume essential work for our customers,\u201d Stan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes and senior executive in the Pacific north-west, said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c841455d564e4d2151ec842157d5d9309bfe1f12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c841455d564e4d2151ec842157d5d9309bfe1f12/0_728_5058_3035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers arrive at the Boeing facility in Renton, Washington, on 21 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers arrive at the Boeing facility in Renton, Washington, on 21 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company also said all employees able to work from home can continue to do so. And if a worker does get coronavirus, officials will conduct contact tracing to limit the risk to other workers.</p> <p>\u201cWe have talked about the prospect of Boeing reopening because they are essential, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve committed to a robust use of PPE [personal protective equipment] and workplace hygiene,\u201d Inslee said during a press conference. \u201cWe hope to get more details on that, and our agencies will keep talking with them to ensure workers feel safe going to work.\u201d</p> <p>Washington, which reported the first case of coronavirus in the US and for weeks documented the most cases in the country, has since made progress with flattening the curve of infections thanks to its early and comprehensive response.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">as numbers continue to rise</a>, officials have been wary about easing restrictions. As of Saturday, the state has confirmed more than 11,700 cases, including 634 deaths.</p> <p>More than a dozen Boeing employees in the Puget Sound region have been infected with coronavirus, including one worker in Everett who died after getting the virus, according to <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/\">the Seattle Times.</a></p> <p>In a letter sent to members of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) District 751, which represents about 32,000 Boeing machinists in the Puget Sound region, the union clarified that employees do have the option to stay home.</p> <p>If an employee is high-risk, needs to care for children, has a sick family member, or is simply worried about working at the facilities during the pandemic, they can use vacation, sick leave or excused leave without pay (LWOP), the letter explained. Some of these employees may also qualify for unemployment insurance benefits.</p> <p>But for those who will be returning, the letter stressed that they \u201chave a right to a safe work environment and should be provided with all the proper personal protective equipment\u201d.</p> <p>After the news broke that Boeing would be reopening its facilities in Washington, workers and local community members alike took to social media to speak out. While there were some who expressed their relief that the facilities were opening and predicted this could prompt additional businesses to follow suit, many others voiced their concern about what this could mean for their health and that of their loved ones.</p> <p>One woman <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/seattletimes/posts/10158081231056215\">posted on Facebook </a>that she is a pregnant wife of a Boeing employee and wants the facilities to stay closed until it is safe.</p> <p>\u201cPutting your life and possibly a unborn child\u2019s [sic] life in jeopardy isn\u2019t something I\u2019d like to do thank you very much! How are they going to prevent this from spreading,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>An inspector at Boeing, who works off-site at the company\u2019s supplier partners, told the Guardian that he\u2019s not as concerned for his safety at work, as he believes the threat of the virus has been \u201csomewhat blown out of proportion\u201d.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/olafur-eliasson\">Olafur Eliasson</a> says he wants the public to be the artist for his latest work but it may not be a straightforward task \u2013 we are urged to rethink how we see the planet Earth.</p> <p>To mark <a href=\"https://www.earthday.org/earth-day-2020/\">Earth Day 2020</a>, Eliasson has begin to release what could be one of his most ambitious works in that it invites mass participation on a global scale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bfa2dcc08f9c8ec4bfe406800529c1d1495f5dea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfa2dcc08f9c8ec4bfe406800529c1d1495f5dea/1366_0_2264_2831/800.jpg\" alt=\"Olafur Eliasson\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olafur Eliasson: \u2018Maybe it is not the planet which is in danger.

People should stare at the dot for 10 seconds and then focus on a blank surface where an afterimage will appear in different colours. That in effect is our work of art \u2013 a new view of the world.</p> <p>Eliasson admitted it was not an easy subject. \u201cThe wonderful idea of Earth Day allows one to take a step back, look at the planet from the outside and recognise that it is an object that is so hard and impossible to comprehend. It sort of escapes us.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a bit like the climate, it is so vast and abstract and full of numbers and crazy people \u2026 how on earth am I going to help? Or have an opinion on it?\u201d</p> <p>The work, titled Earth perspectives, is about encouraging people to reflect on the co-existence of multiple world views. The after-image is a kind of \u201cice breaker\u201d for bigger conversations, Eliasson said. There are many ways of thinking about it.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it is not the planet which is in danger. It is in fact us, the human race, making itself extinct. The planet will be fine. Give it a few thousand years after the humans have fucked up everything and the Earth will thrive and be green and be wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>The nine images of Earth will be shown with different places at their centre.

  "<p>Anne Shirley, the fearless Canadian literary heroine, always speaks her mind.</p> <p>The outspoken orphan who first appeared in Lucy Maud Montgomery\u2019s 1908 novel, Anne of Green Gables, has since appeared in countless movies and television spinoffs \u2013 and built a loyal global following.</p> <p>So it should probably come as little surprise that fans of the show\u2019s latest remake \u2013 the TV series Anne With an E <em>\u2013 </em>are fiercely protective of their heroine. And like Anne, they\u2019re willing to fight for what they believe in.</p> <p>The shows coproducers, Netflix and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), announced in November that the drama would be cancelled after three seasons.</p> <p>But CBC\u2019s statement that the final season would bring a \u201csatisfying conclusion to Anne\u2019s journey\u201d did little to placate fans.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were outraged. The cast and the crew were also blindsided by it,\u201d said Lisa E, a Toronto-based organizer with AWAE Fan Projects. \u201cEveryone loves the show obviously. They just couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p> <p>The day after the announcement, the group took to Twitter with rallying cry: renew the show.</p> <p>The group, whose organizers live in Canada, the United States and throughout Europe, quickly raised thousands of dollars to amplify their message, placing five billboards in downtown Toronto and New York\u2019s Times Square.</p> <p>Nearly 300,000 fans signed a petition on Change.org demanding the series be renewed for another season.</p> <p>But the group\u2019s most successful \u2013 and most controversial \u2013 campaign has been a digital, guerilla-style battle against the two companies.</p> <p>Members of the group have swarmed the comments section of CBC news stories to demand the show\u2019s revival, and posted more than 13m tweets directed at CBC and Netflix. This week, the group arrived en masse in the comments section of Netflix\u2019s quarterly earnings\u2019 call on Youtube.</p> <p>Matters came to a head on Sunday, when the CBC said it would begin block any \u201cAnne-related comments\u201d from news stories.</p> <p>\u201cMy sense is that CBC has not dealt with a sustained siege like this before,\u201d said one of the group\u2019s organizers, Rachel G, who lives in New York City.</p> <p>She argued that the public broadcaster \u2013 in using social media to increase user engagement \u2013 has opened itself up to these broadsides.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of times, CBC\u2019s engagement questions on Twitter are things like \u2018What\u2019s your favourite charcuterie?,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy to go in there and say \u2018Hey, in this episode of Anne With an E,<em> </em>Gilbert ate meat \u2013 and also renew Anne With an E!<em>\u201d</em></p> <p>In November, CBC Kids <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews/post/some-of-the-drama-around-anne-with-an-e-cancellation-could-be-fake\">published an article</a> suggesting the group was using bots to artificially inflate its influence.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the accounts were created this month, they don\u2019t have profile pics, their usernames are generic names followed by strings of numbers and they don\u2019t have any followers,\u201d the article said.</p> <p>\u201cOf course they were just created that day,\u201d responded Rachel . \u201cI\u2019m not going to go on my personal Twitter and start tweeting about Anne With an E hundreds of times in one day.\u201d</p> <p> The show has been praised for its unflinching portrayal of, slavery, Indigenous experiences, sexual assault and feminism.</p> <p>\u201cAs a woman of colour, there\u2019s always been this tension for me watching period dramas \u2013 I don\u2019t really see the point of adapting 19th- or 18th-century work if you\u2019re not going to move forward in some way,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cI feel like Anne With an E really tackled stories of people who have always existed but were ignored by television dramas. And it did so in such a beautiful and sensitive way.\u201d</p> <p>To see the show cancelled with no reason given makes little sense, she said. \u201cI\u2019m an analytical person and with the metrics we have about how successful it is \u2026 I just don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> <p>Both Lisa and Rachel admit the odds are low that the show will ever return to offer closure.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s television, right? It\u2019s not changing the world,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cBut there are just so few shows today that so joyfully optimistic, inclusive and representative. And that\u2019s worth fighting for.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The warehouse appears unremarkable, except for its size. Just off a motorway on an industrial estate in Merseyside sits a 35,000 sq m (377,000 sq ft) purpose-built warehouse with 20 loading docks to enable the storage and rapid distribution of hundreds of millions of face masks, aprons, gowns, gloves and body bags.</p> <p>For security reasons, the Guardian has been asked not to disclose the precise location of the UK\u2019s stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in a pandemic. It is being stored on a site where builders moved the equivalent of more than 90 Olympic\u2013size swimming pools of earth to make way for a vast, climate-controlled warehouse.</p> <p>However, the Guardian can reveal that the management and the distribution of the stockpile has been outsourced to a private company, Movianto, which was sold two weeks ago for $133m (\u00a3107m) by its owner, a large US healthcare group.</p> <p>The fact that Movianto was being sold in the midst of a global pandemic, months after being instructed by the UK government to start mobilising the PPE supply, would be remarkable enough. But the sale is only the latest development in a turbulent 18 months for Movianto, which has included legal disputes with a property developer who built the enormous warehouse in Merseyside.</p> <p>The disputes culminated in Movianto securing a high court injunction in March last year, to thwart threats by the developer, Oliver Morley, to \u201clock the gates\u201d and prevent Movianto employees from accessing the warehoused stock.</p> <p>Morley\u2019s company has since gone into administration and its legal claims against Movianto have been discontinued, but Morley maintains his legal battles with Movianto were not over. He called for an investigation into the firm, alleging there was \u201ca much bigger story that needs to be told\u201d about his former tenant, but declined to provide specific details.</p> <p>For its part, Movianto firmly dismisses all of Morley\u2019s allegations, pointing out that his property firm was defeated last year in court. The company insists the legal disputes and the sale have had no impact on its storage or distribution of PPE in recent months.</p> <p>\u201cMovianto firmly believes that it has and continues to perform to all contractual obligations,\u201d the firm said.</p> <p>But the saga is likely to put a spotlight on the UK government\u2019s decision to outsource the management of the emergency stockpile. In three years, the stockpile appears to have been stored in three different warehouses. Meanwhile, management of the stock has been passed from a German\u2013owned multinational to an American one.</p> <p>In the coming months the custody of the UK\u2019s emergency stockpile of PPE will be passed on to a family-run business based in suburban Paris.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: \u201cThe pandemic influenza stockpile held under this contract has remained safely and securely stored at all times and has supported our Covid-19 response through the distribution of vital personal protective equipment and essential supplies to the NHS and social care sector.\u201d</p> <h2>PPE provision</h2> <p>Widespread shortages of PPE have dominated complaints over the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, including from NHS workers who say their lives are being endangered by the lack of adequate protection. This week an RAF plane was dispatched to Turkey to secure more supplies.</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is rising to the challenge, and has repeatedly said the PPE challenge has been \u201cone of distribution rather than one of supply\u201d. In addition to procuring new supplies from China, the DHSC has been drawing on the emergency stockpile, which it has stored since 2006 under its pandemic influenza preparedness programme.</p> <p>That stockpile is made up of around 52,000 pallets of equipment worth an estimated \u00a3500m. While it contains antiviral medicines and flu vaccines which are of limited use against Covid-19, the bulk of stocks are said to be PPE and hygiene products. Much of the stock needs to be frequently monitored, updated and stored in temperature\u2013controlled conditions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc5a97820aa522ff0d6d7e268bbbb7ee2eb3fc26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc5a97820aa522ff0d6d7e268bbbb7ee2eb3fc26/0_165_2769_1662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The warehouse where 52,000 pallets of PPE and other flu pandemic supplies are stored.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The warehouse where 52,000 pallets of PPE and other flu pandemic supplies are stored.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Waugh/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government owns the stock, but outsources its management to private firms. Previously, the contract was held by DHL. Movianto, a subsidiary of the US health company Owens &amp; Minor, won the \u00a355m deal in the summer of 2018.</p> <p>As part of Movianto\u2019s plans, the company entered into business with Morley to build the vast warehouse in Merseyside. In the meantime, the pandemic stockpile was to be temporarily housed in another warehouse, also owned by Morley, in Knowsley.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It got to the point where I said I\u2019m going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Movianto\u2019s plans were approved by the Cabinet Office, documents suggest. The company says its decision to enter into business with Morley was \u201cmade by executives no longer associated with Movianto\u201d.</p> <p>A notice for the new NHS contract stipulated that the contractor would be required to maintain \u201ca ready state for deployment in the event of a pandemic event\u201d.</p> <p>In early 2019, Movianto became mired in disputes with Morley\u2019s company, which accused the firm of not paying rent for the warehouse in Knowsley. According to Morley, his tenants became \u201cuncooperative\u201d. \u201cThis went on for weeks,\u201d he said. Movianto strongly rejects the allegation, saying it paid rent \u201cin accordance with the terms of the lease\u201d.</p> <p>Another grievance related to the payment of electricity bills to power the generators to ensure the stock, including medicines, was stored at the right temperature. Morley claims he ended up having to pay for electricity to power the generators, which \u201ckept going on the blink\u201d resulting, he alleges, in \u201ctemperature spikes\u201d.</p> <p>A Movianto source said Morley\u2019s account was inaccurate. In a statement, Movianto said electricity generators were only needed because of \u201cMorley\u2019s own failure to provide a mains supply in accordance with his contractual obligations\u201d.</p> <p>By his own account, Morley\u2019s financial disputes with Movianto culminated in him threatening the firm. \u201cIt got to the point where I said I\u2019m just going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.\u201d When that happened, Movianto rushed to the high court in March 2019 and successfully obtained an injunction to ensure continued access to the warehouse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

It said Morley\u2019s allegations over rent and generators were undermined by \u201cvarious court proceedings\u201d that ruled in Movianto\u2019s favour. In July 2019, under the control of administrators, Morley\u2019s property company Industrial North West LLP discontinued its legal claims against Movianto.</p> <h2>More challenges ahead</h2> <p>Morley insists he will continue to seek legal action against Movianto \u2013 and he is used to high-profile disputes. In January, he lost a prominent lawsuit against RBS in which he claimed the bank\u2019s controversial restructuring group placed him under duress by seizing his assets after struggling to repay a \u00a375m loan. A high court judge noted Morley used the \u201cborrowed personal wealth\u201d to spend on \u201cSouth African mining investments, property, cars, a yacht and a jet\u201d.</p> <p>Morley told the Guardian his lifestyle was the result of hard work and \u201chad nothing to do with being a good landlord\u201d. He insists previous business disputes are irrelevant to his grievances against Movianto, which came to a head in May 2019.</p> <p>As works were completed at the Merseyside warehouse and Movianto prepared to transfer the stockpile from Knowsley, Industrial North West was forced into administration. Documents state the firm \u201cfailed to comply\u201d with the conditions of a \u00a361m loan facility.</p> <p>Morley lost control of his warehouses and administrators stepped in. According to the administrator\u2019s report, the legal dispute \u201ccaused delays to the construction works\u201d at the new warehouse, which were finally completed in July 2019. Movianto said the legal disputes \u201chave had no impact on Movianto\u2019s work in response to Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>According to a government source, the transfer of the UK\u2019s emergency PPE supplies to the new warehouse was completed by the end of August 2019, four months before the first cases of Covid-19 emerged in China.</p> <p>The warehouse is now owned by Warrington council, which bought the property for \u00a345m in October. During a change of shifts on Tuesday afternoon, warehouse workers were seen having their car boots searched as they left.</p> <p>In the coming months, their employer will switch from Owens &amp; Minor to the French company EHDH Holding Group, under a deal agreed on 6 April. The sale is expected to be completed before the end of June, with demand for supplies in the UK\u2019s pandemic stockpile expected to continue for many months.</p> <p>The distribution of that stockpile\u2019s PPE, it seems, may no longer solely be the responsibility of Movianto. Eleven days ago, the DHSC announced a new \u201c24/7 military operation\u201d to oversee the supply of PPE to health and care workers. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch,\u201d Hancock said.</p> <p>A government source said the coronavirus outbreak presented different requirements to a flu pandemic \u2013 the basis of Movianto\u2019s original contract. Movianto was now \u201csupporting\u201d the government\u2019s PPE plan through its contractual obligations, the source said.

  "<p>UK guidance urging the over-70s to take particular care to observe social distancing and avoid contact with people outside the home is leaving people aged 60 to 69 at increased risk from coronavirus, say scientists.</p> <p>Prof Azeem Majeed and colleagues at Imperial College London (ICL) noted that other countries had different policies and the World Health Organization said the highest risk was in over-60s.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/\">paper published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine</a> at Oxford University, the death rate among people in their 70s is 8%, and the rate among those in their 60s is 3.6%, which the ICL scientists said was \u201cstill substantial\u201d.</p> <p>They recommend that the 7.3 million people in their 60s in the UK should be more careful about physical distancing and personal hygiene. </p> <p>\u201cIn the absence of government guidance, people in this group (60-69) can make their own informed decisions on how to minimise their risks of Covid-19 infection. This can include isolating themselves in a similar manner to that recommended by the UK government for people aged 70 years and over,\u201d they said in a paper <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0141076820921107\">published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the severity of the disease increases from the age of 40 years, those above the age of 60 years and those with underlying medical conditions including, but not limited to, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases and cancers are at the highest risk.\u201d</p> <p>They cited international evidence that over-60s are at higher risk. \u201cThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 80% of Covid-19-related deaths are in those aged 65 years and over,\u201d they said. In China, 80% of deaths were in the over-60s.</p> <p>Switzerland and France were among the countries that advised over-65s to take greater precautions against infection, they added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Other scientists agree there is a cause for concern about the 60-69 age group. Dr Tom Wingfield from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cIt would be helpful to see what evidence was used to inform the UK government\u2019s decision to define people over 70 years old as a high-risk group rather than using a lower age threshold such as 60 or 65 years old. This is a really important issue for the general public when we consider that more than 7 million people in the UK are aged between 60 and 69 years old.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition to the general public, it is also vital that carers and key workers who are aged over 60, including those returning from retirement to work in the NHS and other social care settings, are provided with accurate information to be able to make informed decisions about minimising their own risk from Covid-19.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 April 2020 to clarify the UK lockdown measures for people over 70.</p>",
  "<p>Recently, petrolhead pundit Jeremy Clarkson was thought to have disgraced himself by pointing out that the hi-tech sea yacht used by Greta Thunberg for her transatlantic crossing, for all its solar panels and underwater turbines, had an old-fashioned diesel engine aboard for emergencies. I thought about Clarkson\u2019s jibe while watching this refreshingly contrarian eco-documentary from environmentalist Jeff Gibbs, which has been uploaded for free online viewing by its executive producer, Michael Moore.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/28/climate-dangerous-documentary-planet-of-the-humans-michael-moore-taken-down\">Climate experts call for 'dangerous' Michael Moore film to be taken down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gibbs has a cheeky habit of going backstage at music festivals that solemnly declare themselves to be using 100% renewable energy, only to find that the fancy array of solar panels behind the tent is enough to power a single bass guitar. The rest of the energy is provided by just plugging into the shameful old electricity grid, provided by fossil fuels. He sees it as symptomatic of the mainstream environmental movement, running on delusional piety.</p> <p>All the green, liberal A-listers \u2013 Bill McKibben, Al Gore, Van Jones, Robert F Kennedy Jr \u2013 are attacked in this film as a pompous and complacent high-priest caste of the environmental movement, who are shilling for a fossil fuel industry that has sneakily taken them over. (Although it should be said that, for all his radical bravado, Gibbs does not dare criticise Thunberg.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pXCftKF4uI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4pXCftKF4uI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Big Oil and its corporate and banking representatives have, according to this film, found a way to rebrand themselves as green or greenish, to use the green movement for their own ends, and to get their mitts on the huge subsidies that taxpayers around the world are handing over to anyone claiming to be developing renewable energy resources, which turn out to be the same old fossil-fuel entities in different packaging.</p> <p>Solar panels and wind turbines? These provide no energy when there is no sun or wind and degrade after only a few decades, says Gibbs. And in any case they need a lot of fossil fuels in their manufacture: silicon, cobalt, silver, graphite, rare earths \u2013 and of course coal. The same goes for manufacturing storage batteries. Factories claiming to have gone \u201cbeyond coal\u201d again and again turn out to be relying on natural gas. Corporate behemoths such as Apple make spurious claims for their energy usage. But how about the ultra-fashionable new \u201crenewable\u201d energy source: biomass or wood-chips? This is basically a colossal logging industry that requires a lot of fossil fuel energy to harvest and transport the material. As Gibbs\u2019 interviewees point out, you might just as well as burn the fossil fuels in the first place. And it is laying waste rainforests and areas of natural beauty.</p> <p>This, says Gibbs, is the queasy merger of environmentalism and capitalism \u2013 and he makes a refreshingly sceptical case. But he takes it further, suggesting that unfettered capitalism and its insanity of eternal growth on a finite planet is also what is leading us to the cliff edge. True enough, although his comments on overpopulation have an unintentionally ironic chime, in the middle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">the Covid-19 outbreak</a>.</p> <p>Most chillingly of all, Gibbs at one stage of the film appears to suggest that there is no cure for any of this, that, just as humans are mortal, so the species itself is staring its own mortality in the face. But he appears to back away from that view by the end, saying merely that things need to change. But what things and how?</p> <p>It\u2019s not at all clear. I found myself thinking of Robert Stone\u2019s controversial 2013 documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/07/pandoras-promise-review\">Pandora\u2019s Promise</a>, which made a revisionist case for nuclear power: a clean energy source that (allegedly) has cleaned up its act on safety and really can provide for our wholesale energy needs without contributing to climate change, in a way that \u201crenewables\u201d can\u2019t.</p> <p>Gibbs doesn\u2019t mention nuclear and \u2013 a little lamely, perhaps \u2013 has no clear lesson or moral, other than the need to take a fiercely critical look at the environmental establishment. Well, it\u2019s always valuable to re-examine a sacred cow.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk11vI-7czE\">Planet of the Humans is available on YouTube</a>.</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>You don\u2019t have to earn your food. I didn\u2019t think that in the middle of a global crisis I would have to write this, but I do \u2013 and you need to hear it. You don\u2019t have to earn your food.</p> <p>On Monday night, the BBC aired a Horizon show called The Restaurant That Burns Off Calories. The premise was, simply put, that out the back of the restaurant was a gym where a group of people would show how long a person might have to exercise in order to \u201cburn off\u201d the calories contained in the restaurant\u2019s dishes. There was some chat about genetics and the calories that a body burns simply by existing, but at its core was a focus on calories in, calories out. The premise was simple: earn the food you eat, and you\u2019ll be OK.</p> <p>For many of us, this way of thinking is more harmful now than ever. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelenlouWest\">Helen West</a> is a registered dietician and author who works extensively with people with eating disorders. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that most of us are struggling in one way or another with the stress and uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and lockdown,\u201d she shares. \u201cThere are many people who haven\u2019t been formally diagnosed with an eating disorder, but struggle daily with food and exercise obsession.\u201d</p> <p>Access to food is uncertain, with trips to the shops anxiety-inducing for even the most mentally \u201cwell\u201d among us. Normal foods might be off-limits. Your cupboards might be disconcertingly bare or unusually full. You might be restlessly pacing or barely moving from your bed. Perhaps your days are stretching unnervingly long ahead of you, and food has become a source of precious comfort. Maybe your stomach is tied in knots with the stress of it all. Others will find themselves busier than ever \u2013 sometimes too hungry, other times too full, seldom able to fall into step with the rhythms of their own hunger.</p> <p>For those with eating disorders, the situation is even more difficult. The services many rely on might have been <a href=\"https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/news/beat-news/coronavirus-what-done-so-far\">stripped back</a> or stopped altogether. In the face of endless talk of health and personal responsibility, some might find their food guilt has gone into overdrive. Maybe, like me, you become stressed if you feel like your future food supply is uncertain, and you fall into disordered behaviours to quell the rising panic. When the Horizon show aired, the UK\u2019s leading eating disorder charity, Beat, kept its support services open after hours to provide a lifeline for those affected. \u201cOur services have sadly been in high demand tonight,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beatED/status/1252351241813807107?s=20\">they tweeted</a>, along with an appeal for donations.</p> <p>Despite the very clear guidelines issued by <a href=\"https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/media-centre/media-guidelines\">charities such as Beat</a>, these dangerous messages proliferate. I should not have to explain that directly equating food eaten with an exercise \u201cequivalent\u201d can serve as a bulimia \u201chow-to\u201d. I should not have to go against the moral of a show commissioned and aired by our national broadcaster when I say that positioning health as an individual \u201cchoice\u201d could be harmful, even lethal, for those with eating disorders. I shouldn\u2019t have to point out that positing food as something to be \u201cearned\u201d will only compound the guilt and self-blame of those who struggle with binge eating. It shouldn\u2019t be on me \u2013 a person who struggled with disordered eating for many years, and continues to live with its echo \u2013 to insist that programming doesn\u2019t entrench precisely the kind of obsessive, unhappy, self-castigating mindsets that eating disorder therapists, clinics and patients work for years to overcome.</p> <p>There is the question of fatness, too: the fear of which is woven deep into the fabric of the Horizon show, from fearmongering about the \u201cobesity epidemic\u201d to using bigger bodies as cautionary tales. There is vibrant and plentiful literature on why fatness and fat people are wrongfully demonised, on the institutional medical bias against fat people and on the massive traumas that fat people face as a result of society\u2019s attitudes. I advise everyone to seek out those voices and to learn from them, but for now I will say this: fatness and thinness are not moral triumphs or failures. There is no inherent virtue in thinness, nor in health (however it is conceived), and those who try to convince you otherwise do so at enormous cost to fat people, to those living with disabilities, to those with eating disorders and to the great many people who inhabit more than one of those identities. When we champion the idea of the perfect, responsible \u201cgood\u201d body \u2013 especially in the midst of a pandemic \u2013 what are we saying about the worth, the specialness, of people whose bodies (or minds) don\u2019t conform?</p> <p>We need to reach beyond ourselves \u2013 if we are well enough to do so \u2013 and have a shot at reconfiguring some of the bigger problems that give rise to such widespread food anxiety and fatphobia. We need to untangle ourselves from the idea that there is one true measure of health and instead turn our focus towards a more nebulous kind of wellbeing: one which digs not into the particulars of your diet, but which foregrounds justice, connectedness, solidarity and care. You\u2019re worthy of care because you exist. Your value can\u2019t be measured in calories.</p> <p>A calorie is no measure of the world. It doesn\u2019t capture the crunch of a breadcrumb coating around milky pale rings of calamari or the garlic kick of aioli. The calories in a bowl of tomato soup with bread and butter speak to something abstract and cold \u2013 the amount energy it might release under laboratory conditions \u2013 and say nothing of the comfort you feel or the pleasure you take. A calorie doesn\u2019t know about your contented bloat or the salty sharp miracle of an olive in a mouthful of pasta \u2013 it is just the energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by 1\u00b0C.

  "<p>To its profit and enduring loss, there is probably no city in human history that has been more promiscuously imagined than Los Angeles. For the better part of the century, most of the planet\u2019s population has seen some version of LA depicted in film and on television: a windblown dream of palm trees swaying within the same cliched confines. A blue-skied neverland of beauty, youth and pleasure alternates with a secret underbelly of corruption and sin in the dialectic of \u201csunshine and noir\u201d, first described by Mike Davis 30 years ago in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/mar/23/books-about-los-angeles-readers-picks\">City of Quartz</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/mar/23/books-about-los-angeles-readers-picks\">,</a> which remains the best book written about LA.</p> <p>The Los Angeles of popular imagination is a place without history, without politics, and almost entirely without brown people. Except for the freeways and the bright bougainvillea, it bears little resemblance to the vast and vital multilingual, largely working-class, viciously unequal and still painfully segregated city of immigrants that those of us who have lived there have come to love.</p> <p>Davis, who grew up in the industrial exurbs east of the city, has played a unique role in contemporary scholarship, emerging from outside the academy as a hard-eyed Marxist analyst of astonishing insight and range. His more than a dozen books, invariably as apocalyptic as they are brilliant, include analyses of colonial-era <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jan/20/historybooks.famine\">famines</a> and of the global rise of slums, a history of car bombs, and a distressingly prescient account of the pandemic threat of avian flu. Again and again, though, Davis\u2019s work returns to Los Angeles. His latest, <em>Set the Night on Fire: LA in the Sixties</em>, co-authored with the journalist and historian Jon Wiener, focuses on a single decade, a transformative one for the city and for its authors, who as young men were active in the civil rights and anti-war movements.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1bbc5eff4f2ddde113d52d4d13b157be4cd8ce7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1bbc5eff4f2ddde113d52d4d13b157be4cd8ce7/0_0_3008_1805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A street in LA in 1965 during the riots.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street in LA in 1965 during the riots.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Ray/The LIFE Picture Collection via</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In their introduction they classify <em>Set the Night on Fire</em> as a \u201cmovement history\u201d \u2013 an attempt to gain ground in the battle for LA\u2019s soul by rescuing the city\u2019s past from the strategic amnesia and propagandistic whitewashing that the great LA poet Sesshu Foster calls the \u201cpoison alzheimer\u2019s of the <a href=\"https://verse.press/poem/the-apartheid-imagination-2326036143330194035\">apartheid imagination</a>\u201d. The 1960s, after all, have been subjected to the same sort of censorial mythmaking as the city itself, facing, in the authors\u2019 words, a \u201crelentless campaign\u201d to \u201crewrite history from the standpoint of wealthy white men\u201d, cutting out the black, brown and working-class men and women \u2013 and often boys and girls \u2013 who are the heroes of this book, along with the feminist, gay and white radical activists who fought alongside them in parallel and often intersecting struggles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The flower children who dominate mythic perceptions of the 60s show up here only peripherally, as minor roles in a larger drama</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The 60s depicted here depart from the \u201cstandard narrative\u201d of the decade that has emerged even on the left, in which university students, predominantly white and middle class, were \u201cthe principal social actors\u201d, and protest radiated out from a few large and storied campuses. In LA, by contrast, the major battles occurred in high schools and even junior high schools in the city\u2019s ghettoised black and Mexican neighbourhoods. The flower children who dominate mythic perceptions of the 60s show up here only peripherally, as minor roles in a larger drama, worthy of notice only when they throw their shoulders into the fight.</p> <p>To their credit, Davis and Wiener do not attempt to squeeze those tumultuous years into a single frame. Their approach is encyclopedic rather than narrative. And at nearly 800 pages, <em>Set the Night on Fire </em>is frankly monumental. It covers, in roughly chronological order, such diverse topics as early desegregation battles, the city\u2019s pioneering gay rights movement, its role in the birth of the Black Power movement, the rise of alternative media, draft resisters, activist nuns and the massive high school \u201cblowouts\u201d that rocked the Chicano east side in the spring of 1968. In this telling, the decade lasted until 1973, when the defeat at the polls of the city\u2019s aggressively racist mayor Sam Yorty (his Washington Post<em> </em>obituary described him as \u201ccolourfully cantankerous\u201d) by an African American city councilman named Tom Bradley brought the era of protest and revolt to an end, if not a resolution.</p> <p>This broad sweep nonetheless circles back to one \u201cissue of issues\u201d: \u201cthe dynamic tectonics of racial segregation\u201d. The thousands of African Americans who migrated to Los Angeles from the Jim Crow south had found similar cruel realities awaiting them. Federal housing policies and local white supremacists \u2013 elsewhere known as \u201crealtors\u201d \u2013 combined to close much of the city to non-whites. The central north-south spine of Alameda Street formed a \u201ccotton curtain\u201d that black people could not safely cross, a divide brutally enforced by vigilante white gangs as well as by the city\u2019s police. Racial segregation in the public schools was, and in many cases remains, almost absolute. In 1964, James Baldwin would write: \u201cThere is not one step, one inch, no distance, morally or actually, between Birmingham [Alabama] and Los Angeles.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a6c797b33b95353583325d8c23cc902683cf459\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a6c797b33b95353583325d8c23cc902683cf459/0_503_4210_2525/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A National Guardsman after the Watts riots, August 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A National Guardsman after the Watts riots, August 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of this book, then, is devoted to the struggle for racial justice, from the campaigns for housing equality at the beginning of the decade to the mass student strikes in black and Chicano neighbourhoods at the end. The Watts rebellion of 1965, which left 34 dead \u2013 most of them shot by police and National Guardsmen \u2013 more than 1,000 injured, and a commercial district in flames receives close and careful treatment. It is characterised, refreshingly, not as a blind outburst of rage, but as a rational and even strategic response to a homicidal status quo. Davis and Wiener devote a full chapter to the Watts renaissance, the artistic awakening that emerged from the ashes of the uprising and that included the assemblage art movement that came out of Noah Purifoy\u2019s leadership of the Watts Towers Arts Center, the influential Watts Writers Workshop and the extraordinary jazz collective the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/02/jazz-album-covers\">Pan African People\u2019s Arkestra.</a></p> <p>If it lacks a single hero, <em>Set the Night on Fire </em>features one recurring villain: the Los Angeles Police Department. LA\u2019s police make dramatic appearances in almost every chapter, clubbing peaceful protesters, brutalising activists and killing so many black men, and with such absolute impunity, that Davis and Wiener\u2019s claim that \u201cthe Manson gang were bit players compared to the forces of law and order\u201d ends up feeling more than fair. In the authors\u2019 telling, the wanton violence of the police acted as a consistent if unwitting catalyst to historical change: it was the chaos that followed a ferocious LAPD assault on anti-war protesters that added to Lyndon Johnson\u2019s decision not to run for re-election in 1968, and the LAPD\u2019s murder of a black Muslim named Ronald Stokes \u2013 seven other Muslims were shot in the same incident \u2013 that pushed Malcolm X towards a broader vision of black liberation. The shared experience of LAPD violence, Davis and Wiener write, forged a \u201ccommon culture of resistance\u201d among black and Chicano youth, white hipsters and anti-war activists, and the city\u2019s gay community.</p> <p>Los Angeles is in many ways a different place from the on it was in the 1960s. A once majority white region is now largely Latino and Asian. The city has become immensely rich, and at the same time, and often on the same streets, shockingly poor. Economic resources \u2013 and access to decent housing and education \u2013 are still distributed, to a shameful extent, according to race. Police still kill black and brown residents with appalling regularity. For new generations growing up in a city whose very history is rarely acknowledged to exist, <em>Set </em><em>the Night on Fire</em> is a vital primer in resistance, a gift to the future from the past.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Ben Ehrenreich\u2019s Desert Notebooks: A Roadmap for the End of Time will be published in July by Counterpoint Press.

The man who has long been <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/piers-morgan-flip-trump-critic-social-media-wondering-if-twilight-zone/\">a cheerleader for Donald Trump</a> (and who loves referring to the president as his friend) found himself trending on Twitter over the weekend after delivering a searing criticism of the US\u2019s abysmal response to the crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/19/media/reliable-sources-piers-morgan/index.html\">Speaking on CNN\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/19/media/reliable-sources-piers-morgan/index.html\">Reliable Sources</a>, Morgan said he had been watching Trump\u2019s White House briefings \u201cwith mounting horror\u201d and accused the president of \u201cfailing the American people\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s turning these briefings into a self-aggrandising, self-justifying, overly defensive, politically partisan, almost like a rally to him \u2013 almost like what\u2019s more important is winning the election in November,\u201d Morgan said.</p> <p>Ya think? Well done, Piers! You\u2019ve finally realised Trump is a dangerous narcissist who does not care if Americans lose their loved ones as he long as he gains in the polls. Shame you were not so clearsighted about his failings when you were doing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCTwo/status/959359534056857600?s=20\">puff pieces on him</a>. Shame it took a global pandemic, instead of Trump\u2019s rabid racism and staggering incompetence, to get you to criticise your pal. Still, I am glad you have seen the light.</p> <p>The bigger question, however, is whether Morgan is an exception or part of a wider trend. Will other people who used to bow down to Trump and Boris Johnson start to realise that they are frauds? How many thousands of people will have to die before they can no longer masquerade as strongmen and are exposed to everyone as dithering, dangerous fools?</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>As Sars-CoV-2 has spread across the world, some countries have reacted with alarm and thorough preparations, given their previous experiences with Mers or Sars. In these countries, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, containment of the novel coronavirus became the imperative, regardless of cost. However, other countries chose to treat it like a bad flu strain that would be unstoppable and spread across the population until some kind of immunity was reached.</p> \n<p>Much of the difference in countries\u2019 initial responses can be attributed to whether they \u201coverreacted\u201d, given prior experience with two other more deadly coronaviruses, or whether they perceived the novel coronavirus from the start as just posing a moderate to low risk to their populations and eventually becoming endemic.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the assumption until quite recently had seemed to be the latter. The containment phase ended on 12 March. At this point, testing ended for all those with minor symptoms (including frontline health staff), contact tracing stopped, airports remained open without checks on incoming flights or passengers, and physical distancing measures were ruled out. Large events involving tens of thousands of people went ahead a few days later, and non-essential travel continued. After considerable public pressure, lockdown measures were introduced on 23 March with the goal of keeping the coronavirus-related burden on health services within NHS capacity.</p> \n<p>Where are we now? According to official figures, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\">16,509 people with Covid-19 have so far died</a> in British hospitals. There are no official statistics for deaths in the community, but ONS data <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52361519\">released today</a> shows that of 6,200 Covid-19-related deaths in the week to 10 April, one in six of them happened outside hospital. We are on track for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/health-52321600/coronavirus-we-could-see-40000-deaths-in-this-wave\">40,000 deaths</a> by just the end of the first wave of this outbreak, while also having to cope with the astronomical economic costs and heart-rending social implications of being in lockdown for weeks on end.</p> \n<p>In a significant number of confirmed Covid cases, the health outcomes are severe, the disease can result in multiple organ failure and long-term lung damage, and the clinical need of patients for oxygen, ICU care and ventilators is much higher. Early clinical management of symptoms, to which Boris Johnson had access, means that outcomes are generally better, but that requires testing at an early stage of the disease.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>New Zealand is in the enviable position of having fewer than 20 deaths, while Australia has managed to stay under 100. With early physical distancing measures and border control, and aggressive testing, tracing and isolating procedures in place, these countries are in a better position to ease lockdown earlier and get their economy and society going again, while keeping Covid-19-related deaths low. That\u2019s as close to a win-win situation as a government can have right now.</p> \n<p>However, when these international comparisons are made, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-adrwale_c\">some in government</a> say that it is still too early to say how countries are performing, and others say that all countries will be in the same place, and any variation will depend on their healthcare capacity. It is worth thinking through the long-term scenarios for the future of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The first scenario: if we have an effective, safe and available vaccine or antiviral in the next 18 months, the countries that minimised loss of life with the least harsh economic restrictions will be in the best position. Australia, New Zealand and numerous east Asian countries have the outbreak under control and can in the short term manage the trickle of cases while waiting for the scientific solution.</p> \n<p>The second scenario: in the absence of a vaccine or antiviral, some kind of population immunity will be built up so that the virus is not actively transmitting at a high level. This assumes that having the coronavirus leads to immunity for at least two or three years and that subsequent reinfection is mild. Even in this situation, the countries with low numbers of cases can wait for ongoing research on better identification of who is exactly \u201cvulnerable\u201d to developing severe symptoms, and shield these individuals so the burden on ICU care and loss of life are kept to a minimum. While we have some basic idea at population level about who is vulnerable, based on age and pre-existing conditions, scientists do not understand the individual genetic or immunological factors yet.</p> \n<p>The third (worst-case) scenario: research might find that there is no lasting immunity to the virus, or in fact immune enhancement, which means subsequent reinfections would be more severe (similar to dengue). This creates a real case for countries with the capacity to eliminate the virus and keep in place border controls . Obviously the fewer cases present, the easier it is to eliminate a virus, and in this situation a precautionary approach to letting it spread through the population would have been well warranted.</p> \n<p>In short, there are huge gaps in what we know about this virus, including about immunity, about the possibility and timeline for a vaccine or antiviral therapy, about who exactly is vulnerable, and about long-term health implications. For example, Italian scientists have warned that some patients are developing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (temporary paralysis) as a side effect of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>In this uncertainty, countries that are actively working to contain this virus and keep numbers as low as possible are buying time to build a more informed policy response while also protecting their economies and societies. Others, by letting the virus spread slowly through their populations (only flattening the curve instead of completely stopping the spread), are just gambling with people\u2019s lives, and will be caught in cycles of lockdown/release that will destroy the economy and cause social unrest, as well as increased Covid-19- and non-Covid-19-related deaths.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p> \n<p><br><br></p>",

These myths include the theory that the virus does not affect Muslims or is a punishment for non-believers for oppressing Muslims. The militant group al-Shabaab, who control large swathes of south and central Somalia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/opportunity-or-threat-how-islamic-extremists-reacting-coronavirus\">has shared similar messages</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, a controversial cleric claimed he would cure coronavirus patients using the Qu\u2019ran and has called on people to seek his help. \u201cIf I fail to cure it, I should be shot in the head,\u201d he said in a video posted on Facebook.</p> <p>In another video, he claimed to have cured a patient from London over the phone, and he has promised to treat the Somali diaspora if they contact him, claiming to have already cured patients with HIV in the past.</p> <p>Muslim clerics, including one of the most respected Somali clerics, Sheikh Maxamed Umal, have been quick to try to debunk the myths, encouraging people to protect themselves and seek medical advice if they feel sick and reassuring people worried over the alcohol content in hand sanitiser. </p> <p>But the national task force has yet to announce firm guidelines on how to approach the holy month of Ramadan, which starts on Thursday and involves communal rituals such as breaking fast together and extended night prayers.</p> <p>\u201cThe ministry of religious affairs continues to engage closely with religious leaders, there is a responsibility on all leaders to assist in raising public awareness and community engagement throughout the country with regard to Covid-19.

  "<p>It has been both a curse and a blessing for Keir Starmer that he has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/keir-starmer-won-over-shell-shocked-labour-party\">Labour leader</a> amid a global pandemic.</p> <p>A curse because in normal times his arrival would be huge news, an opportunity quickly to establish himself firmly in the national conversation; yet in a crisis the last thing the public wants is politics as usual, so this limits his chance to be heard.</p> <p>A blessing, because the current situation plays to Starmer\u2019s strengths \u2013 he is serious, forensic, consensus-seeking, and has a strong grasp of detail. These qualities will become especially important when we are through the worst, and \u201cStarmer or Johnson?\u201d becomes the choice of prime minister. They are qualities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/boris-johnson-sunday-times-prime-minister-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson proudly lacks</a>, one of the reasons the UK has been so badly hit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/16/gordon-brown-on-covid-19-recession-and-trump-when-theres-a-crisis-you-have-to-act-quickly\">Gordon Brown</a> has had helpful things to say, based on experience, about managing financial crisis. <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/04/tony-blair-how-government-can-achieve-credible-lockdown-exit-strategy\">Tony Blair</a>, too, has useful things to say about reordering government around the current challenges on issues such as mass testing, contact tracing, PPE, business, vaccine development, schools, use of technology, social distancing and compliance, travel, and communications. He has suggestions on structure too \u2013 an expert task force on each challenge.</p> <p>Whether the government heeds Blair or not, this is not a bad way for the opposition to reorder its approach. There are many experts, academics, business figures, unions, charities and campaign groups that feel they are not being heard by government. There are scientists who feel the experts deployed at No 10 briefings are too establishment, too secretive, and not challenging enough of ministers. Mobilising them around the challenges Blair prioritised would bring greater rigour and effectiveness to the opposition operation.</p> <p>In his leadership acceptance speech, Starmer set a sensible tone \u2013 supportive of government objectives, but questioning and scrutinising in a reasonable manner. Yet when so many are dying, so many targets are unmet, so many NHS and care workers are going to work unprotected, and so many mistakes have been made, Labour should frankly show no mercy on issues such as PPE and testing. I keep thinking what John Smith \u2013 Blair\u2019s predecessor as Labour leader, and like Starmer a QC \u2013 would have made of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/turkish-ppe-flight-only-slim-chance-goods-will-arrive-in-uk-today\">Turkish plane farce</a>. There would be no holding back. In interviews with some of Starmer\u2019s team, there has been too much \u201cnow is not the time for criticism, those questions can wait\u201d for a crisis of this scale.</p> <p>Ministers should be treated with fairness, because they have enormous responsibility and pressure. But they must be challenged. It is not challenging and questioning per se that helps them do their jobs better; it is that it forces them to amass arguments, data and information, so it is all there at their fingertips.</p> <p>Starmer rightly pressed the government for the parameters of a lockdown exit strategy. Even better, Labour must develop its own ideas about the exit, to show not only that it asks the right questions, but has answers. The shadow cabinet must, with proper expert advice, be a credible alternative government.<br></p> <p>Much of the focus will fall on Starmer. But every single shadow minister must be empowered to challenge, cajole, offer alternatives and challenge the government to answer one of the best questions in politics: \u201cWhy not?\u201d In showing diligence and attention to detail, and by making intelligent suggestions and proposals, they will demonstrate their capability.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds must work to develop a profile as high as her predecessor, John McDonnell, because ultimately the future of the economy, and what kind of values underpin our society in a world of turmoil, is where the main post-crisis arguments are going to fall.<br></p> <p>It is easy to overlook the fact that, Starmer\u2019s role as director of public prosecutions apart, none of the people in the top shadow jobs have senior government experience. But nor did Blair or Brown; nor did John Prescott, or Robin Cook, who ran the Major government ragged before, during and after the Scott inquiry (on Iraq arms sales). What they and others had was real hunger, energy, drive; a determination to ferret out detail the government wanted hidden; an ability to make the media sit up and take notice because of what they were saying and how they were saying it. There can be no soft-pedalling. Oppositions have to win power; governments will do everything they can not to lose it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/parliament-returns-covid-19-constructive-politics\">As parliament returns, Covid-19 shows why we need more constructive politics | Rafael Behr</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From my years in opposition working with Blair I remember that, even at the time of the Dunblane school massacre, as sensitive a time as could be imagined, Labour had a different approach on the issue of firearms, and pressed it, sensitively. And in government, when Blair and Brown faced crises \u2013 foot-and-mouth, fuel protests, times of war \u2013 the Tories were never backward in coming forward to attack, so Labour should not fall for the current line from the right that their role is to support the government.</p> <p>It has been noticeable how rarely, at government briefings and interviews, questions have been framed by things Labour has said or done; that must change. Labour needs to be thinktank, policy expert, advocate for real people in difficulty, and campaign organiser all in one. Backbenchers too are vital in this. There are so many causes and campaigns arising from this crisis.<br></p> <p>Up till now, No 10 briefings, at which both government presentation and media questioning have generally been poor, have provided the main focus for questioning ministers. Now that parliament is back, albeit in a highly unusual form, Labour has the chance to show it can do a better job of holding the government to account than the media; and a better job than the government in showing what needs to be done, and how.</p> <p>Seizing that opportunity will go a long way towards the public deciding whether the long, wasted years of unelectability are behind us, and a credible alternative government now exists.</p> <p>\u2022 Alastair Campbell was Tony Blair\u2019s press secretary and director of communications from 1994-2003<br><br></p>",

  "<p>One day 23 years ago, scientists were exploring a lost world called Batang Toru when they glimpsed something moving in the forest canopy. What they saw was a great ape that had lived in splendid isolation for 700,000 years. With its kindly black face, orange fur and vast proto-artisanal beard, it looked like the familiar Sumatran or Borneo orangutans, but was neither. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/02/new-species-of-orangutan-discovered-in-northern-sumatra-tapanuli-pongo-tapanuliensis\">the Tapanuli orangutan was recognised as a new species</a>. It is smaller, and has paler, thicker fur than its lowland cousins and lives in reproductive isolation on that remote plateau in the north Sumatran jungle 1,000m above sea level.</p> <p>The news about this addition to world species lists prompted producer Nikki Waldron to scramble to the Sumatran jungle, to film the Tapanuli orangutan. After a few weeks, she and her crew found a mother and daughter in their natural habitat. \u201cWhen we first arrived, the cameraman sighed. The light levels were really low because of the density of the leaves, and the orangutans live 40m up in the trees.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The male golden-headed lion tamarins of Brazil work as taxis for their children</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve made series about sharks, which are difficult to film, and big cats which are more difficult, and now primates that are arguably the most difficult of all,\u201d says Mike Gunton, executive producer of the new three-part BBC One nature documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hrg0\">Primates</a>. \u201cThey move quickly. It\u2019s hard for camera crews to keep up with them. What\u2019s more, they tend to live in very inaccessible areas like steamy jungles at the top of tall trees.\u201d Yet Waldron and her camera crew captured some poignant shots of a mother teaching her baby daughter how to forage in the trees. The Tapanuli orangutan needs a more varied diet of plants than other orangutans, and baby needs to learn these life lessons fast: after five years, she will leave her mother and forage independently.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNvNHxP-gqQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qNvNHxP-gqQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But the tender images are bittersweet since the world in which the baby will grow to maturity is a threatening one: logging, gold mining and a huge hydropower scheme now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/apr/23/worlds-newest-great-ape-threatened-by-chinese-dam\">menace its </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2018/apr/23/worlds-newest-great-ape-threatened-by-chinese-dam\">habitat</a>. As a result, the Tapanuli orangutan is not only the newest but also the most endangered of ape species: there are only 800 left. \u201cWithin a generation they could be gone,\u201d says series presenter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/21/chris-packham-urges-tv-makers-to-shout-louder-about-nature-crises\">Chris Packham</a>.</p> <p>More than half of primate species are under threat of extinction. \u201cThe future of them all is in the hands of one primate: us,\u201d says Packham. We are the cause of \u2013 as much as the solution to \u2013 primates\u2019 problems. One sequence in Primates makes this point eloquently. In Malaysia\u2019s Penang province, a busy road cuts through the habitat of a colony of dusky langurs. Undaunted, the langurs have taken to swinging across the power cables stretched high over the roads, risking electrocution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2a163d510d116aed5d4146f3fb04d0f2f6b835b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2a163d510d116aed5d4146f3fb04d0f2f6b835b/0_373_4600_2507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monkey on a wire \u2026 a langur in Malaysia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"545\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monkey on a wire \u2026 a langur in Malaysia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexey Pelikh/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wildlife researcher Jo Leen Yap, along with some other volunteers, has built a monkey bridge from recycled rubber. Since they filmed this sequence, though, Malaysia has gone into lockdown, traffic is minimal, and roads are safe for langurs to cross. Primates the world over are being given a preview of what would happen if humans became extinct.Nature returns as humans, albeit briefly, step aside.</p> <p>The prospect of human extinction would be dismal for arguably the most delightful primates in the series, the rhesus macaques of Kathmandu. In Nepal, they are worshipped as gods and take up positions in city streets where the faithful gift them offerings of food. Better yet, there is a fountain reserved for their use and it is here that camera crews captured some of the loveliest footage. Rhesus macaques, it turns out, love athletically spinning into the pool and cannonballing each other wildly. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible of course that they are performing for the cameras,\u201d says Gunton. </p> <p>In a sequence shot in Tanzania, primatologist <a href=\"https://www.globalwildlife.org/team/russell-mittermeier-ph-d/\">Russell Mittermeier</a> completes a lifelong personal quest by spotting the last of 79 genera of primates that exist on our planet. The kipunji monkey wasn\u2019t described by science until 2015 and is one of the most endangered primates in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"136fc018d693fca6cc1126e711e4f7b8e1797246\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/136fc018d693fca6cc1126e711e4f7b8e1797246/0_52_4285_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gestures \u2026 a chimpanzee from episode one of Primates.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gestures \u2026 a chimpanzee from episode one of Primates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abi Brown/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We live in such a crazily unnatural world that, as we learned from the Netflix documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/insane-intoxicating-tale-of-big-cats-is-perfect-lockdown-tv-tiger-watch-james-mcavoy-greta-gerwig\">Tiger King</a> recently, many more tigers are in American captivity than live wild on the entire planet. It is a world, too, in which there is an online trade in gibbons for pets \u2013 which are often abandoned once they grow up and their propensity to domestic destruction eclipses their charm.</p> <p>In Primates, we see conservation groups habituating such domesticated primates to the wild. Mittermeier argues that the best way to save such animals is to promote ecotourism, often to conservation initiatives where primates can be watched unobtrusively by humans. Primate watching, he argues, provides income for local communities and an incentive to protect primates and their habitat.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lots of people are yearning to experience nature now.

Made over three years, it\u2019s a virtual nature walk in which we meet 25 of the 500 species of primates that exist in the world today, including Madagascar\u2019s beguiling and nocturnal blue-eyed black lemur, which is about 150 times smaller than the biggest creatures in the series, Congo\u2019s mighty mountain gorillas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef2f57b626fe9e2c55b99e750e4f1e6dbce43633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef2f57b626fe9e2c55b99e750e4f1e6dbce43633/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A female drill with her infant on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bewitching \u2026 a female drill monkey with her infant on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Primates also gives us mere humans valuable life tips. What should males do when females are exhausted by pregnancy and giving birth? We could emulate the male golden-headed lion tamarins that Waldron filmed in Brazil. \u201cWe never expected to find the story of a male who does childcare, but that quickly became the story we told. He becomes the guardian, the navigator and a taxi for his daughter. He can\u2019t really be otherwise because her cry is so loud. She\u2019s the most demanding offspring, but he just gets on with his job.\u201d </p> <p>How should we communicate with our offspring when they aren\u2019t listening? We could develop a series of gestures such as those developed by Ugandan chimpanzees. When it\u2019s time to go home, a mother chimp will show its offspring the base of its foot, the little chimp will climb on her back and they will head off. University of St Andrews primatologist Cat Hobaiter has found, from long hours studying footage on her laptop, that chimpanzees in Budongo Forest in Uganda have a repertoire of 80 such gestures. </p> <p>Most topically, the series teaches us the value of collective endeavour, something we may have neglected in our individualistic society, but which we can rediscover by watching dusky leaf monkeys gang up on a menacing python and shake it from a tree. \u201cPrimates are the most social animals,\u201d says Packham. Collaboration and neighbourliness are key not just to survival but to quality of life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3efbc998d6eb693d574c69db473b45ac283a208\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3efbc998d6eb693d574c69db473b45ac283a208/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Closer to nature \u2026 long-tailed macaques on Thailand\u2019s east coast use rock tools to catch shellfish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Closer to nature \u2026 long-tailed macaques on Thailand\u2019s east coast use rock tools to catch shellfish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/NHU</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of these wonders have been made possible by new kit. Back in 1990, on David Attenborough\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01r95v7\">The Trials of Life</a> for instance, a medical endoscope was used to film inside a bivouac of army ants in Panama. In Primates, a 360-degree camera gives us a sense of what it is like to be a gibbon, hurling oneself through the treetops. The camera, which is a sphere equipped with 24 individual lenses, is mounted on a cable that traverses the canopy alongside the gibbons. By digitally stitching together the multiple images it captures, the production team gets closer to a gibbon\u2019s-eye perspective than ever before.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working on these documentaries for 30 years and so much has changed,\u201d says Gunton. \u201cTrials of Life was a watershed because it was then that we started following the journeys of individual animals in a way we couldn\u2019t before. And that led to a richer and more intimate experience for viewers.\u201d But, he argues, the biggest change in nature documentaries is not so much in the sophistication of the technology as the sophistication of the viewers. \u201cWe don\u2019t just want images of cute animals. We do still want that \u2013 but there\u2019s a growing desire to think about what nature is and our role in protecting it.\u201d</p> <p>One sequence in the series particularly touched me. High in the Atlas mountains of north Africa, a broken-nosed old Barbary macaque sat alone. Back in the day, he was an alpha male commanding of a 40-strong crew. Since then, he has become socially redundant, living in 24-hour social isolation. Then temperatures tumbled and a snow storm whipped down from the heavens. Suddenly, several young macaques crawled along the branch on which the venerable male was settling for the bitter night, and hugged him for warmth. Thanks to this hitherto expendable monkey, the juvenile pile-on might survive the night.</p> <p>How lovely to see a superannuated old dude, deemed expendable by society, showing what he has to offer a community in crisis. Or perhaps that\u2019s just me.</p> <p>\u2022 Primates starts on BBC One on 26 April.</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;This article was amended on 22 April 2020 to remove an erroneous reference to the Tapanuli orangutan being filmed for the first time for the Primates documentary.

  "<p>In the name of freedom, we have been exposed, to a greater extent than any other European nation, to a deadly pandemic. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/03/brexit-news-boris--johnson-speech-barnier-cabinet-ministers-claims-uk-does-not-need-trade-deal-with-eu-ahead-of-pms-speech-live-news?page=with:block-5e382b6f8f0811db2faf0775#block-5e382b6f8f0811db2faf0775\">his speech in Greenwich</a> on 3 February, Boris Johnson lambasted governments that had \u201cpanicked\u201d about the coronavirus, inflicting \u201cunnecessary economic damage\u201d. His government, by contrast, would champion our right to \u201cbuy and sell freely among each other\u201d.</p> <p>But as always, the professed love of freedom among those who represent the interests of the rich in politics is highly selective. If the government valued freedom as much as it says it does, it would do everything in its power to maximise the liberties we can safely exercise, while protecting us from harm.</p> <p>In other words, it would take up the call to open London\u2019s golf courses to public access. As the author and land campaigner Guy Shrubsole has discovered, there are <a href=\"https://whoownsengland.org/2020/04/14/who-owns-londons-golf-courses/\">131 golf courses in Greater London</a>, covering 11,000 acres. But they are open only to those who pay fees to play and to members, while millions of people swelter in tiny flats or edge round each other in minuscule parks, desperate for a sense of space and freedom. The government would also take up the call for private schools to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/private-schools-land-targeted-for-families-without-gardens\">open their playing fields</a> and extensive grounds. And it would open London\u2019s locked green squares, and designate other tracts of private land in and around our cities for public access.</p> <p>But a core purpose of conservatism is to defend private property from public use, and to extend private ownership and exclusive rights into realms previously enjoyed by all. And no form of wealth is more fiercely contested than land.</p> <p>Throughout the history of these isles, exclusion from the land has been a major source of social conflict. It remains so today. Last month, Johnson extolled the \u201c<a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-pubs/ancient-british-rights-to-a-drink-in-the-pub-have-to-be-suspended-johnson-idUKKBN21732B\">ancient, inalienable right</a> of free-born people of the United Kingdom\u201d. But before the pandemic began, his government proposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/15/tresspass-trap-law-land-travelling-people-rights\">criminalise trespass</a> in England and Wales. This is the opposite policy to Scotland\u2019s, where there is now a comprehensive right to roam.</p> <p>In November last year, Johnson announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/19/johnson-reveals-plans-to-extend-police-stop-and-search-powers\">an expansion of police powers</a> to stop and search people without grounds for suspicion. These powers have long been perceived by people of colour as a form of collective harassment in public places, impinging on their free movement. Black, Asian and minority ethnic people are on average <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/oct/13/racial-bias-police-stop-and-search-policy-black-people-report\">eight times more likely</a> to be stopped and searched by the police than white people.</p> <p>Some young black men have the sense of living in a permanent state of partial lockdown. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/839765/Section_60_Equality_Impact_Assessment_July_2019.pdf\">own assessment shows</a> that an expansion of stop and search powers has \u201cat best, only minimal effects on violent crime\u201d. In fact, as a primary cause of both the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2246331.stm\">1981</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/31/police-stop-and-search-riots-2011-london\">2011 riots</a>, the policy is likely to exacerbate it.</p> <p>Until 1984, police stop and search powers were exercised under the remarkably brutal <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo4/5/83/contents/enacted\">1824 Vagrancy Act</a>. Beggars, hawkers, sex workers, Gypsies and Travellers, rough sleepers and anyone \u201cnot giving a good account of himself or herself\u201d could be arrested and summarily sentenced to three months\u2019 hard labour. Astonishingly, large sections of this barbaric law <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo4/5/83/section/3\">remain in force</a> , and it is still sometimes used by the police against <a href=\"https://www.crisis.org.uk/get-involved/campaign/scrap-the-vagrancy-act/\">homeless people</a>.</p> <p>Police powers to move people on are necessary during this pandemic. But well into the first half of the 20th century, they were used as a form of social control, securing public space for \u201cthe right sort\u201d, while excluding \u201cundesirables\u201d. They were a source of great resentment in Victorian England, and commemorated in several <a href=\"http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/static/images/sheets/20000/18834.gif\">satirical ballads</a>, various of which had the title Move on There. One song complains that \u201cswells\u201d (rich and extravagant young men) could get away with anything, while those without the means to bribe the police were \u201ccollared\u201d.</p> <p>Today, much of what looks like public space in our cities is in fact privately owned. Many of these pseudo-public spaces are patrolled by security guards, enforcing opaque rules. As a homeless man interviewed by the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/24/revealed-pseudo-public-space-pops-london-investigation-map\">observed</a>, most people wouldn\u2019t notice the difference between a publicly and privately owned open space. But \u201cto me, the difference is everything, because I\u2019m not the sort of person they want over there\u201d. Typically, in these places, homeless people are moved on, no music or photography is allowed, and political gatherings are banned. In some of them, the only acceptable activity appears to be spending money.</p> <p>There\u2019s an interesting parallel with urban parks in the 19th century, many of which were also then privately owned. As the historian <a href=\"http://historyofpublicspace.uk/\">Katrina Navickas documents</a>, the owners typically banned music and political meetings. The Salvation Army, then an extreme temperance movement, waged its wars against people enjoying themselves in any public places, sparking confrontations that sometimes turned violent.</p> <p>Last year, the Guardian revealed that some London housing estates were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/mar/25/too-poor-to-play-children-in-social-housing-blocked-from-communal-playground\">excluding children</a> in social housing from playgrounds used by richer residents. The developers of one estate had been granted planning permission on the grounds that its playground would be available to all, after which it replaced a gate with an impenetrable hedge to shut out the poorest residents.</p> <p>We might look for freedom in the countryside, but for centuries it has been the scene of extreme exclusion and injustice. Here, <a href=\"https://www.thelandmagazine.org.uk/articles/short-history-enclosure-britain\">enclosure</a> (the seizure of land from commoners) violently deprived many people of their liberties. The labouring poor were forbidden to live in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/20n2a3.pdf\">close parishes</a>\u201d, where their homes were ripped down by the lords of the manor, to avoid liability for poverty relief. As a result, until the late 19th century in some places, people were crowded into filthy, dilapidated cottages sometimes an hour\u2019s walk from the fields in which they worked, for which they were charged astounding rents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-crisis-ends-bad-for-conservatism\">No matter how this coronavirus crisis ends, it will be bad for conservatism | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today, we have <a href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1219211665151025152.html\">no right of access to 92% of England</a>.

  "<p>Olaf grasps Diane Barber\u2019s gloved hands with his sticky, four-fingered legs. His skin is bumpy and moist, the colour of pebbles at the bottom of a river when dappled sun hits them. Olaf\u2019s eyes are deep amber. His body lifts and falls with each breath. \u201cThe males get really pretty,\u201d says Barber, ectotherms curator at Fort Worth zoo in Texas. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ll turn a solid yellow when they\u2019re in breeding form.\u201d</p> <p>In some ways, this toad shouldn\u2019t exist at all.

One way could be to bank the genetic lineages of species by freezing sperm and egg deposits and then later thawing and combining them in a dish to create offspring.</p> <p>Amphibians are at the forefront of an uphill battle against extinction, losing a greater proportion of species than any other vertebrate group. <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/\">The IUCN</a> estimates that at least 41% of amphibians are at imminent risk of extinction. Habitat loss, climate crisis and a fungal disease all play a role in their demise.</p> <p>But amphibians are not the only species that can benefit from new technologies. In vitro fertilisation, hormone therapy and cryopreservation are increasingly being used as tools for conservation \u2013 for amphibians and beyond. In a fast-changing world, frozen zoos may be the places where tissues are kept, in the hope of boosting numbers or resurrecting species in the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d3ca60e23af1960709f04fd4db40c0281fc17ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3ca60e23af1960709f04fd4db40c0281fc17ae3/0_0_2417_2593/932..jpg\" alt=\"It is estimated that at least 32% of amphibians are at imminent risk of extinction.\" width=\"932\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It is estimated that at least 41% of amphibians are at imminent risk of extinction.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fort Worth Zoo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Frozen zoos</h2> <p>How did Olaf come to exist at all? A year ago in Puerto Rico, researchers captured six male toads, injected them with hormones and then collected the sperm they ejected when they urinated. The toads usually pee when picked up by humans, but the researchers also barked at them, Kouba explains, as toads urinate when frightened, and dogs barking are a sure-fire way to scare them. The males were then released back into the wild.</p> <p>The team of international scientists preserved the semen in liquid nitrogen and transported it to <a href=\"https://www.fortworthzoo.org/\">Fort Worth </a><a href=\"https://www.fortworthzoo.org/\">zoo</a>, where female toads were injected with hormones to release eggs. Olaf and his roommates were created in a dish, eliciting cheers from the scientists when they hatched from their eggs.</p> <p>The idea of creating a frozen zoo first emerged in the 1970s, when a medical pathologist named Kurt Benirschke started banking animal sperm and eggs at San Diego zoo in the same way that human gametes were starting to be stored: in giant vials of liquid nitrogen that dropped the temperature of the materials to -196 F. When Benisrschke started banking genetic material, no technology existed to make use of it, but he believed it was important to carry on anyway.</p> <p>Now, biobanks for animal species \u2013 from fish to reptiles to birds and even snails and molluscs \u2013 are popping up around the globe. The <a href=\"https://institute.sandiegozoo.org/resources/frozen-zoo%C2%AE\">Frozen Zoo repository</a> at San Diego zoo holds more than 10,000 cell cultures from nearly 1,000 different species. They are mostly from mammals, but also from birds, reptiles and amphibians.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/29/deadly-skin-eating-fungal-disease-wipes-out-90-amphibian-species-in-50-years\">Deadly skin-eating fungal disease wipes out 90 amphibian species in 50 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scientists had been working on the process of bringing together sperm and egg outside the bodies of animals like rabbits and guinea pigs <a href=\"https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/vitro-fertilization\">since the 1870s</a>. But making babies in a test tube is no simple task because every species is different. IVF success rates for mammals are much higher than with reptiles, and with some species, it\u2019s incredibly low. Even within species, some cells are more difficult than others. When it comes to amphibians, Kouba says, their sperm is pretty simple to freeze \u2013 but eggs are not, because they are so much larger than the sperm. \u201cInside that cell, you have water content, and when you start to freeze anything with water, they form ice crystals that rupture the cell.\u201d</p> <p>Because fish such as salmon and cod are widely available commercially, they have been studied much more than amphibians, and amphibian researchers like Barber and Kouba are waiting for breakthroughs that they can adopt. \u201cThere is a huge interest in freezing sperm to move genetics around the world for commercially viable species,\u201d Kouba says. </p> <p>One reason that conservationists want to boost the numbers of amphibian populations is because diseases are devastating them in the wild. Kouba says cryopreservation has a place as a last-ditch effort to bank the remaining genetic material from a dying species, but that it is really better to take action before a species\u2019 numbers have crashed. \u201cWe can produce tens of thousands for reintroduction, which may allow a species to return to a healthy population,\u201d he says.</p> <p>That\u2019s because amphibians have a naturally high mutation rate, so sending thousands of amphibians into the wild to mate and repopulate could mean they create a disease-resistant strain on their own. \u201cYou release animals with the hope that disease resistant lines will develop, and those animals will reproduce,\u201d says Kouba.</p> <h2>Healthy herds</h2> <p>In Colorado, Jennifer Barfield is using IVF to create bison with healthy genes to introduce into existing wild herds. Left to their own devices, bison breed well but what they can\u2019t do is move around the globe \u2013 so to transport new genes to different areas requires the use of IVF.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"04c780465192cae7518559fe2a7a0484ae19169d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04c780465192cae7518559fe2a7a0484ae19169d/0_0_1920_1278/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Barfield has helped establish the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Barfield has helped establish the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William A Cotton/CSU Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Using assisted reproductive technologies, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/jennifer-barfield-494744\">she has helped produce</a> healthy Yellowstone bison from ones that had a bacterial disease called brucellosis and established a new conservation herd in Colorado called the Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd.</p> <p>There is another advantage to using IVF in bison says Barfield. \u201cBio-banking the genetic preservation is just a good idea, like a form of genetic insurance. You never know how science will advance to use that material in the future.\u201d</p> <p>She says that one of the challenges in endangered species is that often researchers don\u2019t know enough about the reproductive physiology of rare animals to apply solutions before the animals become extinct. \u201cYou can\u2019t experiment on endangered species,\u201d says Barfield.</p> <p>In some species, assisted reproduction is the last hope. There are only two remaining northern white rhinos left in the world, both female, both past reproductive age. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/11/scientists-use-ivf-procedures-to-help-save-near-extinct-rhinos\">Last year, researchers were able to harvest eggs</a> from one of the females and have created three embryos with frozen sperm from dead males. The embryos are now frozen, with the hope of implanting them into surrogate southern white rhino females later this year. The eventual goal is to create five animals that could live in the wild in Africa \u2013 a plan that could take decades to come to fruition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f31529c23b1ab366c2bf5add47b6e86ac3206873\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f31529c23b1ab366c2bf5add47b6e86ac3206873/0_0_1600_1067/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The first calf in the world to be conceived via IVF using eggs and sperm from Yellowstone bison, in Soapstone Prairie Natural Area, Colorado.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first calf in the world to be conceived via IVF using eggs and sperm from Yellowstone bison, in Soapstone Prairie Natural Area, Colorado.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William A Cotton/CSU Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back at Fort Worth zoo, Barber carefully puts Olaf back in his cage in the isolation room. In the wild, Puerto Rican crested toads like Olaf spend 95% of their time in small holes between crushed rocks, coming out to feed at night and when it rains. In his home at the zoo, the staff have constructed small pyramids made from sections of white PVC pipes for Olaf and the other toads to hang out in. Of the toads that used to live in this room, 193 were recently shipped via FedEx back to Puerto Rico for reintroduction; now more are being raised here. Other rooms house frogs raised from other parts of North America, all in need of a population boost.</p> <p>Barber says that in the 1980s zoos thought of themselves as arks. \u201cThat was kind of the buzz word for zoos: we\u2019re becoming arks instead of just having animals for exhibit. We need to start doing more about thinking about conservation and maintaining species long term.\u201d</p> <p>But those arks are full, and more species need assistance \u2013 there\u2019s no space to keep animals just as an insurance policy. \u201cWe\u2019re not arks, we\u2019re life rafts,\u201d Barber says. \u201cAnd we have very limited seating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f8251fb1341f0de221d86223331aaf61881e2a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f8251fb1341f0de221d86223331aaf61881e2a8/0_9_5081_3049/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The insemination of an egg from one of the last two remaining female of northern white rhinos using frozen sperm at the Avantea laboratory in Cremona, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The insemination of an egg from one of the last two remaining female northern white rhinos using frozen sperm at the Avantea laboratory in Cremona, Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As she speaks about her passion for overlooked species, Barber\u2019s eyes fill with emotion. \u201cEspecially with the stuff that I work with \u2013 the creepy crawlies \u2013 most people wonder: why should we care? And it\u2019s like, well, we should care about everything because we\u2019re all connected. Sometimes it\u2019s just really hard to communicate why we should care and why it is our responsibility to try to mitigate things that we humans have caused.\u201d</p> <p>So far, IVF conservation work is only being done with about 10 species \u2013 but Kouba predicts it will become much more widespread in the next decade. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to become mainstream,\u201d he says, adding that it could become a primary resource for conservation. \u201cWe left those species in the world and we were able to collect their material, bring it back and put new founder lines back in the population, so we don\u2019t need to remove animals from the wild any more. </p> <p>\u201cThat will revolutionise how we manage wildlife.\u201d</p> <p><em>This story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on climate solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

Instead, it involved the testing of a \u201cwell-known drug for a new purpose\u201d.</p> \n<p>The trial would involve civilian and ADF healthcare workers. It would also be entirely voluntary and require a \u201cdeliberate action\u201d by potential volunteers wanting to take part.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis requires taking action to access and read all online information, watch a video explaining the trial and to make an appointment to attend in-person for evaluation,\u201d Defence said. \u201cThey are then carefully screened against a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria.\u201d</p> \n<p>Participants would be required to fill out daily questionnaires detailing the state of their health and wellbeing, Defence said. Close monitoring would take place and participants could quit at any time.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell conducted clinical trials are needed in the global fight against Covid-19,\u201d Defence said.</p> \n<p>The US Centres for Disease Control <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/fsp/drugs/chloroquine.pdf\">has described chloroquine</a> as \u201ca relatively well-tolerated medicine\u201d, which has some side-effects, including most commonly stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and headaches.</p> \n<p>Australia\u2019s drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, <a href=\"https://www.tga.gov.au/alert/new-restrictions-prescribing-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19\">also says the side-effects of chloroquine</a> can include headaches, skin eruptions, gastrointestinal disturbance, psoriarsis and, in rare cases, psychotic episodes, anxiety, personality change, seizures and blood disorders.</p> \n<p>The actor and singer Rita Wilson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/15/rita-wilson-tells-of-extreme-side-effects-of-experimental-covid-19-drug-chloroquine\">was given chloroquine</a> when she and her husband, Tom Hanks, tested positive for Covid-19 this year in Australia. Wilson claimed to have suffered side-effects including nausea and vertigo.</p> \n<p>Research out of the US tested the similar compound of hydroxychloroquine in veterans\u2019 hospitals. The <a href=\"https://apnews.com/a5077c7227b8eb8b0dc23423c0bbe2b2\">Associated Press reported that the study</a> \u2013 which was not rigorous or peer-reviewed \u2013 showed no benefit for Covid-19 patients. More deaths were recorded for those given hydroxychloroquine compared to those who received standard care, the study said.</p> \n<p>Assoc Prof Jane Quinn, a pharmaceuticals researcher at Charles Sturt University\u2019s school of veterinary sciences, has worked with veterans to study neuropsychiatric conditions arising from quinolone anti-malarials like mefloquine.</p> \n<p>Quinn said she was concerned that Defence\u2019s \u201cmanagement of past trials of these sorts of drugs\u201d was problematic. She said the military had traditionally been poor at obtaining informed consent for clinical trials. The drug itself, she said, was completely unproven.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s an unsubstantiated use at the present in that there has been no suggestion that you can prevent somebody from contracting Covid-19 by giving them hydroxychloroquine,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no proof of that at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cSo why we would be saying that we will undertake a first trial to look into that with Defence members, I don\u2019t know.
