There has been a lot of progress in ramping up testing capabilities, with pretty much all countries on the continent now theoretically able to test their citizens for the disease. As elsewhere however, there are shortages in the key chemicals needed for the tests, and that\u2019s causing problems.</p> \n  <p>This is particularly true in South Africa, which has the highest number of cases and has adopted a strategy based on aggressive screening and testing to try to stamp out any clusters and outbreaks of the disease before it can spread.</p> \n  <p>Officials in South Africa have yet to decide whether to extend the lockdown in South Africa, now in its third week.

One possibility may be to lift some restrictions but maintain strict rules to limit social distancing, but, they say, nothing is decided.</p> \n  <p>Other governments across the continent will face similar decisions in coming days and weeks.

The other person who runs or cycles just behind this leading person in the slipstream then moves through that cloud of droplets.</p> \n   <p>The slipstream is the zone that arises right behind a person when they are walking or cycling, and which pulls the air a bit along with this moving person, as it were.</p> \n   <p>Cyclists like to position themselves in the slipstream of others to reduce their air resistance. But someone who walks or runs also has such a slipstream. We have seen that no matter how that zone forms, droplets end up in that air stream.

this will provide a short-term source of additional liquidity to the government if needed to smooth its cashflows and support the orderly functioning of markets, through the period of disruption from

  "<p>Ministers could face a fight to recoup their losses on orders for antibody tests amid calls to abandon pin-prick kits that can be used at home in favour of more reliable lab-based testing.</p> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced in March that 3.5m antibody tests had been bought to help establish who had acquired immunity to the coronavirus \u2013 a crucial step in getting people back to work \u2013 but later clarified that the orders were subject to the tests being approved.</p> <p>Rigorous checks on a sample number of the tests have so far found that none meet the standards agreed with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), forcing government to row back on claims that the tests would be ready to send out to the public this month.</p> <p>But Martin Hibberd, a professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said finger-prick antibody tests were rarely reliable and encouraged the government to focus instead on lab-based tests.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a centralised pathology lab antibody test. The government has bought these home tests but they are traditionally very poor in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Expecting those to perform exceptionally well is unlikely in my estimate because they don\u2019t perform particularly well for any virus,\u201d Hibberd said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat use is home testing going to be? What are you going to do when someone at home decides they can see a band on a strip and they go out and say I\u2019m free, I can do what I like? I think they should drop it,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care said it had bought its current stock of antibody tests on the basis of \u201cminimal initial volumes\u201d but refused to comment on specific commercial arrangements. It said that if the tests did not work, the orders would be cancelled and costs recovered \u201cwherever possible\u201d.<br><br>Sir John Bell, a Regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, who is leading the testing effort, said the assessments were ongoing and that his group was talking to companies in the hope of improving the antibody tests, adding that \u201ca lot of the tests look very similar and probably come from the same factory in China\u201d.</p> <p>The Oxford group has characterised six different antibody tests and found that most fall well short of the accuracy required. Most failed to detect antibodies half the time and the best spotted the immune cells only 70% of the time. If used at scale, the tests could leave millions of people who have immunity convinced they are still vulnerable to the infection. For the test to pass, the accuracy would have to be nearer 95%.</p> <p>The tests were also found to be unreliable in spotting those who were not immune, with some declaring a blood sample positive for protective antibodies 2% of the time. That false positive is a big risk, because it could mean nurses or carers going back to work believing they are immune when they are not.</p> <p>The failure of the tests and the complexity of the work to improve them means that a working antibody test could be months away. The tests may be performing badly because they were validated against blood from patients who were severely ill and produced a strong immune response to the virus, unlike most people, who become only mildly ill.</p> <p>The global rush for antibody tests meant that many governments found themselves in the position where they had to weigh up the risks of buying poor-quality tests and having no tests at all. \u201cThe Department of Health and Social Care wanted to get tests quickly and felt it had to commit,\u201d Bell said. \u201cTo their credit they put them through rigorous testing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still possible that we won\u2019t get a test \u2026 We don\u2019t want to put out a test that is poor. We want a good test that gives us the answers we want,\u201d Bell added.</p> <p>Without a home-test kit, blood samples can still be checked for antibodies using a lab-based process called an Elisa, which is what Hibberd wants to see adopted. The Elisa test at Oxford can distinguish positive and negative samples of blood with almost 100% accuracy. The downside is that blood needs to be taken from people and sent to the lab for testing.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the sort of testing we need, not these home kits,\u201d Hibberd said. \u201cWill they get their money back on these tests? Who knows. Somebody else will buy them, I\u2019m quite sure.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Ordinarily, a four-day bank holiday weekend with good weather expected over much of Britain would mean only one thing for millions of people. But these are not ordinary times. That is why, this Easter weekend, there can be no let-up of the national lockdown against the Covid-19 pandemic, except for those on genuinely essential business. This is no time for the nation to drop its guard.</p> <p>A holiday from the lockdown would provide no welcome break, whatever the weather. On the contrary, it would be a dereliction of our common responsibility to maintain physical distancing. It would put at risk everything that the British people have achieved for each other and for the health service so far. So we must do nothing that could undermine, directly or indirectly, the collective effort to defeat the coronavirus outbreak. The message is correct. Stay at home this weekend. That means you \u2013 and it means all of us.</p> <p>A key lesson of the past three weeks of national lockdown is that people will act responsibly for the greater good if the situation is clearly spelled out and if sensible rules are explained. The overwhelming majority of people will again respond in precisely this way this weekend, just as they have done so far. This is a tribute to the good sense of the people of Britain as much as to the measures taken by their government. Not for the first time, ministers and experts underestimated the public.</p> <p>Ministers have stumbled during the outbreak. In the beginning they seemed unconvinced that Britain was on the brink of a disaster. They were too <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/deadly-virus-britain-failed-prepare-mers-sars-ebola-coronavirus\" title=\"\">slow to prepare</a> for the pandemic. They spent too long in denial about its severity. They sidled apologetically into the necessary measures. They still over-promise while under-delivering. They have not yet levelled with the public in an adult way about the future of the emergency. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/two-thirds-of-public-think-uk-coronavirus-response-too-slow-poll\" title=\"\">Polls</a> make clear that the public are aware of these failings. Arguably this makes the public\u2019s stoicism the more impressive.</p> <p>Over the past week, the full seriousness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/09/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-extended-boris-johnson-in-hospital-covid-19-latest-updates\" title=\"\">the threat</a> has continued to bear down on the country with increasing force. <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\" title=\"\">Across the world</a>, 1.5 million people have had the virus. Around 90,000 have died from it. In Britain, there are 65,000 cases and nearly 8,000 have died. The prime minister is still in intensive care. It has been a global Passiontide. And things are about to get worse. The projected peak of the outbreak in Britain is expected in the next two weeks. Even when it levels out, there will still be a long way to go before the assault is anything like over. The risk of a renewal of the pandemic remains very real.</p> <p>Ministers have been too cautious about explaining what this is likely to mean for the continuation of the lockdown and for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/imf-chief-flags-up-grim-global-economic-forecast-covid-19\" title=\"\">jobs and the economy</a>. It has been clear since the start of the lockdown that it would have to be extended beyond next week. The Welsh government faced these facts first. The UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/09/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-likely-to-be-extended-says-cabinet-minister\" title=\"\">slowness</a> to do so cannot just be explained by Boris Johnson\u2019s hospitalisation. The failure is cultural. Ministers remain afraid of communicating openly and have not mastered the art of anchoring tough short-term decisions within a clear and credible long-term strategy. Deep down, they act as if the public cannot be trusted with the full truth.</p> <p>The pandemic is terrible and ongoing. Most people grasp there will be no quick end to it. Ministers are already deep in private discussion about the step-by-step measures required to return to some kind of normality while maintaining a grip over the outbreak. They must urgently begin that conversation with parliament and with the rest of us. Ministers should make clear that they will do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/police-chiefs-call-on-no-10-to-tighten-uk-lockdown\" title=\"\">whatever it takes</a> and for as long as it takes to safeguard the country. The choreography of any exit strategy will be complex and phased. In some respects, indeed, the necessary controls during the winding down will be the toughest part. Back in their first cabinet meeting in December, Mr Johnson told his ministers that they were <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/video/prime-ministers-first-new-cabinet-there-is-a-huge-huge-agenda-11888915\" title=\"\">a people\u2019s government</a>.

On Tuesday, 779 people died from the coronavirus in New York state, a one-day record. New Jersey also set a one-day record, with 275 deaths, while Louisiana announced 70 further deaths on that day, matching its worst daily toll.</p> <p>Public health experts have criticized a severe lack of planning by the Trump administration for the US becoming the global coronavirus hotspot, with a dearth of testing and equipment leading to hospitals being overwhelmed in places and states desperately scrambling to source ventilators, masks and gowns.</p> <p>But several media figures who are sympathetic to the president have started to question the official death toll, claiming it is being distorted for political purposes, by including in the statistics people dying of other causes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"35a9bd7430318e60226deb6a97408416fee9dec0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35a9bd7430318e60226deb6a97408416fee9dec0/43_0_2379_2974/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tucker Carlson: \u2018When journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tucker Carlson: \u2018When journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a>\u2019s Brit Hume, who has previously tweeted that New York\u2019s \u201cfatality numbers are inflated\u201d, appeared on Tucker Carlson\u2019s late-night show on Tuesday to claim that any person with the virus is being counted as a Covid-19 death \u201cregardless of what else may be wrong\u201d. Carlson responded by saying, \u201cThere may be reasons people seek an inaccurate death count,\u201d adding: \u201cWhen journalists work with numbers, there sometimes is an agenda.\u201d</p> <p>The rightwing radio host <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=007466294097402385199:m2ealvuxh1i&amp;q=https://www.theguardian.com/media/rush-limbaugh&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiA4Ifk59voAhVRlXIEHdKGAeAQFjABegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1K2VCGcFQQhok9U4MRzbL-\">Rush Limbaugh</a>, who received the presidential medal of freedom from Trump, previously dismissed Covid-19 as similar to the \u201ccommon cold\u201d but changed tack recently to claim: \u201cIt\u2019s admittedly speculation, but \u2026 what if we are recording a bunch of deaths to coronavirus which really should not be chalked up to coronavirus?\u201d</p> <p>Trump regularly echoes theories espoused on Fox News and previously <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45521414\">dismissed</a> an official death toll of 3,000 people in Puerto Rico in the wake of 2017\u2019s Hurricane Maria. However, the president has yet to follow suit by questioning the Covid-19 figures, telling reporters that he thinks the states have been \u201cpretty accurate on the death count\u201d.</p> <p>According to Deborah Birx, the response coordinator on the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, a person who goes into hospital to be treated for Covid-19 and has a pre-existing condition that eventually causes them to die, this is counted as a Covid-19 death. This is slightly different from Hume\u2019s claim that someone dying for whatever reason is counted in the toll if they also have the coronavirus.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm\">According to the CDC</a>, about 90% of people recently hospitalized with the coronavirus had at least one underlying medical condition. Black people and older people are disproportionately being hospitalized because of the virus, due to their increased rate of other conditions such as diabetes, hypertension or respiratory problems.</p> <p>It is in fact more likely that the coronavirus death toll is much higher than the official figures suggest, rather than it being inflated. The CDC has acknowledged its count is an \u201cunderestimation\u201d because it only tallies cases where Covid-19 has been confirmed in a laboratory test.</p> <p>Epidemiologists say a widespread lack of initial testing in the US means many people died without being counted, while even now some people who die at home or in nursing homes are not being tested for the virus.</p> <p>In New York City, more than 200 people are dying at home each day during the pandemic, according to city officials, a very much higher rate than usual. Bill de Blasio, New York City\u2019s mayor, has estimated that about 100 to 200 people a day who die at home in the city are not being included in the official virus death count. But the federal government insists the overall figures are largely accurate.</p> <p>\u201cI think there is more of a chance of missing some that are really coronavirus deaths that are not being counted,\u201d Fauci told NBC. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that number is significant enough to really substantially modify the trends that we are seeing, at all.\u201d</p>",

A small number of reefs in the far north and far east were not visited this year.</p> <p>More than half of the reefs visited had been severely bleached, including dive tourism spots like Osprey Reef north of Port Douglas, Bougainville Reef off Cooktown and Flinders Reef off Townsville.</p> <p>The Coral Sea reefs are less well known than their neighbours to the west on the Great Barrier Reef, which experienced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/great-barrier-reefs-third-mass-bleaching-in-five-years-the-most-widespread-ever\">third mass bleaching outbreak in five years this summer.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/great-barrier-reefs-third-mass-bleaching-in-five-years-the-most-widespread-ever\">Great Barrier Reef's third mass bleaching in five years the most widespread yet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Coral Sea reefs were surveyed between mid-February and mid-March. Hoey said water temperatures were above 30C. Usual temperatures were 27C and 28C.</p> <p>Corals bleach when they sit in unusually hot water for too long. Corals can recover if bleaching is only mild but if temperatures are very high for prolonged periods, corals can die.</p> <p>On 18 March, the US government\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program produced analysis of heat stress over the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea showing \u201csignificant amounts of heat stress\u201d.</p> <p>Townsville-based Dr William Skirving, of Coral Reef Watch, told Guardian Australia: \u201cAll the Australia reefs outside of the GBR will have had significant amounts of bleaching and many would have had significant amounts of mortality.\u201d</p> <p>Hoey said unlike reefs closer to shore in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the reefs in the Coral Sea were largely unaffected by pollution and fishing pressures.</p> <p>\u201cBut they are extremely susceptible to climate-induced stresses,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Hoey said it was \u201chard to predict\u201d how many corals would die.</p> <p>These more remote reefs, he said, relied on their own corals to spawn and regrow, unlike the more tightly packed reefs of the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>He said: \u201cAny coral mortality will take a lot longer to recover from because there is hundreds of kilometres between these reefs and so there\u2019s unlikely to be a lot of connectivity between them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause of their isolation we have a lot to learn about these reefs, but we would still expect any fish and other organisms relying on the reefs to have been affected, particularly those relying on the corals for food and shelter.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Leck, WWF-Australia\u2019s head of oceans, said it was concerning that Coral Sea reefs had bleached because they were regarded as more resilient, as they benefitted from cool water upwelling and very clear water.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe fact they have bleached shows how extreme the underwater heatwave was in the Coral Sea. It shows how close we are to a tipping point with climate change and coral reefs.</p> <p>\u201cThe reefs in the Coral Sea are less well known, except amongst the high-end scuba diving community. They\u2019re a jewel in the crown for many divers around the world to come and visit.\u201d</p> <p>Craig Stephen, managing director of Mike Ball Dive Expeditions, has been visiting the Coral Sea reefs since 1995.</p> <p>He said there were still many amazing places to visit on the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea and \u201cgiven time\u201d he said he thought the reefs would recover.</p> <p>\u201cThese [Coral Sea] reefs rise from the sheer depths in very clear water,\u201d he said. \u201cLarge soft corals and sea fans dominate the depths and sharks abound, giving the diver a real sense of being in the abyss.</p> <p>\u201cYou can hang off a wall that\u2019s 1,000 metres and there you feel pretty insignificant. People enjoy the vastness of it.\u201d</p> <p>The 2020 bleaching was a \u201creset point for many of us\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe do need to step back and have a look at what we are doing to the planet.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t take a good look at ourselves and do something about our CO2 emissions then things will get out of our control. There is a chance to do something about this.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>\u201cLook, the first three episodes are complete trash. Push through those though, and if you like it after that, you\u2019ll love it.\u201d This is something I have said about the science fiction series The 100 approximately the same number of times over the past five years. Without fail, a few days later I receive a message that says some variation of: \u201cUgh, fine, it isn\u2019t bad.\u201d Then about a week after that: \u201cI can\u2019t stop watching this show. How is it this good?\u201d</p> <p>I know that now doesn\u2019t seem like exactly the right moment to talk up a show all about a nuclear apocalypse that has rendered Earth unliveable, but please bear with me. It\u2019s worth it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/08/shrill-no-easy-answers-or-fairytale-endings-in-this-warmly-intimate-series\">Shrill: no easy answers or fairytale endings in this warmly intimate series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In classic sci-fi form, The 100 is set in the not-too-distant future. All that remains of the human race is a small colony living on The Ark, a space station orbiting Earth. The idea is that humans will live there, die there, and reproduce there until Earth becomes inhabitable again. Life on The Ark is harsh: all crimes are met with capital punishment, food is limited, and worst of all it\u2019s running out of air. So the decision is made to send 100 of the population\u2019s juvenile delinquents down to Earth years earlier than planned. If they survive, great, everyone else can follow. If not, well, more air for those who remain.</p> <p>With the series about to enter its seventh and final season, you can take an educated guess at how well that goes. The show \u2013 once you push past the first three episodes \u2013 is like if Lord of the Flies were crossed with Firefly then reimagined as a soap opera. Also, as an added bonus, for an American show filmed in Canada it is very Australian. The cast has a surprisingly large number of Neighbours and Home and Away alumni, including Eliza \u201cJanae Timmins\u201d Taylor and Bob \u201cmy teenage self\u2019s favourite actor on Home and Away\u201d Morley.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDrsItJ_HU4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aDrsItJ_HU4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As the teenagers navigate a new world and tackle the challenges of both a hostile environment and essentially having to construct their own society from scratch, the writers are able to probe topics of real depth. On The Ark everything was punitive. Take extra food \u2013 get executed. Have more than one child \u2013 get executed. What, if anything, does this group of teens owe the people left back at their former home?</p> <p>Across the seasons The 100 digs into more complex territory. How can you decide if one life is worth more than another? Do you protect your own people at all costs? And then, just when you think it is all too real and feel the escapism of the show starting to get away from you, a giant mutant gorilla thing bursts through the jungle so unexpectedly that you can\u2019t help but laugh. Or you remember that the first episode featured someone saying, in earnest, \u201cWe\u2019re back, bitches!\u201d and everything is alright again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/03/hugh-grants-guilty-pleasures-rediscovering-the-saucy-and-sapphic-curios-of-his-back-catalogue\">Hugh Grant's guilty pleasures: rediscovering the saucy and Sapphic curios of his back catalogue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the perfect balance of dark and light. The 100 makes you ask big questions like: does being a strong leader mean giving up part of your humanity? And at the same time makes you ask practical questions like: where is everyone getting shampoo and blowouts? And with all this boning, why isn\u2019t everyone constantly pregnant?</p> <p>We have our own apocalypse to worry about right now, so why watch a show that is basically all about surviving the end of the world? Well, I could happily give you a hundred reasons, but I think the most compelling one is this: it\u2019s just very good television that will completely draw you in. It lets you think about important issues while keeping the real world at arm\u2019s length. It\u2019s deep without being grim, and fun without being flippant.</p> <p>Filled with cliffhangers (sometimes literally), interpersonal dramas and the occasional gut-punch of a plot twist, it\u2019s an intelligently crafted, completely engrossing series that somehow manages to distract you from the world\u2019s problems by being all about the world\u2019s problems.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>The first five seasons of The 100 are <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70283264\">streaming on Netflix</a> now</p>",

Firouzja is compared to the tactical legend Mikhail Tal, while Carlsen is perceived as the successor to Bobby Fischer or Garry Kasparov.</p> <p>There has already been a recent astonishing low profile marathon series between the two, played on 2 April on Lichess and consisting of 194 one-minute bullet games, many of which have been captured in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj_C4_i4w_A\" title=\"\">online videos</a>.</p> <p>The match was first to 100 wins. Counting the draws, Firouzja triumphed 103.5-90.5. Some blamed Carlsen\u2019s defeat on his using a mouse while Firouzja moved faster by finger touch. Others claimed that Carlsen had tired himself by playing 70 bullet games against fellow Norwegians immediately beforehand. The play was often of remarkably high quality on both sides for all moves in one minute with no increment, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmO1xJMZckY\" title=\"\">this example</a> analysed by GM Daniel King on Chessbase.</p> <p>The Banter Blitz dream final promises to be exceptionally watchable since both players have been in devastating form in earlier rounds. Up to the semi-final, Firouzja had won all five of his best of 16 game matches by at least six points, while Carlsen produced a Fischer-style performance in his semi-final. The world champion defeated Sanan Sjugirov, a Russian who had beaten him twice over the board, by a perfect 9-0, playing some wonderful games en route, all of which can be watched <a href=\"https://chess24.com/en/watch/live-tournaments/banter-blitz-cup-2019/6/1/1\" title=\"\">on video</a> with Carlsen\u2019s commentary.</p> <p>Firouzja had a much harder fight in Friday evening\u2019s second semi-final, but still defeated India\u2019s 26-year-old GM Srinath Narayanan, who had eliminated his five previous opponents, by a 9-6 margin, checkmating his opponent in the final game.</p> <p>Other major internet events have already begun or will soon be under way as experts and amateurs seize the opportunity for the serious competition which abruptly stopped over the board in mid-March due to Covid-19.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s national league, the 4NCL, was quickly into action as an online 4NCL attracted 172 four-player teams, far above expectations. The opening weekly round (of 10) was played on Tuesday on <a href=\"https://lichess.org/\" title=\"\">lichess.org</a>, the user-friendly free site where you are paired with an opponent within a few seconds and which is recommended for newcomers to internet chess.</p> <p>One unusual aspect of the online 4NCL is that Guildford,who have dominated the over-the-board version for the best part of a decade, are absent. In place of their elite GM squad there is a team of rising talents, Guildford Young Guns. There is also Guildford Gatekeepers, a quartet of low-rated amateurs.</p> <p>ChessPlus Alpha, a new 4NCL name, and Ireland\u2019s Gonzaga, whose base is a Dublin college, are the two top seeds. ChessPlus Alpha have registered some well-known Swedish GMs, though they did not field any of them in defeating Watford 3-1. Gonzaga suffered a shock defeat, 1.5-2.5 to Surbiton, for whom Koby Kalavannan, aged 17, enhanced his growing reputation by scoring the individual upset of the night, beating France\u2019s GM S\u00e9bastien Maz\u00e9.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/magnus-carlsen-to-stage-richest-online-chess-tournament-in-history\">Magnus Carlsen to stage richest online chess tournament in history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wednesday 15 April sees the chess.com $10,000 <a href=\"https://www.chess.com/news/view/april-15-abu-dhabi-super-blitz-challenge\" title=\"\">Abu Dhabi Blitz</a>, whose entry is headed by the US world No 2, Fabiano Caruana, and France\u2019s world No 5, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, leader of last month\u2019s aborted Candidates.

What do they have that I don\u2019t have? Is it swag?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He was of course joking, Noah clarified, because \u201cif anything, it\u2019s refreshing to see President Trump so concerned about the black community. But when he says it doesn\u2019t make sense that coronavirus is hitting black Americans the hardest \u2013 it\u2019s actually the opposite. Because when you look at the systemic and economic factors facing black people in America, it makes complete sense.\u201d Black people are overall less likely to have health insurance, more likely to have pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, and more likely to be in service jobs without work-from-home options.</p> <p>\u201cAnd of course, there\u2019s always just straight-up racism that affects black people as well,\u201d Noah said, such as implicit bias leading doctors to discount symptoms. \u201cSo while almost every industry around the world is shut down, it looks like racism is still considered an essential service.\u201d</p> <h2>Samantha Bee</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6Z6fzpJXAA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J6Z6fzpJXAA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As the coronavirus crisis extends into another month, \u201cthe Trump administration has been busy abusing their power and pulling some truly shady shit while we\u2019ve all been busy crafting masks out of our underwear,\u201d said Samantha Bee on Full Frontal. Bee presented a distressing list of changes: rollbacks of EPA regulation and emission standards, and more abuses of power at Ice, \u201cthe least necessary government agency since the Bureau of Cassette Tapes and LaserDiscs\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIce decided that since everyone isn\u2019t terrified enough right now, they should keep doing raids while people are stuck at home,\u201d Bee said, noting how agents in Los Angeles had made arrests on the first night of California\u2019s lockdown. \u201cHow is it essential to separate families during a health crisis? The only separation that desperately needs to be done right now is separating my hair from my body. I\u2019ve been a mess since my waxing place closed.</p> <p>\u201cTrump has also used the virus as an excuse to try to slash taxes, make the cuts to the federal interest rate that he already wanted to and to advance anti-union efforts,\u201d Bee continued, which is \u201cthe most work he\u2019s ever done. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say this but someone please find a way to sneak him on to a fucking golf course!</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s hard to think about anything other than our families, our friends or what our tits will look like after months of not wearing a bra,\u201d Bee concluded, \u201cbut unfortunately, we have to. What our government does right now will have a lasting impact on all of us, long after this pandemic is over.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>\u201cSeems like almost every day we get more and more evidence that the Trump administration knew well in advance of the very real threat of a pandemic, and that they both ignored it and lied to the American people about it,\u201d said Seth Meyers on Late Night. He showed a series of clips in which Trump claimed the pandemic was impossible to predict, such as: \u201cNobody knew there\u2019d be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OozvkPVI7LI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OozvkPVI7LI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cSo nobody could see this coming,\u201d Meyers deadpanned. \u201cYeah, Taiwan and South Korea and New Zealand and Singapore were all surprised. That\u2019s why they have a combined total of 12,000 cases and we have a total of 400,000 cases.</p> <p>\u201cDespite Trump\u2019s repeated claims that no one could have foreseen this, it turns out a lot of people foresaw this,\u201d Meyers continued and listed the times Trump was warned about the pandemic:</p> <p>\u201cFirst, Obama officials walk Trump aides through a global pandemic exercise in 2017. Then, in 2017 and 2018, threat assessment intelligence analysts even mentioned a close cousin of coronavirus by name, saying it had pandemic potential. Then in 2018, the director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the national security council told a symposium that the threat of pandemic flu is our number one health security concern. Then, top administration officials said last year that the threat of a pandemic kept them up at night. Then, White House economists warned in 2019 a pandemic could devastate America. Then, intelligence reports warned of a coronavirus crisis as early as November. And then, US intelligence reports from January and February warned about a likely pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you know, the saying: eight strikes and you\u2019re out,\u201d Meyers concluded. \u201cSeriously, how many incredibly specific warnings do you need?\u201d</p>",

  "<p>When this outbreak first began, all the talk was of a sharp but mercifully short economic sting in the tail. The downturn triggered by putting everyday life on hold to halt the infection should, we were told, be V-shaped: a shock, but one from which we\u2019d soon bounce back. Like many comforting predictions in the early days of this pandemic, that is beginning to look alarmingly over-confident.</p> <p>The first problem with picking up exactly where we left off is that where we left off was already in trouble. Today\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/uk-economy-already-flatlining-before-coronavirus-figures-reveal\">GDP figures</a>, covering the three-month period to February when the coronavirus had started to nibble at the travel and tourism industry but we were weeks away from lockdown, show economic growth virtually flatlining at 0.1% overall and falling in the final four weeks. Far from enjoying some mythical \u201cBoris bounce\u201d, we may have been teetering on the verge of a recession, as business confidence dried up in the face of a potentially hard Brexit. The fear is that the economic aftermath of this crisis, like the virus itself, might be toughest on those with pre-existing conditions - including otherwise thriving western countries choosing this moment in history to shoot themselves in the foot.</p> <p>The second problem is that, as the World Bank <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-worldbank/world-bank-sees-major-global-recession-due-to-pandemic-idUKKBN21L3EN\">has warned</a>, we may be heading for a global recession \u2013 yet, unlike 2008, there is little evidence of countries pulling together to find global solutions. The risk of that V-shaped recession being drawn out into a U, or even the dreaded L \u2013 a blow from which we barely recover, bumping along the bottom for years \u2013 grows if world leaders retreat into economic nationalism.</p> <p>So far, growing worries about the economic consequences of the epidemic have translated mainly into calls to end the lockdown quickly. It\u2019s true that the longer Britons are confined to their homes, the more businesses will fail, and the more those lucky enough to have savings will run out of them. The worse things get, meanwhile, the greater the tendency even for those who still feel secure in their jobs to hoard their cash for fear of what lies around the corner. This is the so-called paradox of thrift: that in a recession, people instinctively try to save their money instead of spending it, and thus inadvertently make things worse.</p> <p>Yet the trouble with calls to ward off economic disaster by risking an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/01/lengthy-lockdown-unrealistic-says-former-bank-of-england-governor\">early end to the lockdown</a> is that, in a sense, it\u2019s too late for that now. If the country had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ireland-school-closures-reveal-stark-contrast-to-uk-covid-19-response\">shut down</a> right at the start, when there were only a handful of cases in Britain and influential voices were still scoffing that this was just a touch of flu, there may have been public outrage at a perceived over-reaction, but we might now have had the luxury of wondering whether we could afford to ease off.</p> <p>As it is, there was something almost surreal about a No 10 press conference that saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/08/uk-coronavirus-london--enough-intensive-care-beds-says-sadiq-khan-live-news-boris-johnson?page=with:block-5e8dff988f08ec70ceced105#block-5e8dff988f08ec70ceced105\">journalists asking</a> when we might be allowed out again while the death toll was climbing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/08/uk-coronavirus-london--enough-intensive-care-beds-says-sadiq-khan-live-news-boris-johnson?page=with:block-5e8df3128f085d226cfd551f#block-5e8df3128f085d226cfd551f\">towards 1,000 a day</a>. We are nearing the moment of maximum danger, the moment hospital chiefs hold their breath and even atheists in Whitehall start praying. The blunt truth is that nobody is going anywhere, possibly not for months yet, if we want to keep this infection within hospitals\u2019 capacity to cope. So if we can\u2019t cure what directly ails the British economy any time soon, the only option is to try and improve its underlying condition. That\u2019s what the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has tried to do with an unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\">rescue package</a>, effectively taking much of the nation on to the state payroll in an attempt to keep businesses going until something like normality returns.</p> <p>And if the lockdown lasts into early summer, a similarly big ideological leap of imagination looms over Brexit. For the first time, according to a <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/04/08/ad558/1\">YouGov poll</a>, a narrow majority of Britons now want to extend the transition beyond December, suggesting the last thing many voters want right now is another economic shock. For now, Boris Johnson\u2019s administration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/brexit-uk-plan-to-secure-trade-deal-by-december-is-fantasy-says-eu\">clinging to the pretence</a> that a complex Brexit deal can still somehow be negotiated in the middle of a national emergency that has put the prime minister in intensive care. But reality surely dictates that the timetable can\u2019t hold.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/30/extend-brexit-transition-by-years-over-coronavirus-uk-told\">crunch time</a> for deciding whether or not to extend the timetable is June, by which time official growth and employment statistics should finally be catching up with the damage now happening under all our noses. If some ministers currently fear a public backlash by admitting Brexit might have to be delayed, by summer the idea of ploughing on regardless may be more likely to trigger a mutiny.</p> <p>We can\u2019t know yet, of course, whether this life-and-death emergency will make the country more, or less, risk-averse. But perhaps nobody in politics right now should underestimate the longing for life just to go back to normal when this is over: boring, disappointing, inadequate old normal, but which beats watching helplessly as our loved ones suffer and jobs vanish beneath our feet. The great unspoken fear is that by the time this is over, however, even normal will be out of reach.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/laura-marling\">Laura Marling</a> has described her seventh solo album as a kind of conceptual work. Song for Our Daughter, she says, is about \u201ctrauma and an enduring quest to understand what it is to be a woman in this society\u201d. The songs are written to an imaginary child, offering her \u201call the confidences and affirmations I found so difficult to provide myself\u201d. It has also turned up months earlier than expected. Scheduled for release in August \u2013 the beginning of the annual three-month season when albums by major artists traditionally appear \u2013 it has been brought forward. \u201cIn light of the change to all our circumstances,\u201d Marling wrote on Instagram, \u201c I saw no reason to hold back on something that, at the very least, might entertain, and, at its best, provide some union.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af5f52c484d82cbde6f853ef0469b5d88da5e0ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af5f52c484d82cbde6f853ef0469b5d88da5e0ca/0_0_512_512/500.jpg\" alt=\"The artwork for Song for Our Daughter.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The artwork for Song for Our Daughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However altruistic her intention, it\u2019s quite a canny move: a lot of people have a lot of time on their hands right now, which may cause them to focus more intently on a singer\u2019s work. Yet there is always the chance the opposite may happen. These are, as you can hardly have failed to notice, extraordinary, unprecedented times. There is no escape from what\u2019s going on in the outside world: to release an album now, an artist would have to be pretty confident they\u2019d made something capable of cutting through the constant roar of news about the terrifying global crisis; something capable of subverting our natural inclination to react by turning to stuff we already know and love and find comforting. But a lack of confidence has never been Laura Marling\u2019s undoing: as so-called \u201csensitive\u201d singer-songwriters go, she always cuts a remarkably robust figure. \u201cI have not a fuck to give,\u201d she snaps on opener Alexandra, and all the contents of Song for Our Daughter are distinctly less gooey and self-absorbed than an album offering advice to an imaginary unborn child might be in less assured hands.</p> <p>Marling is still wont to change her accent with the frequency that some singer-songwriters change plectrums. Indeed, she sometimes changes accent in the middle of a song, as on Hope We Meet Again, where she keeps dipping out of the mid-Atlantic twang that\u2019s presumably necessary if you\u2019re going to write songs with words such as \u201chighway\u201d and \u201cmomma\u201d in them, into the kind of cut-glass RP you might expect from someone who comes from Berkshire. The first song that lyrically fits with the advice-to-an-imaginary-child concept, Strange Girl, finds Marling singing in the Dylan-derived sneer she deployed on Master Hunter, from her album Once I Was an Eagle, with what appears to be a little of mid-70s Lou Reed\u2019s patent brand of bored contempt stirred in. Which is certainly a bracing way of delivering maternal counsel.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ntm8jPDfU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P3ntm8jPDfU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Laura Marling: Held Down \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In fact, it doesn\u2019t sound much like maternal counsel at all, more like Marling talking about her own past with an appealing roll of the eyes: \u201cBuild yourself a garden and have something to attend / Cut off all relations because you couldn\u2019t stand your friends / Oh girl, please \u2013 don\u2019t bullshit me.\u201d Certainly, it\u2019s more successful than the title track, where the emotions she summons when imagining her daughter in some pretty grim situations \u2013 \u201cblood on the floor\u201d, \u201cwith your clothes on the floor, taking your advice from an old, balding bore\u201d \u2013 tend to nothing sharper than sighing, well-I-tried-to-warn-you sadness. It\u2019s a song written by someone trying to picture what it\u2019s like being a parent, and not quite pulling said picture into focus.</p> <p>That said, the title track <em>is</em> extraordinarily beautiful, a quality it shares with the rest of Song for Our Daughter. One of the album\u2019s musical touchstones was apparently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney\">Paul McCartney</a>\u2019s 70s albums, and whatever else you think about post-Beatles Macca, you\u2019d have a hard time arguing he was stingy with the tunes. And so it is here. The piano-led Blow By Blow, the gentle strum of For You, and the feedback-flecked Held Down are all lavished with gorgeous, effortless-seeming melodies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The effect is heightened by the production. It\u2019s a highly polished piece of work, big on rich string arrangements and intricate harmony vocals. There\u2019s a particularly striking moment when a swirl of voices \u2013 all Marling\u2019s, multi-tracked to infinity \u2013 rises up to underpin the line \u201cI love you, goodbye\u201d, on The End of the Affair. But it\u2019s recorded in a way that creates a live feel, the lack of echo giving the illusion that Marling and her band are in close proximity to the listener. The effect is impressively punchy on Strange Girl, but on the songs that fill the album\u2019s second half, which are largely reliant on vocals and fingerpicked guitar, the production conjures a warm, fresh intimacy that feels welcome in a world of Zoom meetings and FaceTime catch-ups.

Rebranding wildlife as livestock doesn\u2019t alter the fact that there are insurmountable challenges to keeping these species in farm environments, their welfare needs simply can\u2019t be met.

  "<p>The environmental changes wrought by the coronavirus were first visible from space.

Environmental groups are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">urging</a> the UK and European Union not to do the same.</p> <p>If governments prime the economic pumps with the intention of a return to business as usual, environmental gains are likely to be temporary or reversed.

This year will almost certainly see a much lower <a href=\"https://www.mammal.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RoadDeaths2001Report.pdf\">toll for roadkill by cars and trucks</a>, which \u2013 in the UK alone \u2013 annually takes the lives of about 100,000 hedgehogs, 30,000 deer, 50,000 badgers and 100,000 foxes, as well as barn owls and many other species of bird and insect. Many councils have delayed cutting the grass on roadside verges \u2013 one of the last remaining habitats for wildflowers \u2013 which should bring a riot of colour to the countryside this summer and provide more pollen for bees.</p> <p>Coyotes, normally timid of traffic, have been spotted on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Deer are grazing near Washington homes a few miles from the White House. Wild boar are becoming bolder in Barcelona and Bergamo, Italy. In Wales, peacocks have strutted through Bangor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/31/llandudno-goats-herd-running-riot-coronavirus-lockdown\">goats through Llandudno</a> and sheep have been filmed on roundabouts in a deserted playground in Monmouthshire.</p> <p>This is presented as the comedy in our tragedy. Cartoonists have depicted throngs of tourist animals gawping through city windows at humans under lockdown. Commentators are even talking of the \u201cpost-human\u201d era \u2013 a mocking rejoinder to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\">the idea that we live in Anthropocene</a>, a period of human domination that is reshaping the planet. Humour does not get much blacker. We are laughing at our own decline \u2013 and assuming that nature will be the beneficiary.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners say that is a dangerous misconception. The picture is different across our unequal world. Rich, industrialised nations are seeing a temporary recovery of nature because there is so little of it in the first place. Poorer countries, on the other hand, especially in the southern hemisphere, fear an increased threat to wildlife because the pandemic means they have less money and personnel with which to conserve endangered species and habitats.</p> <p>In the Amazon rainforest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/03/brazil-amazon-protection-coronavirus-fire-season\">environmental authorities are reining in monitoring and protection operations</a>. In the Masai Mara and Serengeti, nature reserves are taking less tourist revenue, which means they are struggling to pay rangers. Conservation groups fear this will open the door to more illegal poaching, mining and logging, especially now that local people are losing income and need new ways to feed their families.</p> <p>\u201cIn the short term it would be dangerous to think that a downturn in economic activity is a benefit to nature,\u201d said Matt Walpole of Fauna and Flora International. \u201cThere are significant risks.\u201d</p> <p>Potentially offsetting this is reduced demand for many natural resources, but it remains to be seen whether home isolation of half the world\u2019s population affects the appetite for consumer goods.</p> <h2>A new future?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d98384a32caffc4da15db2b54a21373919007aca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d98384a32caffc4da15db2b54a21373919007aca/0_426_6519_3911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Security guards patrol road near market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Security guards patrol a road next to the closed Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roman Pilipey/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The respite for nature will be less important than what follows. That is already being decided in closed meetings while the public is locked down at home. Meanwhile, global conferences intended to find solutions to environmental problems, such as the Cop26 UN climate talks originally scheduled for Glasgow at the end of this year, have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\">postponed</a>.</p> <p>UN leaders, scientists and activists are pushing for an urgent public debate so that recovery can focus on green jobs and clean energy, building efficiency, natural infrastructure and a strengthening of the global commons.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the big political battle,\u201d said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and an architect of the Paris agreement. Leading scientists have jointly signed an <a href=\"https://clubofrome.org/impact-hubs/climate-emergency/open-letter-to-global-leaders-a-healthy-planet-for-healthy-people/\">open appeal</a> for governments to use recovery packages to shift in a greener direction rather than going back to business as usual.</p> <p>Ultimately, the most important environmental impact is likely to be on public perceptions. The pandemic has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/covid-19-climate-crisis-governments-coronavirus\">demonstrated</a> the deadly consequences of ignoring expert warnings, of political delay, and of sacrificing human health and natural landscapes for the economy. Of new infectious diseases, 75% come from animals, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Compared with the past, they pass more rapidly to humans through wildlife trafficking and deforestation and then spread across the globe through air travel and cruise-ship tourism. China \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest market for wild animals \u2013 appears to have recognised this by banning the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52125309\">farming and consumption of live wildlife</a>. There are growing calls for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/ban-live-animal-markets-pandemics-un-biodiversity-chief-age-of-extinction?CMP=share_btn_tw\">global ban on \u201cwet markets\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The pandemic has also shown that pollution lowers our resistance to disease. More exposure to traffic fumes means weaker lungs and greater risk of dying from Covid-19, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/air-pollution-linked-to-far-higher-covid-19-death-rates-study-finds\">according to scientists at Harvard University</a>. As the UN\u2019s environment chief, Inger Andersen, put it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-nature-is-sending-us-a-message-says-un-environment-chief\">nature is sending us a message</a> that if we neglect the planet, we put our own wellbeing at risk.</p> <p>Since the start of the pandemic, it is not just from space that the world looks different. The unthinkable is now thinkable. Positions are shifting. Libertarian governments are curtailing freedoms more drastically than wartime leaders. Austerity conservatives are approving trillions of dollars for healthcare and emergency spending. Small-state advocates are being forced into massive interventions. Leading business publications are calling for a deep reform of capitalism. Most importantly, the political focus has shifted from individual consumption to collective wellbeing.</p> <p>These 100 days have changed the way we think about change. Ultimately, whether this pandemic is good or bad for the environment depends not on the virus, but on humanity. If there is no political pressure on governments, the world will go back to unsustainable business as usual rather than emerge with a healthier sense of what is normal.</p> <p>For the <a href=\"http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/852.html\">French philosopher Bruno Latour</a>, one thing we have learned is that it is possible in a matter of weeks to slow the economy, which until now had been considered inconceivable due to the pressures of globalisation.</p> <p>\u201cThe incredible discovery is that there was in fact in the world economic system, hidden from all eyes, a bright red alarm signal, next to a large steel lever that each head of state could pull at once to stop \u2018the progress train\u2019 with a shrill screech of the brakes,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>This makes ecological calls to move off a path of endless resource consumption more realistic, maybe even more desirable. But Latour warns that this unforeseen pause could easily allow powerful interests to seize more control ahead of the bigger battles looming over the climate and biodiversity. \u201cThis is where we must act,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the opportunity works for them, it works for us too.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/debenhams\">Debenhams</a> has fallen into administration, casting fresh doubt over the future of the struggling chain, which employs more than 20,000 people.</p> <p>Like other fashion retailers, Debenhams is facing financial turmoil as the coronavirus lockdown prevents Britons from shopping. However the indebted retailer had problems prior to the health crisis and on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/06/debenhams-appoint-administrators-second-time-in-year-coronavirus-lockdown\">confirmed the appointment</a> of restructuring firm FRP Advisory to handle a \u201clight touch\u201d administration of the 142-store chain.</p> <p>Debenhams said administrators would work alongside existing management to \u201cget the business into a position to re-open and trade as many stores as possible again when restrictions are lifted\u201d. However it also warned that FRP Advisory would be putting its Irish chain into liquidation which would mean the permanent closure of 11 stores that employ around 1,260 people.</p> <p>Stefaan Vansteenkiste, chief executive of Debenhams, said: \u201cWe are desperately sorry not to be able to keep the Irish business operating but are faced with no alternative option in the current environment.\u201d</p> <p>The Irish chain, which includes four branches in Dublin and two in Cork, employed 958 Debenhams staff as well as 300 others who worked for in-store concessions. The staff have already been stood down under the Irish government\u2019s wage support scheme.</p> <p>It was anticipated that Debenhams\u2019 owners and lenders would make additional funding available to fund the administration period, Vansteenkiste said. \u201cIn these unprecedented circumstances the appointment of the administrators will protect our business, our employees and other important stakeholders, so that we are in a position to resume trading from our stores when government restrictions are lifted.\u201d</p> <p>The retailer\u2019s stores are all closed anyway due to the government-mandated shutdown, although its website is still operating as normal. The majority of its UK workforce has also been furloughed.</p> <p>Debenhams, which is hobbled by a \u00a3600m debt pile, was listed on the stock exchange until last April, when its deteriorating finances <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/09/debenhams-is-taken-over-by-lenders-mike-ashley-loses-sta\">resulted in an administration</a> that wiped out shareholders and transferred ownership to a group of financial investors that includes the US hedge funds Silver Point and GoldenTree.</p> <p>Like other struggling chains, it has used an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to cut rents and close unprofitable stores <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/03/debenhams-kicks-off-make-or-break-year-with-19-store-closures\">including a group of 19 shops in January</a>.

  "<p>Local television station London Live is being investigated by the media regulator after the channel broadcast an interview with the conspiracist David Icke in which he suggested the coronavirus pandemic was part of a plot by governments to destroy the economy and conduct mass surveillance.</p> <p>Ofcom said it has launched an urgent investigation into the channel for potentially breaching broadcasting standards after receiving 41 complaints from members of the public. Last week it warned regulated radio and television stations to take extra care not to broadcast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/02/uk-media-outlets-told-not-to-promote-baseless-5g-coronavirus-theories\">potentially damaging</a> claims about the pandemic, with a promise to expedite investigations linked to coronavirus.</p> <p>London Live is controlled by Evgeny Lebedev and operates from the same offices as his newspaper titles Evening Standard and Independent.</p> <p>London Live defended the decision to broadcast the interview with Icke, which was edited down from an even longer online interview conducted last month by the unrelated YouTube channel London Real.</p> <p>They said those complaining were confusing the material they broadcast with a separate interview Icke conducted with London Real this week, which was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52198946\">banned from YouTube for spreading potentially damaging claims about 5G mobile networks</a>.</p> <p>A spokesperson for London Live said: \u201cWe note that several commentators on social media have complained about our decision, however, we also note those complaints are about another interview with David Icke. We did not broadcast the interview which is the subject of the complaints on social media.</p> <p>\u201cCommentators are confusing the interview broadcast last night with an interview with David Icke which was removed from YouTube. The interview London Live did broadcast is still available on YouTube. We regret if we have given any rise to this confusion.\u201d</p> <p>In a minute-long clip of the broadcast uploaded to London Live\u2019s Twitter account, Icke insinuates a connection between coronavirus research and the Israeli state, while also claiming any moves to require people to ultimately be vaccinated for coronavirus is \u201cfascism\u201d.</p> <p>The broadcast was prefaced with a warning from the channel that the \u201cviews contained in this programme are those of individuals articulating them and are not necessarily those of London Live\u201d.</p> <p>London Live is one of the local television stations introduced by the former culture secretary Jeremy Hunt almost a decade ago but has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/28/evgeny-lebedev-in-talks-to-sell-london-live-tv-station\">struggled to reach large audiences</a>. Despite this it enjoys a prominent position on programme listings, which can help attract casual viewers.</p> <p>The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the material consisted of \u201clunatic conspiracy theories and no sensible person would give them a moment\u2019s thought \u2026 Clearly that station is regulated by Ofcom and I would be expecting Ofcom to take appropriate action.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Icke is a former Hereford United goalkeeper who has long been of the most prominent figures in global conspiracist circles. One concern of factcheckers is that debunking baseless theories can ultimately elevate them, with Icke\u2019s supporters holding up YouTube\u2019s deletion of videos as a sign that he is right.</p> <p>While Ofcom can issue sanctions to regulated broadcast radio and television stations, there is currently no substantive regulation of social media output. Online broadcasts can reach a vast audience but oversight of content relies on the whims of private companies.</p> <p>The juxtaposition between regulation of online and broadcast media is stark. According to figures provided by overnights.tv, a peak audience of about 80,000 people watched Wednesday night\u2019s edited David Icke interview on London Live, which has attracted comment from cabinet ministers and potential regulatory intervention.</p> <p>By comparison, 5.2m viewers watched the original unedited interview on YouTube without any government intervention or media questions.</p>",
  "<p>We knew this was coming. In her 1994 warning to the world, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/200682/the-coming-plague-by-laurie-garrett/\">The Coming Plague, Laurie Garrett</a> concluded: \u201cWhile the human race battles itself, fighting over ever more crowded turf and scarcer resources, the advantage moves to the microbes\u2019 court. They are our predators and they will be victorious if we, <em>Homo sapiens</em>, do not learn how to live in a rational global village that affords the microbes few opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>If you think her language hyperbolic, consider the more sober analysis from the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22553895\">US Institute of Medicine in 2004</a>. It evaluated the lessons of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\">2003 S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\">ars outbreak</a>, quoting Goethe: \u201cKnowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.\u201d It concluded that \u201cthe rapid containment of Sars is a success in public health, but also a warning \u2026 If Sars reoccurs \u2026 health systems worldwide will be put under extreme pressure \u2026 Continued vigilance is vital.\u201d</p> <p>But the world ignored these warnings.</p> <p>Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser to the UK government between 2012 and 2019, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00919-3\">recently recalled</a> \u201ca practice run for an influenza pandemic in which about 200,000 people died. It left me shattered.\u201d But did the experience trigger government action? \u201cWe learnt what would help, but did not necessarily implement those lessons,\u201d Boyd said.</p> <p>Austerity blunted the ambition and commitment of government to protect its people. The political objective was to diminish the size and role of the state. The result was to leave the country fatally weakened. Whatever the reasons for failing to act upon the lessons of Sars and influenza simulations, the fact remained, as Boyd summed it up, \u201cwe were poorly prepared\u201d.</p> <p>The global response to Sars-CoV-2 is the greatest science policy failure in a generation. The signals were clear. <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/hendra-virus-disease#tab=tab_1\">Hendra in 1994</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19108397\">Nipah in 1998</a>, Sars in 2003, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html\">ers in 2012</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/-sp-ebola-crisis-briefing\">Ebola in 2014</a>; these major human epidemics were all caused by viruses that originated in animal hosts and crossed over into humans. Covid-19 is caused by a new variant of the same coronavirus that caused Sars.</p> <p>That the warning signs went unheeded is unsurprising. Few of us have experienced a pandemic, and we are all guilty of ignoring information that doesn\u2019t reflect our own experience of the world. Catastrophes reveal the weakness of human memory. How can one plan for a random rare event \u2013 surely the sacrifices will be too great? But, as the seismologist Lucy Jones argues in her 2018 book <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/554995/the-big-ones-by-dr-lucy-jones/\">The Big Ones</a>, \u201cnatural hazards are inevitable; the disaster is not\u201d.</p> <p>The first duty of government is to protect its citizens. The risks of a pandemic can be measured and quantified. As Garrett and the Institute of Medicine showed, the dangers of a new epidemic have been known and understood since the emergence of HIV in the 1980s. Since then, 75 million people have been infected with the disease and 32 million have died. HIV may not have swept through the world at the same pace as Sars-CoV-2, but its long shadow should have alerted governments to prepare for an outbreak of a new virus.</p> <p>During a crisis, the public and politicians alike understandably turn to experts. But on this occasion, the experts \u2013 scientists who have modelled and simulated our possible futures \u2013 made assumptions that turned out to be mistaken. The UK imagined the pandemic would be much like influenza. The influenza virus is not benign \u2013 the number of annual deaths from influenza in the UK varies widely, with a recent peak of <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-compare-influenza/\">28,330 deaths in 2014-15</a> \u2013 but influenza is not Covid-19.</p> <p>China, by contrast, was scarred by its experience of Sars. When the government realised that a new virus was circulating, Chinese officials didn\u2019t advise hand washing, a better cough etiquette and disposing of tissues. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">They quarantined entire cities and shut down the economy</a>. As one former secretary of state for health in England put it to me, our scientists suffered from a \u201ccognitive bias\u201d towards the milder threat of influenza.</p> <p>Perhaps that is why the key government committee, the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (Nervtag), <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-path-speci/special-report-johnson-listened-to-his-scientists-about-coronavirus-but-they-were-slow-to-sound-the-alarm-idUSKBN21P1VF\">concluded on 21 February</a>, three weeks after the World Health Organization had declared a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">public </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">health </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">emergency of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">international </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared\">concern</a>, that<strong> </strong>they had no objection to Public Health England\u2019s \u201cmoderate\u201d risk assessment of the disease to the UK population. That was a genuinely fatal error of judgement.</p> <p>Failure to escalate the risk assessment led to mortal delays in preparing the NHS for the coming wave of infections. The desperate pleas I have received from frontline NHS staff are painful to read. \u201cNursing burnout is at an all-time high and a lot of our heroic nursing staff are on the verge of emotional breakdown.\u201d \u201cIt is sickening that this is happening, and that somehow this country thinks it\u2019s OK to let some members of staff get sick, get ventilated, or die.\u201d \u201cI feel like a soldier going to war without a gun.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s suicide.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sick of being called a hero because if I had any choice I wouldn\u2019t be coming to work.\u201d</p> <p>The availability of, and access to, appropriate personal protective equipment has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">appallingly bad for many nurses and doctors</a>. Some hospital trusts have planned well. But many have been unable to provide the necessary safe equipment to their frontline teams.</p> <p>At every press conference, the government spokesperson always includes the same line: \u201cWe have been following the medical and scientific advice.\u201d It\u2019s a good line. And it\u2019s partly true. But the government knew the NHS was unprepared. It knew it had failed to build the necessary intensive care surge capacity to meet the likely patient demand. As one doctor wrote to me: \u201cIt seems that nobody wants to learn from the human tragedy that happened in Italy, China, Spain \u2026 This is really sad \u2026 Doctors and scientists who are not able to learn from one another.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re supposed to be living through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth\">Anthropocene</a>, an era where human activity has become the dominant influence on the environment. The idea of the Anthropocene conjures notions of human omnipotence. But Covid-19 has revealed the astonishing fragility of our societies. It has exposed our inability to cooperate, to coordinate, and to act together. But perhaps we can\u2019t control the natural world after all. Perhaps we are not quite as dominant as we once thought.</p> <p>If Covid-19 eventually imbues human beings with some humility, it\u2019s possible that we will, after all, be receptive to the lessons of this lethal pandemic. Or perhaps we will sink back into our culture of complacent exceptionalism and await the next plague that will surely arrive. To go by recent history, that moment will come sooner than we think.</p>",
  "<p>Formula One is investigating how to begin the season behind closed doors at European races. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/07/formula-one-furloughs-half-of-staff-while-management-take-20-pay-cut\">Nine grands prix have been called off</a> because of coronavirus but the F1 sporting director, Ross Brawn, said every option is being considered and believes it may be possible to hold up to 19 races.</p> <p>The Canadian Grand Prix became the latest race to be postponed on Tuesday.

Brawn said F1 is making plans on the assumption of the easing of restrictions imposed across Europe.</p> <p>\u201cOur view is probably a European start will be favourable and that could even be a closed event,\u201d Brawn said in a vodcast on Sky Sports. \u201cWe could have a very enclosed environment where teams come in on charters, we channel them into the circuit, we make sure everyone is tested, cleared and that there is no risk to anyone.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a race with no spectators. That\u2019s not great but it\u2019s better than no racing at all. We have to remember there are millions of people who follow the sport sat at home. A lot of them are isolating and to be able to keep it alive and entertain people would be a huge bonus in this crisis. But we can\u2019t put anyone at risk.\u201d</p> <p>F1 had already assented to a closed-door meeting. The Bahrain GP was to be held without spectators in March. Brawn believes permanent circuits would be able to prepare for a race with a short lead time if they are not required to accommodate fans, provide marketing and organise tickets. The British Grand Prix set the end of this month as the latest point to begin preparing the circuit for the race scheduled for 19 July.</p> <p>Binotto acknowledged two-day meetings were already under discussion and Brawn revealed F1 is considering a punishing schedule to maximise the number of races.</p> <p>\u201cIf we were able to start at the beginning of July we could do a 19-race season, [It would be] tough, three races on, one weekend off, three races on, one weekend off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have looked at all the logistics.\u201d</p> <p>He also recognised there was a finite period in which F1 could conclude a world championship. \u201cEight races is the minimum, [according to] the FIA statutes,\u201d Brawn said. \u201cWe could achieve eight races by starting in October. So if you wanted a drop-dead point it would be October but there is always the possibility we could run into next year. That\u2019s being explored.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Rare wildflowers and declining bee populations could start to recover during the coronavirus lockdown because many councils are leaving roadside verges uncut, according to Europe\u2019s biggest conservation charity for wild plants.</p> <p>The respite for these mini-meadows is likely to lead to an explosion of colour in the countryside this summer and bring benefits to other pollinators, including butterflies, birds and bats, botanists at <a href=\"www.plantlife.org.uk\">Plantlife</a> said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/14/on-the-verge-a-quiet-roadside-revolution-is-boosting-wildflowers-aoe\">On the verge: a quiet roadside revolution is boosting wildflowers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roadside verges are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/18/wildflowers-verges-conservation-mowing-councils\">one of the last refuges</a> for the many plant species that have been devastated by the conversion of natural meadows into farmland and housing estates. These narrow strips of grassland are home to 700 species of wildflowers, nearly 45% of the UK\u2019s total flora.</p> <p>Their potential role as conservation areas, however, is normally undermined each spring by local councils when they mow the roadsides.

Some local authorities, such as Devon, had already begun to accept that this should be done later and less frequently.</p> <p>Trevor Dines, Plantlife\u2019s botanical specialist, said this could be a silver lining to the coronavirus crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s a real opportunity for verges to flower again, some for the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the lockdown ends in late May, drivers will see great swaths of oxeye daisies and ladies bedstraw.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88e3f7e7af7c3d8c9ab36b9f182eab4dab77a633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88e3f7e7af7c3d8c9ab36b9f182eab4dab77a633/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pyramidal orchids on verge in Dorset\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pyramidal orchids on verge in Dorset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Murphy/Plantlife/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grass near junctions and sight lines needs to be trimmed more regularly for safety reasons, but he said most stretches of road can be left until much later in the year so that motorists can see the benefits outweigh the risks. \u201cOur message to councils is that if you haven\u2019t cut verges until now then leave them until August and gauge the response from the public,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Kate Petty, the group\u2019s road verge campaign manager, said the extraordinary short-term circumstances of the pandemic could help to shift opinion and policies with long-term benefits for threatened species such as wood-calamint.</p> <p>\u201cThe fix is startlingly straightforward. Simply cutting verges less and later will save plants, money and reduce emissions.

Last year, we already saw improvement in the areas where councils were cutting less. I had my best ever year for honey,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also good for mental health. People are desperate for wildlife and colour right now. Let\u2019s see what the public response is. For lots of commuters, myself included, verges are the only chance to see wild plants.\u201d</p> <p>This year will almost certainly see much lower levels of wildlife roadkill. Past <a href=\"https://www.mammal.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RoadDeaths2001Report.pdf\">estimates</a> suggest cars and trucks in the UK killed about 100,000 hedgehogs, 100,000 foxes, 50,000 badgers, 30,000 deer a year as well as barn owls and many other species of bird and insect.</p>",
  "<p>Liv Cooke recognises the peculiarity of her position during lockdown. Football as mass entertainment has ceased and yet, for one of the world\u2019s leading professional freestylers, it is debatable whether the popularity and profile of her chosen sport has ever felt so high. The platform has enabled Cooke to provide education as well as offer escapism.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/09/fa-can-boost-post-coronavirus-economy-with-new-venues-for-womens-euro-2022\">FA can boost post-coronavirus economy with new venues for women's Euro 2022</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cFreestyle football is a massively growing sport and right now it feels like every professional footballer is becoming a freestyler too,\u201d says Cooke, the 2017 world champion, the UK\u2019s first woman professional freestyler, and now a BBC presenter. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Paul Pogba doing around the worlds at home and many others too. It\u2019s putting the sport in a positive light. It helped me physically and mentally and now I\u2019m addicted to it. It changed my life and if it can help others at this time then that is a beautiful thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cooke\u2019s way of helping is #TutorialsForIsolation, a \u201crandom idea\u201d that has gained a vast following on social media over the past few weeks. Every day the 20-year-old from Leyland, Lancashire, posts footage of herself performing a freestyle trick on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/livcookefs/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LivCookefs?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@livcookefs?lang=en\">TikTok</a> \u2013 all @LivCookeFS \u2013 with instructions on how to follow suit at home. It is an opportunity to learn from a four-times world record holder \u2013 Cooke\u2019s records are for sole juggles (217 in 60 seconds), chin juggles (208 in 60 seconds), leg rolls (27 in 30 seconds) and sole passes (18 in 30 seconds) \u2013 but also, and perhaps more importantly at this time, to remain active and learn within the confines of home.</p> \n<p>\u201cI posted a video of me doing a trick in my kitchen and people were asking me how to do it,\u201d Cooke explains. \u201cSo I thought this would be the perfect time to do it. People can go on a downward spiral when they\u2019re stuck at home but this keeps you happy and fit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9886e9fd-14a0-4b81-aa4a-34ed87c6f2d7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LRcQzT1jlVQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe idea is to build up from beginners\u2019 tricks to more difficult tricks. The hardest part has been thinking of a trick and then making sure it can be done indoors, otherwise people might end up breaking everything.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt first we scripted the tricks but that wasn\u2019t working, it just wasn\u2019t me, but when we started doing them off-the-cuff it allowed me to think in the moment and that was much better. We\u2019re doing one trick a day during isolation and if we have to keep going then I\u2019ll just have to be creative; I am a professional freestyler after all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cooke had established a huge social media following before the lockdown \u2013 4.1m followers and counting on TikTok, for example \u2013 with a role on MOTDx following on from her professional successes and commercial appearances. The reaction, therefore, has been less surprising than the public\u2019s ability to copy the tricks.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat has surprised me is how many people have accomplished the tricks and how quickly they\u2019ve picked it up,\u201d Cooke says. \u201cIt just shows how important social media is. I was aware of its importance before the isolation. I had young girls coming up to me to say I had inspired them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b4fdfe1c4b17c2e0c0d4c4da45f5f83c96efda8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b4fdfe1c4b17c2e0c0d4c4da45f5f83c96efda8/0_0_1451_871/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liv Cooke shows how to do sole juggles.

Unemployment offices have been unable to cope with the huge volumes of claims made in recent weeks, with widespread reports of websites crashing and phone lines collapsing under the weight of calls. Those delays will filter through to the figures in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Florida and Texas, which account for 15% of the nation\u2019s payrolls, only moved to close non-essential businesses in the middle of last week, so the surge in claims in those states is likely to show up in the next report. States have moved to extend unemployment benefits to gig workers employed by Uber, Lyft and others, but not all of them have yet been able to make claims. Others have chosen to stop working for health reasons and have yet to apply for benefits.</p> <p>Eric Anderson, 63, a grocery store worker in Mulberry, Florida, recently quit his job because he is in the high-risk coronavirus category because of his age and diabetes.

  "<p>Just a few months ago Cheng Yongcai ran a thriving farm that produced 20,000 bamboo rats a year in Qingyuan in northern Guangdong province.</p> <p>It was an operation that his local government actively encouraged with loans and other support, he says.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 outbreak, widely suspected of originating in China\u2019s huge wildlife industry supply chain, has led to a complete halt in Yongcai\u2019s operation, now shut indefinitely while he awaits final rules on what will be allowed once the crisis is over.</p> <p>China put in place a temporary ban on all wildlife trading and consumption in late February. But a final determination as to what will be legal or illegal after years of lacklustre regulation has been postponed until authorities in Beijing can get a handle on the human side of the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cWe still haven\u2019t been told what to do, except that we can\u2019t sell or release or even cull them until further notice, so we\u2019re still keeping them, and that\u2019s been costing us about 300 yuan [\u00a334] per day for the past three months,\u201d Yongcai, 30, told the Guardian by phone.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope to transition to other types of business but until it\u2019s clear what to do with the rats, it\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would need funding and the right facility for that.\u201d</p> <p>Like Yongcai, many other wildlife farmers are increasingly irked by the bans on the trade, in place since late January. They argue that they are being unfairly blamed when no evidence has been provided by the Chinese government pinpointing the exact source of the outbreak.</p> <p>Certain types of bats and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/pangolins-might-have-spread-coronavirus-to-humans\">pangolins </a>have been identified by epidemiological studies as natural carriers of the Sars-Cov-2 viruses that spawned Covid-19. But it is still unclear how likely either of these are to have been the source. Meanwhile, other animals such as civet cats, bamboo rats and several kinds of rodents have been shown to be carriers of coronaviruses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-closures-reveal-vast-scale-of-chinas-secretive-wildlife-farm-industry\">Coronavirus closures reveal vast scale of China\u2019s secretive wildlife farm industry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problem is that the regulation and oversight of the sector has been confusing. The last updated catalogue of terrestrial wildlife approved for breeding by Chinese authorities that the Guardian could find, which <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.cn/main/4818/content-796749.html\">appears to be dated 2008</a>, includes civet cats. But it does not include pangolins, bats, or bamboo rats.</p> <p>Yet, local governments, the state forestry and grassland administration and their provincial bureaus have encouraged and supported all sorts of wildlife farms. \u201cThe real number could be hundreds or even over a thousand kinds [of wild animal species] with no regulation,\u201d said Yin Shanchuan, a volunteer with the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation who has long been involved in investigations with the group.</p> <p>\u201cSomehow these were still allowed by the forestry authorities,\u201d Yin said.</p> <p>Recently, the industry association that lobbies for farming bamboo rats has called for the government to continue allowing the animals to be bred, arguing that they have been encouraged for years and have not been found to be the source of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>The group declined to comment about its appeal to lift the ban when contacted by the Guardian on 3 April.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a bit unfair, because for people in the rural areas, this is a very profitable business,\u201d Yongcai said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to invest a lot, you don\u2019t cause much pollution and you only have to feed them bamboo and grass.\u201d</p> <p>Gao Guanxing, a farmer in a village near Heyuan, Guangdong, was one of thousands who went into wildlife breeding in recent years as part of China\u2019s efforts to alleviate poverty by the end of 2020. In 2016 he started to rear bamboo rats, and he was among farmers <a href=\"http://www.zhushuxs.com/news/zhengcefagui/576.html\">feted by officials from nearby Shenzhen</a> and the local government.</p> <p>But now those same local officials are attempting to persuade <a href=\"https://www.yicai.com/news/100558841.html\">230 families who </a><a href=\"https://www.yicai.com/news/100558841.html\">went into breeding </a>bamboo rats, wild boar, snakes, civet cats, frogs and Sika deer to turn to other forms of commerce: brewing, raising chickens, digging fish ponds, with compensation available of up to \u00a323,000 per operation.</p> <p>Guanxing has been encouraged to go into mushroom farming. \u201cAfter the two old bamboo rat houses are cleaned and disinfected, they will become a three-dimensional mushroom farm,\u201d he told state-run financial newspaper Yicai, adding that once his mushrooms are planted and growing he\u2019ll be able to produce 50kg per day. Attempts to reach Guanxing directly were not successful.</p> <p>Yongcai is in a more difficult position as his farm wasn\u2019t officially part of a poverty alleviation programme, so it is uncertain whether he\u2019ll qualify for compensation or additional assistance to switch to another form of production.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard how the Heyuan government is helping breeders there to take up other business such as growing mushrooms and raising chickens, but that\u2019s just for the impoverished household breeders,\u201d Yongcai said. \u201cFor regular breeders, we\u2019re still on our own and awaiting a decision.\u201d</p> <p>What is unknown is what will happen once the government finally decides how to regulate the wildlife industry. Officials have discussed moving certain forms of wildlife that are not endangered or protected, nor known potential sources of zoonotic disease, to a list that would allow them to be bred under rules usually meant for poultry and livestock. No comprehensive list for those changes has been released.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a0f7e84165ffff4a489c44957c9d4e6ee9cf7f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a0f7e84165ffff4a489c44957c9d4e6ee9cf7f5/0_198_4029_2417/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Bamboo rats at a farm in Qinzhou, in south China\u2019s Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bamboo rats at a farm in Qinzhou, in south China\u2019s Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Theoretically, these rules from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs would provide for safer operations, with those continuing in the business required to have larger-scale operations and biosecurity measures to prevent disease transfer.</p> <p>Yet, as has been seen in the outbreaks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/african-swine-fever-destroying-small-pig-farms-as-factory-farming-booms-report\">African </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/african-swine-fever-destroying-small-pig-farms-as-factory-farming-booms-report\">swine </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/11/african-swine-fever-destroying-small-pig-farms-as-factory-farming-booms-report\">fever among China\u2019s pig farms </a>in recent years, which led to the deaths of millions of swine through the disease and culling, even those measures continue to fail to contain the spread of disease.</p> <p>\u201cI am optimistic that bamboo rats won\u2019t be included in the livestock and poultry list,\u201d Aili Kang, Asia director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, told the Guardian. \u201cCurrently, the law does not use very biological or ecological definitions.

Yet labour market experts such as Danny Blanchflower, a former Bank of England interest-rate setter, still predict that almost a third of Americans will end up jobless, worse even than in the early 1930s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45fbce8ec3c4205218383bb5e7c1cd5f479c478e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45fbce8ec3c4205218383bb5e7c1cd5f479c478e/0_150_3021_1813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women working in a British munitions factory during the second world war\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women working in a British munitions factory during the second world war.

In wartime, economies work flat out to provide the military hardware needed for victory. This time shops, restaurants, gyms, hotels, bars, coffee shops have all closed their doors because people have been instructed to stay at home. Big sporting events \u2013 Wimbledon, the Masters, the Olympics \u2013 have been called off. Forecasts of the looming drop in output have just got bigger and bigger.</p> <p>JP Morgan says Chinese GDP might have contracted by 40% in the first three months of 2020. Morgan Stanley pencils in a 30% drop in US output in the second quarter. The numbers are mindboggling, but in a way the pictures of Times Square in New York City and St Mark\u2019s Square in Venice tell the story better: normal life has ceased. It is like something out of a science fiction movie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"010a1fc419512d78f7e3454e490916ceb30ae071\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/010a1fc419512d78f7e3454e490916ceb30ae071/0_376_5644_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Times Square, one of the world landmarks that has emptied of traffic since the pandemic began\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Times Square, one of the world landmarks that has emptied of traffic since the pandemic began.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kena Betancur/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sense of unreality is heightened by the speed at which the crisis has unfolded.</p> <p>In mid-January the World Economic Forum, the body that organises the global elite\u2019s annual talking shop in Davos, released its annual global risks report \u2013 the collective wisdom of hundreds of experts about the possible threats that could lie ahead.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/15/climate-crisis-environment-top-five-places-world-economic-forum-risks-report\">top five concerns</a> over the next decade, the document suggested, were all environmental: the possibility of a global pandemic did not register, even though by late January, a few cases of Covid-19 were being reported in Europe.</p> <p>At Davos, Trump railed against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/21/trump-climate-1tn-trees-davos\">\u201cthe prophets of doom\u201d </a>\u2013 a line he also took in late January and early February when the financial markets finally woke up to the seriousness of Covid-19.

But Trump was not alone in being in denial about the threat. Until late January, the assumption in the financial markets had been that there was no need to panic because the current outbreak of coronavirus would turn out to be no more serious than previous health scares, such as Sars in the early 2000s.</p> <p>Mohammed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz, is one of the few to have spotted Covid-19 for what it was: a Black Swan \u2013 an event that comes as a surprise, has a dramatic impact and which, with the benefit of hindsight, was obvious.</p> <p>Wall Street had become conditioned to take every drop in share prices as a reason to pile into the market, safe in the knowledge that the Federal Reserve would ride to the rescue if things started to look rough. El-Erian said the markets would regret \u201cbuying on the dip\u201d this time and was proved 100% right. Shares have had their biggest quarterly falls since the financial crisis of 2008.</p> <p>As the 100th day of Covid-19 approaches, concerted action by central banks has quietened markets down a little and attention is now shifting to two questions: how big will the economic damage be; and how long will countries continue to be locked down?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61dea423d10863b1e7f33a804b2c8f768b76c638\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61dea423d10863b1e7f33a804b2c8f768b76c638/0_525_5206_3123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screen at a South Korean bank shows a now-familiar downward trend\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screen at a South Korean bank shows a now-familiar downward trend. Early on, some economists had dared to hope for a V-shaped rebound worldwide.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YONHAP/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the early stages of the market panic \u2013 from late February to early March \u2013 the assumption was that the pain would be intense but relatively short. Activity would plunge but then rebound just as quickly. This, though, presupposed that the lockdowns would be only temporary and that no real permanent damage would be done.</p> <p>Now the chances of a V-shaped recession look less likely. Even from the small amounts of data available it is obvious economies are in the middle of a collapse unprecedented in modern times.</p> <p>What is unclear now is how fast they will recover. China is coming out of lockdown, and some European countries such as Austria are planning to do the same, but restrictions remain in place and the mood of consumers remains cautious. Forecasters have started to talk about a steep downturn followed by a slow \u2013 and perhaps uneven \u2013 recovery.</p> <p>This looks much more plausible. Governments are going to be wary of the virus coming back. Consumers and businesses are going to take time to get over the shock. It will take some time before many people feel safe to travel abroad. There may be deeper changes too: more working from home, a further blow to high-street retailers. As yet little attention has been paid to how all the extra government spending will be paid for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aware of the mounting costs, governments are desperate to get their countries back to work.

But even in the US, it is clear it will take time for life to return to normal.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-new-york-dr-anthony-fauci\">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, puts it: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be realistic, and you\u2019ve got to understand that you don\u2019t make the timeline, the virus makes the timeline.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that all but a handful of the organisation\u2019s 189 member states will suffer falling standards of living this year as a result of the worst global economic crisis since the 1930s.</p> <p>Kristalina Georgieva said the sudden onset of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 </a>pandemic meant the IMF\u2019s new forecasts for the world economy were going to be grim when released next week \u2013 and there was a risk that the impact could be even worse than currently expected. She said more than 170 countries will suffer a reversal of living standards in 2020. </p> <p>\u201cToday we are confronted with a crisis like no other,\u201d Georgieva said in a speech designed to set the scene for next week\u2019s spring meeting of the IMF, being held virtually this year as a result of the pandemic.</p> <p>Just three months ago, the IMF was predicting that the global economy would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/20/imf-us-sanctions-threat-will-limit-global-economic-recovery\">grow by 3.3% this year</a>, but Georgieva said: \u201cCovid-19 has disrupted our social and economic order at lightning speed and on a scale that we have not seen in living memory. The virus is causing tragic loss of life, and the lockdown needed to fight it has affected billions of people.\u201d</p> <p>The IMF managing director said there was still \u201cextraordinary uncertainty\u201d about the depth and duration of a crisis that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan in January. She added that it was already clear that global growth would turn sharply negative in 2020. \u201cIn fact, we anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/100-days-zip/giv-3902hE8tHiTx2wNj/\" data-alt=\"Covid-19\u2019s stark impact on the global economy is laid bare.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/100-days-zip/giv-3902hE8tHiTx2wNj/\">Covid-19\u2019s stark impact on the global economy is laid bare.</a> <figcaption>Covid-19\u2019s stark impact on the global economy is laid bare by the statistics.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cJust three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020. Today, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.\u201d</p> <p>Georgieva said the crisis knew no geographic boundaries and the \u201cbleak outlook\u201d applied to advanced and developing economies alike. \u201cEverybody hurts. Given the necessary containment measures to slow the spread of the virus, the world economy is taking a substantial hit.\u201d</p> <p>She added, however, that the pandemic was likely to hit vulnerable countries hardest, adding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/dozens-poorer-nations-seek-imf-help-coronavirus-crisis\">more than 90 nations </a>had now sought help from the IMF in recent weeks following a fall in demand, more expensive borrowing and a drop in commodity prices.</p> <p>Capital flight from emerging market economies \u2013 seen as risky by investors during crises \u2013 had amounted to about $100bn (\u00a380bn) in the last two months \u2013 more than three times the outflows seen during the financial crisis of 2008.</p> <p>Georgieva stressed the need for next week\u2019s spring meeting to offer debt relief and to agree an increase in the IMF\u2019s financial firepower so it could help more poor countries through the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cEmerging markets and low-income nations \u2013 across Africa, Latin America, and much of Asia \u2013 are at high risk. With weaker health systems to begin with, many face the dreadful challenge of fighting the virus in densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums\u2014where social distancing is hardly an option.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the desire of governments to end the lockdown of their economies as quickly as possible, Georgieva said there was no trade-off between saving lives and saving livelihoods. Containment and the strengthening of health systems remained the first of the IMF\u2019s four priorities.</p> <p>In addition, Georgieva said, governments needed to shield affected people and firms with large, timely, targeted fiscal and financial sector measures; reduce stress to the financial system and avoid contagion; and plan for recovery.</p> <p>The IMF boss said it was encouraging that governments had moved so quickly and that there had been significant co-ordination. Governments had agreed fiscal \u2013 tax and spending \u2013 measures amounting to $8tn, in addition to the massive stimulus provided by central banks.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no question that 2020 will be exceptionally difficult. If the pandemic fades in the second half of the year \u2013 thus allowing a gradual lifting of containment measures and reopening of the economy \u2013 our baseline assumption is for a partial recovery in 2021. But again, I stress there is tremendous uncertainty around the outlook: it could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Saudi Arabia has started a two-week unilateral ceasefire in Yemen, in a move designed to show its awareness of the threat the coronavirus poses to a war-torn country with only rudimentary health services.</p> <p>So far no Covid-19 cases have been reported in the country. However, Saudi Arabia, with which Yemen shares a border, has suffered more than 40 deaths and is projecting many more. Yemen has closed its borders.</p> <p>The Saudi move has been welcomed by aid agencies and the UN special envoy, Martin Griffiths. A key test now will be whether it can be sustained, with a Houthi spokesman alleging hours after its announcement that air strikes had continued to pound targets in Yemen.</p> <p>\u201cThe aggression didn\u2019t stop ... and until this moment there are tens of continuous air strikes,\u201d Houthi spokesman Mohamed Abdelsalam told Al Jazeera news network some five hours after the truce began.</p> <p>\u201cWe consider the ceasefire a political and media manoeuver\u201d to bolster the image of the coalition in this critical moment when the world is facing the coronavirus pandemic, he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-threat-prompts-un-to-redouble-efforts-to-end-long-term-wars\">Coronavirus: UN says warring countries have responded to ceasefire call</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A previous ceasefire a fortnight ago collapsed within days. Fighting has been especially intense in Al Jawf governorate in the north, where the Yemen government, backed by Saudi Arabia, has been trying to reverse recent Houthi gains. The Houthis were still firing ballistic missiles in the Marib in Wednesday after the Saudis announced the ceasefire and, as with many ceasefires, will be wary of letting Saudi Arabia use the ceasefire to regroup.</p> <p>Yemen\u2019s recent history has been peppered with failed ceasefires, although a Houthi ceasefire in September last year did lead to some political progress.</p> <p>Griffiths has made intense behind-the-scenes efforts to urge the Houthi rebel forces holding the capital, Sana\u2019a, the western port city of Hodeida and large parts of the north not to exploit the Saudi move. A rival Houthi offer of a ceasefire is highly conditional, and appears to apply only to Saudi Arabia, and not the Yemen government.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, suffering politically from its five-year intervention in Yemen, will face accusations of a PR stunt by its critics. But the Saudi deputy defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman, insisted the move was sincere and called on the rebels to \u201cshow goodwill\u201d by seriously engaging in dialogue.</p> <p>\u201cThe two-week ceasefire will hopefully create a more effective climate to deescalate tensions, work with [Griffiths] towards a sustainable political settlement,\u201d Khalid said on Twitter.</p> <p>He added that Saudi Arabia \u201cwill contribute $500m to the UN humanitarian relief program for Yemen in 2020, and an additional $25m to help combat the pandemic. It is up to Houthis to put the health and safety of the Yemeni people above all else.\u201d</p> <p>The ceasefire started at 10am BST on Thursday and is open to extension, the Saudis said.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia says the ceasefire applies to all its ground, maritime and air operations, and is in support of calls from the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, for a worldwide ceasefire due to the coronavirus outbreak. The United Arab Emirates foreign minister, Anwar Gargash, said the Saudi offer needed to be built upon urgently.</p> <p>Griffiths said \u201cI am grateful to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Arab coalition for recognising and acting on this critical moment for Yemen. The parties must now utilise this opportunity and cease immediately all hostilities with the utmost urgency, and make progress towards comprehensive and sustainable peace.\u201d</p> <p>The special envoy\u2019s statement added that he hoped and expected that the coalition\u2019s ceasefire announcement would create a conducive environment for the parties to conclude these agreements \u201cin the very near future\u201d.<br><br>Muhsin Siddiquey, Oxfam\u2019s Yemen country director, said: \u201cThe announcement from the Saudi-led coalition that it will be laying down arms is a welcome move that offers Yemen a chance to avert a fresh disaster.</p> <p>\u201cOver five years of war have left Yemenis with little defence against the coronavirus, as the country\u2019s health system has been destroyed and families lack the resources like clean water, sanitation, proper nutrition they need to protect themselves.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of the coronavirus on people already pushed to the brink would be devastating. Yemenis desperately need to be able to focus on the basics of keeping their families healthy \u2013 not dodging bombs and ground fighting.\u201d</p> <p>Xavier Joubert, the country director for Save the Children in Yemen, said: \u201cA ceasefire would be a huge step towards finally bringing safety to millions of children and families in Yemen after five years of brutal conflict. But attempts to de-escalate two weeks ago failed when violence escalated almost immediately, killing and injuring scores of civilians \u2013 including children.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Smith of the British Campaign Against Arms Trade said: \u201cIt should not have taken a global pandemic to force Saudi forces into calling for a ceasefire, but this announcement should definitely be welcomed. If it is to succeed then it will take a far greater level of political will than we have seen to date from the regime.\u201d</p>",

Emergency powers have been enacted allowing the minister to exempt ventilators from parts of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 which ensure conformance with safety and performance requirements. <br><br>Such exemptions can be made only by the minister \u201cso that the devices can be made available urgently in Australia in order to deal with an actual threat to public health caused by an emergency\u201d. A description of the new powers says:</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe effect of the instrument is to exempt these ventilators from certain requirements under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 in order to deal with the threat to public health caused by the Covid-19 emergency.\u201d<br><br>The new powers were registered on Wednesday and will cease on 31 January 2021. You can read the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020N00046\">full detail on those exemption powers</a> here.<br><br>The powers appear designed to allow new suppliers of ventilators to get them into Australian hospitals as quickly as possible to deal with the Covid-19 crisis. </p> \n  <p>Ventilators are critical in the fight against the virus because they aid the failing lungs of the most seriously ill patients. Australia had about 2,300 ventilators in intensive care units across the country before the crisis, but the government is seeking to dramatically increase that number as it surges ICU capacity. <br><br>Only one company in Australia, Resmed, manufactures ventilators and it has been working overtime to increase its output. The government has also been attempting to procure more ventilators from abroad and kickstart new domestic manufacturers by securing existing designs used by foreign companies. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:31:53.150Z\">at 3.31am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8e87638f08008f0919fae4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:24:55.987Z\">3.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I was curious how the government could just declare that pay rises will be deferred in the public service, because most employees would be covered by enterprise agreements, with pay increases agreed, scheduled and seemingly locked in.<br>Assistant minister to the prime minister and cabinet, <strong>Ben Morton</strong>, explained it will be done through a determination using s.24(3) of the Public Service Act. <br></p> \n  <p>That section says:<em>\u201dThe Public Service Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine the terms and conditions of employment applying to APS employees, <strong>if the Public Service Minister is of the opinion that it is desirable to do so because of exceptional circumstances</strong>.\u201d</em><br></p> \n  <p>Professor <strong>Anthony Forsyth </strong>told Guardian Australia the Act \u201cdoes appear to allow\u201d a determination to overrule enterprise agreements although it \u201cdepends on the meaning of exceptional circumstances\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201c[But the] opinion that it is desirable to do so is not the same as necessary,\u201d Forsyth said.<br></p> \n  <p>He also noted that according to the Act section 42 of the Legislation Act - on disallowance - does not apply - meaning that one of the \u201cordinary processes of parliamentary scrutiny ... looks like [it] doesn\u2019t apply\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>The Community and Public Sector Union is upset about the move, but agrees with the conclusion that it is legal.<br></p> \n  <p>So there you have it - one of the quirks of working in the public service, maybe better job security than the private sector but employment conditions altered at the stroke of a pen.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8e859b8f08008f0919fada\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:17:14.025Z\">3.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">National park visits over Easter are out</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A reminder that national parks are closed \u2013 which includes to Easter visitors.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:29:48.944Z\">at 3.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8e84e08f08008f0919fad3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:15:40.958Z\">3.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Academy of Science is continuing its great series, where scientists and researchers answer your questions.</p> \n  <p>They get it fact-checked too, so you don\u2019t have to worry about the Malcolm Roberts of the world delivering your information.</p> \n  <p>The latest is on whether or not childcare centres are safe.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/405238449\"> \n   <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/405238449?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n   <figcaption>\n    Australian Academy of Science\n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:18:46.585Z\">at 3.18am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8e838c8f08ec70ceced461\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:13:01.295Z\">3.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The national cabinet is about to meet.

  "<p>Realism in rugby has gone viral in the last month. English club owners from Bristol\u2019s Steve Lansdown to London Irish\u2019s Mick Crossan and unions from England to Australia all agree the suspension of the game as countries look to slow the spread of coronavirus has presented an opportunity to reset the professional game.</p> <p>\u201cClub rugby has to change,\u201d Crossan said. \u201cLast season cost me \u00a34m and I can\u2019t afford that. It\u2019s definitely not a sustainable business. We cannot keep relying on rich benefactors. This crisis may actually help club rugby if everyone cuts their cloth to suit their pockets and it brings back common sense.\u201d</p> <p>The lockdown has exposed the sport\u2019s parlous financial position, union and club, with increases in turnover tending to be spent on wages so they are no better off. Worcester\u2019s last financial accounts showed a turnover of \u00a312.1m that was eclipsed by a wage bill of \u00a312.8m. No wonder the club was sold for \u00a31.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/07/premiership-set-for-extended-break-before-resuming-behind-closed-doors\">Premiership set for extended break with contingency plans to finish season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe do not want to come back in and carry on with the same model that repeats the errors of the past,\u201d said the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney. \u201cWhen you have a crisis of this scale, and I do not think anyone predicted this magnitude, it highlights where there are fault lines. Some are being exposed now.\u201d</p> <p>The game in Europe went into the professional era 25 years ago sleepwalking but the south was more alert. Wealthy entrepreneurs in England and France saw an opportunity and took over clubs, quickly finding themselves on a collision course with their unions when there was not even a distant prospect of turning a profit. All that has changed since are running costs owing to an explosion in wages.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all acutely aware that from present adversity new opportunity could, and very much should, be born,\u201d said the Welsh Rugby Union chairman, Gareth Davies. \u201cStreamlining our playing calendar and balancing up the need for revenue generation have long been issues facing our sport.</p> <p>\u201cWe need each other more than ever to resolve this conundrum and all rugby playing nations should now realise the extent to which we are interdependent. The end result should be a truly global international calendar. Unity is not only the key to survival but long-term prosperity.\u201d</p> <p>Premiership Rugby this week repeated its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/07/premiership-set-for-extended-break-before-resuming-behind-closed-doors\">desire to complete the season</a> and fulfil commercial contracts but it will be a long time before normal life resumes. Even if the restrictions on large gatherings were relaxed sooner rather than later, would there be a demand for big-capacity sporting events amid fears of a renewed outbreak of Covid-19? Social distancing will take on a voluntary nature and there appears to be more chance of next season being affected than a resumption any time soon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"468f063c2293813218765e444586cda07e83efd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/468f063c2293813218765e444586cda07e83efd4/79_0_3389_2033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernard Laporte has floated the idea of a global club rugby championship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernard Laporte has floated the idea of a global club rugby championship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The financial squeeze will become greater and when rugby is played again Test matches will have priority because they are the sport\u2019s commercial driver. The south faces losing its incoming tours: if that happened, Europe\u2019s autumn schedule would need to be revamped and revenue shared, a subject the north has consistently refused to address.</p> <p>As Davies said, all the unions are in it together and they have an opportunity to assert their authority together, as they should have done in 1995. This week the French Rugby Federation president, Bernard Laporte, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/club-world-cup-to-be-put-forward-as-radical-new-rugby-union-competition\">floated the idea of a world club championship</a>, a more exclusive version of the Champions Cup.</p> <p>It was not something he had suddenly dreamed up. Laporte is running on a ticket with the World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, who is up for re-election next month. Laporte is bidding to become his deputy and the governing body\u2019s plan for a nations league, which was scuppered by some of the Six Nations last year, still has legs.</p> <p>The planned divisions below the Rugby Championship and the Six Nations are being organised, providing a pathway for second- and third-tier nations. The European unions are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/02/six-nations-not-ruling-out-300m-paywall\">in talks with the private equity company CVC </a>about taking a 15% stake in their business in return for \u00a3300m.</p> <p>There will be a temptation, with all the unions predicting substantial losses this year, to snatch the \u00a350m+ each would receive but how far would it go after debts had been absorbed? The Premiership clubs last year received \u00a312.5m each after selling a 27% stake to CVC, which means they will each receive around \u00a31.5m less from central funds each year at a time when enhanced television and sponsorship deals will be tough to negotiate.</p> <p>The nations league promised a substantial increase in turnover for unions with all the money raised going to the game and none to speculators whose concern was the bottom line. Put together with Laporte\u2019s proposal, it would allow all the tier one unions to contract their leading players, relieving some of the financial burden on clubs in France and England.</p> <p>The clubs would resist the move. Owners have put a significant amount into the domestic game with a consequent rise in playing standards and facilities but wage inflation means the business as a whole is losing some \u00a350m a year, a figure that will rise. The \u00a37m salary cap will be reviewed after the start of the season but it will need to come down rather than go up.</p> <p>The playing calendar in Europe is a compromised mish-mash, a product of the drive for cash, which serves neither club nor country well. It cannot survive the current crisis and unions will never have a better opportunity to force change. The game needs them to seize the moment.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Patients aged 70 and older are far more susceptible to Covid-19, and many worry that will put the elderly at a disadvantage to receive life-saving care. But ethicists say that\u2019s not the reality. They said older people could be lower priority for ventilators, but because of a higher likelihood of underlying health conditions, not age.</p> <p>\u201cI hope the public will recognize these triage plans are being developed by heartbroken health professions, for whom there\u2019s going to be tremendous suffering and [post-traumatic stress disorder],\u201d said Solomon.</p> <p>While \u201csurvivability\u201d has emerged as the most widely accepted metric for hospital ethics boards, it is not without critics. Such triage has been described as<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689\"> \u201cdeath panels\u201d</a>, and some argue care should be on a \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d basis. Others have argued that underlying health conditions of demographic groups in the United States will lead to disparate treatment in critical situations.</p> <p>Critics argue metrics of survivability will prioritize the healthy, and \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d would be fairer. However, many ethicists believe this model is the \u201cmost corruptible\u201d, and will inevitably disadvantage people with less baseline access to healthcare. \u201cPeople who aren\u2019t in the know or don\u2019t have transportation are unlikely to be first in line,\u201d said Solomon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ethicists said they have been excluded from higher-level decision making during this \u201cextraordinary\u201d time. When Donald Trump took office, his administration declined to impanel a national committee on bioethics, breaking a generations-long tradition beginning with President Gerald Ford in 1974.</p> <p>\u201cI believe completely that having a panel of experienced bioethicists at the disposal of the president, as President Obama, would have been helpful to the Trump administration,\u201d said Anita Allen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Carey law school, who also served on President Obama\u2019s bioethics commission. For upheaval similar to that caused by Covid-19, she said, Americans would have to look back to the second world war.</p> <p>Boyd went further: \u201cThe response from the federal level has been appalling across every single front.\u201d</p> <p>In the absence of a federal panel, which would have probably begun considering issues of scarcity as early as January, bioethicists have been left to coordinate with states, hospitals and even individual agencies on how to allocate scarce medical resources. More than 1,400 leading bioethicists urged the Trump administration to tackle this issue in mid-March, but the administration only began to heed such advice last week.</p> <p>Amid the piecemeal guidance, workers at all levels of the country\u2019s healthcare system are scrambling to stretch their resources on the ground. At the center of the outbreak in New York and New Jersey, hospitals have converted anesthesia and \u201cBiPap\u201d machines (often used by sufferers of sleep apnea) into ventilators.</p> <p>Physicians at hospitals in New York City said that they haven\u2019t yet been provided any specific new guidelines for how to triage or care for new patients. A doctor at Elmhurst hospital, the center of New York\u2019s coronavirus cases, said he has multiple conversations with patients and their families every day about whether or not they should go to the ICU or be put on a ventilator.</p> <p>Pressure on local hospitals extends past the doors of the emergency rooms. EMT workers in cities such as Paterson, New Jersey, to<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/health/coronavirus-emt-workers.html\"> avoid bringing people to the hospital</a>. There, emergency medical technicians from the local fire department determine whether patients are in such severe respiratory distress that they should come to the emergency room.</p> <p>With the entire health system stretched to its maximum, a patient\u2019s life during the pandemic will depend not just on triage teams at hospitals, but on every health worker in their journey along the way.</p> <p>\u201cNow, we have ethics decisions at the bedside, or by the ambulance driver, or the ICU doctor in terms of when is it time to stop,\u201d said Arthur Caplan, the founding head of medical ethics at New York University\u2019s school of medicine in New York City.</p> <p>\u201cFamilies are going to be seeing a loved one die \u2013 not necessarily from Covid \u2013 that normally they would not,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Billions of dollars worth of food is going to waste as growers and producers from California to Florida are facing a massive surplus of highly perishable items.</p> <p>As US food banks handle record demand and grocery stores struggle to keep shelves stocked, farmers are dumping fresh milk and plowing vegetables back into the dirt as the shutdown of the food service industry has scrambled the supply chain. Roughly half the food grown in the US was previously destined for restaurants, schools, stadiums, theme parks and cruise ships.</p> <p>The impact could be up to $1.32bn from March to May in farm losses alone, according to a National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition report.</p> <p>Agriculture officials insist that the supply itself is not in question, but matching that supply with demand and getting it to where it\u2019s needed most is a new and urgent problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab28a66459b3e44c2d1b8d2334e9c8d806989d2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab28a66459b3e44c2d1b8d2334e9c8d806989d2d/0_159_4620_2772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pile of ripe squash sits in a field in Homestead, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pile of ripe squash sits in a field in Homestead, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Sladky/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018A disconnect\u2019 in the food chain</h2> <p>This time last year, half of Paul Allen\u2019s green bean and cabbage crops at RC Hatton farms in Pahokee, Florida, would have been destined for food service. Now he\u2019s plowing 5m to 6m pounds of vegetables back into his fields.</p> <p>\u201cRetail cannot absorb it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever else you\u2019ve got just goes unharvested and you\u2019ve got to mulch it back into the ground.\u201d</p> <p>Allen is far from alone. He laments the circumstances his tomato-growing friends find themselves in, with 80% or more of their crops previously bound for food service. \u201cEverybody\u2019s in the same situation.\u201d</p> <p>South Florida is a major producer of vegetables for US consumers, especially in the winter and early spring. Now, for many farmers, the cost to pick and pack that produce is higher than the market price.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all combined to just be a disastrous situation for south Florida growers, who actually had a bumper crop coming into the harvest season,\u201d said Lisa Lochridge, director of public affairs for the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association.</p> <p>\u201cThis is really having a disproportionate effect on warm-weather states and smaller farms,\u201d said Kara Heckert, California regional director for the American Farmland Trust. \u201cIt was kind of an overnight shift to at least a significant portion of the food system.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"480be2902757b9d0891ef39f01306a2c0417a0bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/480be2902757b9d0891ef39f01306a2c0417a0bc/0_170_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fruit and vegetable stand, normally open in spring, sits shuttered in the Salinas Valley, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fruit and vegetable stand, normally open in spring, sits shuttered in the Salinas Valley, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strawberries on the California coast and lettuce in the Salinas Valley \u201csalad bowl\u201d \u2013 which grows roughly 70% of the nation\u2019s lettuce crop \u2013 have been hit particularly hard. And efforts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/us-coronavirus-outbreak-california-farm-workers\">keep farmworkers safe</a> and socially distanced in the fields mean even slower harvesting.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot being left on the field, and a lot is being tilled underground,\u201d said Heckert. More still is sitting in storage facilities.</p> <p>Dairy producers in Wisconsin, Vermont and other states have taken to dumping excess milk en masse, flooding their fields or pouring it down drains in production facilities. The loss of food service business, particularly schools systems that are large buyers of dairy products, has left producers with a highly perishable glut that they can\u2019t easily resolve.</p> <p>Preparing and packaging food for retail as opposed to wholesale, and getting it packed and shipped on trucks, is an entirely new and expensive problem. And spring is an especially productive season for dairy cows, leading to even more supply in a time with even less demand. Over the last six weeks, US dairy futures prices have nosedived.</p> <p>Still, said Heckert, there\u2019s confusion over where the pipeline is facing the most stress. \u201cA lot of the grocery stores are limiting how much milk people can buy, thinking it\u2019s going to run out. There\u2019s a disconnect there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2be7bb8d273054928703e5982ac2da8ffefe9ad9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be7bb8d273054928703e5982ac2da8ffefe9ad9/0_183_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan and Chris Eble stand by while fresh milk gushes down a drain at the family\u2019s Golden E Dairy farm near West Bend, Wisconsin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan and Chris Eble stand by while fresh milk gushes down a drain at the family\u2019s Golden E Dairy farm near West Bend, Wisconsin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Usa Today Uspw/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Farmers filling the gaps </h2> <p>For farmers with direct-to-consumer produce box services, the chaos has been a boon. In the northern San Francisco Bay area, every farm delivery program is full, some with waiting lists in the hundreds.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re using this as an opportunity to encourage collaboration and farmers working together to try to fill the gaps in this disruption,\u201d said Evan Wiig, membership director at the Community Alliance with Family Farmers, which is working to pair farms that previously sold direct to schools and restaurants with already established delivery logistics.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a mad rush to figure out supply and demand and who needs what, who has what,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is usually something that you do carefully over the course of an entire year. And here we are trying to do it in a matter of a week in order to prevent the closure of the farms, and also a lot of food waste.\u201d</p> <p>Before the coronavirus, nearly all of Brothers Produce business was food service and school delivery. In March, Brent Erenwert, CEO of the Houston, Texas, food distributor, created an entirely new model to keep his employees in business and his company afloat: selling produce boxes with fruits, vegetables, eggs and milk through co-ops in the region, and direct to customers online.</p> <p>\u201cSome consumers don\u2019t feel safe going to the grocery store, unfortunately, because of too many people being there. I know how to get that product safely to a consumer\u2019s hand,\u201d said Erenwert. \u201cThe biggest thing was to keep my employees\u2019 jobs and keep the supply chain moving \u2013 because if people see the supply chain stop, they go into even more of a panic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6f86d8cfe385f16f2c4b912df3d1b08ce757cf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6f86d8cfe385f16f2c4b912df3d1b08ce757cf1/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casondra Myers and Ellen Henslee pack produce delivery boxes at Front 9 Farm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casondra Myers and Ellen Henslee pack produce delivery boxes at Front 9 Farm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dane Rhys/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But that supply chain is missing a crucial link, bridging the gap between food that would be wasted and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/us-food-banks-coronavirus-demand-unemployment\">growing need in food banks</a> nationwide.</p> <p>Many growers already reeling from huge losses in sales aren\u2019t able to further eat the cost of harvesting, packing and transporting crops to needy food banks without any financial aid. Florida growers have asked the US Department of Agriculture to buy the surplus produce so it could be donated to people in need without further hurting farm finances. The California department of food and agriculture is partnering with the California Association of Food Banks to provide funding and resources for farm donations to feeding programs across the state.</p> <p>Still,<strong> </strong>there\u2019s only so much that food banks can take.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really weird right now in the supply chain is the grocery stores seem to be pretty heavy on product, farmers are throwing away stuff, and food banks are full. We don\u2019t know where the demand lies,\u201d said Erenwert.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working with the state to try to get it to charities. But quite frankly, a lot of those avenues are full,\u201d said Paul Allen, a Florida vegetable grower. \u201cThey can\u2019t absorb it all, no way.\u201d</p> <p>Food banks aren\u2019t set up to be warehouses for such vast quantities of stranded and highly perishable food.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"681ba7b4d8235e344cfe3ad874a6796e9b38a0c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/681ba7b4d8235e344cfe3ad874a6796e9b38a0c0/0_64_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the California national guard help pack boxes of fruits and vegetables at Second Harvest food bank in San Jose, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the California national guard help pack boxes of fruits and vegetables at Second Harvest food bank in San Jose, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEverything under the sun produce-wise is showing up. We\u2019re getting the cream of the crop,\u201d said Brian Greene, CEO of Houston Food Bank. \u201cWe have a potential bonanza \u2013 now we\u2019re working on the ability to capitalize on it. All the food banks have to solve this puzzle. What are the partnerships we set up so we can utilize this? Because we\u2019re not going to get the other things.\u201d</p> <p>With shelf-stable staple goods selling out at markets nationwide, food banks are finding it difficult to secure surplus dry and frozen goods. This influx of produce could help shore up a dip in donations, but it requires more workers and volunteers to sort and package the food when charities are in short supply of helping hands. There\u2019s no doubt, said Greene, that much of this food will unfortunately still go to waste.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is what makes the food chain work normally is there are just tens of thousands of arrangements that have been developed over time in order to match supply and demand. Then you just suddenly break all that and you\u2019re trying to, with voluntary relationships, piece something together in a very short timeframe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of failure.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>You will already be regularly washing your hands and social distancing, but many of us are still likely to become infected with coronavirus. Doing what you can now to improve your health and boost your immune system will help your body cope. Thankfully, the majority of cases are mild and you should recover within a week, though if your symptoms are persistent it is vital to seek medical advice from NHS 111 rather than try to continue to manage at home. With that in mind, here\u2019s what you can do to put yourself in the best position to help your recovery.<br></p> \n<h2><strong>Protect your lungs</strong></h2> \n<p>Tom Wingfield, a physician and clinical lecturer in infectious diseases at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, says you should avoid anything that damages your lungs \u2013 stop smoking, and don\u2019t expose others to secondhand smoke. \u201cOpen fires are not great, and if you have allergies that irritate your lungs, avoid what you can.\u201d One upside of the lockdown is that air pollution has decreased. And, says Wingfield, \u201c[general aerobic] exercise will help your lungs\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>Boost your immune system</strong></h2> \n<p>There is no magic supplement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/08/how-to-boost-your-immune-system-to-avoid-colds-and-coronavirus\">The advice is </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/08/how-to-boost-your-immune-system-to-avoid-colds-and-coronavirus\">as it\u2019s always been</a>: reduce your alcohol consumption, exercise, sleep well and reduce stress. A varied, balanced diet, with lots of vegetables and fruit, is important, but there is little evidence for most vitamin and mineral supplements. </p> \n<p>Getting out in the sun each day can also be beneficial, says the GP Amir Khan. \u201cThe majority of people have low vitamin D because we don\u2019t have enough sunlight in the UK, and we are coming out of winter. Vitamin D levels will be depleted, so there\u2019s no harm in taking a vitamin D tablet.\u201d<br></p> \n<h2><strong>Rest as soon as you start to notice symptoms</strong></h2> \n<p>Many people who are suspected of having had the virus report at least one day of fatigue. Now is not the time to try to tough things out. \u201cYour body is using all its energy to fight a virus that is infecting cell after cell,\u201d says Khan. \u201cEven with mild symptoms, you\u2019ll have some days when you feel fine and other days when you are tired and achey. You can potter around the house and make food if you need to, but you shouldn\u2019t be doing any more than that and, where possible, you should be on the sofa or in bed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Once you develop a fever, he says, \u201cyour body is starting to use energy to raise your core body temperature to make it an unfavourable environment for the virus to reproduce.<strong> </strong>You shouldn\u2019t wait until you feel tired [to rest], because by then you\u2019ve expended too much energy already.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Keep drinking fluids</strong></h2> \n<p>Khan says: \u201cEverybody should be sticking to two to three litres of fluid a day\u201d \u2013 as normal. When you have a fever, says Saira Ghafur, an honorary respiratory consultant at St Mary\u2019s hospital in London, \u201cyou can become dehydrated, so you need to make sure that even if you don\u2019t feel like it, you\u2019re drinking as much as possible. If you feel you\u2019re not peeing very much, that\u2019s another sign you\u2019re very dehydrated and should seek medical advice.\u201d<br></p> \n<h2><strong>How to manage a fever</strong></h2> \n<p>Take paracetamol, rather than ibuprofen.<strong> </strong>There has been concern that ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/health-experts-criticise-nhs-advice-to-take-ibuprofen-for-covid-19\">could reduce immune function and make coronavirus symptoms worse</a>, but there is not enough evidence to confirm this. Still, the advice is to take paracetamol for fever and muscle pain instead. \u201cIf you have been prescribed ibuprofen and develop symptoms of Covid-19 then discuss that with your medical practitioner,\u201d says Wingfield.<br></p> \n<h2><strong>Definitely don\u2019t rely on supplements or \u2018miracle\u2019 cures</strong></h2> \n<p>Khan has seen advice online about taking vitamin C to treat coronavirus \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be trying this at home. \u201cIt has been used intravenously in very, very high doses in hospitals in China. That\u2019s a big difference to what you get in a tablet. The jury is still very much out in terms of using intravenous vitamin C for coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Taking a vitamin C tablet from the chemist or supermarket \u201cwon\u2019t stop you getting an infection and it won\u2019t help treat the infection\u201d, says Khan. And certainly don\u2019t try to take very high doses.</p> \n<p>Don\u2019t pin your hopes on \u201csuperfoods\u201d or the <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/ap/2020/04/03/eating-alkaline-foods-will-not-kill-the-coronavirus/\">social media posts about \u201calkaline\u201d foods</a> (a virus doesn\u2019t have a pH level, and you can\u2019t change the body\u2019s pH level through diet). What about garlic? \u201cIt may help reduce the length of things like a cold, but won\u2019t prevent it,\u201d says Khan. And there\u2019s no evidence it has any effect on coronavirus.</p> \n<h2><strong>Can breathing exercises </strong><strong> help?</strong></h2> \n<p>It\u2019s far from clear. On Monday, the author JK Rowling <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/07/doctor-reveals-breathing-technique-helped-jk-rowling-recover-coronavirus-12519409/\">shared a video of Sar</a><a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/07/doctor-reveals-breathing-technique-helped-jk-rowling-recover-coronavirus-12519409/\">faraz Munshi, the head of urgent care at Queen\u2019s hospital in Romford,</a> London, demonstrating breathing techniques that he said could relieve symptoms and prevent someone developing a secondary pneumonia infection. People with asthma and those recovering from pneumonia are often helped by respiratory physiotherapists, says Wingfield, \u201cwho can help support your breathing with exercises. The main thing you are trying to do is make patients\u2019 lungs open as much as they can and try and get rid of some of the fluid and inflammatory material.\u201d</p> \n<p>Coronavirus, says Khan, \u201ccauses inflammation around the alveoli, the air sacs at the peripheries of the lungs, and it can damage them. It reduces your lung capacity. If you are safely managing your condition at home [on advice from a doctor or the NHS 111 service], then breathing exercises might help.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"da6e7b30-c83b-43bf-8d5e-772e3e686b5a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/suTKhpuZPww?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re really doing there is forcing air into the alveoli by taking big breaths in and holding the alveoli open, and that will help clear any excess mucus, pathogens, as well as stop them from becoming hardened, which can happen. This is with the caveat that you are safe to stay at home and you don\u2019t need to be in hospital. If there\u2019s any chance of pneumonia, you should be in hospital.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Laura Breach, a spokeswoman for the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care (ACPRC), says while the exercises should be harmless for healthy individuals, she would not advise them, adding that they could make symptoms worse in someone suffering breathlessness. Although Munshi\u2019s video was well-intentioned, the ACPRC says the techniques are not correct (it is preparing its own video). If you did try the exercise, you only need to take three or four breaths so as not to hyperventilate and become dizzy, and if you have coronavirus symptoms, there is no need to make yourself cough as part of the exercise. \u201cWe would always encourage nose-breathing rather than mouth-breathing, because your nose is really important in humidifying the air that you breathe in and catching any particles in the air,\u201d says Breach.</p> \n<p>There is no evidence these exercises will help healthy people prepare for the illness, she says. \u201cThere are patients with longer-term respiratory conditions and we do teach them techniques to give them a better starting point. If it\u2019s something you should be doing then your healthcare professional will have already advised that.\u201d Instead, the ACPRC says: \u201cPropping yourself up with pillows, or leaning forward onto the back of a chair\u201d can be beneficial to breathlessness.</p> \n<p>Wingfield also questions whether the exercises can aid recovery from coronavirus \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a slightly evidence-free zone\u201d \u2013 and says if you are having trouble breathing, you should seek medical help rather than simply try to follow breathing exercises at home. \u201cBut they can keep your lungs moving, and some people might find these exercises meditative and stress-relieving,\u201d says Wingfield. Ghafur agrees: \u201cNone of this is evidence-based.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>But try lying on your front</strong></h2> \n<p>One of the big things in intensive care that we\u2019re seeing with a lot of patients,\u2019 says Ghafur, \u201cis you have to put them on a ventilator in what we call a prone position, which basically means you\u2019re lying on your front. It\u2019s not in any recommended guidance for patients who are not in intensive care, but if you\u2019re able to lie on your front for a while that can help breathing.\u201d There\u2019s no harm in trying it, she says, but only if you\u2019re generally fit and healthy. Do not try to lie on your front if you are older, infirm, have mobility problems or are pregnant.</p> \n<p>Lying continuously on your back is not ideal. \u201cIf you can sit and take deep breaths in and out, that will help any respiratory condition \u2013 you\u2019re taking in a bigger lungful of air and that will help remove any mucus.\u201d However, she adds that there is no evidence that this will improve your recovery.</p>",
  "<p>A US firm has said it is on track to provide the UK with 100,000 coronavirus tests per day by the end of the month, giving renewed hope that the government could hit its target.</p> \n<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">said last week </a>he wanted to increase testing to 100,000 a day by the end of April. On Wednesday 19,500 were tested, up from 10,200 on that day the previous week.</p> \n<p>Mark Stevenson, the chief operating officer at Thermo Fisher Scientific, based in Waltham, Massachusetts, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the target was possible. \u201cWe began mobilising actually straight away after we learned about the Covid-19 outbreak and we designed the kit to identify the virus\u2019s unique genetic code,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThen we worked in a way to test that, validate that in patients. And then we began to scale up our manufacturing to meet demand. We agreed with the UK that we would supply to meet their demand of more than 100,000 tests per day.\u201d</p> \n<p>The company will initially produce antigen tests, which determine whether someone currently has the virus, rather than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/08/blood-sample-shortage-holding-up-uk-work-on-antibody-tests\">antibody tests</a> that reveal if someone has previously had it and may, therefore, be immune.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/green-shoots-visible-in-uks-fight-against-covid-19-says-powis\">has blamed</a> the UK\u2019s delay in ramping up the rates of testing \u2013 widely seen as an important way to manage the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 on shortages of the chemical reagents needed, though the Chemical Industries Association later said it was unaware of this.</p> \n<p>Experts have said the UK should not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/what-are-the-uks-options-for-exiting-the-coronavirus-lockdown\">end the lockdown</a> without developing a clear strategy for stamping out the virus through mass testing.</p> \n<p>Stevenson said Thermo Fisher Scientific had all the elements required to produce tests and it was not affected by any global shortage of reagents. \u201cWe manufacture the whole sophisticated supply chain so the tests, the reagents, the instruments,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is actually our expertise, so we\u2019re bringing both the reagents, the chemicals and also our scientific expertise to help the UK. The challenge has really been making sure we have the lab capacity built up.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd so that\u2019s what the UK government has been building out, these three new centres and hubs. But we have the capacity to supply those labs with the necessary reagents, and tests for those kits.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Stevenson said the kits were currently produced outside the UK, but the company had agreed to use its UK bases to manufacture them for local supply. \u201cHere in the UK we have about 5,000 employees and about 26 sites, so we already have a very large presence,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Amazon was involved in moving the test kits from the company\u2019s bases to UK testing centres, he said. Tests are carried out at these centres and then sent to one of three major hubs that have been set up for processing.</p> \n<p>The company is also looking at antibody tests. Boris Johnson has previously described such tests as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-testing-kits-could-be-unreliable-uk-scientists-say\">a potential \u201cgame</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-testing-kits-could-be-unreliable-uk-scientists-say\">changer\u201d</a>, as people who have recovered from the virus are thought to be largely immune, meaning they could go back to work.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are looking at how to develop an antibody test, as you know the science is quite hard there,\u201d said Stevenson. \u201cBut we do think over time there will be good antibodies available and that will be part of the expansion beyond what we\u2019re doing at the moment.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>One year after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/11/canadia-soccer-coaches-abuse-mishandling\">going public about abuse, manipulation, and inappropriate behavior</a> by a Canada national team coach, former player Ciara McCormack\u2019s fire is still burning even if the country\u2019s governing body continues to ignore the issue.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://ciaramccormack.com/2019/02/25/a-horrific-canadian-soccer-story-the-story-no-one-wants-to-listen-to-but-everyone-needs-to-hear/\">blog post</a> by McCormack 12 months ago shined a light on how Canada Soccer \u2013 the governing body of the sport in the country \u2013 and Major League Soccer club Vancouver Whitecaps had failed to adequately address decade-long allegations by 14 high-level players of abuse by an elite coach working for both their organizations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/11/canadia-soccer-coaches-abuse-mishandling\">'The sickest thing': Canadian soccer rocked by claims of systemic abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the coach left Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps by \u201cmutual consent\u201d after a flawed internal enquiry at the time, he was still allowed to continue working with female youth players in Canada.</p> <p>Following poor publicity and protests by fans at the club\u2019s apparent inaction, the Whitecaps <a href=\"https://vancouver-mp7static.mlsdigital.net/elfinderimages/2019/safesport/SLSG_REVIEW_Findings_and_Recommendations_Report.pdf\">released a report</a> to the public in December last year that effectively absolved the club of any wrongdoing in how it had addressed the allegations of abuse.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the day no one was held accountable for anything and a national team coach who was fired for sexually harassing players went right back into the community to coach for another 10 years,\u201d McCormack told the Guardian. \u201cYou can do the most atrocious things and not be held accountable.\u201d</p> <p>McCormack, a Canadian-born former Ireland international, had an extensive professional career in Canada, Denmark, Norway, the United States and Australia, and played for the Vancouver Whitecaps Women until the team folded in 2012.</p> <p>As reported by the Guardian, McCormack and 13 former Under-20 Canada internationals detailed events that took place in 2008 while Bob Birarda was coach of both the U-20 national team and Vancouver Whitecaps Women side.</p> <p>Their allegations ranged from rubbing a player\u2019s thigh in a car, sending sexually suggestive text messages to players, demanding one-on-one meetings with players he had cut from his team in his hotel room, and telling a player during a half-time talk how he thought her body looked in a wet white team jersey.</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s report prompted more players and team administrators to speak out about their experience. Eden Hingwing, who played under Birarda for both the Canada women\u2019s Under-20 international team and the Vancouver Whitecaps in 2008 said: \u201cI watched what was a very professional environment created by the previous coach change into something extremely toxic and confusing.\u201d</p> <p>Birarda left Canada Soccer and Vancouver Whitecaps in late 2008 by \u201cmutual consent\u201d but was still able to coach female youth soccer teams in British Columbia without any sanctions. No criminal charges have been laid against him.</p> <p>\u201cThe most valuable thing to come out of this whole experience is that it created a case study for how the system is set up to not hold anyone accountable,\u201d McCormack said.</p> <p>McCormack said that a December 2019 third-party review into the 2008 events commissioned by the Whitecaps left many questions unresolved. The review by Canadian organization Sports Law and Strategy Group cleared the Whitecaps of a \u201ccover-up\u201d and even though Vancouver Whitecaps is one of the largest and well-known soccer clubs in North America it only had \u201cauthority to prevent [Birarda] from coaching with the Whitecaps organization\u201d. The report said any further sanctions on Birarda lay at the feet of Canada Soccer.</p> <p>Concacaf president Victor Montagliani \u2013 president of Canada Soccer from 2012 to 2017 and vice president at the time of the 2008 allegations with specific responsibility for national teams \u2013 told the Guardian last year that national organizations do not deal with coach registrations and responsibility for Birarda lay with regional governing bodies or local clubs.</p> <p>\u201cThere can be all the evidence in the world right in front of everybody and [coaches like Birarda] are not forced to answer to anybody,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cPeople quit the national team because they couldn\u2019t cope with the sexualized environment that [Birarda] created. No one has been able to explain why [Birarda] was able to go unchecked even when his new club\u2019s executive director worked in the Whitecaps office in 2008. Canada Soccer has never met with us. No has been forced to answer to any of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel good that everybody knows what happened and that this big nasty secret is out and that the spotlight has been shone on people who were operating in what they thought were dark corners,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cBut this is a case study for how unbelievably corrupt it all is. It is not about athlete health and wellbeing. It is all just words with no substance behind it.\u201d</p> <p>McCormack said the experience of the Whitecaps and Canada U-20 team echoed that of Megan Brown, a potential Olympic-level runner who has alleged her decades-older coach at a prestigious running program at the University of Guelph groomed her for a sexual relationship. Her former coach, Dave Scott-Thomas, was suddenly fired from the university in January more than 10 years after Brown first told her story.</p> <p>Speaking to Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail, Brown said: \u201cThis is how abuse of power works \u2026 the victim has too much to lose in speaking the truth. The victim is the one who suffers, who is ostracized, who is labelled, who is forced to rebuild their life, while the person in power continues to reap the benefits of their power.\u201d</p> <p>Adds McCormack: \u201cYou can swap Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps for the University of Guelph and it is the same thing. These stories will continue. Until something significant changes, I am grateful for the experience to know that the whole system and these people don\u2019t care. To feel silenced and squished down and made to feel so little. \u2026 I wanted to see if the report would make a difference but of course it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Now coaching youth soccer in Los Angeles, McCormack said that, while the Whitecaps and Canada Soccer offered no support for the 2008 players, she was overwhelmed by the response from Vancouver\u2019s wider soccer community to their experiences.</p> <p>Whitecaps fans staged protests during MLS home games last year at their club\u2019s perceived inaction on the issue. Fans coordinated stadium walk outs mid-match joined by visiting supporters of Portland Timbers and Los Angeles FC in a show of solidarity.</p> <p>\u201cThe gift this gave us was being heard and that helped healing,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cThe community in Vancouver showed that they do care, it valued us and they were willing to take a stand. They realized people did wrong. I hated Vancouver. It was so full of bad memories but the walkouts changed things for me. It meant that I got my city back. I\u2019m grateful for that.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Canada Soccer did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.</em></p></li> </ul>",

Now she makes daily visits to one of three sprawling displacement camps outside the town to campaign for vulnerable women and girls. Once a climate refugee herself, she knows what their lives are like.</p> <p>\u201cI tell them to gather in groups when they go out,\u201d Abdulle says. \u201cThat most of the men are your enemies, so don\u2019t go out alone so you can be safe from the violence and the rape, especially at night-time.\u201d</p> <p>In Somalia, climate change<a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/news/gender/202001/environmental-degradation-driving-gender-based-violence-iucn-study\"> is driving</a> rape, sexual violence and intimate partner violence.

After a nomadic life with her family, Abdulle was sent to the capital city, Mogadishu, for her education. She returned first to her parents in northern Somalia, and then moved to Oog.</p> <p>\u201cWhen my family [lived] in the countryside, we had a drought like this one [in 2016],\u201d Abdulle says. \u201cThe people were helped. Some were educated, some worked and some of them went abroad. I know something about the droughts. When the droughts come, there can be good change for the people, especially for women.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, when waves of displaced pastoralist families streamed into Oog, looking for healthcare, food, water and shelter, Abdulle felt compelled to document the crisis and to protect and empower women and girls. She recorded videos to send to the government and the Somali diaspora, requesting support for the overwhelming need.</p> <p>Abdulle\u2019s no-nonsense attitude and unrelenting commitment encouraged the community to approach the local government to request she be put in charge of their welfare. Holding a paid leadership position overseeing men is an usual responsibility for a woman in Somalia\u2019s male-dominated society.</p> <p>\u201cThe surprising thing is that the three male heads of the three IDP camps are \u2026 happy that Ibado is above them,\u201d said Muna Hussein, a gender officer at Oxfam, who works closely with Abdulle. \u201cThey listen to her.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c34b9fe85d999c1711cc887b6e06cbca8761755\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c34b9fe85d999c1711cc887b6e06cbca8761755/0_0_6668_4445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Huda, 35, stands in her home at a camp for displaced people on the outskirts of Oog, in Somaliland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huda, 35, stands in her home at a camp for displaced people on the outskirts of Oog, in Somaliland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Swanson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Camp conditions are hazardous for women: there is no lighting at night, and no doors or fences to keep out opportunistic criminals and predators.

  "<p>Healthcare professionals are being silenced and threatened with disciplinary action for speaking out about their work during the coronavirus outbreak, the Guardian can reveal.</p> \n<p>Many NHS staff are increasingly concerned that their ability to share stories about their work is being restricted by a clampdown on speaking out publicly.</p> \n<p>It follows reports of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/nhs-staff-gagged-over-coronavirus-protective-equipment-shortages\">doctors and nurses being gagged</a> by hospitals and other NHS bodies from speaking out about widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE).

Several professionals said they worried about losing their jobs. Examples include an email signed by the chief executive of one NHS trust forbidding all staff from talking to the media, and incidents where staff suspect emails and social media accounts are being monitored. Requests by staff to communications departments to permit them to talk to the press have been turned down, leaving staff anxious and fearful for their jobs during the worst global public health crisis of this century.</p> \n<p>One nurse who wanted to highlight the vital role of his profession received an email (later recalled) from his trust to all staff, which banned public communications. When he contacted the communications department, he was shocked to receive a response saying simply no media. The team did not say what action they might take to enforce the ban, he said, but the tone was threatening.. </p> \n<p>The nurse added: \u201cAs healthcare workers I think we feel generally quite secure \u2013 there\u2019s always work for nurses. But in my correspondence with the communications department I felt quite powerless all of a sudden. It makes me so sad.\u201d Ironically, he added, coronavirus has in fact led to the role of nurses being highlighted in a way they could never have otherwise dreamed of, including being featured on the front cover of glossy magazines.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Not all NHS trusts in England have imposed a blanket ban on staff speaking out and some are encouraging professionals who wish to talk about their work. A range of staff recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/at-risk-like-doctors-nhs-staff-fighting-coronavirus-behind-scenes\">explained their behind-the-scene roles</a> to the Guardian, but most of those speaking out tend to be doctors, often in secure positions where they are less likely to be challenged or threatened.</p> \n<p>Kate Jarman, director of corporate affairs at Milton Keynes University hospital NHS foundation trust, believes staff should be supported to talk about what life is like in their roles. \u201cThere\u2019s always a balance to be struck in how staff get messages across,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople should be mindful of patient confidentiality and the core messages of public information and safety but from what I\u2019ve seen, they are doing that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian is aware of several cases where staff have been silenced. They include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>A health professional who was left anxious for their job after their communications department found out they had spoken to a journalist about their work.</p></li> \n <li><p>Staff at one trust who faced disciplinary action for speaking out. A blanket email signed by one trust\u2019s chief executive was sent, warning staff not to speak to media under any circumstances.

Colenzo Jarrett-Thorpe, national officer for health at the Unite union, which represents 100,000 health staff, said officials had been hearing that some NHS bosses may have been clamping down on staff wishing to expose failings in the system and improve the wellbeing of patients.</p> \n<p>A spokesman from the Institute of Biomedical Science, a professional body for scientists, support staff and students, said members working for the NHS who wanted to talk about their vital role in the crisis were increasingly coming up against the same barriers. \u201cHospital trusts in England are silencing our requests for members to talk.\u201d </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/society-weekly-email-newsletter-sign-up\">Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The ramifications of such a clampdown at a time when NHS staff are risking their lives and being celebrated by the general public are chilling, but come as no surprise to some. Roger Kline, a research fellow at Middlesex University who has done a lot of work looking into whistleblowing, said: \u201cOld habits die hard, and I\u2019ve certainly been contacted by NHS and social care staff anxious about going public and nervous about challenging local managers.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p> One mental health professional told the Guardian that the unspoken rule is that staff should keep their heads down, follow orders and say nothing. \u201cWhen it comes to the day-to-day clinical issues and challenges we face, there is a definite power dynamic at play, and [we] are generally petrified to speak out,\u201d they said.</p> \n<p>Preventing people from speaking out about their work is not only happening in the UK.

  "<p>The pirated VHS copy of Conan the Barbarian that I cherished when I was 12 was cruddy and discoloured even before I wore it out with twice-daily viewings. The image, tinted jaundice-yellow in some places and seasickness-green in others, was striped with thorny lines of static that made you feel as though you were watching the movie through barbed wire. I knew it wasn\u2019t supposed to look like that because I\u2019d already seen it on the big screen a year earlier. One afternoon in September 1982, I had persuaded my father to take me after school to the ABC cinema in South Woodford, east London. I gave the movie the hard sell: it had Arnold Schwarzenegger, the goofy muscleman we\u2019d liked in Cactus Jack, as well as lots of whopping great swords and a baddie who could turn into a snake! I showed Dad the glossy stills printed in Starburst magazine, and waved my copy of the novelisation in his face. In fact, there was only one detail I kept hidden from him: the AA certificate, which prohibited anyone under the age of 14 from seeing the film.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t fazed. I wore my burgundy leather jacket that day and stocked up on Juicy Fruit in preparation for some emphatic gum-chewing. Those factors alone would surely be enough to add three years to my age. The danger as I saw it was not that I would be refused entry but that I might very well be mistaken for James Dean.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t quite how it panned out. The woman at the ticket desk gave me the once over.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not 14,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dad replied. \u201cSo what?\u201d</p> <p>She broke the bad news while Dad took a step back from the counter. He sighed heavily, huffing and puffing and saying \u201cDear-oh-law\u201d and \u201cWe drove all this way\u201d and \u201cOh blimey\u201d, which I knew was serious because in our family we didn\u2019t say \u201cblimey.\u201d We said \u201cblimus.\u201d It was a Carry On Cleo joke.</p> <p>My father is an East End geezer straight out of central casting: shaved head, rough edges, bags of front. The sort of firework you don\u2019t want going off indoors. But I had seen him angry plenty of times and this wasn\u2019t the real deal: it was surprise and inconvenience worked up artificially into a performance. Possibly he had in mind a lesson learned from Mel Brooks\u2019s Hitchcock spoof High Anxiety, one of his favourite films. There\u2019s a scene where Brooks and Madeline Kahn, finding themselves on the run from the police, try to sneak through customs disguised as an elderly kvetching couple. \u201cIf you\u2019re loud and annoying,\u201d Brooks tells Kahn, \u201cpsychologically people don\u2019t notice you.\u201d And he\u2019s right. The demonstrative drunk on public transport is usually guaranteed a wealth of personal space and the pick of the best seats.</p> <p>That must be why Dad caused enough of a fuss for the cashier to decide that it might just be easier to let us in.</p> <p>\u201cGo on,\u201d she said with a wink. \u201cBut sit yourselves at the back, alright?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"006fcf30e8a22f87147faddc34dd6500d76990f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/006fcf30e8a22f87147faddc34dd6500d76990f4/0_47_3477_2086/1000..jpg\" alt=\"James Earl Jones and headgear, with suitably underdressed companion ...

Basil Poledouris\u2019s thunderous, stirring score boomed out of the crummy speakers in Screen Two and for the next couple of hours I was in a disbelieving trance. What do I remember of the film itself? Watching it again now, I can only say: pretty much everything. I can hum every note of that score. And the violence is branded on my memory, from the casually brutal killing of young Conan\u2019s mother at the start of the movie \u2013 her severed head drops past the camera in a blur while the boy is still holding her hand \u2013 to the sight of Schwarzenegger punching a camel. (You will search in vain for a \u201cno animals were harmed during the making of this film\u201d disclaimer in the end credits.)</p> <p>What I hadn\u2019t minded at the time was John Milius\u2019s laborious direction, or the plodding, meat-and-potatoes script that is credited to him and Oliver Stone. But then in many ways this is the archetypal adolescent-boy movie, from the epigram taken from Nietzsche to the lip-smacking shots of phallic symbols (swords, snakes, arrows). Their only rival for closeups is Schwarzenegger himself, who looks adorable despite the baby-oiled, bowling-ball biceps; I\u2019m amazed to find that the schoolboy crush I had on him is revived today as I watch. There\u2019s a giddy innocence in his eyes here that would calcify within the decade into a businessman\u2019s shrewdness.

  "<p>When Typhoon Haiyan laid waste the central Philippines in 2013, Bernadeth Cabusog was one of the many people whose lives were turned upside down. Her smallholding was wrecked and with it, her family\u2019s main means of provision. \u201cIt was the hardest time of our lives,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAll our vegetables were destroyed. We really needed some help.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cabusog took the advice of a neighbour in her village in rural Cebu province and approached <a href=\"https://lendwithcare.org/info/how-it-works/microfinance-institutions/lamac\">Lamac</a>, a local agricultural co-operative. Lamac lent her around $450 to replant her crops of lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes, allowing her to defer half of its repayment until she was back on her feet again. \u201cI was just so thankful that they were there to help me. I felt like God had a purpose for me after all,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Seven years later, Cabusog has just repaid her fifth loan of $1,900, which went towards fertiliser and other farm equipment, to Lamac. She sells her produce through the co-operative and employs two people. Some of the money will help fund the wages of more workers she plans to hire this year.</p> \n<p>While her loan was administered by Lamac, the funds came from <a href=\"https://lendwithcare.org/\">Lendwithcare</a>, one of several nonprofit microfinance sites where small investors can help entrepreneurs in developing countries by crowdfunding loans.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1aa742dfa60a560785b7c1be8401510ff049f3c0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1aa742dfa60a560785b7c1be8401510ff049f3c0/0_380_2775_1665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernadeth Cabusog</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CARE International</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Millions of people in developing countries depend on microloans to raise the funds to grow a business or just stay afloat in hard times. And thanks to digital platforms, smartphones and free-moving global capital, growing numbers of people in the rich world are using their money to lift others out of poverty.</p> \n<p>In the decade or so they have been around, nonprofit microlenders have become big business. <a href=\"https://www.kiva.org/\">Kiva</a>, the Silicon Valley-based market leader, has around $158m (\u00a3120m) invested by 639,000 lenders to more than 400,000 borrowers, according to its 2018 figures.</p> \n<p>More modestly but no less impressively, Lendwithcare has lent \u00a327m in total to 127,000 borrowers. Its recent funding targets include a baker in Ecuador looking to replace a mixer, an embroiderer in Pakistan seeking to stock up on cloth, and a taxi rider in Rwanda hoping to purchase a new moped \u2013 the kind of small individual ventures that can make a big difference in poor communities.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Traditional microlenders think harnessing big data will be the key to lowering borrowing costs in the developing world</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Critically with Kiva and Lendwithcare investors cannot make a profit \u2013 so once funding targets are met, the sites can forward on the microloan interest-free. When (and occasionally if) the loan is paid back, lenders are free to withdraw their initial investment \u2013 but most end up returning it to a new project.</p> \n<p>Microfinance was conceived as a solution to world poverty by offering people in developing countries reliable access to loans and other financial products. But, 15 years since the idea caught hold, the question that perpetually dogs the sector is whether it actually works.</p> \n<p>By some measures, extreme poverty appears to be falling. According to the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/poverty/\">most recent UN estimates</a>, in 2015 10% of the world\u2019s population lived at or below the World Bank\u2019s extreme poverty line of $1.90 a day \u2013 down from 16% in 2010 and 36% in 1990. But how much of this trend can be attributed to the effects of microfinance? The microfinance sector has grown into a financial behemoth, with overall loans in 2018 estimated <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5db8891e058ab7204b4e9088/t/5dea83f380f97670d487de8e/1575650294671/MIX+Market_Global+Outreach+%26+Financial+Benchmark+Report_2017-2018.pdf\">by the World Bank</a> at $112bn to 120 million borrowers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dc51237f-a5b4-442b-bcec-cdb548ae9356\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <!-- invalid atom id (dc51237f-a5b4-442b-bcec-cdb548ae9356) -->\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But Dr Philip Mader, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies who has looked at the sector extensively, says that, while microfinance has created more financial products in developing countries and encouraged generosity from the rich world, there is no clear evidence that microloans do, on average, lift people out of poverty.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are always going to be exceptional individuals for whom a loan was a single breakthrough factor, but most people just aren\u2019t natural entrepreneurs,\u201d says Mader. \u201cThey\u2019re doing this to get by, and at the end of next year, they\u2019re going to be where they were before. Some people are going to be worse off as well. Loans are risky. That\u2019s important to consider.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a point acknowledged by Ajaz Ahmed Khan, the senior microfinance adviser at Care International, Lendwithcare\u2019s umbrella organisation. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in this sort of world for 30 years, but I\u2019ve never been convinced that any one thing is a panacea,\u201d he says. \u201cPoverty is far too complicated for one simple intervention to remedy everything.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc446032832a3832a9a04205b724e815a9ff7df2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc446032832a3832a9a04205b724e815a9ff7df2/0_179_5370_3222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Entrepreneurs in Bangladesh repaying microloans.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images/Science Faction</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kiva is the slickest of the microfunding websites, offering a mind-bogglingly glossy catalogue of projects sorted into different categories, countries and attributes, all illustrated with backstories and pictures. It\u2019s clear that this sense of connection between lender and borrower is a big part of the urge to invest.</p> \n<p>But the reality is often a lot messier \u2013 something that may not initially be obvious to the lender. In fact, like Cabusog and Lendwithcare, borrowers and crowdfunding sites connect via local partner microfinance institutions (MFIs) who do the essential work of assessing creditworthiness and administering loans. To pay for that, most MFIs charge interest to borrowers, often at wildly varying rates.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, many lenders have been surprised to find the money being crowdfunded on Lendwithcare or Kiva is often already in the borrower\u2019s pocket, lent by a local MFI long before the loan target has been met. There are good practical reasons for this, explains Kathy Guis, Kiva\u2019s director of partner investments. \u201cOften borrowers have urgent financial needs, for example, to purchase perishable goods for resale,\u201d she says. \u201cSo for entrepreneurs to wait two or three months for Kiva to send that money to the [MFI] partner just wouldn\u2019t actually be useful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Still, the reality is that in many cases a lender\u2019s individual investment is simply going towards a partner MFI\u2019s general portfolio, rather than directly to the loanee. Both Kiva and Lendwithcare do spell this out in the small print on their sites, Kiva in particular <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html\">having been accused of not being clear enough about this</a> in the past. It\u2019s just not quite as straightforward as you might first think.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5947407-4f95-41fe-849d-e7d9248ebcb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

Goldie Chow, Kiva\u2019s director of impact, says that a sense of connection is key to the urge to lend. \u201cKiva is a platform to democratise impact investing,\u201d Chow says. \u201cWhen you come on the website, it looks very simple, it looks very clean and very easy. But the fact of the matter is that to manage the $150m of loans that we do every year, we have to have really onerous systems and levers and monitoring processes in place.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the work carried out by local MFIs is generally necessary and cost-consuming, the malpractice of some operators has also cast a shadow over the industry. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/12/microfinance-lenders-in-sierra-leone-accused-of-payday-loan-interest-rates\">Guardian investigation</a> into a microfinance programme run in Sierra Leone by Brac, the world\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.brac.net/latest-news/item/1219-ngo-advisor-s-global-ranking-brac-named-world-s-number-one-ngo\">largest NGO</a>, found its staff were failing to fully explain loans to borrowers, or ensuring they could afford the payments.</p> \n<p>Separately, a <a href=\"https://www.licadho-cambodia.org/reports/files/228Report_Collateral_Damage_LICADHO_STT_Eng_07082019.pdf\">report last year</a> by Licadho, one of Cambodia\u2019s leading human rights organisations, highlighted numerous cases of MFIs preying on borrowers. It detailed widespread reckless lending practices from local credit officers in offering loans to clients who were clearly unable to repay them, and who were then pressured to sell land to clear debt. It also revealed that at least a million Cambodian borrowers had been forced to offer their land or homes as security to MFIs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8136fab7aadb7448247e48d94e8638966d74e397\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8136fab7aadb7448247e48d94e8638966d74e397/0_52_5325_3195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Lendwithcare\u2019s recent funding targets include a taxi rider in Rwanda hoping to purchase a new moped.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lendwithcare\u2019s recent funding targets include a moto taxi driver in Rwanda hoping to purchase a new moped.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kiva and Lendwithcare both say they take stringent measures to avoid exposure to such bad practice. Khan says that Lendwithcare\u2019s MFI partners tend to be NGOs and co-operatives and its due diligence visits typically last seven to 10 days, including full policy and procedure reviews. \u201cSometimes, despite all the research and country visits, we decide not to proceed,\u201d he says, highlighting recent visits to Tanzania, Guatemala and Egypt as examples.</p> \n<p>On its website, Kiva says it will not partner with organisations that charge unreasonable interest rates, and that it requires field partners to fully disclose their rates. \u201cKiva only partners with organisations and microfinance institutions that have a social mission to serve the poor, unbanked and underserved,\u201d it says.</p> \n<p>If rogue MFIs are often perceived as the problem, would it be possible to do without them? Around 2006, Julia Kurnia had that very thought while working for a small NGO in Senegal, when she saw first-hand how expensive microloans could be for borrowers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe had started a microfinance bank and hired a loan officer,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe would have to travel to the villages and collect money. That was very expensive relative to the small size of loans. But even though we tried to be as frugal as we could \u2013 I was there as a volunteer \u2013 we could never get the operating cost below about a third of the value of the loans.\u201d</p> \n<p>The result was that Kurnia founded Zidisha, a peer-to-peer lending service that cuts out the middleman altogether by utilising cheap mobile phone money transfer services to connect borrower to lender directly. Borrowers pay a 5% fee to Zidisha to cover its operating costs, but that\u2019s it. Since it was founded in 2009, it has lent around $16.7m to more than 380,000 members.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cae67ed54018d2514ae008f42e95ee77deca6ab2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cae67ed54018d2514ae008f42e95ee77deca6ab2/0_107_4096_5537/740.jpg\" alt=\"pic\" width=\"740\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A microfinance loan helped Maria Jafon to get her shoe selling business started in Freetown, Sierra Leone.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jake Lyell/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Zidisha uses algorithms to assess potential borrowers for default risk and for possible fraud: \u201cThat\u2019s the main problem we have to solve as an internet service that doesn\u2019t have people on the ground,\u201d says Kurnia. She admits the absence of an MFI to mediate could result in a higher risk of default, though she says Zidisha offers a guarantee to lenders of up to $1,000.</p> \n<p>The traditional microlenders think that harnessing big data will be the key to lowering the cost of borrowing in the developing world. Kiva is using blockchain technology in Sierra Leone to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-leone-kiva/san-francisco-crowdfunder-kiva-sets-up-sierra-leone-credit-database-idUSKCN1VB262\">create an online ID database</a> so that loan applicants outside the formal banking system can prove their credit history, and it hopes to extend the system to other countries if successful.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom the outside looking in, many people assume there\u2019s minimal economic activity in the unbanked world,\u201d says Kiva\u2019s chief strategy officer, Matthew Davie. \u201cIn fact, there\u2019s a very active financial sector. The problem is all the activity in that sector never gives you credit when you move on to formal financial services.\u201d</p> \n<p>Still, the question remains: does microfinance really achieve the objective of lifting people out of poverty? As with the differing models of loan disbursement, the answer is complicated. \u201cBroadly speaking, I\u2019d agree that it\u2019s hard to prove,\u201d says Khan. He points out that Lendwithcare tries to supplement its loans with a range of other financial services including savings and training, so that the impact is not just focused on loans.</p> \n<p>Over the past five years, Lendwithcare has tried to measure the impact of its work in collaboration with the University of Portsmouth. It has found that in Pakistan, for example, household income for the low-income families it supports has risen by 30.7% since 2015. The results look encouraging \u2013 but even here, Khan says they should be treated with caution as Akhuwat, its MFI partner in Pakistan, charges no interest on its loans in accordance with Islamic practice. \u201cThe results in Zimbabwe, where the economic situation is difficult, were very mixed,\u201d he admits.</p> \n<p>In the end, philanthropic investing in this form is only one in a range of options open to people wanting to help alleviate poverty \u2013 and that includes just giving money to needy individuals or to good causes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/19/saving-city-millions-gallons-water-one-tap-at-a-time-india-kolkata\">Saving a city millions of gallons of water \u2013 one tap at a time</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThere is no one thing that will help everyone living in poverty find a way out,\u201d says Kiva\u2019s Guis. \u201cCash transfers are right for some people, loans are right for others. Where I find the argument for Kiva\u2019s approach strongest is that we\u2019re tapping into money that is not earmarked for charitable giving.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Mader points out, people need to consider what they want to achieve. \u201cIf people want to give directly to someone, there\u2019s a website called <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">givedirectly.org</a>. If they want to make sure that somebody is working hard to have a chance at poverty reduction and development, but only after having repaid interest to an intermediary lender, then yes, use Kiva.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fault anyone for giving a loan. But I\u2019m fascinated by how well Kiva and others have managed to sell the idea that the best way to do this is by funding individual entrepreneurs via loans, rather than working for broader community-based change.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the Philippines, Bernadeth Cabusog is already planning for her next loan. She hopes to use it to concrete a track on her land, and to buy a motorcycle which would considerably reduce the time she spends travelling to and from the credit office in town.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery day I see the difference,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore the loans, everything was so hard.

  "<p>That\u2019s it. I have now played Apex Legends for over 500 hours. The online multiplayer shooter, developed by Californian studio Respawn Entertainment and released in February 2019, has been my obsession all year, seeing off a variety of pretenders from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/19/doom-eternal-review\">Doom Eternal</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/16/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch\">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p> <p>To the casual observer, there\u2019s nothing remarkable about it. Set in a science-fiction universe tied to Respawn\u2019s successful Titanfall series, it is another title in the battle royale genre alongside the Goliath that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/fortnite\">Fortnite</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jan/22/player-unknowns-battlegrounds-pubg-battle-royale\">Player</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jan/22/player-unknowns-battlegrounds-pubg-battle-royale\">Unknown\u2019s Battlegrounds</a> and Call of Duty: Warzone. You land in a hi-tech future landscape with two team-mates and then you scramble about, finding weapons, while 19 other teams try to kill you and everyone else. The last team left alive is the winner.</p> <p>But the thing is, Respawn is one of the greatest designers of fast-paced shooter games in the industry. Formed in 2010 by the creative directors behind Call of Duty, Jason West and Vince Zampella, the studio was set up with most of the technical and design staff behind the legendary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/oct/31/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-review\">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a> \u2013 and this experience shows in Apex Legends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0609b93ba2ca3777b572ed70d50c155e602ffb44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0609b93ba2ca3777b572ed70d50c155e602ffb44/114_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Most buildings in Apex Legends have a modular design that allows easy climbing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most buildings in Apex Legends have a modular design that allows easy climbing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One vital element of game design that\u2019s explored perfectly is the interplay between flow and friction. Indeed, much of the time Apex Legends feels frictionless. When you move through the environment you do so freely; if you like, you can hit a button to slide, giving you a short speed boost on level ground but also allowing you to sledge extremely quickly down hills. It\u2019s quick, satisfying, and if you\u2019re sliding toward an object, you can hit the jump button to break out of the animation, gracefully avoiding a collision. The two Apex Legends maps we\u2019ve seen so far are designed to encourage and facilitate this form of traversal, with lots of slopes and valleys to explore.</p> <p>Buildings and rockfaces also keep the player moving. Whenever you approach a tall object, there is almost always a handy grip point \u2013 say, a rocky outcrop or a window ledge \u2013 a few metres higher than your character. When you jump at a vertical surface, you scramble up a little, adding extra height and putting that grip point just within reach. This scramble animation makes you feel as though you worked for it, providing a sense of achievement, even though raised platforms are almost always accessible. The game is working with you.</p> <p>\u201cIn instances where the player is not entirely sure if they can get somewhere but decide to try anyway, 90% of the time they are going to succeed,\u201d says game designer Dan Pearce, director at Four Circle, and fellow Respawn fan. \u201cEverything in Apex is balanced like this, the same way that bullets in Halo curve slightly to hit their target, or Mario has about half a second where he can still jump after running off the edge of a surface.\u201d</p> <p>Another aspect Dan and I both like is the decision to go with three-player squads, rather than the four-person teams favoured by Fortnite or Call of Duty. It means no one can be carried \u2013 everyone has to work together and be a functional part of any strategy. \u201cThree players also means it\u2019s really easy to set up a balanced rock/paper/scissors-style team, where someone\u2019s focused on traversal, someone\u2019s focused on aggression, someone\u2019s focused on defence,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cThree players is also a small enough group that, if you were really in the zone, you could conceivably take out a whole squad single-handed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8100ad8d43711deda39e190f405274f54c4b57fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8100ad8d43711deda39e190f405274f54c4b57fa/240_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The game\u2019s focus on three-player teams ensures everyone has a role and close teamwork is necessary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The game\u2019s focus on three-player teams ensures everyone has a role and close teamwork is necessary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electronic Arts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the masterstroke in terms of cooperative play is the game\u2019s ping system, which allows players to highlight areas of the map, useful items and enemy locations to their team-mates without talking. This, together with a conversation wheel offering a range of tactical phrases, means that it\u2019s possible to play as a squad with strangers without having to use your voice, which is intimidating and opens you to the possibility of abuse \u2013 or unwanted noise. \u201cIt is a genuine blessing for games culture,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cI might never again have to awkwardly describe an enemy\u2019s location over the sound of a stranger\u2019s barking dog while I\u2019m being riddled with bullets.\u201d</p> <p>Having spent a lot of time wandering the two Apex Legends maps \u2013 King\u2019s Canyon and World\u2019s Edge \u2013 what I\u2019ve noticed is how functional the architecture and topography are; how they work together to provide fun little playgrounds, choke points and risk centres. The icy slides down to the Epicenter, the slim, lava-surrounded walkways of the Dome, the wide, densely overlooked streets of Capitol City. In a game with such extravagance in terms of weapon design and character special abilities, you need each area of the environment to provide strict and specific roles. Respawn\u2019s approach to staging is more theatrical than cinematic. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s incredibly little that is extraneous in the designs,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cAlmost nothing is there just because it looks cool. Every Respawn game so far has felt to me like it could be played with blocky prototype graphics and still be just as involving, because every element justifies its inclusion mechanically. This kind of puzzle-box design, where everything clicks together in such a deliberate way, is harder to come across in games with larger scopes. Respawn isn\u2019t the only developer doing this \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/aug/30/control-review-pc-ps4-xbox-adventure-video-game-sci-fi-blockbuster\">Remedy\u2019s Control</a> felt similar to me, but it is rare in the big-budget, triple-A space.\u201d</p> <p>But what I really love about Apex Legends is the simple, unimpeded pleasure of moving through the world. Lots of game designers are very interested in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s concept of flow, a highly focused mental state in which actions become almost automatic. Assisting flow is one of the most underappreciated elements of design \u2013 it might be found in the way a game illuminates certain areas in the world to show where the player should go (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/feb/16/dead-space-was-to-games-what-alien-was-to-movies\">Dead Space</a> does this brilliantly), or the use of rumble feedback to indicate the edges of a road in a racing game. But what Apex Legends does is reduce friction in a way that makes the player feel skilful.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is why Apex has found so much success, even among players who don\u2019t usually enjoy battle royale games,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for players to feel overwhelmed when they\u2019re being introduced to these games, but Respawn balances everything to make the player feel about 20% more competent and cognisant than they are.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, I have to deal with the realisation that the game I\u2019ve played the most this year is the one that\u2019s designed to flatter me. But, 500 hours in, I don\u2019t really care.</p>",

I\u2019m worried about giving something to them.</p> \n<p>The authorities don\u2019t want to run empty buses because it won\u2019t be profitable, so they have to limit the number. But that means people are waiting for ages and all pile on, which reduces the space they have. There\u2019s no social distancing there, but I can\u2019t go round and clean the bus every time I stop. It\u2019s quite frightening, really.</p> \n<p>My partner has a heart condition, and I don\u2019t want to think about the possibility of giving it to him. I don\u2019t want to be the reason my husband dies. It\u2019s a horrible situation, but my husband can\u2019t work, so I\u2019m the only breadwinner. If I don\u2019t earn money, we don\u2019t have any.</p> \n<p><strong>The care home manager, Scotland</strong></p> \n<p>At the moment, we\u2019re lucky enough that no one has symptoms. It\u2019s a strange atmosphere but it\u2019s still quite positive. There aren\u2019t many residents who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on; even those with dementia understand that things are different because of a global phenomenon. They\u2019re all going along with it really well, and if they start to feel lonely, we set up a private video chat with their family.</p> \n<p>We\u2019re placing a lot of trust in the staff, like when they get home they\u2019re staying indoors, but they\u2019re worried too, and very dedicated. They take their temperatures in the morning when they arrive, sanitise their hands, and bring a change of clothes to work in.</p> \n<p>We\u2019ve set up WhatsApp and Facebook groups to keep in touch with families while they can\u2019t visit. We take photos and videos throughout the day so they can see that our residents are still doing things. </p> \n<p>This is something no one could ever have imagined, but we have dealt with diarrhoea and vomiting outbreaks and had to isolate residents. The biggest difference is the uncertainty. The government don\u2019t seem to have a clue, so we\u2019re just doing what we believe is the best way to do things.</p> \n<p>Getting food has been difficult for staff. We had a member of staff turned away from Tesco at the healthcare workers\u2019 hour \u2013 they were told they weren\u2019t a real nurse because they didn\u2019t work for the NHS. I made ID badges and laminated them for the staff, but again they said we couldn\u2019t go at the NHS time. Even when you can get in, the shelves are empty. </p> \n<p><strong>The postal worker, southern England</strong></p> \n<p>I\u2019m still delivering junk mail and that seems mad at the moment when post office workers are going off sick \u2013 one piece of junk mail for pizza showed a picture of people in a park together. Online shopping has led to a huge swell in the number of packets we\u2019re delivering. It\u2019s like Christmas.</p> \n<p>Social distancing means new rules \u2013 no more than one person to a post van. The other postie, who would normally be doing the walker\u2019s side of our route, is now expected to walk out to the drop-off point or catch a bus. The two-metre rule is almost impossible to enforce when we\u2019re working in the office, and people are very worried about that.</p> \n<p>One of the extra key services I\u2019m providing is conversation. There\u2019s one older woman who lives by herself and wishes it could all be over for her birthday in a week\u2019s time. She\u2019s asked to me to swear I won\u2019t stop delivering to her, whether I get the virus or not.</p> \n<p><strong>The supermarket worker, Cumbria</strong></p> \n<p>The first huge panic took us by surprise \u2013 we had no restrictions in place. A lot of our customers are regular people who we\u2019ve known for years, but there were lots of new people who didn\u2019t know how things worked or where they were. They wouldn\u2019t use self-checkouts because of the germs, so there were long queues. There was a lot of anger directed towards us, and it was panic-stricken. </p> \n<p>We\u2019re only letting in about 40 people at a time, and there are queues outside in the early mornings. The car parks are normally full with about 150 cars, but there are about 15 there now. During the initial lockdown, the car park was deserted, and a large rabbit came up to the staff door everyday. We never normally see wildlife, but it was so quiet that the rabbits were coming out to play.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s most strange is that people just don\u2019t talk in the store \u2013 they nod and smile and whisper.</p> \n<p><strong>The delivery driver, Somerset</strong></p> \n<p>It\u2019s worse than it is at Christmas. I would normally do about 10 or 12 drops each day, 14 at a push, but yesterday I did 20. I\u2019m still dropping off orders of \u00a3400. Sometimes people shop for multiple families because they can\u2019t get delivery slots.</p> \n<p>Nowadays, we have no complaints about replacing items with alternatives, people understand, and that\u2019s very different to usual. Our policy was to carry shopping in if needed, but now we aren\u2019t allowed in anyone\u2019s house, we just leave them at the door in bags and step back. We won\u2019t collect the bags either, which has caused a massive explosion in plastic. </p> \n<p>It\u2019s a very stressful time, and I\u2019m definitely concerned about bringing [the virus] back. We don\u2019t get gloves or face masks, just gel. None of the people packing the vans wear gloves, and we share vans which run from 6am to 11pm, so you don\u2019t know who\u2019s touched what.</p> \n<p>I was working on the night of the national NHS clap, and people came to their gates while I was driving down the road and cheered, saying, \u201cWell done, driver,\u201d and things like that. That was great.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>The cemetery worker, London</strong></p> \n<p>This week has been really draining for me. I have been present at eight funerals and five of them were coronavirus-related. I\u2019ve been a gravedigger for five years, I work in one of the smaller London cemeteries; there\u2019s a nice community vibe here. Doing what I do, I\u2019ve been really aware of the seriousness of the outbreak, but I think it took the public longer to become aware of it.</p> \n<p>Even after the lockdown was announced, people were still playing football and frisbee in the cemetery. At one burial there were about 30 people standing closely together and they all hugged each other afterwards. I was thinking I could end up burying some of them.</p> \n<p>I do worry about what\u2019s coming. It\u2019s incredibly stressful. Workers here are concerned about catching something because the virus lives on surfaces. It can be on a coffin, or anywhere, you just don\u2019t know. We do have enough PPE at the moment, but it won\u2019t be easy for a family to see us in hazmat suits during a funeral.</p> \n<p>Death is such a taboo subject, but we have to be more open as a society about talking about it, particularly now. We just don\u2019t know where we\u2019re heading. The atmosphere is very tense.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-and-volunteering-how-can-i-help-in-the-uk\">Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?</a></p></li> \n</ul>",

Which bit didn\u2019t you like? The terrifying, sexualised cats? The complete lack of a storyline? The horrible music? The implication that Dame Judi Dench had murdered her family and made them into a coat? The scene where Rebel Wilson unzips her own flesh and tries to eat some mice who all have the faces and voices of human children?</p> <p><strong>Yes. </strong>Oh. Well, then in that case imagine all of that, but worse.</p> <p><strong>How so?</strong> The so-called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/1240138000249630721\">Butthole Cut of Cats</a> was first reported in March, when a Twitter user announced that a friend of his had been exclusively hired to delete all the CGI cat anuses that had previously been inserted into the film.</p> <p><strong>That </strong><strong>sounds like hearsay.</strong> And here\u2019s some more. The Daily Beast claims that a VFX artist who worked on Cats confirmed to it that a lot of work did indeed go into airbrushing out feline behinds.</p> <p><strong>Were the butts the worst thing about Cats? </strong>No, not at all. There were other surreal effects, like the one where all the cats looked like hellishly disfigured mutants who existed solely to crawl into your nightmares and eat your brains.</p> <p><strong>Maybe they could have done something about Idris Elba, too</strong><strong>.</strong> You mean like dip the audio every time he squealed the word \u201cMistoffelees\u201d in the manner of a weasel being goosed by a nun? No, absolutely not.</p> <p><strong>This doesn\u2019t exactly have </strong><strong>\u201ctrouble-free production</strong><strong>\u201d written all over it. </strong>Unfortunately not. Once the Cats trailer was released, and immediately became an entirely deserved target for global scorn, director Tom Hooper announced some redesign work.</p> <p><strong>Yikes.</strong> And the film wasn\u2019t completed until less than 48 hours before its official premiere, which is extraordinarily close to the wire for such a tentpole release.</p> <p><strong>Double yikes.</strong> And then, once it was released and everyone hated it, it was tinkered with again. Universal had to supply cinemas with a whole new version that wasn\u2019t as horrible as the previous versions. Reader, it was exactly as horrible.</p> <p><strong>Triple yikes.</strong> Exactly. So with such a frantic production schedule, it would be no wonder a few bums almost scraped in under the radar.</p> <p><strong>I have just one more question.</strong> Sure, go ahead.</p> <p><strong>What is a Jellicle?</strong> I sat through the whole thing and I only wish I knew.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cSomeone edited all the butts out of Cats.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cUnfortunately, though, they left all the crap in.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>It arrives in a cardboard box, postmarked Brighton, UK. Black, with maroon pinstripes, the dry-cleaning tag still pinned to the lapel. It\u2019s beautiful material, handmade and still smells good, the traces of smoke and sweat and stage. The pants have no bum, none whatsoever, but the jacket fits surprisingly well on my small frame, slim-fitted. It\u2019s the closest I\u2019ll get to Nick Cave, that\u2019s how I figure it, after imagining him as a character for so many years in my novel Almost a Mirror. I find a black wiry hair trapped in a seam and hide it for safekeeping. When I tell my male friends about the suit, they vie for my attention, insisting they are the perfect fit. I imagine them lined up in a St Kilda alley, thin and lanky, smoking \u2013 like Cinderella hoping to be invited to the ball(room).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/22/nick-caves-stranger-than-kindness-inspiration-pictures-photos-notes-archive\">Nick Cave's inspiration: pictures and notes from his archive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The suit hangs and swings as I drive, and I realise it\u2019s worth more than my car. I\u2019m heading to the home of Andy Griffiths, the world-renowned author of the Storey Treehouse series, where he lives with his partner and co-author Jill. A Nick Cave fanatic, Andy has just purchased the suit for $10,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/11/from-nick-caves-suit-to-iced-vovos-with-kevin-rudd-how-authors-for-fireys-is-funding-bushfire-relief\">in an auction bid for the #AuthorsForFireys appeal </a>\u2013 a donation that I, another Nick Cave fanatic, had facilitated.</p> <p>When I arrive, Andy tries the jacket on too. It fits \u2013 but the suit isn\u2019t for him. He bought it for the skeleton in the studio out the back where he works.</p> <p>I ask why he put in a bid. \u201cFirst and foremost, I was really affected by the fires and also the bravery of the firefighters,\u201d he says. \u201cWe take creative risks as artists but not life-threatening risks. I was so angry at the \u2026 state of play for the last decade. [Scott Morrison] is just so obstinate on this issue. I was filled with rage at this fucking awful government.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"516817390edfd55df031d0741aa64297b12ca6d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/516817390edfd55df031d0741aa64297b12ca6d9/249_124_2775_3908/710.jpg\" alt=\"Andy \u201cGriff\u201d Griffiths performing in Gothic Barnyard at the Crystal Ballroom in the 1980s\" width=\"710\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy \u201cGriff\u201d Griffiths performing in Gothic Farmyard at the Crystal Ballroom in the 1980s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tracey Claire</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like Nick Cave, Andy \u2014 known then by his stage name Griff Griffiths \u2014 was attracted to the post-punk Melbourne music scene in the late 70s and early 80s, and hovered around the Crystal Ballroom: an elegantly wasted venue in St Kilda that hosted bands including the Birthday Party, the Cure, New Order and Go-Betweens.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t old enough to be part of the Ballroom scene and so in my book I inhabit a performative space, exploring the mythology that surrounds Nick Cave and his fellow musicians. Andy was part of it though. He saw his first gig there: Midnight Oil in November, 1979. He remembers because it was the last day of Year 12. \u201cWe sat outside the station just drinking, getting as drunk as we could, so we didn\u2019t have to pay money inside,\u201d he says. At that point the band was \u201cthe best kept secret in the world \u2026 Pure energy coming from the stage. Mind blowing, really exciting.\u201d</p> <p>Andy is good with dates and has a uniquely detailed memory. Partly this is because he\u2019s kept everything from childhood onwards: early stories, song lyrics, band memorabilia and photos, cassettes taped from the radio carefully labelled in a drawer. He is an archivist\u2019s dream. Over lunch with Jill, he lovingly shows me set lists from bands like Snakefinger and Dead Kennedys grabbed at the end of gigs, reads me lyrics from his high school days in first band Unborn Babies, and shows photos and hand-drawn flyers from when he rocked up to the Ballroom with a later band, Gothic Farmyard.</p> <p>On stage he was the lead singer; he couldn\u2019t play an instrument, but was renowned for his manic energy and beating himself up, colliding, bashing his head blood-raw. \u201cWe were committed to making every show an event,\u201d he says. \u201cThe end goal was to get a gig at the Ballroom. That was you already successful beyond your wildest dreams.\u201d</p> <p>He loved the venue because it welcomed all comers. \u201cAnd the beauty of it for someone like me ... was that any band that got on stage at the Ballroom would have an audience prepared to take us seriously and try to figure us out,\u201d he says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t heckling or anything.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7db08e0c006c122a6f21d8cdd19c68159a361fd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7db08e0c006c122a6f21d8cdd19c68159a361fd9/0_66_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young, shirtless Nick Cave sings into a microphone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Cave performs with the Birthday Party at the Crystal Ballroom, Melbourne, 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Prentice</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4477078d3adf23fe1978e245441e75fb18eae148\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4477078d3adf23fe1978e245441e75fb18eae148/0_36_3024_2255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Griffiths, pictured here with Nick Cave\u2019s old suit dressed on a skeleton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"746\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Primal energy came out\u2019 of the Birthday Party, says Andy Griffiths, pictured here with Nick Cave\u2019s old suit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by Kirsten Krauth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andy was always drawn to Nick Cave and Rowland S Howard while hanging around the Ballroom; he talks passionately about the Birthday Party gigs, especially one at the Astor. \u201cIf anyone asked me what\u2019s the best gig you\u2019ve ever been to? I\u2019ll just go straight back to 1982,\u201d he says. \u201cNick, Tracey Pew in the background with his 10-gallon hat and stomping around, and Rowland\u2019s cigarette hanging out his mouth, making music.\u201d Returning from London, they \u201chad kind of transformed from this Melbourne band to a world band and they were full of dark energy and anger,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were just at the height of their powers \u2026 full throttle. Opened the gates of hell, and primal energy came out.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clear the influence of the place has been profound, the sensibility of the time \u2013 the chaos, and wild energy \u2013 infusing all of Andy\u2019s writing. Nick Cave was a particular inspiration. \u201cHe\u2019s been lucky to do his own thing. And that\u2019s probably what I value the most about him as an artist,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I realised when I started writing \u2018seriously\u2019 that I wasn\u2019t like other writers \u2026 I just couldn\u2019t write a sensible novel. In the end, everything I did was derailed by the anarchic Devo punk rock energy.\u201d</p> <p>While Andy Griffiths is now a global phenomenon for the wildly popular and hilarious books he writes with illustrator Terry Denton, it took years before his work reached an audience. He has never seen himself as a children\u2019s writer, either: his early Bad Book series caught many (including A Current Affair), off guard with its gut-churningly funny depictions of children in peril, including a mother who encourages her child to run across a busy road (so many of the punchlines end in gratuitously ridiculous deaths).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5ff4b76deedc2c1236fcd40ded9115e2c01dfd41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ff4b76deedc2c1236fcd40ded9115e2c01dfd41/0_1064_3597_4437/811.jpg\" alt=\"If the suit fits: Kirsten Krauth, author of Almost a Mirror, wearing Nick Cave\u2019s suit\" width=\"811\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If the suit fits: Kirsten Krauth, author of Almost a Mirror, wearing Nick Cave\u2019s suit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penny Ryan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Early on, he made a conscious decision to stick with his own offbeat style \u2013 \u201creally funny, off the wall, strange stuff\u201d \u2013 even if it meant not having a recognisable career. Artists like Nick Cave \u201cdon\u2019t bend over backwards to get to their audience,\u201d he says. \u201cThey go, \u2018This is what I do, and this is what I <em>have</em> to do,\u2019 \u2014 and then they do it. And I loved the courage of that. So, I thought, \u2018Well, maybe I\u2019m an outsider artist in my heart.\u2019 I probably am, dammit.\u201d</p> <p>In retrospect, embracing the anarchic and punk spirit was the perfect decision. \u201c[Kids] are a very critical audience, they can spot a try-hard from a million miles away,\u201d he says. \u201cThey realised I wasn\u2019t trying to be funny; I just was doing what I do, and they could come to me. And so, I think they just heard the voice, the pure energy at that point, because I wasn\u2019t trying to make them like me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/apr/22/andy-griffiths-terry-denton-storey-treehouse-childrens-books\">Andy Griffiths and Terry Denton: 'We had to draw the entire world back into existence'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After lunch, Andy leads me to his studio where he takes time to dress the skeleton, carefully adjusting the arms, while pointing out Ballroom-era memorabilia and music that lines the walls.

One model run by the University of Washington School of Medicine predicts the virus will kill 60,000 people in the US over the next four months. Virus response coo-ordinator Dr Deboarh Birx said: \u201cWhat has been so remarkable to those of us who have been in the science field for so long is how important behavioural change is and how amazing Americans are in adapting.\u201d At the same briefing, Donald Trump said he would like more information on reports US intelligence officials had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/global-coronavirus-cases-near-15m-as-fresh-who-row-erupts\">warned his office as far back as November</a> that a coronavirus was spreading through China\u2019s Hubei region.</p> <h2><strong>Oxfam warns half a billion people could be pushed into poverty</strong></h2> <p>More than half a billion more people could be pushed into poverty unless urgent action is taken to bail out poor countries affected by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, Oxfam has warned.</p> <h2><strong>China reports a slight increase in new cases</strong></h2> <p>China reported 63 new cases on Wednesday, up from 62 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 81,865. While infections have fallen from their peak in February after China locked down several cities and imposed strict travel restrictions, authorities have called for continued vigilance amid fears of a second wave of infections.</p> <h2><strong>Australia records its lowest number of new cases in three weeks</strong></h2> <p>Australia recorded just 96 new cases on Wednesday. This is the first time in three weeks the country has seen the number of new daily cases fall below 100 and the health minister said it was a hopeful sign that measures that had been introduced were helping to flatten the curve. Australia has just over 6,000 cases and 51 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>US strategic national stockpile nearly out of PPE</strong></h2> <p>America\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile is nearly out of the N95 respirators, surgical masks, face, shields, gowns and other medical supplies desperately needed to protect front-line medical workers treating coronavirus patients. This came after the US suffered its highest daily death toll from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> on Tuesday, with 1,858 people succumbing to the disease.</p> <h2><strong>Boris Johnson\u2019s condition improves</strong></h2> <p>The UK prime minister remains in intensive care receiving treatment for Covid-19, but on Wednesday, the chancellor Rishi Sunak reported Johnson was sitting up in bed and \u201cengaging positively\u201d with the clinical team.</p> <h2><strong>Virus fears prompt curb on military operations in Yemen</strong></h2> <p>Concerns about a potential outbreak in Yemen, where no cases have been reported so far, are partly behind a decision to call a halt to the military action there that has left tens of thousands died and spread hunger and disease, a Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki has said.</p>",

Veterans of Antarctic exploration had warned me that this location would give me my first taste of how rapidly the region is warming. On the slopes around the bay, there was more bare rock than snow, while the stony beach was so free of ice that it could almost have been Brighton, were it not for the penguins. This was to be expected. Temperatures on the peninsula \u2013 the finger of land that points up from Antarctica towards South America \u2013 have <a href=\"https://discoveringantarctica.org.uk/challenges/sustainability/impacts-of-climate-change/\">risen by about 3C</a> in the past 70 years, one of the fastest increases in the world. <br></p> \n<p>What was more surprising was the number of other vessels bobbing in the bay.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cPeople think Antarctica is isolated. That is a myth,\u201d Marcelo Leppe, the director of Chile\u2019s National Antarctic Institute, had told me when I visited him the previous day in Punta Arenas, the capital of Chile\u2019s southernmost region. \u201cThe changes are so great it is hard to put them in words,\u201d he said. Since Leppe started studying the region in 2002, he had seen more and more visitors, and less and less snow. \u201cI have seen glaciers retreat by 100 metres, and parts of the land become so green that it almost looks like a golf course,\u201d he said. </p> \n<p>In December, monitoring equipment at the Chilean research base on King George Island detected something that worried Leppe even more: black carbon in the air, which came from the Australian bushfires more than 6,200 miles away. Even in tiny quantities, this soot darkens the white landscape, reducing its capacity to reflect sunlight and making it melt faster. \u201cAt least future geologists will find this black layer helpful to identify the year 2020 in their ice cores,\u201d he joked darkly.<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6d07815a4bc36bddb1ed1d963fc30259a6de04e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6d07815a4bc36bddb1ed1d963fc30259a6de04e/0_0_8256_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bridge of the Arctic Sunrise in Discovery Bay, Antarctica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bridge of the Arctic Sunrise in Discovery Bay, Antarctica.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There will be other clues for the geologists of the future.

If it all melts, sea levels will rise by more than 50 metres. Long before then, most of human civilisation will have been submerged.

Before the coronavirus pandemic, shipbuilders had been seeing<a href=\"https://thebarentsobserver.com/en/travel/2018/05/arctic-cruise-ship-boom\"> strong demand</a> for polar- and ice-class cruise liners.

To ensure that tourists feel like they are journeying through a nearly deserted wilderness, tour operators coordinate schedules and instruct captains to use radar to avoid visual sightings of other vessels. (As our polar guide, Tom Foreman, noted, the impression of solitude would be \u201csomewhat ruined if you see 500 people floating past on another big lump of steel\u201d.) </p> \n<p>If there is something absurd about tour companies expending so much energy on crafting the illusion of solitude, it does at least help avoid overcrowding. Biosecurity is no small matter in the Antarctic. Boots need to be sterilised before setting foot on land to avoid spreading seeds, fungi or viruses. Everyone must keep their distance from wildlife \u2013 five metres from a penguin, 10 metres from a seal, 50 metres from a whale, unless they come to you. And no littering. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4597d553bc45b45e7bde06754fdc303a4b5edcc9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4597d553bc45b45e7bde06754fdc303a4b5edcc9/0_0_6048_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists visit Orne Harbour in South Shetlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists visit Orne Harbour in South Shetlands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Over the past five years, Astrid Zafiro has watched the traffic to Antarctica grow. As chief of Argentina\u2019s Admiral Brown base in Paradise Harbour, about 250 miles south-west of King George Island, she considers the rise in tourism as visible as the changes wrought by a warming climate. After guiding us through a penguin colony and up a slope behind the small research facility, Zafiro pointed across the bay at a newly emerged nunatak \u2013 a bare mountain peak sticking out above the ice. Near the nunatak, a massive cruise liner was unloading Chinese tourists in rubber boats. In the distance, we heard a crash as another slab of fractured glacier crashed into the water. \u201cIt is all happening right in front of us \u2013 the bay full of tourists, the ice breaking,\u201d Zafiro said wistfully. </p> \n<p>Zafiro described a feedback loop that does not appear in climate models: the more the Antarctic is threatened by the climate crisis, the more tourists want to visit before it melts away. That means more cruise (and air) miles to the end of the Earth, more carbon dioxide and more global heating. Last-chance-to-see tourism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. <br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"697e7f51d28b9c7b5d8878b215d0f2ae19844518\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/697e7f51d28b9c7b5d8878b215d0f2ae19844518/0_0_5926_3943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An iceberg and the Hurtigruten hybrid expedition cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen on Half Moon island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cruise ship MS Roald Amundsen.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On board the Sunrise, a young German member of the ship\u2019s crew, Carola Rackete, told me about \u201csolastalgia\u201d, the term coined by the philosopher Glenn Albrecht to describe the pre-emptive sense of loss that people feel when witnessing natural beauty in this era of environmental destruction. \u201cYou enjoy it knowing that next time it will be changed beyond recognition. There is always the anticipation of loss, which makes me feels sad,\u201d Rackete said. Solastalgia is hard to escape in the Antarctic.</p> \n<p>We passed three days in Paradise Harbour, going out daily in the boats to gather samples and look and listen for whales, seals and penguins. On our final night, I was reluctant to sleep, knowing this was the last chance to take it all in. As the sun\u2019s pale afterglow faded behind the mountains, the dusky bay was as smooth as polished chrome. Time itself seemed to have frozen and I began to understand why so many of the early Antarctic explorers felt close to God here. <br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89b89eeacdf4e165fecc1e6e22831df15b065e61\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89b89eeacdf4e165fecc1e6e22831df15b065e61/0_0_4729_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists visit Yankee Harbour in the South Shetlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists in the South Shetlands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez/AFP via Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After a few moments, my transcendental musings were interrupted by the sound of KC and the Sunshine Band echoing out from a huge cruise liner anchored 100 or so metres away. \u201cThat\u2019s the way, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh\u201d continued to ring in my ears as I made my way to the cabin.<br></p> \n<h2>Chapter 4: Low Island</h2> \n<h2>\u2018Something is broken in this ecosystem\u2019<br></h2> \n<p>There are still some Antarctic islands that have rarely, if ever, been visited by humans. They are deemed too small, too plain, too remote or too storm-battered. Our destination the following day, Low, seemed to tick all of these boxes. This south-westernmost island in the South Shetlands, nine miles long by five miles wide, takes the full brunt of the winds and waves that spin around the Shrieking Sixties, the stretch of latitude between 60 and 70 degrees south, which is notorious for howling gales. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d4069ce8c7d123ae36614e6d93b300759cea5b8a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4069ce8c7d123ae36614e6d93b300759cea5b8a/0_0_4501_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A chinstrap penguin colony on Low Island.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A chinstrap penguin colony on Low Island.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bb00bb3d-c012-4fca-8e56-103e2671ef5b\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Low was once home to what was believed to be the biggest and most raucous colony of chinstrap penguins on the continent. Prior to our visit, the last survey of this island had been carried out in 1987, and since then chinstrap populations in other parts of Antarctica had suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/antarctic-alarm-collapse-chinstrap-penguin-numbers-global-heating\">an alarming 50% decline</a>. We wanted to find out whether that trend held true here. On shore, we joined a team of US biologists from Stony Brook University who had been island-hopping on the other Greenpeace ship, the Esperanza. Their task was simple but enormous: counting penguins. Hundreds of thousands of them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"38bd630e-c64a-405a-8e8b-87b667a6f7a6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wVgXtM1FgfY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Avian census-taking starts with satellites. Penguin guano is the only excrement that can be seen from space. Over generations, the projectile poo from tens of thousands of krill-eating birds dyes rock a delicate pink. This makes colony spotting easy, but for more precise calculations, the team of four scientists use drones and artificial intelligence to count nests. Then, armed with handheld clickers, they head out to sample areas to double-check their findings. Each cluster is counted three times in a row to ensure wandering penguins do not evade the census. One member of the team, Noah Strycker, described the process to me as \u201ca Zen-like activity\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2049da4017d28371a25a2443c9263ef33190e67b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2049da4017d28371a25a2443c9263ef33190e67b/0_0_4499_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinstrap penguins diving into the ocean.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinstrap penguins diving into the ocean.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chinstraps have a reputation for being one of the noisiest and most aggressive of the penguin species. During courtship, the birds chat up potential mates with loud displays. After separating to gather food, they reunite with ecstatic greetings. If nests are threatened by predators, parents shriek protectively. Scientists have discovered that birds can filter out the background cacophony and focus in on the call of their own family members (the so-called \u201ccocktail party effect\u201d). But this skill becomes less essential as the chinstrap population diminishes, and the boisterous hubbub of the colony grows quieter. </p> \n<p>As we wandered from nest from nest to nest, totting up chicks, the loudest noise was from pubescent chicks nagging their parents for more regurgitated krill, the tiny shrimplike creature that constitutes the chinstrap\u2019s only meal. Scientists believe this dependence on a single food source is one reason why chinstraps populations are plummeting. Krill graze on organisms that grow under the sea ice, so when the ice melts, the krill disappear in turn. By contrast, another species of penguin, the gentoo, is thriving, because it is far less fussy about its diet. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff9931945a439b2592d4893449e4948e692dce63\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff9931945a439b2592d4893449e4948e692dce63/0_0_2902_1934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinstrap penguins mate on Low.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinstrap penguins mate on Low.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The population final count is not yet complete, but it is already clear that the chinstraps on Low are just as vulnerable as elsewhere. And it is not only the penguins that are in danger. \u201cSuch a big decline over a short time suggests something is broken in the Southern Ocean ecosystem,\u201d said Strycker.</p> \n<p>It was a sobering thought to sleep on Low amid that shifting climate. Our group may well have been the first in history to camp on the island. The polar guides had to tie the tents to boulders because there was no soil to bang pegs into. The tents withstood a cold night of wind and rain, but there was nothing anyone could do about the smell and the chatter. In the damp darkness, the penguins hunkered down, although they never fell completely silent. Thirty years ago, the noise would have been louder. The quietening of Low was far less soothing than it sounded.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cd07e3d6fb3a4a92a53a483084585470711fc18\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cd07e3d6fb3a4a92a53a483084585470711fc18/0_0_4499_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Chinstrap penguin colony on Elephant Island, with the Esperanza in the background.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Chinstrap penguin colony on Elephant Island, with the Greenpeace ship Esperanza in the background.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Chapter 5: Hannah Point and Discovery Bay</h2> \n<h2>The continent\u2019s greatest comeback<br></h2> \n<p>Over the next two days, the weather took a turn for the worse. With a storm brewing out at sea, we sheltered in Discovery Bay, an indent on the northern coast of Greenwich Island, waiting for a break in the clouds that refused to come. </p> \n<p>In the sea, the only signs of life were strings of <a href=\"https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/polar-research/polar-life/the-watery-world-of-salps/\">salps</a> \u2013 tiny tubes of transparent jelly with pink dots for bellies. As waters warm, these little zooplankton are thriving at the expense of krill, which is bad news for the ocean ecosystem and the climate because they are a lot less nutritious for predators, and they do not appear to play such a major role in helping the ocean absorb carbon dioxide. (Krill are better at this because they graze more on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/07/oceans-demise-the-end-of-the-arctic-as-we-know-it\">phytoplankton</a> \u2013 tiny, plantlike organisms that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.) The change is another consequence of the ominous sound we had heard on the hydrophone several days earlier. As the Antarctic melt gets louder, there will be fewer chinstraps and krill, more gentoos and salps, less oxygen, more acid, and, of course, less land ice and more sea water.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"034f5db2c2262e6f1c5a290bdab2ea61f6eaed43\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/034f5db2c2262e6f1c5a290bdab2ea61f6eaed43/0_0_6605_4403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery Bay In Antarctica.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Discovery Bay in Antarctica.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>An increasing number of scientists believe the melting of West Antarctica is so far beyond natural fluctuations that it has become irreversible. In February, a first examination of the underside of the vast Thwaites glacier \u2013 which covers an area similar to that of the UK \u2013 showed extensive erosion by warm water. This and the nearby Pine Island glacier are now losing ice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/16/thinning-of-antarctic-ice-sheets-spreading-inland-rapidly-study\">five times faster</a> than in the 90s. A collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet is now a serious concern. </p> \n<p>It might be tempting to think humanity can do nothing right, but the short history of human interaction with the Antarctic suggests we can at least learn from our mistakes and reverse some of the damage we have caused.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"881e807cf199a5b50b86cb1dca4d7c9b260b2d51\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881e807cf199a5b50b86cb1dca4d7c9b260b2d51/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elephant seals near a gentoo penguin colony on Livingston Island, South Shetlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephant seals near a gentoo penguin colony on Livingston Island, South Shetlands.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The stratosphere high above our heads is proof of that. In the 1980s, the world was horrified to discover that certain chemicals had thinned the ozone layer and opened up a vast hole above the Antarctic that was raising cancer risks and disrupting weather systems and ocean currents. Since then, however, international efforts to reduce CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals have eased that threat. This year, scientists were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/global-efforts-on-ozone-help-reverse-southern-jet-stream-damage\">relieved to find</a> that disruption of southern wind systems has paused and may even be returning towards its natural state. There is a risk that a closed ozone hole will <a href=\"https://www.popsci.com/environment/article/2009-12/study-finds-ozone-hole-repair-contributes-global-warming-sea-level-rise/\">trap more heat</a>, but the initial damage is on its way to being repaired. This is also true of wildlife in the region. </p> \n<p>For 4.5bn years, not a single whisper was carried on the winds or the waves of this region. It was only 200 years ago, years after the invention of the steam engine and electric lighting, that humans first caught sight of Antarctica. The explorers who first mapped the continent were lauded as heroes, but carnage often followed in their wake. James Clark Ross \u2013 the British naval officer who discovered the sea now named after him \u2013 knew exactly what would happen to the seals and penguins he saw on his voyage. \u201cHitherto beyond the reach of their persecutors, they have enjoyed a life of tranquillity and security, but will now, no doubt, be made to contribute to the wealth of our country,\u201d he wrote in his diary in 1841.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3292db9d66f5835659005418f94142a3b1f36f49\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3292db9d66f5835659005418f94142a3b1f36f49/0_0_4959_3306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Whale identification work in Paradise Harbour.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whale identification work in Paradise Harbour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Over the next 50 years, Britain and the US killed more than a million fur seals for their skins, and enough elephant seals to produce 20,000 tonnes of blubber for oil lamps, cosmetics and soap. In bay after bay, and on island after island, animal populations were almost wiped out. Penguins were boiled down for oil in giant digesters that could squeeze the fat out of 2,000 birds per day. When legal protection for penguins was finally put into place in the early 20th century, it prompted a surge in whaling to make up the shortfall in animal oil and fats. Several species of whale, including the blue, right and sei were hunted close to extinction. Others, such as the humpback, suffered an estimated 90% decline. </p> \n<p>Like seals and penguins before them, whales appeared to be doomed. But unfashionable regulations and often unpopular campaigning have made a difference. Steady increases since the moratorium on commercial whaling that came into effect in 1985 have taken southern hemisphere humpbacks close to their pre-exploitation population of about 80,000, according to the <a href=\"https://iwc.int/status\">International Whaling Commission</a>. The scientists on the Greenpeace ships are helping to track whale populations by collecting vast amounts of acoustic data, such as the communal chatter of a pod of orcas and the thunderous clicks of the sperm whale, the loudest natural sound made by any creature on Earth. Thrillingly, blue whales are also making a comeback. Last month, a British Antarctic Survey mission to South Georgia <a href=\"https://www.bas.ac.uk/blogpost/blue-whale-comeback-at-south-georgia/\">recorded 55</a> in just three weeks. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eaf31c1d1a04fdbff8ebd2e6390835a27031945\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eaf31c1d1a04fdbff8ebd2e6390835a27031945/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Humpback whales approach Cuverville Island during whale identification and hydrophone work in the Errera Channel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Humpback whales.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbie Trayler-Smith/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For campaigners, the recovery of whales is a much-needed reminder that international cooperation can be effective, protections can work, and our species is capable of undoing the damage we inflicted on the natural world.

I know a thing or two about that,\u201d he said. \u201cA low point has passed but the condition is still fragile. It needs more time or it could slip back again.\u201d </p> \n<p>After the storm finally abated, the Sunrise sailed back to King George Island, from where I would have to take a plane home. The closer we came to the airport, the more cruise ships and scientific vessels we saw. In the 10 days since we had left, summer had taken a visible toll. Hillsides that had been covered in snow were now bare, black rock.

It was thrilling. Did the whale realise there was an obstacle in its path? Our small boat would surely be upturned in a collision with a creature that size. </p> \n<p>The whale had something else in mind. After passing just below the surface a few metres from the front of our craft, it turned parallel and so close we could almost reach out and touch it. Then the whale tilted its giant head out of the water and yawned cavernously, revealing a bed-sized tongue and the bristled carpet of its baleen plates. Seconds later, with a flick of its knobbled pectoral fin, it was under the water again. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F03%2F27%2FC6.jpg&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F03%2F27%2FC6__abr900.mp4\" data-alt=\"\u2014\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F03%2F27%2FC6.jpg&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2020%2F03%2F27%2FC6__abr900.mp4\">\u2014</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Mouths agape, beaming rapturously, the five of us looked at each other to confirm we had not imagined what we had seen.

In Heinsberg, his team of coronavirus detectives could find scant evidence of the virus being transmitted via the surfaces of door handles, smart phones or other objects.</p> \n<p>Early theories that the virus at the carnival party in Gangelt could have been transmitted through the dishwater in the kitchen turned out to be a red herring: most guests drank their beer from bottles.</p> \n<p>Instead, he said, transmission took place at \u201cevents where people spent a length of time in each others\u2019 close company\u201d, such as apres ski parties in the Austrian resort of Ischgl, the Trompete nightclub in Berlin and a football match in northern Italy.</p> \n<p>\u201cMass events are a perfect opportunity for the virus, as people meet total strangers,\u201d said Niki Popper, a mathematician at Vienna\u2019s Technical University whose team has been developing a simulation that could help governments predict the development of the pandemic more accurately.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Instead of merely multiplying the number of daily cases by a certain factor, Popper\u2019s example tries to account for what he calls the starting point of \u201clocal epidemic networks\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you have 100 or 200 people spend enough time in a room with a person carrying the virus, then for example 20 might walk out with the new infection and, after a few days\u2019 incubation time, pass it on to their families and workmates, let\u2019s assume 10 more people each. Within a few days, the virus can thus multiply 200 times with only one new incident - and then continue.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018We shared cups\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>Large parties played a key role in the pandemic\u2019s rapid expansion not just in central Europe, but also in the US and Australia. New York may now be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-center-us-coronavirus\">centre</a> of the US outbreak, but the traditional festivities around Mardi Gras is thought to have been a catalyst for a large outbreak in New Orleans.</p> \n<p>On 25 February the entire city, with almost 400,000 residents, and an estimated tourist crowd of 1.4 million people from all over the world were swallowed up in a tide of music, floats, extravagant costumes, cocktails and revelry for the climax of carnival.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91aa7a187b00e473c497628091f28db6dd64eeb1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91aa7a187b00e473c497628091f28db6dd64eeb1/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People in The French Quarter on the final day of Mardi Gras in New Orleans on 25 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in The French Quarter on the final day of Mardi Gras in New Orleans on 25 February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Anderson/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As is traditional in this Louisiana city on the Mississippi, gatherings and parades had begun weeks before, from 6 January onwards. Many people flung the doors of their houses open and crammed in friends, family, neighbours, strangers \u2013 all jostling, dancing, hugging, eating and drinking together.</p> \n<p>There were no social restrictions during carnival. Only weeks later, on 20 March did the mayor of New Orleans issue a stay-at-home order for the city, with Louisiana ordering statewide restrictions two days later, closing schools and all non-essential businesses.</p> \n<p>The first death in the city occurred on 13 March, and by 22 March Louisiana had 837 cases, of which 70% were clustered in New Orleans. On 1 April the death toll in the state reached 273.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p> \u201cMardi Gras was the perfect storm, it provided the perfect conditions for the spread of this virus,\u201d said Rebekah Gee, head of Louisiana State University\u2019s healthcare services division.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe shared cups. We shared each other\u2019s space in the crowds. People were in close contact catching [strings of] beads. It is now clear that people also caught coronavirus,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p> For health authorities that were still trying to track and contain individual infections at this stage of the pandemic, party clusters represented a particular challenge since revellers would often travel from and return to other regions, other countries or even other continents.</p> \n<p>In Australia, for example, at least 30 people including backpackers became infected after attending a crowded dance party at Bondi Beach\u2019s Bucket List pavilion on 15 March. </p> \n<p>The party took place the night before restrictions came into force on gatherings of more than 500 people, during a weekend of mixed messages from the authorities. Australia\u2019s prime minister was urging people not to gather in large numbers, but also saying he would go to a football game.</p> \n<p>Many of those who attended the \u201cBack to Boogie Wonderland \u2013 Tropicana\u201d event, which told people to release their \u201cinner Caribbean dancer\u201d, later retired to local backpacker hostels with dorm rooms and shared facilities.</p> \n<p>The Waverley council area, which encompasses Bondi and its backpacker community, has now become a hotspot for Covid-19, with many of its 140 cases linked to bars, clubs and restaurants, including the Bucket List.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf9799a8171c85575c60eb6e766508660d99b86c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf9799a8171c85575c60eb6e766508660d99b86c/0_107_3200_1921/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A Bondi resident leaves a Covid-19 testing clinic near Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Bondi resident leaves a Covid-19 testing clinic near Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Lewins/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Pray-ins and funerals</h2> \n<p>In many countries, partygoers and organisers have found themselves on the receiving end of a backlash. In Australia, the Bucket List\u2019s Facebook page is full of livid comments condemning \u201cidiots\u201d who gathered to party. In Germany, cars with Heinsberg number plates have had their windows smashed and have been jeered as \u201ccorona spreaders\u201d.</p> \n<p>But the novel coronavirus did not require social gatherings to have an overtly hedonistic character to flourish. In the week of 17 to 21 February, around 2,500 worshippers gathered at the Porte Ouverte Christian church in the Bourtzwiller district of Mulhouse, in Alsace, eastern France, for one of the most anticipated events in the evangelical calendar.</p> \n<p>They came from far and wide including from France\u2019s overseas territories and Corsica, for a week of fasting and prayer \u2013 held annually for the last 25 years.</p> \n<p>\u201cDuring the five days, the worshippers greeted each other, pecked each other on the cheeks, and held hands, sometimes while praying during the services,\u201d Nathalie Schnoebelen, spokesperson for the church said afterwards.</p> \n<p>At the time, nobody thought more of it; it would be almost a month before France went into a national lockdown. A small cluster of coronavirus cases had broken out in the unfortunately named Contamines ski resort in the Alps, but most coronavirus cases were still confined to China.</p> \n<p>\u201cContrary to what certain politicians have said, we didn\u2019t ignore the basic rules because at the time there were not any,\u201d Schnoebelen said.</p> \n<p>It was only after the congregation at the Porte Ouverte had dispersed and several worshippers tested positive for the coronavirus that concerns were raised. Among those who tested positive were the church\u2019s main pastor, Samuel Peterschmitt (son of Jean Peterschmitt, who founded the <a href=\"https://porte-ouverte.com/\">Porte Ouverte </a>church in 1966).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In total 18 people from the Peterschmitt family tested positive for Covid-19. Samuel Peterschmitt\u2019s son Jonathan admitted that worshippers had been in close confines for a week in \u201cconditions relatively ideal if a virus wants to develop\u201d.</p> \n<p>By the time it had been identified as a cradle for the virus, church worshippers had unwittingly passed it on to others. A nurse who had been at the Porte Ouverte is believed to have originated a cluster that contaminated 250 colleagues at Strasbourg University hospital, where she worked.</p> \n<p>Two retired worshippers returned to their home in the Ajaccio region of the Mediterranean island of Corsica. There are now at least 263 positive cases and 21 deaths on the island.</p> \n<p>A delegation of five church-goers from French Guiana, led by their evangelical pastor Gilles Sax, returned to the French overseas territory on the north-east coast of South America, on 25 February. Sax said he felt ill and was \u201ctrembling like a leaf\u201d as soon as he returned..</p> \n<p>Other worshippers returned to cities and towns across France - Orl\u00e9ans, Besan\u00e7on, Saint-L\u00f4, Belfort, Dijon, M\u00e2con, Brian\u00e7on, Paris.

On 3 March, hundreds of people gathered to pay their last respects at the funeral in San Marco in Lamis, a small city of 13,000. The 74-year-old man being buried had died after complications of what seemed to be a case of seasonal flu.</p> \n<p>Until that day, there had been seven cases of coronavirus infection in Puglia, the heel of Italy\u2019s boot. The photos of patients in the red zones of northern Italy, and the first fatalities in Lombardy, seemed unimaginable, much like the national lockdown that was extended a few days later across the entire country.</p> \n<p>However, soon after the funeral, the man\u2019s wife, who had just begun mourning the death of her husband, received a call informing her that her husband had tested positive for coronavirus.</p> \n<p>According to Ludovico Vaccaro, head of the public prosecutor\u2019s office in Foggia, \u201ca postmortem revealed the man was infected with Covid-19, but the result came out only after his body was released to the family for the funeral. They should have waited for the result of the test before handing over the man\u2019s body.\u201d</p> \n<p>Authorities said that, a few days earlier, the man had travelled to Cremona, in the north of Italy, to visit his daughter. Upon returning, he began to experience flu-like symptoms.</p> \n<p>According to doctors and investigators, the man had infected his daughter and wife before he died. At the funeral, they then came into contact with dozens of relatives and friends who gave their condolences to the family with handshakes and hugs, opening a gateway for one of the first clusters in southern Italy. As a result, 110 people were quarantined, dozens of whom tested positive for coronavirus. Two have died.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor\u2019s office in Foggia has begun an investigation into what the governor of Puglia has called a \u201ccatastrophic error\u201d. Behind one of the most dramatic cases of the virus\u2019s spread is human error: if doctors had waited for the test results before handing over the body to family members, perhaps dozens of people could have avoided infection.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>A loop not a curve</strong></h2> \n<p>Thinking of the coronavirus pandemic as a process that can speed up dramatically through human clusters also affects the considerations of policymakers who are plotting a route out of the current lockdown. When governments start to relax the current social distancing measures, can they also afford to allow large social, cultural or religious gatherings to go ahead?</p> \n<p>\u201cThe image of the Covid-19 epidemic as a curve has taken hold in the collective imagination, but my fear is that we are actually dealing with a loop,\u201d said mathematician Popper. \u201cAs soon as restrictions are loosened, there could be new clusters that allow the spread to accelerate again.\u201d</p> \n<p>The story of the pandemic in Vietnam serves as a cautionary tale.</p> \n<p>The south-east Asian country recorded its first cases of coronavirus on 23 January, a development that prompted swift action from officials. Vietnam kept many schools closed following the traditional lunar new year holiday late in January, and banned flights to and from China on 1 February. It also became the first country outside China to introduce a mass quarantine, when, on 12 February, officials isolated villages about 25 miles (40km) from Hanoi that were home to 10,000 people.</p> \n<p>Vietnam had detected no new cases for three weeks when a flight from London touched down at Hanoi\u2019s Noi Bai international airport on 2 March. Among the hundreds of passengers onboard was a 27-year-old Vietnamese woman returning after a trip to attend exclusive fashion week events in Europe. Along with her sister, she had sat among guests at a Gucci show in Milan, and watched Yves Saint Laurent in Paris, documenting her travels on Instagram.</p> \n<p>The woman later told the New York Times that she had flown to Milan on 18 February and that, at the time, \u201cno one was talking about the virus\u201d. She travelled to Paris on 25 February, she added, and said she felt fine when she flew home that week.</p> \n<p>Days after arriving back in Vietnam, she developed a cough and tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the country\u2019s \u201cpatient 17\u201d. As of 7 April, Vietnam has 245 confirmed infections. The effort to trace and contain the virus has to start all over again.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 April 2020. An earlier version said it was the Champions League football match between Bergamo and Valencia on 19 February that was described as a \u201cbiological bomb\u201d.

Some airlines are already cutting costs by standing down staff and halting commercial services.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Aviation emissions are not attributed to any country\u2019s tally \u2013 a blind spot in commitments on climate change</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Attaching conditions to government support rather than writing the industry a blank cheque is important. Any rescue plan should be conditional on those airlines providing critical transport services, including repatriation and freight. This could mean acting as an operator of last resort \u2013 akin to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lner-to-run-east-coast-mainline-services-from-london-to-yorkshire-the-north-east-and-scotland\">directly operated railways, such as LNER</a>. Sunak has been clear that any deal would be \u201cstructured to protect tax interests\u201d, but partially nationalising a few key airlines would make more strategic sense. With a stake in the industry, the government will be able to directly steer aviation policy and reconsider how it fits into long-term transport strategy.</p> <p>Even under a high or low fuel-saving scenario, emissions by the aviation sector are set to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/jul/19/carbon-calculator-how-taking-one-flight-emits-as-much-as-many-people-do-in-a-year\">double or triple by 2050</a>. In recent years we have seen a boost in air travel by an average of between <a href=\"http://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/publications/2013%2009%20Your%20Guide%20to%20ICAO_final.pdf\">4% and 5%</a> a year. By 2050, aviation was forecast to account for <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/569964/IPOL_STU(2015)569964_EN.pdf\">almost a quarter</a> of emissions worldwide and be the <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Letter-from-Lord-Deben-to-Grant-Shapps-IAS.pdf\">most polluting sector</a> in the UK. Air travel is also a sector that predominantly caters to a wealthier demographic. The richest 10% account for 60% of all flights purchased. And it is worth remembering that aviation emissions are not attributed to any country\u2019s tally \u2013 a blind spot in international commitments on climate change. Public oversight of the industry makes all the more sense given recent claims that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/airlines-lobby-to-rewrite-carbon-deal-due-to-coronavirus\">airlines are trying to \u201cdodge\u201d their climate obligations</a> in light of the current crisis.</p> <p>With a stake in the airlines, the government could directly oversee a policy of reducing air travel, which would be part of a wider low-carbon transport strategy. Applying pricing tools such as a frequent flyer penalty, carbon emissions-based tax or airport user surcharge would discourage air travel. At the same time, government should invest in alternatives such as rail and bus services \u2013 including sleeper trains and coaches for long-distance travel and also telecommunications infrastructure to enable widespread working away from the office. The personal cost to airline and airport staff should not be dismissed. New investment in more sustainable transport services and infrastructure will create new jobs, including in customer service, logistics and engineering. The government could provide targeted training so airline and airport staff can acquire different work within the transport sector.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/03/how-is-the-coronavirus-affecting-global-air-traffic\">How is the coronavirus affecting global air traffic?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From consumer\u2019s point of view, the current interruption of global air travel is also an opportunity to shape future travel behaviours.

After the shutdown eased, the country\u2019s economic woes would also dissuade many from having children, Spoonley said.</p> <p>Sexual health specialists were also not anticipating a baby boom, but warned some contraceptives were difficult to access in New Zealand during the lockdown.</p> <p>A global condom shortage is also looming because of factory shutdowns due to the virus, leading the United Nations to warn of \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences; including unplanned pregnancies and STDs.</p> <p>Restrictions on the operations of Malaysian contraceptive giant Karex, which makes one in every five condoms globally, means the firm expected to produce 200m fewer condoms than usual from mid-March to mid-April.</p> <p>New Zealand\u2019s Family Planning organisation had conducted hundreds of phone consultations each week, most of them requests for oral contraceptives which were running dangerously low in New Zealand\u2019s pharmacies, said Beth Messenger, a spokesperson.</p> <p>\u201cSome of the pills were limited because there was a non Covid-19-related manufacturing issue,\u201d she said, adding that others had not been stocked in large quantities. \u201cIn New Zealand, we\u2019re about as far away from anywhere as you can get, which from a Covid-19 perspective is probably a good thing but it means it\u2019s difficult to bring essential medications in.\u201d</p> <p>Due to the lockdown rules, Family Planning could not conduct in-person appointments, so clients were missing out on insertion or removal of IUDs or contraceptive implants or tests for sexually transmitted diseases. However, she said that because those complying with the lockdown rules could only have sex with those already in their homes, \u201ctheoretically STI transmission should decrease.\u201d</p> <p>The organisation also provided free or cheap pregnancy tests, and Messenger said many preferred to take these at Family Planning clinics because they could not afford to buy them from pharmacies.</p> <p>\u201cIf people are pregnant, we want them to have the health care they need,\u201d Messenger said, adding that Family Planning had urged the government to fund at-home tests during the shutdown. \u201cIf they don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant, they won\u2019t be able to access it.\u201d</p>"
