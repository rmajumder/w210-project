Cancer is onerous at the best of times; now, there are additional layers of complexity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not a call to muzzle debate but a plea that outrage always travels faster than methodical thinking</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As others stay home, doctors and nurses, cleaners, theatre techs and secretaries are coming to work. Our car parks are full. And yet, there\u2019s not even a whisper of self-congratulation \u2013 we\u2019re simply doing what we undertook.</p> <p>I am touched by the number of offers of help. Fortunately, I don\u2019t need supplies, rent assistance or a job. But if I may, here is something you can do. Please stop constantly second-guessing and ridiculing the Australian government officials, health authorities, and public health experts at the forefront of managing this unprecedented crisis. Self-appointed experts have thrust themselves everywhere, declaring outrage at every step, criticising the advice of the chief medical officer, his deputies and anyone whose view they disagree with. From testing criteria to elective surgery, from protective gear to unproven therapies, a cacophony of voices is drowning out authoritative advice. \u201cAuthoritative\u201d may be an exaggeration in swiftly changing times and a democratic society should welcome debate rather than a slavish adherence to rules but the truth is when we are all unsure, it is important to let people do what they are trained to do but hold them accountable.</p> <p>Global experience tells us that there is no single formula for diverse nations. I have clinical acumen but it\u2019s no use pretending that I have any real public health expertise or insight into the levers of government. What works for my patient won\u2019t help the population.</p> <p>From the comforts of Melbourne, I can\u2019t posit what should happen in Darwin, much less Manhattan or Mumbai \u2013 and I suspect it\u2019s the same for most of us.</p> <p>So, in the midst of so much noise, I need a clear space to listen to local experts who not only have access to the data but also the capacity to integrate rapidly multiple moving pieces. These people have training in infectious diseases, public health, epidemiology, statistics, economics and government and are working day and night for the common good. I decline to vilify them or lampoon their decisions and I hope you will too.</p> <p>In 2004, I was a disaster-relief physician in the tsunami-ravaged Maldives and witnessed the difficulties of coordinating a mass medical effort. The world poured in billions of dollars in aid. Unlike today, the threat had passed, only recovery mattered. On an island without a hospital, I needed oral antibiotics, asthma inhalers and pain relief. Instead, I got anaesthetic, a desalination plant and mouldy bread. The best intentions are useless in the absence of cool, considered minds. Another reason to trust the experts.</p> <p>For many of my colleagues, staying calm is becoming decidedly harder in the face of constant messages being generated by highly anxious individuals fuelling our worst fears. Let\u2019s face it, we are all watching this pandemic with disbelief. But blaming and emotive commentaries shared on personal and professional groups, with an \u201cintent to vent\u201d, or \u201csimply discuss\u201d have very real consequences \u2013 they rattle even the most stoic and steady professionals.</p> <p>This week, I need to focus on the children in quarantine while their mother is dying. And the patient whose cancer is progressing. And the man who can\u2019t give his beloved wife a funeral. I want to protect my interns who aren\u2019t sleeping well through this baptism of fire. But I have limited bandwidth and the more time I spend distinguishing real concern from confected outrage, the less time there is for the things that really matter.</p> <p>Universal healthcare isn\u2019t perfect but is again revealing its strengths. A central command structure is cutting through the noise and delivering the most up-to-date, evidence-based information. Our public hospitals are working non-stop to keep up with change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/09/the-message-to-doctors-has-always-been-clear-if-you-get-sick-do-it-on-your-own-time\">The message to doctors has always been clear: if you get sick, do it on your own time | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In swiftly changing times, we must excuse our leaders the occasional stumble but realise the gift of calm and consistent leadership.</p> <p>So no matter who you are, please take a minute to ask yourself how your next private or public post or media commentary will add value to the societal response to the pandemic.

  "<p>Health officials must abandon strict production rules that are hampering the introduction of mass testing for coronavirus, scientists warned on Wednesday, after the government admitted that just 2,000 of half a million frontline NHS staff have been tested to date. </p> \n<p>Procedures drawn up by Public Health England describe the precise chemicals and equipment that must be used to test patients. But with specific reagents in short supply, senior researchers told the Guardian that the UK must find alternatives to avoid more delays, with one arguing: \u201cThese are not normal times.\u201d</p> \n<p>Their plea came as the prime minister was forced to address mounting anger about the government\u2019s failure to increase testing, just weeks after it had appeared to rule out such a strategy. Ministers have been consistently flummoxed by questions on the issue.</p> \n<p>In a video message posted on Twitter on Wednesday evening, Boris Johnson said the country need to \u201cmassively ramp up\u201d the two separate tests that show whether people have, or have had, the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s crucial people who do have the disease are able to be tested positive and to take the necessary steps to isolate at home in the way that I am doing and many, many others are doing,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s poor testing figures compared with other nations have caused a huge political backlash, with critics asking why the government is both failing to source the right equipment and refusing to agree to expand testing to the general population.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Only around 8,000 hospital patients and NHS staff are being tested daily \u2013 well short of the government\u2019s targets and far below the 70,000 a day achieved in Germany. In total, just 2,000 NHS workers \u2013 or 0.4% of those being exposed to the virus \u2013 have been tested so far, meaning thousands in isolation cannot get back to work.</p> \n<p>Ministers have struggled for four days in a row at No 10\u2019s daily press conference to explain why testing is so slow. In an attempt to solve another logistical barrier, NHS England also directed all trusts to lift the 15% cap on staff testing and use all their spare testing capacity to help solve the problem.</p> \n<p>But Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a molecular virologist at Leeds University, said that efforts to scale up testing were being frustrated by over-reliance on specified reagents, enzymes and other chemicals. \u201cIt is holding things up,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we could get over this, we could get the testing centres up and running so much faster, and that\u2019s got to be a good thing.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe NHS have very specific requirements and there is good reason for that. It makes sure that standards are maintained. But there are alternatives. They need to be optimised and validated, but you can fast-track that if you have enough people. It wouldn\u2019t take a lot of time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced last week that the government had bought 3.5m antibody tests.

There is more going on behind the scenes to secure supplies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Universities have received a flurry of urgent calls from the government to assist in scaling up virus testing. Weeks ago, certain enzymes were in short supply. More recently, requests came in for chemicals that release the virus\u2019s genetic code, the first step in the process of detecting the virus in swab samples.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe protocols say they want specific types of reagent for that, but there are lots of ways to do it, there are many reagents you can use,\u201d Stonehouse said. \u201cWe can do this, and with appropriate controls, the risks are low and the benefits could be high.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-3-zip/giv-3902lafouGVLZpZa/\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-3-zip/giv-3902lafouGVLZpZa/\">Graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The stringent rules around test chemicals and equipment are designed to ensure that tests are reliable and consistent across the NHS.

While manufacturers are producing the kits as rapidly as they can, the firms are having to prioritise what products are shipped where.</p> \n<p>Stonehouse said chemicals were not the only hurdle that scientists faced in trying to help in the acceleration of testing. A large swath of university-trained researchers have volunteered to run testing equipment, but have been held up amid legal concerns about having them working at NHS and other testing facilities. \u201cThis seems to be stopping things going forwards,\u201d Stonehouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s an overreaction.

With the summit delayed to next year, other governments will have time to adjust either to a second term of Donald Trump \u2013 who opposes the Paris agreement and is withdrawing the US from it \u2013 or a new president who is likely to support climate action.</p> <p>But several prominent climate experts had feared that delaying the talks would mean governments eased off on pursuing stronger commitments to fulfil the Paris goals.</p> <p>Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief who oversaw the Paris summit in 2015, had argued for keeping Glasgow on track. On Wednesday night she accepted the delay but added: \u201cEmissions must peak this year if we want to limit warming to 1.5C and the Paris agreement set the Cop26 summit as the moment when all countries would ramp up their targets in line with the steep emissions decline we need to see in this decisive next decade.\u201d</p> <p>The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) welcomed the delay as the best hope of rebuilding diplomatic momentum before the talks take place. Stephanie Pfeifer, the group\u2019s CEO, said investors would support the decision because it \u201cimproves the likelihood of a strong outcome and ensuring that the world is put on a path to tackle the climate crisis\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the delay will come as a blow to some climate campaigners, who have urged the UK government to proceed with the conference despite the outbreak to avoid stalling progress on global climate action. They believe since the Paris agreement, countries have failed to develop climate commitments that go far enough to avoid a catastrophic environmental breakdown. The Glasgow talks aim to galvanise tougher plans to cap rising temperatures by limiting greenhouse gas emissions.</p>",
  "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering changing its guidance on whether people should wear face masks in public, prompted by new evidence that suggests doing so could help contain the pandemic.</p> <p>The WHO, and the UK government, currently advise that face masks do not play a major role in protecting people from infection outside healthcare settings. But there are growing calls for this stance to be reviewed, with suggestions that the widespread use of face masks may have played a role in containing outbreaks in some Asian countries.</p> <p>Speaking at a Chatham House briefing on Wednesday, Prof David Heymann, an infectious disease expert who led the global response to the SARS outbreak, said that new evidence from Hong Kong had prompted a reconsideration of the role of face masks. \u201cThe WHO is debating that tomorrow to understand if there is evidence that would call for a change in what WHO is recommending,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The data from Hong Kong was shared confidentially with the WHO, but is likely to be published soon, Heymann said. He added that, in reassessing its policy, the WHO would take into account health workers\u2019 need for masks in all countries.</p> <p>The possible shift in guidance comes as a body representing thousands of doctors in the UK called for every patient and member of staff in hospitals to be provided with face masks, to be worn at all times to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA) says the virus is so widespread and infectious, and the risks to frontline staff so great, that everyone in hospital should always have their mouth covered to reduce the risk of transmission.</p> <p>The HCSA is demanding the change in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/worrying-event-deaths-of-nhs-doctors-from-covid-19-stark-reminder-of-pandemic\">the death of two hospital doctors</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/first-nhs-consultant-dies-from-covid-19\">Amged El-Hawrani</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/first-working-nhs-surgeon-dies-from-coronavirus\">Adil El Tayar</a>, from coronavirus. Hawrani, aged 55, was an ear, nose and throat specialist while Tayar was a transplant surgeon.</p> <p>\u201cOur call for surgical masks to be worn by all staff and patients in all areas of hospitals, and for all patients to be treated as Covid-19 patients, comes in the wake of two consultant deaths, and of course the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">infection of the prime minister and health secretary</a>,\u201d said Dr Claudia Paoloni, the HCSA\u2019s president and an anaesthetist at an NHS hospital in Bristol. \u201cThis underlines how infectious this disease is.\u201d</p> <p>In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/cdc-considering-recommending-general-public-wear-face-coverings-in-public/2020/03/30/6a3e495c-7280-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html\">is also said to be reviewing its guidance on masks</a> and may advise Americans to cover their faces while commuting to work. And in <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/not-wearing-masks-protect-against-coronavirus-big-mistake-top-chinese-scientist-says\">a recent interview</a>, George Gao, the director general of China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, suggested the failure to wear masks in the US and Europe was a \u201cbig mistake\u201d.</p> <p>Dr Peter KaHung Chan, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, said that the evidence on public use of face masks is still unclear, but that <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034660v1.full.pdf\">observational studies from Hong Kong</a> have, at least, shown that the overall package of containment measures have been effective. \u201cFace masks are certainly not the only thing that was useful, but they\u2019re something that should be studied properly instead of dismissed or excessively promoted with inadequate empirical evidence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Until now, the WHO has suggested that masks are mostly useful for protecting other people if you have symptoms such as coughs and sneezes that could spread droplets. But Heymann said the realisation that a lot of transmission of Covid-19 occurs before symptoms raises the possibility that masks could help stop the spread among people before symptoms emerge.</p> <p>\u201cOne or two days before symptoms develop, it seems [people] may be shedding virus at that time and it may be that if they\u2019re talking and spewing droplets around they may be spreading the virus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAs the evidence becomes available it seems that there will be a more serious debate [including] tomorrow at the WHO trying to decide whether masks really do play a role at some point in the outbreak containment,\u201d he added. \u201cBelieve me if they do, there\u2019s a private sector healthy enough in many countries to begin producing those masks in the quantities that are necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Paoloni\u2019s call to Public Health England (PHE) comes as it finalises new guidance telling NHS staff across the UK what personal protective equipment (PPE) they should wear in different areas of hospitals and other settings when dealing with patients who are confirmed or suspected to have Covid-19. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/nhs-staff-gagged-over-coronavirus-protective-equipment-shortages\">Serious shortages of PPE </a>and confusion over what kit is needed have prompted huge alarm and fear among frontline staff.</p> <p>In a letter to PHE, Paoloni says that staff should wear full PPE \u2013 double gloves, a surgical gown, FFP3 face mask and visor or goggles \u2013 in a wider range of settings that PHE has previously proposed, including A&amp;E units, operating theatres, wards, radiology departments and intensive care units, which are rapidly filling up with infected patients.</p> <p>\u201cStaff and patients may not even be aware they are spreading the virus because the symptoms can be so slight and vary from person to person. Even those who appear to have recovered may be infectious. By shifting to a policy where staff and patients are considered potential Covid-19 carriers, we will be cutting the prospect of infection and reducing the chances of crucial NHS staff being taken ill at the worst possible time,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cOur message is simple: we need social distancing in our hospitals too, and that means changing the guidance so that everyone wears a mask.\u201d</p> <p>The HCSA is \u201cconcerned that safety standards are being dictated by supply [availability of PPE] rather than than being based on protecting NHS staff, our most precious resource,\u201d she added.</p> <p>NHS England and ministers have made huge efforts over the past 10 days to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/31/more-orders-for-nhs-ventilators-covid19\">many millions of pieces of extra kit</a> to hospitals, GP surgeries and other care settings.</p>",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

We thought we could manage that epidemic over the course of March and April, push the curve to the right, build up herd immunity and that way we could protect people,\u201d said Horton. \u201cThe reason why that strategy was wrong is it didn\u2019t recognise that 20% of people infected would end up with severe critical illness. The evidence was there at the end of January.\u201d</p> \n<p>Anthony Costello, a UK paediatrician and former director of the WHO, also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/uk-covid-19-strategy-questions-unanswered-coronavirus-outbreak\">fiercely criticised</a> the decision to stop tests. \u201cFor me and the WHO people I have spoken to, this is absolutely the wrong policy,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-health-experts-fear-epidemic-will-let-rip-through-uk\">he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-health-experts-fear-epidemic-will-let-rip-through-uk\">said</a>. \u201cThe basic public health approach is playing second fiddle to mathematical modelling.\u201d</p> \n<p>Less than two weeks on from the lockdown that Johnson announced on 23 March, the original strategy, the decisions that came before and after it, and the UK\u2019s inability to ramp up testing for NHS staff \u2013 let alone anyone else \u2013 are under unrelenting scrutiny.</p> \n<p>Ministers have been flailing. What has emerged is a picture of confusion and uncertainty at the top, with ministers making promises they cannot keep and apparently with little comprehension of the global tussle for tests that may make it impossible for the UK to buy its way belatedly out of the problem. </p> \n<p>The UK is now competing with every other nation to obtain the kits it needs, particularly the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which tells someone whether they have Covid-19 or not. </p> \n<p>The Guardian has been told that presidents and prime ministers are trying to outbid each other to secure these kits and their components, which are in short supply. The US also has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">woken up</a> to the need to test \u2013 and is telling companies that export them that America must come first.</p> \n<p>No wonder, perhaps, the UK now finds itself struggling to increase testing to 25,000 a day for hospital patients and health workers, let alone meet its ambition \u2013 once stated but now seldom mentioned \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-mass-home-testing-to-be-made-available-within-days\">to reach 100,000 a day</a>, to include other key workers. </p> \n<p>\u201cIn all countries we have prime ministers calling the CEOs and diagnostic companies to try to get hold of the stocks. Indonesia and Peru we know have offered to order several million tests and send private planes to pick the tests up. There is more going on behind the scenes to secure supplies,\u201d said Dr Catharina Boehme, chief executive of the non-profit Geneva-based Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, which is a WHO collaborating centre.</p> \n<p>The companies are trying to be responsible, she said. \u201cThey supply small quantities to each country to give sufficient supplies for a number of days and then ship on a very frequent basis. But there is clearly this move in the US where several companies have openly declared they can\u2019t supply anyone outside the US.\u201d</p> \n<p>Three US companies making the PCR tests, Abbott, Hologic and Cepheid, have been told not to export them, leaving Africa \u2013 which uses their technology in HIV tests \u2013 with a single supplier, Roche in Switzerland.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-01T13:02:42/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK testing compared with other countries\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-01T13:02:42/embed.html\">UK testing compared with other countries</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The WHO, Unicef and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation are working on procuring tests for low- and middle-income countries.

Prof Sharon Peacock, director of infections at Public Health England, told MPs that millions of home testing kits would be available, delivered by Amazon or bought in Boots, within days, not weeks.</p> \n<p>\u201cTests are being ordered across Europe and elsewhere and purchased in south-east Asia.

He warned that antibody tests needed proper evaluation, which was being undertaken at Oxford University. \u201cThe key thing for us to do is evaluate. Are these tests accurate enough to be used by the general public?\u201d he said at the prime minister\u2019s press conference the same day. </p> \n<p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the government had bought 3.5m antibody tests, but the Guardian understands the UK has actually put in orders for 40m more. It is the sort of drastic gamble that governments around the world are taking, afraid that stocks will disappear.</p> \n<p>Antibody tests are available right now on the internet to anyone who wants them \u2013 but some are unreliable, and could give the wrong verdict. So far, the best are 90% sensitive to Covid-19 and 90% specific. </p> \n<p>The perils are all too apparent, and not just for the antibody tests: Spain and the Czech Republic recently had to send back hundreds of thousands of antigen tests to China because they had an accurate detection rate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-test-kits-withdrawn-spain-poor-accuracy-rate\">of just 30%</a>.</p> \n<p>Antibody tests are being used widely in China and South Korea, where the virus has already been beaten down to lower levels by the traditional PCR testing of those with symptoms and tracing and isolating their contacts.</p> \n<p>Mass contact tracing, which can be highly labour-intensive, is made possible through phone apps, which alert people who have been near someone who has tested positive.</p> \n<p>The concept was greeted with horror by some in the UK as mass data gathering and an invasion of privacy \u2013 yet Oxford University is now developing just such an app.</p> \n<p>Looking ahead to the endgame, testing and tracing contacts, figuring out where the virus has been and who is still vulnerable is widely acknowledged among scientists to be the way to stamp out the last pockets of a pandemic.</p> \n<p>For now, Italy is doing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/scientists-say-mass-tests-in-italian-town-have-halted-covid-19\">more testing</a> than any other country, desperate to bring down its cases and fatality rates.</p> \n<p>Not far behind is Germany, which has been doing widespread testing of suspects with symptoms and contact tracing in the WHO-recommended fashion from the beginning.

Despite government guidance calling on landlords to \u201cshow compassion\u201d for their tenants, campaigners say the current policy is likely to lead to a major eviction and rent arrears crisis once the lockdown ends.</p> \n  <p>In a letter to the department for communities, homes and local government, the London Renters Union, which represents thousands of renters in London, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Urging landlords to \u2018show compassion\u2019 does nothing in reality to protect renters. The government has left renters to fend for themselves. As the government\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/876500/Consolidated_Landlord_and_Tenant_Guidance_COVID_and_the_PRS_v4.2.pdf\">guidance</a> clearly states, tenants are still legally obliged to pay rent and landlords are still able to issue eviction notices to renters who enter into rent debt. The eviction process will begin as soon as the temporary ban on evictions is lifted.</p> \n   <p>Renters should be freed from having to make any rent payments during the coronavirus pandemic and should be protected from having to pay back massive arrears once social distancing measures are reversed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The call was echoed by Acorn, a community-based union that organises among renters in 15 other cities. Kat Wright, Acorn\u2019s national organiser, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Despite the spin, the government is not protecting renters. When tenants are enduring much reduced incomes and are struggling to pay for basic necessities, it\u2019s unacceptable that landlords have their businesses protected at our expense.</p> \n   <p>Acorn is calling for a rent waiver for the duration of the crisis. In the midst of the worst public health emergency in living memory, a safe, secure home is not just an individual right but a public health necessity. We believe that housing is healthcare.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Research carried out late last month by Opinium, on behalf of the campaign group Compassion in Politics, found more than a third of workers said they had taken a financial hit due to emergency measures.</p> \n  <p>Of those, 14% said they had missed rent or bill payments. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e84c3e28f0866297e9f52b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-01T16:42:53.668Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>BuzzFeed\u2019s Emily Ashton asked about the \u201ccrisis within a crisis\u201d of the lack of PPE for frontline staff.</p> \n  <p>Sharma said over 390m PPE products had been delivered over the last two weeks and a 24-hour NHS hotline that staff could call to request PPE if needed. </p> \n  <p>Doyle added the intention was to ensure deliveries rapidly reached where they were needed most.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e84c2938f087564da1e3efc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-01T16:37:32.538Z\">5.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Testing intended to be increased for general population' \u2013 Doyle</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The FT\u2019s Laura Hughes asked about the government\u2019s exit strategy for getting us out of the lockdown and the role testing will play in that.</p> \n  <p>Sharma said the restrictions were for an initial three-week period then would be reviewed, but we could not allow efforts to be wasted and head to a dangerous second peak.</p> \n  <p>Doyle added that the prime minister would review the situation after Easter, based on scientific information and clinical evidence as to how the epidemic is progressing.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We want to make the right call at the right time on this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Doyle appeared to confirm that the UK\u2019s strategy will be to increase testing for the virus in the general population, after days of calls from public health experts and the Tory former health secretary Jeremy Hunt to expand it out from hospital patients and the NHS. </p> \n  <p>This appears to contradict the approach outlined on Tuesday by Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, who said the future antibody testing to determine immunity was the key.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-01T16:46:48.745Z\">at 5.46pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e84c1a18f087564da1e3eed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-01T16:34:22.169Z\">5.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy asked whether people were getting complacent about the measures in place and why Germany\u2019s capacity to test was so much higher than the UK\u2019s.</p> \n  <p>Doyle said staff in contact with the sickest patients would be tested first.</p> \n  <p>She added that the reagents that worked best were those that worked best with the machines they were intended for.

  "<p>Fuad Nahdi, who has died aged 62 due to complications related to diabetes, was one of the most important figures over the past 30 years in the framing, development and mainstream influence of British Islam. He also made Britain a bridgehead between east and west, where Islamic scholars came to face their reckoning with modernity.</p> <p>Nahdi held no great administrative office but he was a consummate communicator with crucial connections when it mattered \u2013 which was the moment when British Islam emerged as distinct from \u201cAsianness\u201d, through the Rushdie Affair, 9/11, the Iraq war and the 2005 London bombings.</p> <p>He also lived in the right place at the right time, for Britain, hosting the world\u2019s most ethnically and theologically diverse Muslim population, became an international centre for debate, providing a more rigorous testing ground than Muslim-majority, often authoritarian, states.</p> <p>A warm, charming man, widely trusted as a writer and publisher, interfaith leader and community activist, he had unrivalled connections not only in the Arab world and Africa but, unusually for a Muslim, within the liberal establishments of Europe and the US.</p> <p>His rare cultural, religious and political agility, combined with an irreverent sense of humour, meant his voice was heard from Downing Street to Dakar, from Manchester to Mecca. He was well equipped to explain Islam \u2013 and in particular its British version \u2013 to establishment figures and became, in 2014, the first Muslim to address the General Synod of the Church of England.</p> <p>Two of his innovations stand out. First, in the late 1980s and early 90s he founded two independent, often satirical and humorous Muslim publications \u2013 MuslimWise and Q-News \u2013 which provided an intellectual and spiritual home where the UK\u2019s multi-ethnic, linguistically diverse Muslims could forge a confident, dissenting identity that nurtured resilience against political exclusion and calls to violence. Prior to this, virtually all Muslim media in Britain was funded from overseas \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Iran or the Gulf states \u2013 and largely reflected the interests of other countries.</p> <p>Second, after the London bombings he took his message out to Britain\u2019s communities by founding Radical Middle Way, a community interest company that delivered programmes and events promoting the idea that good religion is the way to tackle extremism. Radical Middle Way hosted hip-hop concerts across Britain, attended by thousands of young Muslims, in the midst of which a devout Sufi scholar, usually from abroad, in traditional dress, would take the stage with messages of faith and peace, followed by questions and discussion.</p> <p>Quick to spot extremism\u2019s harnessing of technologies to spread misinformation, Nahdi ensured that all these events were widely streamed on the internet. Working also in Sudan, Mali, Morocco, Pakistan and Indonesia, Radical Middle Way galvanised a global Muslim conversation.</p> <p>Nahdi\u2019s message was clearly expressed in the strapline for the Radical Middle Way initiative, which reads: Fight Fear. Fight Ignorance. Have Faith. A fierce critic of both Islamist violence and the Iraq war, he would say: \u201cThe problem is not too much religion. The problem is too little good religion.\u201d He would poke fun at out-of-touch imams and enjoyed rattling Islamic institutions. \u201cBeyond beards, scarves and halal meat, what does it mean to be a British Muslim?\u2019 asked an early edition of Q-News.</p> <p>In 2001, a few days after the World Trade Center bombing, Nahdi anticipated problems that would later beset Britain, telling the Guardian: \u201cThe danger is that there are a large number of Muslim leaders in Britain who come from the same school of Islam as the Taliban. They are not extremists, but they copy the style. In Leicester, for example, they won\u2019t allow the women into the mosques.</p> <p>\u201cMeanwhile, there are platoons of young Muslims roaming the streets. They saw the TV images of the intifada and copied them during the Oldham riots. Now they are seeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/02/osama-bin-laden-obituary\" title=\"\">Osama bin Laden</a> turned by the BBC and others into a glamorous, Rambo figure. Next time, will they be copying the bombers? We have to invest in forging a positive identity for them so we create the right kind of Muslim. Otherwise it could be dangerous for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>The content of his publications encapsulated the confusing influences on British Muslims. One page might feature an entreaty from the Grand Ayatollah of Iran, the next an item on Yasmeen Ghauri, the Muslim supermodel, and another on the rise of HIV in the Muslim community.</p> <p>MuslimWise, a monthly satirical magazine modelled on Private Eye, was founded in 1988 amid the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rushdie-fatwa\" title=\"\">heated reaction</a> to Salman Rushdie\u2019s novel The Satanic Verses. Q-News followed in 1992, a weekly independent newspaper investigating daily life \u2013 from dodgy halal certification to racist attacks, domestic violence, youth and women\u2019s projects and corruption in the nascent class of Muslim politicians.</p> <p>With a female editor, Shagufta Yaqub, and news editor, Fareena Alam, its pages might juxtapose an article on sacred odes with a review of the latest Terminator film. Both publications were in print and did not survive far into the internet age, especially as Nahdi began to turn his attentions to the Radical Middle Way project. But they were influential projects with clout.</p> <p>Nahdi\u2019s upbringing, and life in Britain, prepared him for cultural connectedness. Fluent in Arabic, English and Swahili, he was born in Arusha, Tanzania, to an Indonesian mother, Alya Faraj bin Muhanna Nahdi, and a Yemeni-Kenyan father, Salim Abdallah bin Taher Nahdi, who was a trader. His paternal heritage was in Hadramaut, the Yemeni home of the Bin Laden clan, which enabled him to observe that \u201cI\u2019m probably the only person who has had lunch with Tony Blair and dinner with Osama bin Laden.\u201d</p> <p>The family settled in Mombasa, Kenya, and he attended the University of Nairobi, where he studied economics. He was arrested after playing a prominent role in student protests against the country\u2019s then president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/04/daniel-arap-moi\" title=\"\">Daniel arap Moi</a>.</p> <p>In 1983 he took a master\u2019s degree in Islamic studies at SOAS University of London and trained as a journalist at City University, guided by Godfrey Hodgson, the veteran Observer foreign correspondent. Hodgson connected him to Reuters and the US and British liberal media, for whom he wrote throughout his career.</p> <p>Soon after joining the political monthly Africa Events, Nahdi began what became a lifelong, daily conversation with its then editor, the late Zanzibari intellectual and former BBC journalist, Mohamed Mlamali Adam, who rooted the young journalist in an influential British circle of Islamic thinkers.</p> <p>Nahdi also became a protege of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jan/25/guardianobituaries.religion\" title=\"\">Zaki Badawi</a>, who built British Islam\u2019s key institutions, including the Muslim College and the Sharia Council, and who sought to shape an Islamic identity that could be comfortable for a minority community in a western context. Nahdi eventually saw the opportunity to take Badawi\u2019s insights on to bigger, more popular platforms.</p> <p>In 1989 he married Humera Khan, a leading figure in British Muslim community development. Her Pakistani heritage, London upbringing and welcoming family embedded Nahdi in British life and ensured that their home became the go-to place for Muslim thinkers. </p> <p>Nahdi\u2019s friendship with Rowan Williams, archbishop of Canterbury from 2002 to 2012, led to his 2014 Synod invitation. His address there anticipated the thinking that preoccupied his final years \u2013 that faiths should embrace convergence not conversion, helping people to be ethical and moral beings in a broken world.</p> <p>\u201cOur interdependent existence must be at the back of our minds at all times,\u201d he declared. \u201cSoon, two out of every three members of the church will have a Muslim neighbour. The need to educate our flocks on the proprieties of co-existence and the embracing of difference is a top priority.\u201d</p> <p>He is survived by Humera, a son, Nadir, and a daughter, Ilyeh.</p> <p>\u2022 Fuad Salim Abdullah Neheid Taher Nahdi, journalist and publisher, born 1 June 1957; died 21 March 2020</p>",

  "<p>For residents of Sheffield, <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/f94c3c90da5b4e9f9a0b19484dd4bb14\">the daily roll call</a> of coronavirus cases has made for alarming reading. On Wednesday the Steel City had the fourth highest number in any local authority in England (541), behind Surrey (571), Hampshire (652) and Birmingham (734).</p> <p>The figures have led some to worry that Sheffield \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/home/your-city-council/population-in-sheffield\">home to </a><a href=\"https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/home/your-city-council/population-in-sheffield\">575,400 people</a>, compared with Birmingham\u2019s 1.1 million \u2013 has become a hotbed of disease. Research from the Centre for Cities on Tuesday prompted further consternation by breaking the data down by population size and reporting that Sheffield <a href=\"https://www.centreforcities.org/coronavirus/\">was second only</a> to London in terms of cases per 100,000 people.</p> <p>But local hospitals and public health experts are playing down the statistics. \u201cThe figures are misleading and alarming. People look at them and think, \u2018Oh gosh, we\u2019re all going to get it\u2019 and \u2018Sheffield is a high-risk area\u2019, but that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Dr Andrew Lee, a reader of global public health at Sheffield University and executive director of primary care and population health at NHS Vale of York clinical commissioning group.</p> <p>So far, 21 patients have died in hospitals in Sheffield, while the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust, which operates the city\u2019s two big hospitals, the Northern General and the Royal Hallamshire, says they are currently treating \u201ca comparatively low level\u201d of coronavirus patients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-01T18:11:24/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Sheffield Covid-19 cases\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-01T18:11:24/embed.html\">Sheffield Covid-19 cases</a> </figure>  <p>Talking in his academic capacity, Lee despaired at the <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/f94c3c90da5b4e9f9a0b19484dd4bb14\">Public Health England daily dashboard</a>, which lists the number of cases in each local authority in England. \u201cThat tracker is really misleading. In some senses they should just turn it off because everywhere is testing differently. So you can\u2019t compare place A with place B with place C. And it\u2019s not like you\u2019re just following a score because the interpretation of those numbers is really complicated,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The main reason Sheffield has such a high number of cases is that it has been testing more people and testing earlier, according to Lee. The Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust took the decision to test all symptomatic NHS workers 11 days before most other areas, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>From 19 March, any Northern General staff with symptoms were instructed to phone occupational health and \u2013 assuming they had their own transport and weren\u2019t going to use public transport \u2013 were given an appointment for a test, according to a medic from the Northern General. That hospital has a larger than average in-house testing laboratory, which <a href=\"https://www.sth.nhs.uk/clientfiles/File/Link%200613%20intranet.pdf\">when it opened in 2013</a> was able to process more than 10m tests a year. And at the start of March, local authorities set up <a href=\"https://www.thestar.co.uk/health/where-new-drive-through-coronavirus-testing-site-has-been-set-sheffield-2444430\">a temporary drive-through community testing facility</a> just off the Sheffield Parkway where members of the public who had visited affected countries could be tested without leaving their cars.</p> <p>It was <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/covid-19-testing-and-staff-retention-letter-29-march-2020.pdf\">only this week</a> that the rest of the NHS was ordered by Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, to start testing staff, starting with those working in critical care, emergency departments and ambulance services.</p> <p>Healthcare workers were disproportionately likely to get infected, said Lee. \u201cIf you look at what happened with Mers-Covid, when they had that big outbreak in South Korea some years ago, most of the cases were in health workers. And the same with Sars in 2003-4. It just reflects the fact healthcare workers have high-risk, prolonged contacts with patients. Healthcare workers are not representative of the wider public.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a243cd73c679cacf5429352250df473b46032eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a243cd73c679cacf5429352250df473b46032eb/176_330_6544_3926/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A notice in Broomhill, Sheffield.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A notice in Broomhill, Sheffield.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Northern General medic said the widespread testing in Sheffield meant that infected staff stayed at home while those who tested negative could come in to work. \u201cI know five or six people in my team were sure they had it and tested negative, and yet a few others who were adamant it was just a cold turned out to have coronavirus,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Another reason for Sheffield\u2019s high figures is that the Royal Hallamshire is home to one of England\u2019s few specialist NHS infection centres. That is why, when the first coronavirus patients arrived in the UK<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51606368\"> from the cruise ship the Diamond Princess</a>, two were sent there.</p> <p>In addition, Sheffield has experienced a few \u201cCovid clusters\u201d, according to a spokeswoman at the hospitals trust. \u201cI know we did have some clusters of people that we tested in the community, which had a wide contract testing base, which made the Sheffield figures look larger,\u201d she said.

The airline also had plans before the coronavirus to expand at London Heathrow.</p> <p>In one of the letters, according to Sky News, John Harrison, the general counsel and UK chairman of Airbus, said that Virgin\u2019s \u201ccollapse could have an extremely negative impact on the A330 programme\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cAs you will be aware, all wings for these aircraft are designed and manufactured in the UK, and orders from airlines like Virgin are vital for the continuation of our business.\u201d</p> <p>Rolls-Royce has also stressed the \u201csignificant importance\u201d of Virgin\u2019s custom to the company and its UK supply chain.</p> <p>A Heathrow spokesperson confirmed that the airport had written on Virgin\u2019s behalf, and said: \u201cThe government must take urgent steps now to safeguard the future of the sector or it will risk undermining the recovery of Britain\u2019s economy once we beat the virus.\u201d</p> <p>Virgin has parked up to 85% of its aircraft fleet and put most staff on eight weeks\u2019 unpaid leave, as well as cutting executive pay, and offering redundancy and year-long sabbaticals to its 8,500 employees. The carrier is 51% owned by Branson\u2019s Virgin Group, with a 49% stake held by the US carrier Delta Airlines. The US airline industry has already received a multibillion-dollar bailout as part of an economic stimulus package <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">passed by Congress</a>.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic\u2019s chairman, Peter Norris, led calls last month for the government to give the industry up to \u00a37.5bn in state support. However, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last week disappointed airlines and airports by deciding against an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/24/uk-airlines-and-airports-told-not-to-expect-industry-wide-covid-19-bailout\">industry-wide bailout</a>, but said help would be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>Virgin submitted its claim for state assistance this week to Rothschild, the investment bank which is acting for the government to assess bailout requests from aviation businesses.</p> <p>How much leverage Virgin\u2019s industry backers have in Downing Street is questionable. Airbus was one of the most prominent industrial voices against Brexit, while Heathrow\u2019s expansion plans have been left to evaporate by the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/heathrow-third-runway-ruled-illegal-over-climate-change\">after a judicial review</a>.</p> <p>The government is also loth to be seen to be helping out billionaire shareholders. Branson has said he will inject $250m (\u00a3200m) into his Virgin Group, which includes other businesses as well as the airline. EasyJet, another major UK airline which could eventually require aid, went ahead with a \u00a3171m dividend payout this month, which it said it was legally obliged to do.</p> <p>The regional carrier Loganair, which stepped in to take over some of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/04/flybe-could-collapse-within-weeks-without-help\">Flybe\u2019s routes when it collapsed</a> at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, is also expected to seek help.</p> <p>Help for Virgin would also be resisted by its bigger rival at Heathrow, British Airways, as well as environmental groups. Willie Walsh, the boss of BA\u2019s owner, IAG, has said that \u201cgovernments would expect airlines to look at self-help before they would call [for] state aid\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Virgin Atlantic\u2019s financial performance had been improving in recent years, cutting losses to \u00a326m in 2018, the last full-year results the airline issued Its Virgin Holidays arm turned a slight \u00a36m profit. The airline reported cash reserves of \u00a3489m a little under a year ago, and had since unveiled ambitious expansion plans to challenge BA\u2019s dominance at Heathrow.</p> <p>However, it is believed to have made significant additional losses in the ill-fated acquisition of Flybe, which \u2013 as part of a consortium \u2013 it hoped to rebrand as Virgin Connect, to feed passengers into its long-haul network.

  "<p>Private schools in the UK are facing a battle for survival in the face of the coronavirus crisis as parents who have lost their income cancel direct debits and overseas pupils who have gone home decide whether to return.</p> <p>As the economic fallout from the pandemic begins to bite, there are fears that a number of smaller independent schools, which are already struggling, will be driven out of business.</p> <p>Many are offering fee discounts of anything from 10% right up to 50% for the summer term to take into account the fact that schools have closed and are only able to offer an online education.</p> <p>Others are offering rebates for meals, transport and extra curricular activities.</p> <p>Looking ahead to the autumn, schools are promising a fee freeze for the next academic year, with increased bursaries and hardship funds for families hit by the economic downturn, in order to try to keep places full and parents on board.</p> <p>Neil Roskilly, the chief executive of the Independent Schools Association which represents 540 private schools in the UK, warned that not all schools would survive. \u201cFive or six close every year or amalgamate, and that\u2019s just in normal times. We could be looking at maybe double that. We simply don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of it will depend on where the world\u2019s economy is going, and whether people have got the jobs they once had.\u201d</p> <p>There is also uncertainty about overseas pupils, most of whom have now gone home though a number remain stranded in the UK, being cared for by their schools. According to the Independent Schools Council (ISC), there are around 55,000 overseas pupils in ISC schools, of which almost 10,000 are Chinese, 5,000 are from Hong Kong and 2,500 from Russia.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many of the children want to come back, and even if they do want to come back, whether they will be able to leave their country, or whether their country is still going to be in lockdown,\u201d saids Roskilly.</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority are saying they want to come back if they can. They just don\u2019t know what the situation\u2019s going to be. What schools are doing is hoping for the best but planning for the worst.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/going-home-puts-my-parents-at-risk-students-hit-by-coronavirus-upheaval\">'Going home puts my parents at risk': UK students hit by coronavirus upheaval</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eton College, which educated the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has reduced its fees by a third for the summer term. \u201cWe have invited parents to contribute the balance to support our various community initiatives if they are able to and would like to, and (very) many have,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe have also increased our financial aid fund, and many parents have donated to this.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew Adshead is headmaster of the Old Vicarage School, an independent nursery, pre-prep and preparatory school for around 160 girls and boys aged three to 13 in Darley Abbey, Derby.</p> <p>\u201cWe are going to need to be able to adapt and look after our parent body. They are going through the same pressures we are,\u201d said Adshead, who is offering a 15% fee discount for those parents who need it, plus a freeze on fees for September.\u201d</p> <p>He said he had already lost about five pupils as a result of the crisis. \u201cI think we will see some schools closing, I\u2019m sad to say \u2013 some are teetering already. In a small independent school, the large majority of parents have got their own businesses.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are going to see is significant strain and pressure on cash flow. The first thing that\u2019s going to have to go is fees, because they are going to need that money to live on.\u201d</p> <p>Francis Green, professor of work and education economics at UCL Institute of Education, said private schools were facing \u201ca triple whammy\u201d \u2013 the direct effects of the virus, the economic effects as their parents run into financial problems and the increased costs of teachers\u2019 pensions, which has been causing the sector difficulties for some time.</p> <p>\u201cThe last time fee increases were held at or below inflation was in the immediate aftermath of the 2008-9 financial crisis; this being much more severe I would expect to see fee reductions, and retrenchment in the schools. Maybe even redundancies.\u201d</p> <p>Green continued: \u201cPrivate schools have quite a few foreign students, who pay slightly higher fees and in some cases are very important for the schools\u2019 financial survival.</p> <p>\u201cAssuming business is able to be resumed at some level in the autumn, one can\u2019t help thinking that global demand for British education will have taken a knock if Britain is seen to be way behind the curve in dealing with the virus \u2013 particularly in comparison with China.\u201d</p> <p>In the event of schools being threatened with closure, Green said the Department for Education should allow them to convert to academy status, and become part of the state school system, as a small number have already done.</p>",

News of \u201csignificant, voluntary pay cuts\u201d reportedly accepted by Eddie Howe and other members of the leadership team at Bournemouth, whose approach might have been influenced by their proximity to the foraging hotbed that is the New Forest, has done little to assuage critics.</p> <p>One of the issues Premier League clubs have traditionally faced is a lack of either the funds or the inclination to even consider the plight of wild mushrooms, when they could spend \u00a3270,000 a week on Mesut \u00d6zil instead.

He in fact accused the Premier League of operating in a \u201cmoral vacuum\u201d.

  "<p>Will the inevitable public inquiry into the UK\u2019s Covid-19 response pin the blame on a few scapegoats? I hope not. Britain\u2019s failure to move quickly and effectively is the symptom of a more comprehensive system failure. More than three months after the virus first appeared in Wuhan, England and Wales still lack the necessary testing capacity and surveillance infrastructure to shut down the epidemic. Crucial frontline workers are still doing their jobs without adequate personal protective equipment. Public Health England (PHE) seem unable to increase the daily number of tests in line with European neighbours. As other countries acted swiftly to contain the epidemic, the UK appears indecisive and delayed, shifting late in the day from a controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">herd immunity strategy</a> to a lockdown. History won\u2019t look kindly on Britain\u2019s response.</p> <p>We must ask at least five far-reaching questions about how our health system deals with a pandemic. First: who\u2019s in charge? Many actors have been involved in devising a response to coronavirus \u2013 Downing Street and its advisers; Cobra; the Department of Health and Social Care; NHS England; PHE and its Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh counterparts; the National Institute for Health Research; the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty; the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance; and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (UK Sage). Coordination appears chaotic. I\u2019ve reliably been told that leaders across these various bodies often don\u2019t know what each other is doing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pandemics move fast; if you don\u2019t get ahead of a virus, it quickly spreads</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second question concerns history. The UK\u2019s haphazard coronavirus response wasn\u2019t just a result of chaotic planning. The groundwork was laid years ago. During the last decade, funding for public health has been fragmented and downgraded. In 2013, the Lansley reforms created PHE, a new executive agency within the Department of Health and Social Care that was separate from the NHS. Its mission was to protect and improve the nation\u2019s health in order to address inequalities. Its funding came from local authority budgets; as local authorities suffered the sharp end of austerity, funding for PHE stagnated. Spending on the public health grant in 2019-20 was <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/reverse-cuts-public-health-funding\">\u00a3850</a><a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/reverse-cuts-public-health-funding\">m</a><a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/reverse-cuts-public-health-funding\"> lower in real terms than initial allocations in 2015</a><a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/reverse-cuts-public-health-funding\">-16.</a></p> <p>Today, the repercussions of fragmentation and underfunding are clear. Scaling up Covid-19 testing requires a community surveillance system that integrates PHE local outbreak management teams with NHS primary care facilities and laboratories. In its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan\">3 March </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan\">Covid-19 action plan</a>, PHE<strong> </strong>assured us that \u201conce a case has been detected, our public health agencies use tried-and-tested procedures for rapid tracing, monitoring and isolation of close contacts, with the aim of preventing further spread\u201d. By all accounts, this didn\u2019t happen at scale. On 12 March PHE stopped all community testing as part of the government\u2019s delay strategy, instead focusing its efforts on patients and health workers.</p> <p>The third question is political. This epidemic has tested the reigning political emphasis on market mechanisms and public-private partnerships, and found it wanting. During a national epidemic, our system of outsourced providers and internal markets simply doesn\u2019t work. As one senior British doctor close to the Covid-19 crisis organisation told me, the chaos of the UK\u2019s response has \u201creflected the wholesale destruction of a coordinated and focused state sector. Outsourcing, delegated powers, internal markets \u2026 have made a single response impossible. It is affecting every aspect of policy.\u201d</p> <p>A fourth question concerns the pool of experts advising the government. Vallance has stated that UK Sage comprises the best of British science \u2013 with expertise in virology, mathematical modelling and behavioural science. But for an overall crisis response, UK Sage was too narrow in scope. It needed public health science, logistics, IT, social and citizen science, communications and community mobilisation expertise at the table. Government funding for health has always had a strong bias towards clinical medicine. According to one <a href=\"https://media.nesta.org.uk/documents/The_Biomedical_Bubble_v6.pdf\">2018 report from Nesta</a>, 94% of all health research funds are spent on clinical medicine, drugs and biosciences; only 6% is divided between psychology and behavioural sciences, and public and community health. During an epidemic, public health expertise is vital.</p> <p>But perhaps the gravest problem with the UK\u2019s response is that it didn\u2019t act sooner. The 12 March decision to stop community testing meant the government effectively gave up on containing the spread of the epidemic. In South Korea, regional data and maps about coronavirus deaths are available <a href=\"https://coronaboard.kr/en/\">online</a><em>, </em>and virus test data shows that just two out of 18 regions account for 84% of cases<em>. </em>The UK doesn\u2019t have a reliable regional data bank because it collected too little community information. Where South Korea and China used digital apps to assist contact tracing, clinical deterioration and quarantine compliance, NHS Digital has simply recorded data since 18 March on 111 calls and online assessments. This data is not linked to community case surveillance or quarantine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/why-uk-coronavirus-testing-work-catchup\">Why the UK failed to get coronavirus testing up to speed | Paul Hunter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe it is already too late in the day for the government to remedy these mistakes. Pandemics move fast; if you don\u2019t get ahead of a virus, it quickly spreads. The government stuck stubbornly to its delay policy to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d through social distancing alone, despite the evidence of epidemic suppression through testing in South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Germany, which have all recorded lower death rates.</p> <p>On 23 March Paul Romer, a Nobel prize-winning economist, wrote a <a href=\"https://paulromer.net/covid-sim-part1/\">blog</a><a href=\"https://paulromer.net/covid-sim-part1/\">post</a> about his models of social distancing and community mass testing. \u201cIf we contrast a nonspecific policy of social distance with a targeted policy guided by frequent testing \u2026 how much more disruptive is the nonspecific policy? Answer? Way more disruptive.\u201d Though an economy can survive with 10% of its population in isolation, it can\u2019t survive when that figure is 50% or above. Without community surveillance and testing in place to detect new outbreaks and isolate individuals once the current lockdown is lifted, we face hugely damaging national lockdowns, over and over again. Any self-respecting Cobra, UK Sage or pandemic crisis team should have realised the importance of mass testing from the outset, and never allowed this to happen.</p> <p>\u2022 Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL and a former director of maternal and child health at the WHO</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>These are trying times for the BBC. The government talks about abolishing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc-licence-fee\">licence fee</a>. Certain newspapers compete to haul the programme makers over the coals for various crimes, from \u201cwoke\u201d casting to \u201cmucking around\u201d with classics. There are rumours of declining ratings and mutterings about the muscle of Netflix and Amazon. Add to that a pandemic that has forced some of the corporation\u2019s biggest dramas \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/23/it-makes-you-go-oh-my-god-how-line-of-duty-broke-the-laws-of-police-shows\">Line of Duty</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/20/brad-pitt-snoop-dogg-asap-rocky-peaky-blinders-steven-knight-gangster-series\">Peaky Blinders</a> \u2013 to cease production and it would be no surprise to find Piers Wenger in a pessimistic mood. In fact, the opposite is true.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a really mad time,\u201d says the head of BBC drama. \u201cBut it\u2019s also been inspiring in terms of the ingenuity creators, producers and casts are showing to get their shows on screen.\u201d He\u2019s been holding \u201cdaily calls to talk about the longer term impact this crisis will have on the kind of story audiences are most in need of\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ccfb8442c2238c70e07cd89b50bbcb61a7d9676e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccfb8442c2238c70e07cd89b50bbcb61a7d9676e/517_185_1290_1291/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Piers Wenger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Drama for me\u2019 \u2026 Piers Wenger.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Lawrence/Channel 4 Pictures</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been talks, too, about how to protect the BBC\u2019s huge swath of freelance talent. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the day talking about how the BBC will support small and medium-sized production companies who will find the closedown particularly challenging \u2013 and how we work with established industry bodies to support freelancers, through a hardship fund or some other means. It\u2019s something we\u2019re taking seriously because, yes, people expect the BBC to do the right thing \u2013 and quite rightly, given the way we\u2019re funded.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wenger is clearly pleased with the swiftness of the corporation\u2019s wider response to the pandemic, from the extended news coverage to an array of educational, health and cultural programming, not to mention the decision to bring back old favourites such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/spooks\">Spooks</a> to iPlayer. \u201cWe need to shape the output \u2013 whether you\u2019re school age, seeking escape, looking for drama at 9pm, or want a comedy that really makes you laugh and reflects the soul of the nation, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/17/this-country-series-three-review-bbc-mockumentary-charlie-and-daisy-may-cooper-cotswolds-comedy\">This Country</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>That said, it\u2019s clear the past few days have brought a sea change. When we first talked, pre-lockdown, Wenger stressed the importance of \u201cdrama for me\u201d, as he called it. \u201cNot me personally, but rather for particular demographics instead of a broad mainstream.\u201d This is theme close to the 47-year-old\u2019s heart. Since leaving Channel 4 as head of drama in 2016, he has worked hard to overhaul how the BBC commissions drama, shifting from the general to the specific, to fulfil \u201cbespoke\u201d viewer needs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>People take great comfort from watching together with the rest of the nation</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cIf you look at work we\u2019ve got coming up this year and compare it with what might have been commissioned for BBC One five or 10 years ago, you would see how we are making drama for a very diverse range,\u201d he said pre-virus. \u201cWe would never underestimate the power of communal viewing, but we have to be flexible in the terms of the way we platform our drama. I feel that our current slate is serving the whole population rather than just super-serving the heartlands.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking now, he admits to a different focus. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to see the extent to which audiences are coming together to enjoy shows that have a really strong universal appeal. Whether it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/26/the-repair-shop-we-can-fix-anything-but-a-broken-heart-and-brexit\">The Repair Shop</a> or Ant and Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway, I think people are taking great comfort from watching together, and knowing they are watching along with the rest of the nation \u2013 whereas up to now, the general trend was to seek out stories that were more bespoke. Audiences will continue to want those very particular pieces, but this period will also be a reminder of the sense of community that television can bring to the nation.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc64d69af754b77fa5ab59e9d7685cc015911788\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc64d69af754b77fa5ab59e9d7685cc015911788/0_263_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the fixers of The Repair Shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sense of community \u2026 the fixers of The Repair Shop.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Peskett/BBC/Ricochet Ltd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So he\u2019s particularly pleased about two upcoming adaptations: David Nicholls\u2019 take on his bestselling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/01/us-david-nicholls-review-fiction\">marriage-in-crisis novel </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/01/us-david-nicholls-review-fiction\">Us</a>, starring Tom Hollander, Saskia Reeves and Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l; and Normal People, which tackles Sally Rooney\u2019s much-admired young-and-in-love second novel. \u201cUs might not be a super-tanker of a show, but it has a lot of heart and a lot to say about family. While Normal People is both a thrilling ride and incredibly emotionally honest. I think audiences will enjoy losing themselves in the lives of its protagonists.\u201d</p> \n<p>Not that he\u2019s back-pedalling his support of the year\u2019s most innovative dramas, including the sleek period crime thriller The Serpent; Michaela Coel\u2019s provocative contemporary drama January 22nd; and Small Axe, Steve McQueen\u2019s anthology series about black British history. Interestingly, all will air on BBC One.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ff30817255e1ea42ce686be0c3705d552a25b77\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ff30817255e1ea42ce686be0c3705d552a25b77/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jenna Coleman and Tahar Rahim in The Serpent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleek \u2026 Jenna Coleman and Tahar Rahim in The Serpent.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roland Neveu/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhy should a voice like Michaela\u2019s be confined to the margins?\u201d Wenger says. \u201cStories like this and Small Axe haven\u2019t been given the big platform they deserve. We\u2019re looking to give the mainstream audience as much stimulation as we can. It makes sense to embrace the most diverse range of storytellers that we can. Having Michaela and Steve on BBC One in the same year is massive for the BBC.\u201d</p> \n<p>Is he concerned that the lockdown might lead to delays? \u201cWe\u2019re in the very early stages,\u201d he says. \u201cWith Small Axe, Steve has finished shooting and has been editing each episode. We are currently on course, although much will depend on how long the lockdown lasts. Steve has been incredibly pragmatic but there are also obviously things he\u2019s going to be incredibly rigorous about. So it\u2019s hard to say for sure, although the signs are positive.\u201d</p> \n<p>He is, however, prepared for a backlash when the shows do air. The recent adaptation of Malorie Blackman\u2019s best-selling young adult novel Noughts + Crosses, about a world where black people rule over white people, was called a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-8076381/The-BBCs-Noughts-Crosses-recipe-division-Calvin-Robinson-argues.html\">recipe for division</a>\u201d in the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, the casting of Vinette Robinson, who is black, as Mary Cratchit in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/22/a-christmas-carol-review-twee-free-torment-fest-is-a-tonic-for-our-times\">A Christmas Carol</a> led to predictable complaints.</p> \n<p>\u201cOh, the whole woke thing,\u201d says Wenger laughing. \u201cFor us not to choose Vinette Robinson, who was the best actress put up for that part, is like saying there weren\u2019t any black people in London in the 19th century, which is just historically inaccurate among other things.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e3554e3c-0b5d-49a7-ba95-1b1ab3f69e3a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VnfQZLhdeDU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He pauses. \u201cSome people like work to be adapted in a quite conservative way. But, you know, we do that as well. The adaptations of A Suitable Boy [due later this year] and Normal People are extremely faithful to the text because they haven\u2019t been adapted before. There were complaints about A Christmas Carol and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/17/the-war-of-the-worlds-review-doom-dystopia-and-a-dash-of-downton\">War of the Worlds</a> but those stories had been adapted so many times. If we adapted them in their most faithful form, people might ask, \u2018Well, why bother?\u2019 It\u2019s not so much about being deliberately woke as about having a range of approaches.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the pandemic has put talk of cuts and threats to the licence fee on hold, are there still concerns? \u201cOf course. None of us can ignore the discourse around the BBC. For me, conversations about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/05/bbc-facing-funding-cut-as-licence-fee-consultation-launched\">decriminalisation</a> of licence fee non-payment and a subscription model for the BBC just point back in the direction of the importance of being a universal service.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe serve the heartland, but you have to think about young audiences and diverse audiences and audiences across the whole nation to justify the licence fee. Quite often when I\u2019m thinking about what to commission, I think who are the hardest people to convince? Which are the toughest nuts to crack? How can I give them a show that will be irresistible to them?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4637ea899ab1899bf2e9efb0b298e9ce9e528389\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4637ea899ab1899bf2e9efb0b298e9ce9e528389/0_286_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On course \u2026 Steve McQueen is making Small Axe, a period drama about black British history.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On course \u2026 Steve McQueen is making Small Axe, a period drama about black British history.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/McQueen Limited</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Small Axe, a little-told history that speaks to an audience Wenger feels has been ignored, is crucial in this regard. The first episode of McQueen\u2019s anthology series focuses on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/nov/29/mangrove-nine-40th-anniversary\">Mangrove Nine</a>, a group of black activists who were tried in 1970 for inciting a riot; they had been protesting against police targeting the Mangrove Restaurant in Notting Hill, London, a gathering place for intellectuals and activists. \u201cIt gave me the same visceral thrill as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/mar/06/hunger-reel-history-bobby-sands-hunger-strike\">Hunger</a>. It\u2019s a defining piece of work from Steve McQueen, told with such purpose and drive and anger that you are stopped in your tracks.\u201d</p> \n<p>He hopes it will address the ongoing exodus of black British actors to America. \u201cThe more work like Small Axe, the more work like January 22nd, the more work like Noughts + Crosses, the more we send a positive message that they don\u2019t have to go.

  "<p>Think of Antarctica and it is probably sweeping expanses of ice, and the odd penguin, that come to mind. But at the time of the dinosaurs the continent was covered in swampy rainforest.</p> <p>Now experts say they have found the most southerly evidence yet of this environment in plant material extracted from beneath the seafloor in west Antarctica.</p> <p>The Cretaceous, 145m to 66m years ago, was a warm period during which Earth had a greenhouse climate and vegetation grew in Antarctica.</p> <p>Scientists say the new discovery not only reveals that swampy rainforests were thriving near the south pole about 90m years ago but that temperatures were higher than expected. Such conditions, they add, could only have been produced if carbon dioxide levels were far higher than previously thought and there were no glaciers in the region.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that this Cretaceous greenhouse climate was that extreme,\u201d said Dr Johann Klages of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany and a co-author of the research. \u201cIt shows us what carbon dioxide is able to do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc8cdf159f76011fb83a3f378ae49dd54e74fd4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc8cdf159f76011fb83a3f378ae49dd54e74fd4a/0_0_2592_1555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The seafloor drilling rig at work by the edge of the Pine Island glacier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The seafloor drilling rig at work by the edge of the Pine Island glacier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karsten Gohl/Alfred Wegener Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2148-5\">Writing in the journal Nature</a>, the team explained how, in 2017, they drilled a narrow hole down into the seafloor near the Pine Island glacier in west Antarctica. This location is about 2,000km (1,200 miles) from today\u2019s south pole, but about 90m years ago it was about 900km from the pole.</p> <p>The hole was drilled and material extracted using a remotely operated rig. \u201cIt is like a spaceship sitting on the seafloor,\u201d said Klages.</p> <p>The first few metres of material were glacial sediment, dating to about 25,000 years ago, while the next 25m were sandstone, dating to about 45m years ago \u2013 something Klages said was of little interest to the team.</p> <p>As they worked, a huge field of sea ice was approaching. \u201cIt was getting a little dangerous,\u201d said Klages. \u201cWe said: \u2018OK, three more metres and then we can evacuate the coring site here.\u2019 And in this three metres we had this exciting new material.\u201d</p> <p>This three-metre section was composed of mudstone, topped by a coal-like material, and packed with soil from the ancient forest, complete with roots, spores and pollen \u2013 with the latter identified as coming from plants including conifer trees and ferns.</p> <p>\u201cIt is like if you would go to a forest near your house somewhere and drill a hole into the forest soil,\u201d said Klages. \u201cIt is really pristine \u2026 it was amazing.\u201d</p> <p>The team found evidence of more than 65 different kinds of plants within the material, revealing that the landscape near the south pole would have been covered in a swampy conifer rainforest similar to that found today in the north-western part of the South Island of New Zealand. The material was dated to between 92m and 83m years ago.</p> <p>It would have had average annual temperatures of 12-13C (53-55F), \u201cwhich is warmer than in Germany today\u201d, Klages said, adding that analysis of chemicals left by photosynthetic organisms called cyanobacteria revealed that surface waters, for example of lakes, would have been a pleasant 20C.</p> <p>Crucially, said Kages, computer modelling shows that such an environment so close to the south pole \u2013 where in the winter there is darkness for four months \u2013 would only have been possible if greenhouse gas concentrations were far higher than previously thought and the land surface were covered in vegetation.</p> <p>In other words there were no ice sheets present \u2013 something Klages noted had been a matter of debate.</p> <p>Dr James Bendle, an expert in organic geochemistry from the University of Birmingham, said that studying the Antarctic ecosystem was hugely important in understanding past and future climate change, adding that unabated use of fossil fuels use could push concentrations of carbon dioxide to levels similar to those 90m years ago by the start of the next century.</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, if we have an atmosphere of more than 1,000 parts per million of carbon dioxide, we are committing ourselves to a future planet that has little to no ice, and ultimately an Antarctic continent that would be vegetated and wouldn\u2019t have an ice cover,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>The glory of the world\u2019s oceans could be restored within a generation, according to a major new scientific review. It reports rebounding sea life, from humpback whales off Australia to elephant seals in the US and green turtles in Japan.</p> <p>Through rampant overfishing, pollution and coastal destruction, humanity has inflicted severe damage on the oceans and its inhabitants for centuries. But conservation successes, while still isolated, demonstrate the remarkable resilience of the seas.</p> <p>The scientists say there is now the knowledge to create an ocean renaissance for wildlife by 2050 and with it bolster the services that the world\u2019s people rely on, from food to coastal protection to climate stability. The measures needed, including protecting large swathes of ocean, sustainable fishing and pollution controls, would cost billions of dollars a year, the scientists say, but would bring benefits 10 times as high.</p> <p>However, the escalating climate crisis must also be tackled to protect the oceans from acidification, loss of oxygen and the devastation of coral reefs. The good news, the scientists say, is a growing awareness of the ability of oceans and coastal habitats such as mangroves and salt marshes to rapidly soak up carbon dioxide and bolster shorelines against rising sea levels.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a narrow window of opportunity to deliver a healthy ocean to our grandchildren, and we have the knowledge and tools to do so,\u201d said Prof Carlos Duarte, of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, who led the review. \u201cFailing to embrace this challenge, and in so doing condemning our grandchildren to a broken ocean unable to support good livelihoods is not an option.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Callum Roberts, at the University of York, one of the review\u2019s international team, said: \u201cOverfishing and climate change are tightening their grip, but there is hope in the science of restoration.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the overarching messages of the review is, if you stop killing sea life and protect it, then it does come back.

  "<p>After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/britain-covid-19-head-start-squandered\">squandering valuable time</a> to prepare for the spread of Covid-19 in February and the first half of March, the government made a dramatic U-turn and put the country into lockdown two weeks ago. But amid the drama of shutting down our entire way of life \u2013 with kids out of school, shops closed and millions working from home \u2013 we appear to have forgotten that lockdown itself is not the solution to coronavirus. It is simply a means of slowing its spread and buying time \u2013 while we race to catch up.</p> <p>The real question facing Britain now is how to most effectively make up for lost time: what can we really do to fight this instead of simply cowering in our homes and waiting for it to blow over? If things carry on much as they are now, one possible scenario is that we will find ourselves in an endless cycle of lockdown and release over the next year \u2013 while the population slowly acquires the virus and hopefully gains immunity.</p> <p>From Chinese data reported to the World Health Organization, we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/what-happens-to-peoples-lungs-when-they-get-coronavirus-acute-respiratory-covid-19\">estimate that roughly 80% of people</a> who contract the virus will not need medical attention and will have mild symptoms (largely children and people under 40); 14% will have severe disease including pneumonia; 5% will require critical care for respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure; and 1-2% will die regardless of medical care. Therefore, the challenge for the government (in the absence of a vaccine or treatment) is to ensure that healthcare capacity is not overwhelmed; that while the virus is transmitted throughout the population, the 19% who require either hospitalisation or an ICU bed are able to access that care and survive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/doctors-choose-life-saving-treatment-ethical-rules\">Doctors will have to choose who gets life-saving treatment. Here's how we'll do it | John Chisholm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The burden on the NHS will be tremendous, especially given concerns about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/31/nhs-staff-gagged-over-coronavirus-protective-equipment-shortages\">lack of appropriate personal protective equipment</a>, and this will have knock-on effects on other services it offers: routine surgery, cancer treatment, the ability to deal with emergencies such as heart attacks and strokes. The decision whether to extend lockdown will be made by looking at the modelling of NHS capacity in three weeks\u2019 time as well as assessing public willingness to comply.</p> <p>In an optimistic version of the above, over the next three to four months an antiviral therapy would be discovered while we hold out for a vaccine. Antiviral therapies would give doctors an additional tool to treat critical patients with, while vaccines would provide a prevention measure so individuals can build up immunity and the necessary antibodies before being exposed to Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Effective therapies have helped with how we deal with HIV/Aids (antiretrovirals), malaria (antimalarials) while vaccines have been effective against measles, mumps and rubella. Repurposing a drug that has already been tested for safety in humans would be the quickest path, and clinical trials are taking place for antimalarial cocktails (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), remdesivir and plasma therapies, which involve extracting antibodies from recovered patients and injecting them into ill patients.</p> <p>The endgame would be a vaccine that is widely available, effective and affordable. Currently there are about two dozen vaccine candidates, with several being tested on animals and one imminently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-it-be-ready-covid-19\">due to begin</a> testing on humans. However, time is the problem, as vaccines require three phases of clinical trials to test for safety, side effects and whether they actually work. It will take about a year to 18 months even if all goes to plan \u2013 and even then, given all countries would be looking to acquire the vaccine, manufacturing enough of it would present a further challenge.</p> <p>But instead of quarantining the entire population (and assuming anyone could be carrying the virus), the most pragmatic way out would be via a more nuanced and data-driven approach of mass-testing 75-100,000 people per day. This would not be testing random people but rather those presenting with symptoms, and then tracing all of their contacts (household members, colleagues, flatmates) to ensure they are also tested. All those who are virus-carriers would be put into a mandatory two-week quarantine in their homes, enforced through tracking and fines. This will allow the public health community to identify where exactly the virus is, to break further chains of transmission and to keep case numbers low and within the NHS capacity limit.

The government needs an exit strategy, which may be gradual and initially involve those who have had the virus and are able to travel and go back to work. If we have a lockdown for too long there will be a rebellion against it.\u201d</p> \n<p>King said it was pointless to speculate on the extent of the health and economic damage caused by the crisis, but emphasised that there would be significant costs in terms of failed businesses, lost jobs and increased unhappiness.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is understandable that health officials focus on the broad-brush aspect of this \u2013 the need for a lockdown to diminish the spread of the virus,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9980d40c-07e2-4e5a-8ae3-5056907866ee\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Income subsidies</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Direct cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to \u00a32,500 a month.

Young people are having their university education and school exams cancelled, and that it is going to have a significant impact of their wellbeing and future careers.\u201d</p> \n<p>King added the government had made a deliberate decision to lock down the economy and so had a responsibility to ensure cash flow to businesses big and small, and to act as the customer of last resort.</p> \n<p>The Treasury needed to speed up its plan to offer financial help to the self-employed because the target date of early June would be too late for many, he said.</p> \n<p>Alistair Darling, the chancellor responsible for bailing out stricken banks at the beginning of the 2008 crisis, said the government was failing to provide a consistent message on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/testing-for-coronavirus-what-being-done-in-uk\">testing </a>for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is critical in any crisis that the message has clarity\u201d, Darling said. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t know whether the government is going beyond NHS staff to the public as a whole. Unless we know who has got it or who has had it, we are always going to be on the back foot.\u201d</p> \n<p>Darling also said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, needed to make sure measures were having an impact where they were needed.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is very easy to announce a policy, but much more difficult to get it delivered.

France and Germany have donated more masks to Italy than China, according to the EU executive, which trumpeted the statistics on social media amid alarm it was losing the <a href=\"https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/76379/corona-virus-pandemic-and-new-world-it-creating_en\">\u201cthe global battle of narratives\u201d</a> over \u201cthe politics of generosity\u201d. In the early phase of the crisis, Russia and China sent medical supplies to Italy, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/italy-criticises-eu-being-slow-help-coronavirus-epidemic\">its nearest neighbours failed to immediately respond to Rome\u2019s calls for help</a>.</p> <p>While European leaders have converged on a response to the public health crisis - a pledge to revamp the EU crisis management system, funding for vaccine research and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/uk-discussed-joint-eu-plan-to-buy-covid-19-medical-supplies-say-officials\">joint procurement of medical kit</a> - countries remain divided over how to help the economy weather the storm. The pandemic has reopened the wounds of the eurozone crisis, resurrecting stereotypes about \u201cprofligate\u201d southern Europeans and \u201chard-hearted\u201d northerners. \u201cEach crisis has reduced trust between member states and within the whole system and this is a real problem,\u201d said Heather Grabbe, a former adviser to the EU enlargement commissioner.</p> <p>The Dutch finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-finance-minister-acknowledges-lack-of-empathy-on-corona-bonds/\">voiced contrition </a>this week after infuriating his neighbours by asking why other governments didn\u2019t have fiscal buffers to deal with the financial shock of the coronavirus. His comments were described as \u201crepugnant\u201d, \u201csmall-minded\u201d and \u201ca threat to the EU\u2019s future\u201d by Portugal\u2019s prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa.</p> <p>Europe is still entrenched in two camps over how to respond to the economic fallout caused by Covid-19. France, Italy, Spain and at least half a dozen others want to break with convention by issuing joint eurozone debt, so-called \u201ccorona bonds\u201d. Germany, Austria and the Netherlands continue to shun the idea. At a summit last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/eu-leaders-clash-over-economic-response-to-coronavirus-crisis\">European leaders failed to reach a decision</a>, passing the problem to finance ministers, who have been instructed to find a way out of the impasse by next week.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the all-consuming coronavirus crisis threatens to divert EU attention from the erosion of democratic standards in Hungary. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">newly</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\"> adopted emergency law</a> caps Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s decade-long project of centralising power that has left Hungary the first EU country to be classed as only <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/hungary\">\u201cpartly free\u201d by Freedom House.</a></p> <p>Grabbe, who now leads the Open Society European Policy Institute in Brussels, thinks attention on the virus risks lessening attention on Hungary. \u201cOrb\u00e1n is very skilled at choosing his political moment,\u201d she says. \u201cHe has often done this before when politicians in other countries are distracted. He introduces new measures and waits for the fuss to die down.\u201d</p> <p>Luuk van Middelaar, a professor of EU law who worked for the European council president during the eurozone crisis, believes the EU can improvise a way out of current divisions. \u201cThe EU is internally ill-equipped to deal with any crisis or unforeseen circumstances, and yet each time under the pressure of events it improvises solutions.\u201d</p> <p>During the eurozone crisis it took \u201ctwo years of drama and near-death experiences\u201d to fashion the solution of European banking union, \u201cas it always takes time for interests and minds to converge ... This time we don\u2019t have that much time so that is worrying.\u201d</p> <p>Tocci, director of Italy\u2019s Institute for International Affairs, thinks the EU can rescue the situation by moving the coronabonds debate on to more \u201ccool-headed, technical\u201d terrain. \u201cWho is actually going to emit these bonds \u2026 What are these bonds going to be for? And if one actually manages to give specific technical answers to these questions then it could be an opportunity to break the ice on a debate that has become so polarised.\u201d</p> <p>Letta envisages a \u201ccorona deal\u201d that avoids the divisive question of mutualised debt by having bonds issued by the European Investment Bank, the EU\u2019s lending arm. But Germany and the Netherlands also need to move, according to the Italian former prime minister. \u201cThe key point to the Germans and the Dutch: please don\u2019t block, don\u2019t stop European measures that we can take together.\u201d</p> <p>Any deal carries the seeds of a future argument. Every time the EU has strengthened its hand in response to a crisis, whether centralised refugee policy or oversight of national budgets, there has been resistance and resentment, according to Middelaar. \u201cThe Germans have still not fully digested the role of the European Central Bank as the lender of last resort,\u201d he said while mandatory refugee quotas deepened the cleavage between western and central European countries. \u201cIt\u2019s just worth remembering that Italy does not have a monopoly on Eurosceptic politicians. In Germany and the Netherlands there are also Eurosceptics waiting to exploit this issue.\u201d</p> <p>European leaders\u2019 response will ultimately shape public opinion. When Italians felt they had been left alone by Europe in the early phase of the pandemic, confidence in the European project shrank. A <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_whatever_it_takes_italy_and_covid_19_crisis\">poll conducted on 12-13 March</a> found that 88% of Italians felt Europe was failing to support Italy, while 67% saw EU membership as a disadvantage - a remarkable result for a founding member state, where the EU once basked in high levels of support.</p> <p>If European division prevails, the memory will stick of the time when China and Russia rushed to Italy\u2019s aid, thinks Tocci. Italian confidence in the EU \u201cdepends more on what Europe does than what the Chinese and Russia do\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think that the jury is still out as to whether Europe is going to do what it takes to come out stronger from this.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Italy extends lockdown</h2> <p>Anti-coronavirus lockdown measures in Italy are to be extended to April 13, the health minister, Roberto Speranza, has said. He told the Senate on Wednesday: \u201cWe must not confuse the first positive signals with an \u2018all clear\u2019 signal. Data shows that we are on the right path and that the drastic decisions are bearing fruit.\u201d</p> <p>Although data has shown that the total number of cases in the country is slowing \u2013 with 4,053 new infections on Tuesday \u2013 the death toll remains at over 800 a day.</p> <h2>Spain passes 100,000 confirmed cases</h2> <p>Spain has crossed the threshold of 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, health officials said on Wednesday. According to official figures, it has more cases than any country except Italy and the US. Spain also reached a record single-day death toll between Tuesday and Wednesday, with a total of 864 deaths. The country has logged 102,136 cases of the virus and 9,053 deaths.</p> <h2>Russia delivers masks and medical equipment to US</h2> <p>Russia has dispatched a cargo plane with masks and medical equipment to the US after Donald Trump accepted an offer of humanitarian aid from Vladimir Putin to fight the coronavirus outbreak. The delivery is likely to stir controversy among critics of Trump, who have said Putin will portray the goodwill gesture as a public relations coup and use it to bolster Russia\u2019s efforts to escape sanctions for meddling in the 2016 US elections.</p> <h2>UK government aims for 25,000 tests a day within two weeks</h2> <p>The UK government is aiming to test 25,000 a day for Covid-19 within a fortnight, the housing minister has said. Downing Street is facing mounting criticism over a lack of testing compared with other nations, with only 143,186 carried out to date. By comparison, Germany is testing 70,000 a day.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s Covid-19 death toll <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\">jumped 381 in a single day </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public\">on Tuesday, with overall fatalities standing at 1,789.</a> More than 25,000 people have tested positive for the virus.</p> <p>The UK health secretary has ordered all spare coronavirus tests to be used for NHS workers, as it emerged only a small proportion of those in isolation appear to really be ill with the virus.</p> <h2>Global deaths pass 43,000</h2> <p>Data collected by Johns Hopkins University researchers shows at least 43,291 people have died around the world. At least 874,000 have been infected.</p> <h2>US deaths could reach 240,000</h2> <p>The White House has said 240,000 people could die of Covid-19 in the US. Models indicate at least 100,000 will die. Donald Trump said the country should expect a \u201cvery, very painful two weeks\u201d. US deaths currently exceed those in China.<strong> </strong>Monday was the deadliest day yet for the US, which has now lost more than 4,076 people.</p> <h2>Briton among coronavirus victims on Zaandam cruise ship</h2> <p>A British national is among four people to have died on the coronavirus-stricken Zaandam cruise ship embroiled in a bitter dispute over plans to disembark passengers in the US, the PA Media news agency reports.</p> <h2>China moves to focus on asymptomatic cases</h2> <p>China reported 36 new Covid-19 cases and 130 new asymptomatic cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of such cases under observation to 1,367. Previously, China has regarded asymptomatic patients as a low risk and not included them in their tally of confirmed cases. The move to disclose the number of asymptomatic cases comes amid scrutiny of China\u2019s reported figures, which previously only included people who exhibited symptoms.</p>",

With no solution to the impasse in sight, and UKA facing a crippling financial blow if its flagship event is not staged, Warner has urged both sides to think laterally and creatively and send a goodwill message to the Olympic host city that has seen its Games postponed for 12 months.</p> <p>\u201cThe ill-advised cost-saving exercise when the stadium was revamped after the London 2012 Games means that reconfiguring the seating takes around two weeks,\u201d Warner said. \u201cThis is a hugely labour-intensive exercise reported to cost up to a staggering \u00a38m a time, and social distancing guidelines militate against a nonessential project like the stadium seat move.</p> <p>\u201cNow, then, is the time for creativity. UKA, with the backing of the London mayor and DCMS [the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport], should offer the hosting rights for this year\u2019s Anniversary Games to Tokyo, free of charge. The Japanese capital would not be constrained by UKA\u2019s London Stadium calendar but could work with World Athletics to find a window in late summer or early autumn to stage a joyous two-day celebration of world-class athletics once, hopefully, the global pandemic has abated.</p> <p>\u201cTokyo should be encouraged to revert to the Anniversary Games\u2019 original structure and add a third day of elite Para athletics, so creating the tastiest of appetisers for both next year\u2019s Olympics and Paralympics.\u201d</p> <p>Warner, writing on the iSportConnect website, said he was convinced that the World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, would recognise the value of the switch. He also believed the BBC, UKA\u2019s broadcast partner, would be delighted with an event likely to pull in an audience of \u201cmaybe five or 10 times its usual two million viewers\u201d, while M\u00fcller, the headline commercial partner, \u201cwould receive unimagined global exposure\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Legacy Company would save the exorbitant costs of moving the London Stadium\u2019s seats, more than enough to make a payment equal to the average profit UKA made from the event in recent years,\u201d Warner said. \u201cThis would shore up the governing body\u2019s fragile finances and remove the virus uncertainty hanging over it.

  "<p>On Wednesday night the players of Diriang\u00e9n, the oldest club in Nicaragua, will put on their face masks before they line up for kick-off and hope for the best. They are third in the country\u2019s Liga Primera and a home match against fourth-placed Walter Ferretti offers a chance to put the heat on those ahead while widening the six-point gap between the sides.</p> <p>It is tight at the top but Diriang\u00e9n have little appetite to compete and will do so from obligation alone.

We want to suspend the tournament but all the clubs have voted and the majority want to continue.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/31/uefa-fears-football-season-unlikely-to-resume-before-end-of-june\">Football authorities fear season is unlikely to resume before start of June</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although circumstances are being reviewed weekly in a country that has publicly confirmed five cases of Covid-19, Diriang\u00e9n were the only club to oppose the league\u2019s continuation at its 10 clubs\u2019 latest meeting on Tuesday. The line from most of their rivals, including Wednesday\u2019s opponents, is that they will play until the ministry of health says it is unsafe to do so. It is virtually impossible to find anyone elsewhere in the division who will go on record to deviate from that view.</p> <p>Unpicking the situation requires a journey into the complex and murky world of Nicaraguan football. A condensed explanation is that almost all roads lead to the country\u2019s president, Daniel Ortega, a strongman for whom football represents a potent arm of internal power and a vision of stability to the outside world. </p> <p>Diriang\u00e9n are understood to be the only top-flight club with little or no funding from an arm of the state, although four would describe themselves as privately owned. It makes them outliers in a deeply repressive environment in which most of those competing are entirely dependent on direction from above.</p> <p>Ortega\u2019s regime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/16/nicaragua-protest-ortega-government-one-year\" title=\"\">wobbled in April 2018</a> when a protest movement took to the streets; it was neutralised bloodily but a series of general strikes followed and the country\u2019s economy has nosedived.

Coronavirus became a big threat because they are scared of a general strike and shutting everything down would pretty much allow that.\u201d</p> <p>So football carries on. The Guardian interviewed two players from other teams and neither expressed doubts about persisting. \u201cThere is no concern on my part,\u201d says the Walter Ferretti forward Dshon Forbes. \u201cMy job is to play and while the institution in charge of health does not suspend these activities everything continues as normal.\u201d</p> <p>Pablo G\u00e1llego, a Spanish winger playing for Managua, adopted a near-identical tone and described himself as \u201csuper-happy\u201d with the club\u2019s care. \u201cIf I felt my physical integrity was at risk I\u2019m sure I could talk to them but we feel safe and feel appropriate measures are being taken,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Walter Ferretti are owned by the Nicaraguan police force, and Managua\u2019s players are paid by the capital city\u2019s mayoral office. That is not to reject the footballers\u2019 opinions out of hand but the incentives to opt against dissent are significant in a country believed to have 73 political prisoners.</p> <p>\u201cPlayers are very, very scared,\u201d explains Vel\u00e1squez, who says a number have messaged him privately to say they feel helpless and forced to play. \u201cWhen their income is football and the state is paying their salary, you can understand why they\u2019ll remain quiet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61717af2b30e5b55631ee91709583522adb95db1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61717af2b30e5b55631ee91709583522adb95db1/0_237_5341_3204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fan with a face mask watches Managua take on Diriang\u00e9n.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fan with a face mask watches Managua take on Diriang\u00e9n.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inti Oc\u00f3n/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been a few flickers of support for Diriang\u00e9n\u2019s stance. Real Madriz, who are seventh in the league, appeared to have stuck their head above the parapet when they announced on social media they would not fulfil their match at Real Estel\u00ed on 22 March. But that message was mysteriously taken down; Madriz turned up and lost the game, traditionally a home banker, 4-0.</p> <p>Public opinion, already low after a perceived lack of support from the nation\u2019s players during the uprising of 2018, appears firmly in favour of a pause. But, while club Twitter accounts remind their fans \u201cQu\u00e9date a casa\u201d (\u201cStay at home\u201d), their teams continue to compete, albeit behind closed doors since the most recent round of games. \u201cIt is uncomfortable for the players but they prefer to use masks,\u201d Salazar says. It is an arresting, uneasy image and one that brings the situation\u2019s absurdity home.</p> <p>One of Diriang\u00e9n\u2019s stars, the Costa Rican forward Sebasti\u00e1n Barquero, has been allowed to return home and players have been told there will be no recriminations if they decide to down tools.</p> <p>In the meantime everyone else awaits evidence that Ortega\u2019s version of normality bears some resemblance to the reality inside the country\u2019s hospitals and on the streets. \u201cThe first thing we have to take care of is the health of our people,\u201d Salazar says. \u201cWe continue to think we should not play.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The Labour peer and former MP Ted Graham, Lord Graham of Edmonton, who has died aged 94, was one of the foremost figures in the British co-operative movement in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. He owed his own advancement to the movement, which he had joined as an errand boy at Newcastle upon Tyne Co-operative, delivering groceries on a Co-op bike after leaving school at 14. Raised in prewar poverty in the Scotswood Road area of the city, he had passed the 11-plus but his family could not afford for him to attend grammar school.</p> <p>His lifetime journey to become the Labour party\u2019s chief whip in the House of Lords (1990-97) and to many of the major offices of the co-operative movement was one he never forgot. He was a kindly, popular man without a trace of self-importance. \u201cMy name is Ted Graham,\u201d he would say at public meetings, \u201cbut you can call me Lord.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/letter-lord-graham-of-edmonton-obituary\">Letter: Lord Graham of Edmonton obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When elected to the House of Commons in February 1974 as the Labour and Co-operative MP for the north London constituency of Edmonton, Graham devoted his maiden speech to education and the need for more public spending on schools and teacher training in order to reduce the disadvantages that still existed for many families in his constituency. He disclosed then that he himself got up in the early hours of every Sunday morning to study for a degree with the recently established Open University. He became the first MP to qualify for an OU degree two years later and in 2005 told the Lords that he was still the only parliamentarian to have graduated from \u201cthe university of the second chance\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Newcastle, the eldest of five children of an unemployed railway porter and his wife, Graham received elementary education at Westgate Road school. An episode seared in his childhood memory was when he was one of six boys called out of class to be given a pair of boots; an act of charity that made his mother cry at the humiliation of him being identified as among the poorest children in the school. After two years as a delivery boy, he became an office boy in 1941 and then joined up with the Royal Marines. In 1944, training for D-day on the English south coast, he was seriously injured when he was accidentally caught in a hail of machine gun fire. His life was saved by an American military surgeon in a US army field hospital.</p> <p>When demobilised in 1946 he returned to the co-op movement in the north-east. He started going to night school, doing correspondence courses with the Workers\u2019 Educational Association and attended the Co-operative College at Stanford Hall, Loughborough. In 1952 he became the organiser of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jan/26/peter-shea-obituary\">British Federation of Young Co-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jan/26/peter-shea-obituary\">operators</a> and the following year he moved south to a post with the Enfield Highway Co-operative Society. In 1962 he was appointed the southern secretary of the Co-operative Union. He was national secretary of the Co-operative party from 1967 until his election to parliament.</p> <p>Graham had first entered party politics in 1961 when he joined Enfield borough council, becoming leader. He understood the importance of local government, which he said later had taught him in a modest way \u201cboth the art of government and the constraints that prevail in government\u201d. He stood against Iain Macleod, then shadow chancellor, at Enfield West in the 1966 election before winning Edmonton.</p> <p>At Westminster he was immediately appointed parliamentary private secretary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/23/alan-williams\">Alan Williams</a>, minister of state at the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, and when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\">James Callaghan</a> succeeded as prime minister in 1976, Graham was made a senior government whip. This caused some minor unhappiness in the whips\u2019 office as he had been parachuted in over the heads of others, but he was a good organiser and hard-working. In 1980 he became an environment spokesman on the opposition front bench. When he lost his seat in 1983 he was promoted to the Lords, where he was Labour chief whip from 1990 to 1997 and then chaired the Labour peers\u2019 group until 2000. In 1998 he was made a member of the Privy Council.</p> <p>Graham continued to work closely with the co-op. He worked with the organisation to develop co-operative housing and he was also involved with the movement\u2019s attempt to resist the change in shop-working hours to allow Sunday trading in the early 1990s. He was a moderate rightwinger within the Labour party and was not afraid to stand up to some of the more radical trade unions, asserting his belief that \u201cprofit\u201d was not a dirty word. He was president of the Co-operative Congress in 1987 and chaired the UK Co-operative Council, the umbrella group for the movement, for a period from 1997.</p> <p>He was a humanist and told the Lords in a debate on faith issues in 2007: \u201cMy faith is in the human spirit and the ability of ordinary people to control their affairs.\u201d He was a keen swimmer and football enthusiast and supported Millwall. As a lad in the Co-op society shop, he once served Jackie Milburn, who promised to get him tickets if Newcastle United made it to Wembley. Ten years later, in 1951, Milburn delivered the ticket as well as the two winning goals in the Cup final \u2013 \u201ca real gent,\u201d said Graham.</p> <p>Graham was much admired for the courage with which he handled a family tragedy. His wife, Margaret (nee Golding), whom he married in 1950, was diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy, a muscular wasting genetic disorder. Their two sons both inherited the condition. Margaret died in 2005 and their sons shortly thereafter.</p> <p>\u2022 Thomas Edward Graham, Lord Graham of Edmonton, politician, born 26 March 1925; died 21 March 2020</p>",

The inquiry also did not see any evidence of the expected liaison with the FCO and UK or local authorities.\u201d</p> <p>The Charity Commission said Al-Fatiha Global\u2019s trustees failed to \u201cproperly safeguard their volunteers by failing to exercise any due diligence or risk management procedures, to provide any meaningful training, instructions and/or guidance to its volunteers\u201d.</p> <p>It said the trustees also failed to make sure its funds were only used to support, put in place adequate financial controls \u2013 despite its income rocketing from \u00a34,000 to \u00a31.2m between 2012 and 2013 \u2013 and failed to protect its volunteers, assets and property.</p> <p>Al-Fatiha Global has been contacted for a response.</p>",
  "<p>The Hungarian parliament, which has a two-thirds majority in favour of the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/hungary-emergency-law-incompatible-with-being-in-eu-say-meps-group-viktor-orban\">passed a bill on Monday</a> 30 March that extended his already strong powers. The bill, not supported by most opposition MPs, gives parliamentary authorisation to prolong the state of emergency the government declared on 11 March in light of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, the few remaining checks and balances in Hungary will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">cease to exist</a>, with the government ruling by decree with hardly any legal supervision. No elections and no rallies can be held. Hungary has become a textbook case of how coronavirus can be abused for authoritarian ends.</p> <p>There is no sunset clause in the text, so the<em> </em>state of emergency will be in force for as long as the government wants. Changes to the criminal code mean the publication of facts that interfere with the \u201csuccessful protection\u201d of the public could be punished by five years in prison \u2013 a clear message to journalists. The government now also wants to effectively take over the running of local municipalities through supervising the decisions of directly elected leaders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Viktor Orb\u00e1n is a role model for other illiberal leaders</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The constitutional court could theoretically overrule the decisions implemented during the state of emergency, but given that its rights have been curbed and it has been stuffed with pro-government loyalists in recent years, we cannot expect that it will serve as an effective counterweight to the cabinet\u2019s power. Likewise, although the parliament could officially terminate the state of emergency, it won\u2019t. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz-KDNP has a comfortable and loyal majority; there has been not a single case in the past 10 years when Fidesz MPs have not supported a governmental decision.</p> <p>Why is Orb\u00e1n doing this? For two reasons. The first is to label the opposition as the \u201csupporters of the coronavirus\u201d, instead of supporters of the people, winning the political debate in advance.</p> <p>Second: he sees this as the ideal opportunity for a power grab. When death is in the air, people tend to rally around their national flag, and their attention is narrowed. While the opposition and the free media covered the enabling act widely, the average Hungarian has seemed less concerned. He or she is more interested now in where to buy face masks.</p> <p>Strategically, Orb\u00e1n knows that this is the perfect time to act: every country is dealing with how to save the lives of their citizens and at the same time avoid total economic collapse. In times of such crises, countries are becoming more inward-looking. Foreign policy, in general, becomes less important. Human rights and the rule of law in other countries are issues of little importance for most politicians and citizens.</p> <p>But they should be. There are many reasons why this is not only a domestic issue for Hungary, and why the international press, politicians and institutions should pay attention.</p> <p>First, Orb\u00e1n is a role model for other illiberal leaders. If this experiment proves successful, many others will be encouraged to follow his path. If Hungary is not put in a political quarantine, a new wave of illiberalism will sweep through Europe, especially in the east. While there was strong criticism for Orb\u00e1n\u2019s latest move from many directions, the most important leaders of the biggest EU member states have remained silent about the enabling act. The president of the commission <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1244960501085491202\">tweeted</a> that emergency situations will be examined in all member states \u2013 without naming Hungary.</p> <p>Second, Orb\u00e1n is working hard to tarnish the image of western alliances. While Hungary received \u20ac5.6bn to help protect it from the pandemic, members of its ruling class have been loudly accusing the EU of doing nothing but lecturing Hungary about democracy. Orb\u00e1n justifies his eastern geopolitical shift, claiming that the EU is unable to help now \u2013 unlike China and members of the <a href=\"https://hungarytoday.hu/coronavirus-foreign-minister-thanks-turkic-council-countries-for-delivering-protective-gear-to-hungary/\">Turkic Council</a>: Uzbekistan and Turkey. Hungary buys masks and respirators from the former and also receives some from the latter two. Also, the general consensus that authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China are dealing with coronavirus much better than democracies is receiving a lot of airtime in the pro-government media.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/coronavirus-is-a-chance-for-authoritarian-leaders-to-tighten-their-grip\">Authoritarian leaders may use Covid-19 crisis to tighten their grip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Third, and this has received less attention, Orb\u00e1n will use this as an opportunity to refashion the economy in his image. This could be bad news for some foreign investors in Hungary \u2013 especially when the economic problems worsen. The government is currently deploying a military taskforce to oversee the operation of 140 companies providing critical services (for example energy and retail) in the public and the private sectors alike. There are plans for the government to save companies \u2013 on condition that it owns the company in turn. We can expect the coming global economic slowdown and the decline of budget revenues to usher in some \u201cunorthodox\u201d economic measures that go against mainstream economic policies. Multinational companies will likely face levies, as has been done before, but this time without any meaningful legal obstacles. EU funds may be redirected to line the pockets of pro-government cronies more than ever before.</p> <p>The nature of extraordinary legal measures is that they are easy to introduce, but hard to undo. The \u201crally around the flag\u201d effect won\u2019t last for ever. And as the economic consequences of the pandemic become worse, Orb\u00e1n may become increasingly unpopular \u2013 and the situation more desperate. The temptation to keep the emergency measures in place may become even stronger as the 2022 elections approach.</p> <ul> <li><p>P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3 is a political analyst and social psychologist.

She joins an illustrious cast of previous winners, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/31/zaha-hadid-maverick-architect-designer-appreciation\">Zaha Hadid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/16/the-scandal-of-architecture-invisible-women-denise-scott-brown\">Denise Scott Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/liz-diller-rebel-architect-moma-high-line-simon-rattle-centre-for-music\">Liz Diller</a>, but her career has been like no other, moving from glitzy corporate monuments to shelters built with the barest minimum of means.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"612cbd436a73d4b290ee5a4d15a4e5837064f572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/612cbd436a73d4b290ee5a4d15a4e5837064f572/0_83_931_559/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Pakistan State Oil headquarters in Karachi\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A power-dressed monument to the early 90s ... the Pakistan State Oil House in Karachi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Heritage Foundation of Pakistan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Widely celebrated as Pakistan\u2019s first female architect, Lari studied at Oxford Polytechnic (now Oxford Brookes University) before returning to her home country, where she began her practice with a series of <a href=\"http://www.sosbrutalism.org/cms/15889899\">daring brutalist homes</a> in the 1960s and 70s. She made her name with a number of prestigious state commissions in the 1980s, including <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/creating2000/235861605\">Karachi\u2019s finance and trade centre</a>, a <a href=\"https://dome.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.3/61592/153673_cp.jpg?sequence=1\">vast hotel</a> and a host of military barracks, as well as a <a href=\"https://archnet.org/sites/64\">low-income housing project</a> that favoured low-rise high-density over the fashion for concrete-slab blocks. Then, in 2000, she retired, primarily to focus on writing books about Pakistan\u2019s architectural history and put her energies into the <a href=\"http://www.heritagefoundationpak.org/Hf\">Heritage Foundation</a>, which she had founded with her husband in 1980.</p> <p>\u201cCorruption levels in the country had greatly increased and I was sick of always struggling to try and please the big corporate clients,\u201d she says, \u201cespecially when they had no understanding of architecture. Writing seemed like a much more attractive option.\u201d</p> <p>But her quiet life wasn\u2019t to last. In 2005, an earthquake of 7.6 magnitude on the Richter scale <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/oct/20/naturaldisasters.internationalaidanddevelopment\">hit northern Pakistan</a>, killing 80,000 people and leaving 400,000 families displaced. \u201cI felt I had to go and help,\u201d says Lari. \u201cI had no idea what I could do as an architect. I\u2019d never done any disaster work, or any projects in the mountains. I had no workforce, I\u2019d given up my practice. But I found that, if you do something beyond your usual comfort zone, then help will always come.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything I do is a collaboration, so I shouldn\u2019t be known as the author of my work</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While international aid agencies busied themselves erecting costly prefab housing with concrete and galvanised iron sheets, Lari worked with dispossessed families to rebuild their homes using mud, stone, lime and wood from the surrounding debris. Working with volunteers, she trained local people how to use whatever materials were to hand to rebuild in a better, safer way.</p> <p>\u201cI think we often misunderstand what kind of help is needed,\u201d she says. \u201cAs an outsider, you do things that you think are appropriate, but the reality here is different. The aid mindset is to think of everyone as helpless victims who need things done for them, but we have to help people to do things for themselves. There\u2019s so much that can be done with what\u2019s already there, using 10 times less money.\u201d</p> <p>She says that the process of co-creation can also be a crucial part of healing. \u201cDisasters can be truly devastating and people easily fall into deep depression. But if you give them something to do, it really helps with recovery. Something people have helped to make is much more valued than something simply given.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"82fcb0a02497bbf386f3a36bee6bdf344dd860d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82fcb0a02497bbf386f3a36bee6bdf344dd860d6/0_0_3315_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I think female architects in the UK have a much tougher time\u2019 ...

Testing the prototype on a shaking table at NED University in Karachi, they found the structure was capable of withstanding an earthquake more than six times the strength of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/12/this-is-not-a-what-if-story-tokyo-braces-for-the-earthquake-of-a-century\">1995 Kobe disaster</a>. If the homes ever did begin to crumble, they could be easily rebuilt using the same organic materials \u2013 unlike their concrete and steel counterparts.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much money in disaster relief,\u201d says Lari, \u201cbut we need to put much more effort into disaster preparedness.\u201d She is critical of the \u201cuniversal solutions\u201d offered by aid agencies and the siloed ways in which they work, as well as the urbanised mindset imposed on rural communities, insisting instead that responses should follow \u201cforms based on age-old wisdom\u201d.</p> <p>Beyond disaster reconstruction, her foundation has developed a programme of what she calls \u201cbarefoot social architecture\u201d for impoverished communities in Sindh province, running training programmes to get rural villagers to make building components and products that they can sell on to each other. Each village specialises in making a different item, from bamboo panels to glazed tiles, mud bricks and ceramic goods, as well as fuel briquettes and soap, minting a new class of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.pioneerspost.com/news-views/20200213/meet-pakistan-s-barefoot-entrepreneurs\">barefoot entrepreneurs</a>\u201d in the process. She says that 80% of the communities they\u2019ve worked with have since been raised above the poverty line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b0156a819db218b89e9c6f38abac116e580fa092\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0156a819db218b89e9c6f38abac116e580fa092/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yasmeen Lari\u2019s Zero Carbon Cultural Centre, Makli, Pakistan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Training up the next generation of craftswomen ...

Traditionally, cooking is done on open-flame fires on the floor, which can cause serious respiratory infections and eye problems, while food is easily contaminated, leading to diarrhoea. Lari\u2019s design features enclosed stoves on a raised podium, built and decorated by local women, which makes cooking cleaner, safer and bestows a new status on the cooks. The women are now raised up on a throne-like platform, rather than squatting on the floor, which has had an impact on men\u2019s attitudes towards them.</p> <p>\u201cI really wasn\u2019t expecting this,\u201d says Lari, \u201cbut it has transformed the women\u2019s self-esteem. They\u2019re so proud of their stoves, which they decorate beautifully and keep absolutely spotless.\u201d Following the barefoot entrepreneur model, a cohort of women were trained to build the <em>chulahs</em>, in turn training other women for about \u00a32, creating a chain of artisans who can monetise their new skills. Since 2014, more than 60,000 stoves have been built, improving the health of more than 400,000 people \u2013 and the local female entrepreneurs earn 25 times their original income.</p> <p>On a four-acre campus in Makli, on the edge of a Unesco-listed necropolis, the Heritage Foundation now has a dedicated space to train up the next generation of craftswomen, many coming from the nearby mendicant communities, who had always relied on begging for alms. Taking the form of a great thatched-roof hangar, walled with decorative bamboo screens, the <a href=\"https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/you/294397-rebuilding-lives\">Zero Carbon Cultural Centre</a> provides a colourful social space where women and young people can come and go, as well as joining in the workshops, learning to make everything from terracotta bowls to composting eco-toilets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b30e2f66b835d2aa14c1ecc09ebeb9680b974704\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b30e2f66b835d2aa14c1ecc09ebeb9680b974704/0_307_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A decorated chulah stove.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A decorated <em>chulah</em> stove.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Heritage Foundation of Pakistan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what does this latest international prize mean for Lari, Pakistan\u2019s first female architect, whose work has encompassed fashionable brutalist villas, mirrored office towers, heritage restoration projects and now essential humanitarian relief for the poorest of the poor?</p> <p>\u201cI feel like such an imposter,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything I do is a collaboration, so I shouldn\u2019t be known as the author of my work.\u201d As for the gender question, she is frank. \u201cIt\u2019s a fallacy to think that women like me have really battled. Pakistan is still a very male-dominated society, but if you are a woman working in public life then you are already part of the elite, with a powerful support system behind you. I think female architects in the UK have had a much tougher time.\u201d</p> <p>She says she often struggles to reconcile her privileged background with the nature of her work, as the daughter of a senior civil service bureaucrat, born into a world of open doors. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m a rebel,\u201d she insists. \u201cSometimes I feel I should be living like the women in the villages that I work with \u2013 but I enjoy my comforts too much.\u201d</p>",

The most frustrating part, and there are many, is the lack of communication with the frontline caregivers,\u201d said Quinn. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that our hospital was prepared at all for this pandemic. Three and a half weeks ago, when the first room came up for cleaning, our department had no direction from our supervisors or administration on how to clean and contain the items in the room.\u201d</p> <p>In Oakland, California, John Pearson, a registered nurse and president of SEIU Local 1021, explained their hospital, already suffering from understaffing and supply shortages, isn\u2019t equipped to handle an expected surge in coronavirus cases.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a routine set in place to be screening workers, we don\u2019t have rapid testing or much testing at all,\u201d said Pearson. \u201cWhat we have is absolute certainty of a mixing of people carrying this virus who don\u2019t know it yet, and spreading it around the hospital to patients and other people, exacerbated by not having enough protective equipment and on top of that, zero training on coronavirus. We\u2019ve gotten some emails and the emails wind up being contradictory advice and instruction.\u201d</p> <p>Several hospital workers who spoke to the Guardian requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.</p> <p>A registered nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit at a hospital in north-east Pennsylvania explained nurses in their department, which is already understaffed, are being pulled in and out to assist with coronavirus patients.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s just no clear guidance on what our policy is if we do have somebody who comes in presenting signs and symptoms. Are we going to continue to take care of them on the floor where all these other healthy moms are trying to have the best experience they can in bringing a newborn baby into this situation?\u201d the nurse said. \u201cWe were told that if we have symptoms we can continue to work as long as we protect ourselves with a mask if it\u2019s available. There is nothing saying if we come in contact with a patient that we need to self-quarantine.\u201d</p> <p>The person cited a mother in delivery who presented coronavirus symptoms recently, and no one knew what to do, whether proper protective equipment would be available to workers, while nurses argued with a supervisor to provide the equipment.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is an emergency, I have to make a split decision, do I risk myself and take care of that person or do I wait for the supplies to become available and then treat that person?\u201d added the nurse.</p> <p>Hospital workers in Washington DC described understaffing and confusion.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the frontlines sanitizing these rooms every day, but we\u2019re afraid because we don\u2019t know who has the virus and they don\u2019t inform us,\u201d said a housekeeping aide at a Washington hospital. </p> <p>In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, hospital workers also complained over a lack of preparation and communication to workers through the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like they have nothing in place and that anything we find out is after the fact, from the media,\u201d said a cafeteria worker at a University of Pittsburgh medical center hospital. They explained workers handle menus and food items from various patients, and receive supplies from several other hospitals, but are given no guidance on how to handle these supplies that are potential carriers of Covid-19. \u201cIf we don\u2019t know how to protect ourselves, how can we protect the patients and their families? We can\u2019t. This is so dangerous,\u201d the worker said.</p> <p>A spokesperson for PeaceHealth Sacred Heart medical center at RiverBend said in an email, \u201cWe are committed to safeguarding our valued EVS caregivers in this rapidly changing environment.

Airlines have been appealing to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/us-airline-industry-seeks-50-billion-bailout-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\">governments for bailouts</a> as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/30/easyjet-grounds-entire-fleet-of-planes-because-of-coronavirus-crisis\">fleets have been grounded</a>.</p> \n<p>But campaigners and experts fear that after the Covid-19 outbreak has waned, the sector could bounce back with the aid of public money and send emissions soaring.</p> \n<p>In their letter to the chancellor, the campaigners \u2013 including Greenpeace, Flight Free, the IPPR and New Economics Foundation thinktanks, and Tax Justice \u2013 call for the government to take equity stakes in airlines rather than handing out cash or loans. They want to see social benefits with workers\u2019 rights enforced, including a living wage and no mass redundancies a condition of any rescue. In the longer term, they want to see support for a \u201cjust transition\u201d for workers to move to jobs in lower carbon industries.</p> \n<p>They also want a new fiscal regime that includes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/24/frequent-flyers-could-face-extra-tax-under-plans-to-cut-emissions\">frequent flyer levy</a> or air miles levy, replacing air passenger duty, which would reduce demand without removing access to flights from those with limited alternatives or limited resources, by shifting the tax burden to frequent leisure flyers. About half of people in the UK do not fly in any given year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/25/1-of-english-residents-take-one-fifth-of-overseas-flights-survey-shows\">but 1% of people take a fifth of all flights.</a></p> \n<p>Rebecca Newsom, head of political affairs at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cEmergency funding must be used to tackle emergencies, not to support business as usual. Conditions are needed to protect workers\u2019 rights, prevent public money from being diverted into the pockets of shareholders, and reduce demand gradually over time through a frequent flier levy, so that the sector operates within safe limits for the climate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Attaching conditions to any bailout could take several forms. Ca\u00f1ete wants to see a carbon tax or emissions trading system such as the one operating under the EU. \u201cMarket mechanisms are needed,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Airlines UK, a trade body, said the industry was already taking steps to reduce their environmental impact before the coronavirus crisis hit. \u201cThe UK aviation sector has already committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 \u2013 the only national aviation industry to do so,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cThis will be achieved via a range of measures, including airspace modernisation, the development and commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuels, new cleaner planes, and the UN carbon offsetting scheme Corsia.\u201d</p> \n<p>Airlines face difficult choices ahead. More efficient aircraft will help to reduce emissions, but the impact will be limited. Biofuels offer a possible answer, but they are still expensive and there are difficulties in ensuring that the sources are environmentally sustainable. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/19/aviations-flight-towards-low-emissions-only-fuels-the-crisis\">Electric planes</a> are still some way in the future, and solar-powered flight a distant dream.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to stimulate research and development into things like hydrogen fuel,\u201d said Barbara Buchner, managing director of the Climate Policy Initiative. \u201cWe need more proactive thinking from airlines \u2013 they can\u2019t imagine we will go back to the way they were before.\u201d</p> \n<p>The coronavirus disruption may also bring about permanent changes in people\u2019s habits, some experts hope. Business flying has stopped meetings from happening, but people have found ways to work with video conferencing and other cheap technology, forcing businesses to question whether their staff need to fly as much in future.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"32b701e0-4add-4a25-8a76-13655756d661\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>These eight companies</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>These eight companies are among those who will help you offset your carbon emissions.

Under the Corsia (Carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) system adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, airlines would have to curb their future emissions using efficiencies, alternative fuels and offsetting, such as investing in forests, renewable energy or other carbon-cutting projects.</p> \n<p>Before the coronavirus crisis emerged, airlines pushed for the average emissions in the years 2019 and 2020 to be used as the baseline by which future emissions would be judged. In any years from 2021 onwards, when emissions from the sector exceed the average of 2019 and 2020, the difference between actual emissions and the baseline will have to be offset, meaning airlines will have to buy carbon credits from carbon-cutting projects.</p> \n<p>Choosing 2019 and 2020 should have made those targets easy to meet for airlines if air travel had continued to rise this year as it has in recent years. With the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the disruption to travel means emissions are likely to be drastically lower than envisaged for 2020 \u2013 meaning Corsia\u2019s future carbon targets will be much tougher for them to reach, if the scheme goes ahead without changes.</p>",
  "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Melissa Davey bringing you the main stories on Wednesday 1 April.</p> <h2>National death toll reaches 21</h2> <p>Western New South Wales local health district said a person admitted to Orange base hospital with Covid-19 died on Wednesday after suffering complications due to the virus.</p> <p>At the request of the family, a district spokeswoman said no further details would be provided. It takes the NSW death toll to 10 and the national toll to 21. Earlier on Wednesday, NSW Health announced that a 95-year-old woman who was a resident at the Dorothy Henderson lodge died overnight. The woman is the fifth person to die from coronavirus in the home. There are 4,860 cases in Australia.</p> <h2>Retired and non-practising health workers to be deployed</h2> <p>More than 40,000 doctors, nurses, midwives and pharmacists who are no longer practising or registered will be encouraged to re-enter the workforce to boost capacity to treat patients throughout the pandemic.</p> <p>The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency on Friday said a short-term pandemic response sub-register would be in effect for the next year. This will be a separate and temporary register to the <a href=\"https://www.ahpra.gov.au/Registration/Registers-of-Practitioners.aspx\">existing register of medical practitioners</a>.</p> <p>Only those who are properly qualified and competent will be invited to register, so practitioners who lost their registration due to malpractice will not be included.

  "<p>The UK construction sector is racing to deploy the latest technology as it seeks to boost productivity. While industries such as manufacturing and retail have hiked output per worker with huge investments in digital systems and automation, construction is lagging far behind. Technology on many construction projects for road, rail and other essential infrastructure has changed little in 50 years.</p> <p>\u201cWe really need to step back and look at how we can completely shift the paradigm,\u201d says Lesley Waud, design development director for transportation at engineering consultancy Atkins. \u201cThere are lots of pockets of good practice,\u201d she adds, \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t feel as if it is moving fast enough.\u201d</p> <p>Construction can learn \u201cfantastic\u201d lessons from car manufacturing, where data and robotics have revolutionised production, she says. \u201cThey really understand how to take manual processes out of activities. What I want to do is explore how we take their thinking on to a construction site.\u201d</p> <p>She gives the example of off-site manufacture, where components for a building project can be made in a factory and transported to the site to be installed. The auto industry has led the way in developing new methods to assemble pre-manufactured parts using advances in glue technology and clicking parts together. But construction has failed to exploit the opportunity of off-site manufacturing to fundamentally change approaches to building. \u201cWe\u2019re still bolting things together,\u201d says Waud.</p> <p>She believes that the industry needs to undergo a cultural shift to explore innovation and get the most from the digital revolution. That means everyone involved becoming more data-literate and for digital thinking to become embedded in projects from the start.</p> <p>For instance, she thinks the industry has failed to reap the full benefits from Building Information Modelling (BIM) software, which creates 3D images of buildings. BIM allows clients to virtually watch the construction of a building, and this helps speed up the design and construction process and saves on costs. However, Waud says there has been a patchy take-up of the technology across the industry. This is partly because clients often find it hard to understand the 3D models, as they are more accustomed to traditional two-dimensional drawings. The models also lack vital data such as environmental impacts. As a result, BIM has often failed to improve decision-making about projects.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot more data and information at our fingertips, which means we can make decisions about what we\u2019re going to build and how we are going to build it much earlier. But people aren\u2019t used to doing that. They are used to making decisions much later in the process,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"527e92b3f2152b06343f90c91a28d24a478162f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/527e92b3f2152b06343f90c91a28d24a478162f3/0_572_8660_5196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Female engineers using technologies in automobile industry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Off-site manufacturing, using techniques pioneered by the car industry, could fundamentally change approaches to building.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Morsa Images/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There needs to be a sea change in the way technology is used so engineers, architects, project managers and clients become accustomed to making decisions based on 3D models.</p> <p>Given safety concerns and the huge scale of the machinery involved, construction projects can struggle with implementing new technology quickly. As Kamini Edgley, Network Rail\u2019s acting chief engineer, says: \u201cIn a safety-critical environment, you can\u2019t afford to get it wrong. You want to make sure everything is tried and tested, though that\u2019s not to say that we can\u2019t improve.\u201d</p> <p>The company is organising \u201chackathons\u201d, where technologists collaborate intensively over a period of hours or days to solve problems. \u201cThere are a lot of ideas we are getting from challenges like that,\u201d says Edgley.</p> <p>She believes that technology can be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for rail and points to Plain Line Pattern Recognition (PLPR), which has revolutionised track inspection since its launch in 2013. PLPR uses cameras mounted on trains to find faulty tracks, quickly notifying maintenance teams about repairs. This is quicker, safer and more effective than the traditional method where staff walk along the tracks looking for faults.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/network-rail-spend-42bn-railway-improvements-after-year/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Network Rail is investing \u00a342bn</a> over five years to upgrade trains, tracks and stations. This includes a \u00a3350m fund for research and development, which Edgley believes stands to significantly boost productivity and innovation. In the long term, she points to technology such as hydrogen trains, which are being tested in Germany, and battery-powered trains, as potentially transformative for rail.</p> <p>Another senior engineer, Annette Pass, head of innovation at Highways England (HE), believes that there is \u201cenormous scope\u201d for the greater application of digital technology in road building. In one example, HE is working with a software company to produce an automated, digitised road design system. Designing roads includes many repetitive elements \u2013 every motorway has gantries, the overhead platforms supporting signals and cameras, and refuge areas. \u201cWhy were we getting people to draw out these designs over and over again in a repetitive fashion when it\u2019s something we could potentially automate?\u201d she says.</p> <p>The digitised system, which is under development, uses data about topography and the local landscape. It overlays elements of the road scheme \u2013 such as gantries, refuge areas and signs \u2013 from a digital library and models where they should be located. \u201cThat\u2019s effectively producing a digital design within hours once the information is fed into it. And that would normally take designers weeks,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The system is being extended to other areas of road design and could be fully operational within a year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-engineering-infrastructure-atkins/2020/apr/01/its-an-exciting-time-for-engineers-the-path-to-decarbonising-the-uks-energy-mix\">'It's an exciting time for engineers': the path to decarbonising the UK's energy mix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But for technology to really take off in the construction sector, the method of charging for work must change, says Pass. Consultants charge construction companies by the hour for design and planning work on projects. \u201cBut if we\u2019re asking people to automate design, then clearly we\u2019re taking out large chunks of that time that they might spend repetitively designing those elements,\u201d she says. The hourly payment model means consultants have little incentive to introduce labour-saving technology.</p> <p>A new business model is needed where consultants are paid for creating effective projects rather than for hours worked.</p> <p>Such a switch could start to turn around construction\u2019s poor showing on productivity.</p> <p>Between 1997 and 2019, the UK construction industry\u2019s output per hour, the standard measure of productivity, rose by slightly more than 20%, compared with a 30% rise for productivity across the whole economy, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p> <p>The sector has been identified as a drag on overall productivity growth across the economy. Massive infrastructure projects are planned or underway across Britain with an ambitious road building plan, rail projects such as HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail, and the push for more homes. With the sector suffering from a shortage of skilled labour, boosting productivity in construction through better technology will be a vital factor in improving efficiency.</p>",
  "<p>The global Covid-19 pandemic has changed so many things, including the UK\u2019s plans to host the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference \u2013 also known as Cop26 \u2013 which has now been postponed until next year. However, Dr David Cole, director for power generation at Atkins, still has a stark warning for world leaders: \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves, the climate crisis needs immediate action.\u201d</p> <p>As if to prove his point, the UK government, despite becoming the first major world economy to commit to a goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/06/johnson-urged-to-set-out-firm-plans-for-uks-net-zero-carbon-target\">provided little detail since</a> as to how that might be achieved. For those who could make a difference, it\u2019s a frustrating time. \u201cIf they don\u2019t do anything, we\u2019re going to miss the target by miles,\u201d says Jo Bandle, principal process engineer at Atkins, a global design, engineering and project management consultancy. \u201cLots of people here are looking at what needs to be done, but we also need government policies.\u201d</p> <p>To get a better idea of what the UK\u2019s net-zero carbon energy system might look like, and how it might be achieved, Atkins has produced a report: <a href=\"http://explore.atkinsglobal.com/engineeringnetzero/assets/pdf/Engineering%20Net%20Zero%20Technical%20Report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Engineering Net Zero</a>. For Cole, who was involved in the report, it provides a much-needed injection of pragmatism to the debate: \u201cAn awful lot of modelling has been done of what a future energy system could look like, but not as much work on how you get from A to B. We now need to urgently engineer and build net-zero today, rather than just modelling possible future scenarios.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a long way to go, says Chris Ball, managing director of Atkins\u2019 nuclear and power business for UK, Europe and the Middle East. He points out that the UK currently <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/820277/DUKES_2019_Press_Notice_GOV.UK.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">consumes about 300 terawatt hours</a> (TWh) of electricity per year: \u201cBy 2050, we\u2019ll be using about <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Net-Zero-Technical-report-CCC.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">645 TWh per year</a> \u2013 and all of that [will need to come from] low-carbon generation, which currently accounts for about 150 TWh.\u201d</p> <p>Wind power\u2019s role in meeting this energy demand is massive, says Andy Thompson, director of offshore wind at Atkins, because it is a comparatively proven technology: \u201cThere are technologies we can rely on. When you look at the maturity of this technology and you look at the planning constraints on onshore wind, the size of the turbines, for example \u2013 or the amount of land we have for solar \u2013 you realise that if you need large-scale build of renewables, offshore wind is the most viable at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Net-Zero-Technical-report-CCC.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Committee on Climate Change (CCC) report,</a> which recommended that the UK should commit to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, suggested a scenario where wind could make up to 75GW of the UK\u2019s power capacity. \u201cIs it possible? Yes. If we maintain the current build rate [of about 200 turbines a year]. With larger turbines, we can achieve that,\u201d says Thompson. Currently, the UK\u2019s wind power capacity <a href=\"https://www.renewableuk.com/news/418472/Wind-smashes-through-20-gigawatt-mark.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">stands at about 20GW</a>.</p> <p>The UK has been the world leader in offshore wind power generation since 2008. Its rapid deployment and ongoing success is partly down to lessons learned in other sectors. \u201cA lot of people who work on corrosion for offshore wind, for example, are bringing expertise they learned from the nuclear sector,\u201d says Cerianne Cummings, principal project manager at Atkins, who works primarily on design and foundations for new wind farms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2271804ca3563a713f52bf3ef4b5b52a62c2edfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2271804ca3563a713f52bf3ef4b5b52a62c2edfc/0_179_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hinkley Point C (EDF Energy)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The teams developing offshore wind are drawing on expertise from other sectors, including lessons learned from working on nuclear power projects.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HayesDavidson/Atkins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Amy Dowdeswell, a project manager and strategic business development associate at Atkins, who has worked in both oil and gas and renewables markets, echoes that point: \u201cThings we\u2019ve learned from work on oil and gas platforms we\u2019re able to apply to offshore wind-farm maintenance. There\u2019s no need for a separate learning curve.\u201d</p> <p>Turbine capacity rates \u2013 which measure the proportion of time a turbine is generating power \u2013 have increased dramatically over the past 30 years. Where a 1990s model might be idle up to 70% of the time, newer models more than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHuN0fzCN88&amp;t=520s\" rel=\"nofollow\">halve that downtime</a>, thanks to taller units reaching stronger, more consistent wind sources. \u201cThis type of floating wind power, which will go further offshore and tap into higher wind speeds, is going to be key to hitting the 2050 target,\u201d says Dowdeswell.</p> <p>Observing wind\u2019s success in the UK, other countries are following its lead and leveraging its knowledge, as they seek to reduce their own carbon footprints. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing countries and governments looking at locations that haven\u2019t historically had offshore wind and with that comes conditions that are challenging,\u201d says Cummings. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at deeper locations, bigger turbines, more environmental extremes \u2013 hurricanes and earthquakes. From an engineering perspective, it\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-engineering-infrastructure-atkins/2020/apr/01/inclusion-leads-to-innovation-how-atkins-enables-brilliant-minds-to-flourish\">Inclusion leads to innovation: how Atkins enables brilliant minds to flourish</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nuclear is also considered to have a place in the proposed 2050 energy mix: three new plants (including Hinkley Point C, which is currently under construction) account for up to 11% of power generation in the CCC\u2019s net-zero carbon scenario. Bandle, who works on Hinkley Point C, spells out why it\u2019s difficult to foresee a net-zero carbon future without nuclear power: \u201cA nuclear power station such as Hinkley will power about 6m homes for 60 years. No other technology today comes close to that \u2013 you\u2019d need about 8,000 wind turbines to get a similar output.\u201d</p> <p>But the high upfront costs of commissioning a plant (despite being offset thereafter by low running costs) have forced the government to seek investment partners for its large-scale nuclear projects, leaving them vulnerable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/17/hitachi-set-to-scrap-16bn-nuclear-project-anglesey-wales\">delay and cancellation.</a> If the chances of two more plants on the scale of Hinkley Point C seem slim, Bandle has a pragmatic solution alongside new build plants: \u201cWe\u2019re starting to design what are called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/07/uk-should-support-mini-nuclear-reactor-projects-says-official-review\">small modular reactors</a> (SMRs) that will produce maybe 440MW [an eighth of Hinkley Point C], but would be much cheaper to get off the ground.\u201d</p> <p>The size of the challenge needs both large nuclear and SMRs working side by side, and with the government yet to make firm, clear announcements on how it plans to make the UK energy mix carbon neutral, SMRs could well have a place in the future energy-generating mix. Yet for all the discussion around the climate crisis, it is the lack of a ubiquitous, urgent understanding among the general public that most concerns Ball. \u201cEvery time I flick my light switch at home, the lights come on. That detracts from the message of understanding where our power comes from and where we\u2019ll get it from in the future, and this is really important - we have to change that.\u201d</p> <p><em>This article was updated on 3 April 2020 to reflect the decision to postpone the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference due to the global Covid-19 pandemic.</em><br></p>",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell.

  "<p>By the end of January, <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/player/john-o-reilly-682615?stats=career-r-pitching-minors&amp;year=2019\">John O\u2019Reilly</a> was champing at the bit to get to spring training. Like most minor leaguers, the 24-year-old pitcher, newly assigned to the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, viewed baseball\u2019s preseason as a mecca of opportunity. Sure, O\u2019Reilly who played last season in Double-A, minor league baseball\u2019s second-highest level, wasn\u2019t expecting to make it to the majors and become the Pirates\u2019 opening day starter. But with a decent showing perhaps he could inch his way up minor league baseball\u2019s arduous, low-salaried ladder.</p> <p>And, when it started, O\u2019Reilly was having what he considered to be a highly successful spring training. He had been called upon to finish innings for major league pitchers. In one game, he pitched against the New York Yankees, a big deal for a kid from New Jersey.</p> <p>Then on the evening of 13 March<sup> </sup>O\u2019Reilly got a message from the organization. <em>Beginning tomorrow morning everyone must go home.</em> By that point the Covid-19 outbreak <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/11/814474930/coronavirus-covid-19-is-now-officially-a-pandemic-who-says\">had been officially declared a pandemic</a>. It was no longer safe for any large groups to gather together. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/mls-suspends-season-as-coronavirus-outbreak-hits-us-sporting-calendar\">Baseball games were no exception</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt is definitely scary,\u201d O\u2019Reilly says. \u201cLess of a chance to go out and play the game you love with your teammates. You look forward to it for the five months you\u2019re away [during the offseason].\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Reilly went home to his family in New Jersey where he is anxiously following the news. With no gyms open, nowhere suitable to throw, and unlike Major Leaguers, no guarantees of being paid this season.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.milb.com/player/index.jsp?sid=milb&amp;player_id=595255\">Mitch Horacek</a>, a 28-year-old pitcher in the Minnesota Twins organization opted to stay in Florida with his girlfriend\u2019s family instead of going home to the cold of Colorado. One day Twins doctors were cautioning players to wash their hands and avoid signing autographs. Three days later, Horacek\u2019s big league hopes were paused. Horacek had been following Covid-19\u2019s growth since the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, and sensed baseball could be shelved a while.</p> <p>\u201cOne of our last games had almost 10,000 people,\u201d Horacek says. \u201cIt was a culmination of my nerves. I kept thinking someone here might have this virus, we should do something. Of course things got way more crazy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/19/will-mlbs-battle-with-the-minor-leagues-deal-a-blow-to-americas-heart\">Will MLB's battle with the minor leagues deal a blow to America's heart?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The exodus from camps was chaotic and unprecedented. As teams were figuring out how to operate in the new climate, Horacek, O\u2019Reilly and hundreds of other minor leaguers started to worry about when \u2013 or if \u2013 they would be paid.</p> <p>Then again, money is always a concern in the minor leagues. Players are provided housing and a $10 per diem during spring training. They get no salary. During the regular season, players make anywhere from a measly $1,160 a month to a slightly less measly $2,100 a month, depending on which level they play at.</p> <p>Despite being professional athletes, these players\u2019 salaries <a href=\"https://fanbuzz.com/mlb/minor-league-baseball-salary/\">often fall below the United States\u2019 minimum wage</a>, forcing many to get creative to make ends meet. Horacek says it\u2019s commonplace for players to double the occupants allowed on a lease so they can all afford to pay rent. Many offer pitching or hitting lessons, but a huge chunk of players take second jobs that they can fit around their baseball career, such as delivery driving. Horacek used to engage in another common cost-cutter for minor leaguers: skipping breakfast.</p> <p>Minor leaguers understand it\u2019s all part of the sacrifice, namely because they have no other choice if they eventually want to make it to the big leagues. \u201cI watch guys I\u2019ve pitched well against. There are guys on TV I\u2019ve struck out before so I know I\u2019m good enough,\u201d Horacek says.</p> <p>Last season was Horacek\u2019s best training camp and, had a few more stars aligned, he says he could have been called up to the big leagues. Instead he toggled between Double-A and Triple-A, his dream dangling so close. Horacek\u2019s taxable income from baseball for 2019 was less than $8,000.</p> <p>Minor leaguers\u2019 low salaries have been discussed frequently over the past few years, most notably in 2018 when Major League Baseball lobbied Congress to exempt minor leaguers from making minimum wage. More recently, MLB floated the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/19/will-mlbs-battle-with-the-minor-leagues-deal-a-blow-to-americas-heart\">contracting 42 minor league clubs at the end of the 2020 season</a>. Bernie Sanders, currently competing to become the Democratic presidential candidate, has been a vocal opponent, calling the possible contraction another example of \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d Sanders, along with over 100 members of Congress, created the Save Minor League Baseball task force in November which has pushed back on MLB\u2019s plans for contraction and continued low salaries.</p> <p>After the start of the baseball season was postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak,<em> </em>MLB agreed to pay minor leaguers <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28976252/mlb-pay-minor-leaguers-400-per-week-31\">a spring training stipend of $400 a week</a>. The league has since announced that minor leaguers will continue to receive the weekly stipend, plus health benefits, until the end of May. Ironically that\u2019s more than many minor leaguers receive when not in the midst of a global pandemic.</p> <p>Horacek was met with plenty of pushback on Twitter when he initially expressed his concern about pay. \u201cIt\u2019s a perception problem,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone might perceive baseball as less of a job than working at a stadium concession job. Just because my job is fun doesn\u2019t make it easy and it doesn\u2019t make my bills go away.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/mets-ban-their-minor-league-players-from-new-clubhouse-after-57m-upgrade\">Mets ban their minor league players from new clubhouse after $57m upgrade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOne guy said there are plenty of people who would like to have my job in a second but while somebody might want to take my job, they can\u2019t. They physically can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Back in February, MLB, largely at the behest of Sanders and the congressional task force, announced that <a href=\"https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2020/02/16/mlb-to-raise-minor-league-salaries-for-2021-season/\">it would boost pay for minor leaguers</a>, starting with the 2021 season. Salaries are then expected to range from $1,600 a month for rookies up to $2,800 a month at the highest level, Triple-A.</p> <p>But for many, that\u2019s not nearly enough. Enter <a href=\"https://www.advocatesforminorleaguers.com/get-involved\">Advocates for Minor Leaguers</a>, a new group founded by a group of former players that is seeking annual minimum salaries of $15,000 for minor leaguers. Ty Kelly, a utility player who spent most of his 11-season career in the minors, says the organization was prepping to launch before the coronavirus halted spring training but it is prioritizing taking care of players left in limbo.</p> <p>\u201cI used to find an apartment for five months in the offseason. Then find a new lease for the next offseason,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cThere are tons of guys in that situation that don\u2019t have a home to go back to. It was necessary for us to launch now and try to help them.\u201d</p> <p>Advocates for Minor Leaguers has already had a rush of donations, which Kelly attributes to the public\u2019s connection to minor league baseball and a growing understanding of the players\u2019 plights.</p> <p>Kelly is one of the lucky minor leaguers who had his dream realized. After seven-plus years in the minors, making a salary below the poverty line, the New York Mets called him up and his life instantly changed. \u201cIt was crazy. I was called up from Colorado Springs, my least favorite AAA field by far, went straight to Washington DC to play with the Mets in this pristine park,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Kelly was signed to a 25-man major league contract, where he was paid a prorated salary based on the MLB\u2019s minimum (currently $550,000 a year). He suddenly had protections. He had a union. The Mets team hotel was a Ritz Carlton where Kelly ordered a $20 omelette <em>and</em> coffee with no guilt.</p> <p>Even when Kelly, or any player, is sent back to the minors, they still earn a prorated salary base of $91,000 for the rest of the season. Even though Kelly was better off financially, it was somewhat jarring at first to return to the conditions and second-class citizenry of minor league baseball. These cultural differences are felt everywhere, from salary to resources to facilities.</p> <p>For example, the Mets recently spent $57m to upgrade their spring training facility in Port St Lucie, including a pristine new clubhouse. But according to MLB.com\u2019s Anthony DiComo the minor league St Lucie Mets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/mets-ban-their-minor-league-players-from-new-clubhouse-after-57m-upgrade\">would have to remain in their basic clubhouse</a> when spring training ended as a reminder of what they\u2019re trying to achieve.</p> <p>Despite the conditions, despite the unlivable wages, despite the slim odds of making it to the majors, the dangling carrot is too hard to walk away from for guys like Horacek.</p> <p>\u201cEvery year you play is like rolling craps,\u201d he says. \u201cSay you need to roll a seven. If you stop rolling the dice, you have no chance.\u201d</p>",

It is true that his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/trump-pandemic-floundering-coronavirus-crisis\">approval ratings have gone up</a>, paralleling what happened with George W Bush after September 11. But Trump is clearly worried about the electoral consequences of a massive death toll and a recession that could see unemployment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">over 20%</a>.</p> <p>The difficulties experienced by national populists are unsurprising given they are no friends of the issues at the heart of this crisis: health, welfare and science. On the health front, the crisis reveals the folly of decades of underfunding and privatisation of the health system. Trump, Johnson and Salvini have embarrassing questions to answer in regard to their record as enemies of public healthcare. Furthermore, the crisis calls for a sea change in economic policy that is at odds with the ideological premises of national populism, which combines chauvinism on the cultural front and ultra-neoliberal policies on the economic front.</p> <p>The glaring need for state protection of strategic national industries, starting with health equipment and pharmaceuticals, is no anathema for national-populists who have already embraced trade protectionism. But the populist right has strongly opposed welfare measures that are becoming a matter of necessity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\">to avoid social catastrophe.</a> Having repeatedly branded these policies as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201canti-patriotic\u201d, these politicians find themselves in the embarrassing situation of having to espouse them.</p> <p>Another skeleton in the closet is national-populists\u2019 disparagement of science. The coronavirus emergency confronts us with a threat that is best understood and measured through the lens of science. Epidemiologists and virologists have acquired media prominence and the public has been diligently following their recommendations. It is not clear whether this will lead to greater public trust in science and an erosion of the anti-science attitudes that national populist leaders have toyed with. However, it can be expected that citizens will take more heed of the risks flagged by scientists, including the climate emergency, which is also bound to exacerbate the spread of diseases.</p> <p>National-populists are well known for stoking people\u2019s fears. But the fears now prevalent are not of the kind these leaders are best positioned to exploit. Due to the urgency of health and economic worries, migration \u2013 the populist right\u2019s main enemy \u2013 has fallen in the list of priorities. Travel bans, and the fact that Europe and the US are the present focus of the pandemic, are leading to a drop in migration to these regions. In fact, we are now witnessing a historic reversal, with Mexico aiming to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\">block</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\"> the border</a> with the US and African countries suspending flights from Europe, while UK farmers are organising charter planes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/28/fruit-and-veg-will-run-out-unless-britain-charters-planes-to-fly-in-farm-workers-from-eastern-europe\">to fly in farm workers from eastern Europe</a> to prevent fruit and vegetables being left unpicked. However, if the global economic crisis results in a new wave of migration like that of 2015, this scenario could drastically change \u2013 national-populists will try to validate their narrative of cosmopolitan globalisation as a dangerous vector of all sorts of ills.</p> <p>If the coronavirus crisis has momentarily disoriented the populist right, this does not mean it is vanquished. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-populism-trump-politics-response\">It would be misguided for the left</a> to believe that this crisis will work out in its favour. The health crisis is bound to be followed by a deep economic crisis, more similar to the Great Depression than to the 2008 financial crisis, and the populist right has already demonstrated its ability to prey on popular despair and find social scapegoats for economic ills. It can be expected that it will go down the same road, if anything becoming even more vicious.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">authoritarian measures</a> implemented on Monday by Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, with the suspension of parliament and the introduction of government by decree, may be the shape of things to come. In Italy, Salvini had no qualms about applauding Orb\u00e1n\u2019s move. We are also likely to see an exacerbation of anti-Chinese rhetoric. Trump made no apologies for calling Covid-19 \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1239685852093169664?lang=en\">the Chinese virus</a>\u201d, while Steve Bannon <a href=\"https://adncuba.com/english/steve-bannon-covid-19-communist-party-virus-trump\">argued</a> that Covid-19 is a \u201cChinese Communist Party virus\u201d. Salvini <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/31/china-isnt-helping-italy-its-waging-information-warfare/\">has proposed</a> that \u201cif the Chinese government knew [about the virus] and didn\u2019t tell it publicly, it committed a crime against humanity\u201d, and allies in Brazil and Spain are adopting a similar line.</p> <p>Given the ties among national-populists, including their botched attempt to establish a \u201cnationalist international\u201d under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/steve-bannons-rightwing-europe-operation-undermined-by-election-laws\">auspices of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/steve-bannons-rightwing-europe-operation-undermined-by-election-laws\">Bannon\u2019s Movement</a>, this synchrony should not be taken as accidental. It has all the look of a coordinated strategy to channel the rage and despair caused by the crisis\u2019s brutal human and economic toll towards a racial and ideological enemy conveniently identified in the Chinese government. Along with self-proclaimed socialists, all opponents are likely to be smeared as \u201cChinese collaborationists\u201d: centrist US presidential candidate Joe Biden has already been termed <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-is-chinas-choice-for-president/\">\u201cChina\u2019s choice for president\u201d</a> by the conservative National Review.</p> <p>What may be in store is thus something much worse than the populist right of the 2010s: an extreme right using the whole arsenal of the red scare and rightwing authoritarianism to intimidate opponents and defend its interests from demands for meaningful economic redistribution.

  "<p>Gail LeBoeuf makes an unlikely climate justice campaigner. Although the 67-year-old resident of Gramercy, a small town in south Louisiana by the banks of the Mississippi River, has been fighting against local pollution for the last few years, she spent most of her career working at an area plastics manufacturer.</p> <p>\u201cThese plants just kept popping up, one after another, built by these billionaires who decided they just want to make money.

LDEQ has permitted Formosa to release an astonishing 13.6 million tons of greenhouse gases each year, the equivalent of three and a half coal fired power stations.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Formosa said that the facility could emit less GHG than permitted, as the totals in the permit \u201cwere generated based on the facility operating at maximum levels, 100% of the year\u201d. The spokeswoman did not cite a separate figure however.</p> <p>The spokeswoman said the company would \u201cperform a variety of emissions testing and monitoring activities\u201d at the facility.</p> <p>The permit marks the project as the single biggest emitter of climate pollution under construction in the US, according to an analysis of oil and gas industry proposals conducted by the Environmental Integrity Project, a DC based advocacy group. The sector announced about $204bn in spending on 340 new or expanded projects since 2010, according to the American Chemistry Council. Many of them are to produce plastics \u2013 which the research firm IHS Markit forecasts will grow an average of 3.5% to 4% per year through 2035.</p> <p>This boom in plastic production is<em> </em>fueled by cheap oil and gas released by fracking. The industry is planning 157 new or expanded plants and more drilling over the next five years, according to a report from the Environmental Integrity Project. These projects will release up to 227m tons of additional greenhouse gases by the end of 2025 \u2013 a 30% rise from the industry\u2019s footprint in 2018.</p> <p>Steven Eric Feit, an attorney for the Center for International Environmental Law\u2019s climate program, said oil companies are banking on plastics growth for when oil demand for transportation peaks. </p> <p>\u201cThe story from the oil industry for how they\u2019re going to see growth in the 21st century is plastics, that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying,\u201d Feit said.</p> <p>Many of the biggest facilities are along the Gulf Coast \u2013 with eight of the top 10 by size in Texas or Louisiana.

In turn, oil and gas prices plummeted. Fracking has also made it cheaper to make plastics, which come from a byproduct of the extracted gas.</p> <p>And experts agree that the rapid boom in plastics production has been overlooked as the lower-emitting gas has allowed the US to phase out coal plants, at a benefit to the environment.</p> <p>\u201cIndustry is saying this is good because we\u2019re replacing coal, but they don\u2019t talk about what else they\u2019re doing with it \u2013 which is making plastic and chemicals,\u201d said Courtney Bernhardt, research director at the Environmental Integrity Project.</p> <p>According to a recent legal complaint filed against Formosa by lawyers representing local residents, the amount of greenhouse gases released by the plant will be the equivalent of 6.5% of Louisiana\u2019s total energy related emissions by 2016 standards.

  "<p>One morning toward the end of January 2019, Steve Lewis, a US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) biologist in Juneau, Alaska, logged on to the website Movebank.org to check the whereabouts of some golden eagles that he had tagged with GPS trackers.</p> <p>Lewis, a lanky, outdoorsy 49-year-old, usually tried to look at the location data once a week, but he had spent most of the month at home on furlough, unable to work as a result of the government shutdown. Eager to catch up with his birds, Lewis beelined it to his office when he got back to work. \u201cThe first thing I did,\u201d he says, \u201cwas go and check on my eagle tags.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/22/florida-python-action-team-snake-epidemic\">Python wars: the snake epidemic eating away at Florida</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One bird in particular, Golden Eagle 1703, gave him pause. Lewis knew the animal well. He had tagged it on 26 July 2017, when it was still a nestling on a rocky outcrop in Denali national park and preserve. Even before it knew how to fly, 1703 displayed its might by leaping from its nest and gliding a quarter mile down a valley to evade Lewis\u2019s initial attempt at tagging it. After a short hike, Lewis and his team retrieved the squawking bundle of black and white feathers, outfitted it with the tracking device, and returned it safely to its nest.</p> <p>In the 18 months that followed, 1703 flourished. The bird traversed about 8,000 miles, from Denali to Wyoming, all the way back up to Alaska\u2019s North Slope, where it probably feasted on waterfowl and perhaps a straggling caribou calve of two. From there, it carved a long, treacherous path south through the wilderness of western Canada and worked its way back to the lower 48 to hunker down for its second winter on Earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"001574e33585518534fd1945c9aebb3d21f6e8b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001574e33585518534fd1945c9aebb3d21f6e8b5/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Lewis tagging Eagle 1703 .\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biologist Steve Lewis getting ready to return Golden Eagle 1703 to its nest in Denali national park and preserve after outfitting the bird with a solar-powered GPS device in July 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carol McIntyre, National Park Service</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Little is known about what golden eagles do in the liminal years between leaving their parents\u2019 nest and settling down to build a nest of their own. Each ping from 1703\u2019s solar-powered GPS revealed a tiny part of the picture, offering a rare glimpse of an apex predator as it learned the ropes of the natural world. \u201cIt takes four or five years for them to reach maturity,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cand it\u2019s unknown how long it actually takes them to then compete and get into the breeding population. So you have to follow a bird for years.\u201d</p> <p>But now, staring at his computer screen on that January morning, Lewis could see that 1703\u2019s location device was stationary in Sully county, South Dakota, and had been so for two days. \u201cIt was seeing the sun and talking to the satellites,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t moving.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not uncommon for Lewis to lose a bird. Since 2014, he, along with colleagues from the National Park Service and the US Geological Survey, have tagged 49 golden eagles in Alaska as part of a broader effort to understand their biology, behavior and population trends. Of those birds, only 17 are still being monitored. Sometimes the GPS device malfunctions or the eagle shakes free from it. Other times the bird dies.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tough world out there,\u201d Lewis tells me, \u201cespecially for eagles.\u201d They can starve to death or get electrocuted by high wires or be decapitated by wind turbines. None of those fates, however, seemed likely in the rolling farmland of Sully county.</p> <p>Hoping to get a sense of what went wrong, Lewis opened a souped-up version of Google Earth, plugged in the last GPS coordinates he had for 1703, and began looking around the virtual landscape. There was a nearby road, a line of trees, acres of empty land, and what looked to be a farmhouse. \u201cIt definitely felt suspicious,\u201d Lewis says.</p> <p>He called up a Fish and Wildlife office in Pierre, South Dakota, and asked if anyone could go check on a downed eagle tag.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Richard Bare wasn\u2019t sure whether to be pissed off or deeply disappointed by the prospect of having to retrieve yet another dead eagle. \u201cI first and foremost suspected a shooting because we were having a rash of eagle shootings,\u201d says Bare, a special agent with FWS\u2019s office of law enforcement, who was stationed in South Dakota at the time. In the five weeks leading up to 1703\u2019s death, he had responded to a bald eagle shooting and two separate golden eagle shootings. None of the birds survived, and he found no evidence to suggest the incidents were related. The case of 1703 seemed like more of the same.</p> <p>While the average American might be shocked to learn of an eagle being intentionally blasted from the sky, those who work in wildlife law enforcement know it\u2019s an alarmingly common problem. According to one <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/pdf/management/EagleRuleRevisions-StatusReport.pdf\">FWS report</a>, somewhere in the range of 1,000 golden eagles are shot each year. Sometimes it\u2019s poachers who want to sell the bird\u2019s feathers on the black market, other times it\u2019s ranchers who want to keep the dive-bombing predators from snatching their livestock.</p> <p>Bare, who has been a special agent since 2016 and before that spent close to a decade in the field as an FWS game warden (the outdoor world\u2019s equivalent of a beat cop) ballparks that over the course of his career he\u2019s dealt with upwards of 200 cases involving eagles \u2013 shootings, poisonings, collisions with cars, starvations. \u201cIf you asked me about any other eagle, I probably wouldn\u2019t remember it,\u201d he says. But 1703 \u201cwas a flashbulb event\u201d because the weather was memorably miserable, even by South Dakota standards. A punishing cold snap had plunged temperatures well below zero while sustained winds of 50mph ripped across the plains.</p> <p>After a quick chat with Lewis, Bare loaded his cold-weather gear into his truck and hit the road. 1703\u2019s GPS tracker was pinging about five miles north-west of where the Oahe Dam cuts across the Missouri River to form Lake Oahe, one of the nation\u2019s largest man-made reservoirs and fertile hunting ground for birds of prey.</p> <p>When Bare arrived at the location, he saw all the same features that had popped up on Lewis\u2019s computer screen \u2013 the quiet country road, the shelter belt of trees and the farmhouse, which in real life was dilapidated and long ago abandoned. A firm layer of snow crunched under his boots as he walked across the field, scanning the ground for any signs of an eagle or an errant GPS tag. Then, among the knee-high wheat reeds that poked through the frozen landscape, Bare spotted what looked to be a clump of tail feathers. He took out his camera and began documenting everything. \u201cEven though something might not be a criminal investigation, I have to treat it as such and maintain the integrity of the evidence,\u201d he says, \u201cthe evidence being the eagle in this case.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5999c7ad4afaaf65630b39bc463c737a754f9cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5999c7ad4afaaf65630b39bc463c737a754f9cd/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eagle 1703 found in a field in South Dakota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bundle of 1703\u2019s feathers poke through the ground in Sully county, South Dakota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FWS Special Agent Richard Bare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only two species of eagles are native to the US \u2013 the bald eagle and the golden eagle \u2013 and few animals in the world enjoy as many legal protections as they do. In addition to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Lacy Act, which regulates the trade of wildlife, they are privy to the <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/history/protections.html\">Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act</a>, a federal statute that threatens steep fines and jail time for anyone caught killing eagles, disrupting their nests, or generally interfering with the birds.</p> <p>Passed in 1940, the law was originally designed to protect only bald eagles. At the time, the species was teetering on the edge of extinction in the contiguous US as a result of hunting, habitat loss and the toxic effects of DDT. In 1962, Congress amended the act to include golden eagles. Nearly 50 years later, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act has proven to be a godsend, at least for bald eagles. The national bird is widely considered one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest environmental comeback stories: in 1963, a mere 417 nesting pairs lived in the lower 48. Today well over 10,000 pairs can be found from the suburbs of Boston to garbage dumps near Seattle.</p> <p>Golden eagles haven\u2019t been as lucky. While they are not classified as an endangered or threatened species, they certainly aren\u2019t thriving. FWS estimates that in 1967, there were 31,813 golden eagles in the US. In 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, the agency estimated there were 31,477 golden eagles in our skies. It\u2019s a remarkable stretch of stability, but it\u2019s unclear if the numbers can hold as wind farms rise across the western US and myriad pressures from habitat loss, environmental degradation and the climate crisis push down on raptors and the animals they prey upon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>In 1963, a mere 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles lived in the lower 48. Today, well over 10,000 pairs exist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With so many threats looming, Bare knows as well as anyone that the last thing golden eagles need are people shooting them out of the sky. After a few minutes of photographing the area, he dug 1703\u2019s frozen carcass out from under the snow and gave it a once over in the wind-whipped field. Much to his surprise, there were no overt signs of trauma \u2013 no bloody bullet hole or broken wing or spilled guts. The bird weighed more than 7lb and, aside from being dead, looked to be in good shape. Still, there was no telling what type of damage might be lurking under its plumage. Bare zipped 1703 into a small body bag and chewed over the possibilities on his drive back to the office.</p> <p>A day or two later, a preliminary X-ray seemed to support his original hunch when it revealed two metal fragments near one of 1703\u2019s wings. \u201cIt resembled the approximate diameter of buckshot,\u201d Bare says. Following protocol, he packed 1703 on ice and FedExed it to the National Fish &amp; Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon.</p> <p>Like that, 1703 had gone from a high-flying predator to commercial cargo.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>On any given day, a menagerie of dead animals passes through the FWS\u2019s forensics lab. From the outside, the building looks like most any other government facility \u2013 squat, gray, plenty of parking. Inside, it\u2019s filled with sophisticated laboratory equipment and staffed by a small, exquisitely specialized team of scientists whose disciplines range from herpetology to ornithology to ballistics to genetics. When it comes to analyzing evidence of animal-related crimes and building scientifically sound prosecutions against wildlife traffickers, poachers and others who inflict harm on nature\u2019s inhabitants, there is no better place on earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dbd18a3d2dd917acafbe70e6f54bcd66d8cfef02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbd18a3d2dd917acafbe70e6f54bcd66d8cfef02/507_0_1506_1784/844.jpg\" alt=\"A group of bald and golden eagles feed on a fish on the frozen surface of the Mississippi River near LaCrescent, Minnesota.\" width=\"844\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A group of bald and golden eagles feed on a fish on the frozen surface of the Mississippi River near LaCrescent, Minnesota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Fredrickson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like any potential murder victim, 1703 underwent a full postmortem in hopes of pinpointing the cause of death. That task fell to Rebecca Kagan, one of two staff pathologists at the lab. If there\u2019s a federally protected animal that dies under mysterious circumstances, there\u2019s a decent chance it will end up on Kagan\u2019s exam table. One day it\u2019s an endangered Mexican gray wolf; the next day an eagle.</p> <p>\u201cWe get a lot of bald and golden eagles,\u201d Kagan laments. In 2019, she and the other pathologist at the lab necropsied about 100 eagles total, including 1703. Managing an endless stream of suspiciously dead animals can be bleak. But Kagan keeps a sharp sense of humor \u2013 she jokes that she always carves the bird at Thanksgiving \u2013 and finds comfort in knowing that her work is ultimately in service of conservation. Sometimes a necropsy yields evidence that helps finger the bad guy. Other times her efforts reveal that there wasn\u2019t any foul play, just the lethal hand of Mother Nature at work.</p> <p>Kagan unpacked 1703 on 13 February 2019, roughly three weeks after Lewis first noticed its GPS at a standstill. Dribs of a red-brown fluid leaked from the bird\u2019s mouth when she tilted its carcass. She checked the esophagus and it was empty. She checked the crop, a pouch-like structure near the upper part of the digestive tract, and found a 3.5oz blob of partially masticated muscle and fat mixed with a few white hairs that looked like they came from a deer. \u201cThe nutritional condition was good,\u201d Kagan recalls. \u201cThis bird didn\u2019t starve to death.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly and methodically, she worked 1703 over, inspecting and documenting every inch of its insides and outsides. A large amount of \u201cwatery, red-tinged\u201d excrement pooled in its cloaca and its gall bladder contained \u201cscant, yellow-green, watery bile\u201d, according to the necropsy report.</p> <p>Kagan eventually arrived at the two metal pellets that showed up on the preliminary X-ray only to discover that they were nothing more than tiny remnants from the GPS harness. Hours spent deconstructing 1703, and the cause of death wasn\u2019t any clearer. \u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe really checked everything with this bird.\u201d</p> <p>As a final step, she shipped 1703\u2019s liver to Michigan State University for a detailed toxicology analysis. A few weeks later the results came back positive for bromadiolone, better known as rat poison.</p> <p>Even if you\u2019ve never heard of bromadiolone or its chemical counterparts \u2013brodifacoum difenacoum and difethialone \u2013 chances are you\u2019ve been in close proximity to them. They are known as \u201csecond-generation anticoagulant rodenticides\u201d, a popular class of poisons that essentially kills a rodent by making it bleed to death from the inside out. Exterminators stuff these poisons in those black plastic bait boxes that you see everywhere in cities \u2013 down alleys, on the sides of restaurants, in condo buildings\u2019 parking lots \u2013 and they are deployed throughout the agricultural sector to keep germ-carrying rodents away from food supplies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"56d64ac6fd464002669cdfb0e583d8e523081343\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56d64ac6fd464002669cdfb0e583d8e523081343/0_0_3400_2403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A juvenile male golden eagle flies back into the wild at the Starr Ranch Sanctuary after being released on Friday, July 1, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A juvenile male golden eagle flies back into the wild at the Starr Ranch Sanctuary after being released on 1 July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images/MediaNews Group via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These poisons came to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s and were \u201cextremely widely embraced\u201d from the get-go, says Bobby Corrigan, an esteemed rodentologist who has spent his career studying and consulting on pest control practices. \u201cIt was kind of a magic bullet of advanced chemistry.\u201d</p> <p>Corrigan frequently preaches the importance of addressing the root causes of rodent infestations \u2013 improving trash storage and collection, addressing degrading infrastructure \u2013 and is unsettled by the widespread reliance on second-generation anticoagulants and lax enforcement efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to restrict their use. But \u2013 and this is an important, he says \u2013 the sad truth is that we are dependent on these poisons. Forgoing them entirely would lead to an explosion in rodent populations that could usher in \u201ca public health catastrophe\u201d.</p> <p>One reason these poisons are so effective is because, in most cases, the rat or ground squirrel or vole or whatever the target vermin happens to be only needs to eat a single dose. The poison works quickly, and the critter typically doesn\u2019t have time to excrete any of the poison before it keels over. In other words, a rat that dies from a second-generation anticoagulant often dies with a belly fully of poison. And if a scavenger comes along and plucks up the rodent corpse, it, too, will be exposed to the poison. It\u2019s a process that scientists call bioaccumulation, and it occurs all the way up the food chain.</p> <p>Just like mercury in the ocean, these rat poisons have seeped into ecosystems far and wide. A<a href=\"https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/registration/reevaluation/2018_investigation_anticoagulant.pdf\"> 2018 study</a> from the California department of pesticide regulation found detectable levels of second-generation anticoagulants in roughly 85% of mountain lions, bobcats and Pacific fishers that were examined. Birds of prey, including eagles, are especially at risk for these types of \u201cnon-target animal\u201d exposures. Maureen Murray of the Cummings school of veterinary medicine at Tufts University <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28669046\">analyzed</a> 94 birds of prey from New England and found traces of these poisons in a stunning 96% of them. \u201cWe can say confidently that there\u2019s widespread exposure,\u201d Murray says. \u201cBut how that translates into mortality or deaths is still very much an unanswered question.\u201d</p> <p>The toxicology report for 1703 showed that it had 0.05 parts per million of bromadiolone in its liver. Murray says it\u2019s unlikely that\u2019s enough to directly kill an eagle, but there\u2019s not really any good data on what the lethal threshold is for a bird of that size. If the poison didn\u2019t deal the fatal blow, I ask, could it have impaired 1703 in a way that made the bird less capable of hunting or migrating or withstanding the winter and thus contributing to its death? Again, Murray says, it\u2019s an important question to which there\u2019s no answer. And even worse, it\u2019s becoming an increasingly difficult question to study because, Murray explains, so many raptors in the wild now have rodenticide in them that it\u2019s almost impossible to find enough birds that are free of rat poison to serve as a control group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"461aff0e5f7b8b3dbb604d376d3a285e4f10c281\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/461aff0e5f7b8b3dbb604d376d3a285e4f10c281/0_0_4256_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wildlife repository specialist Dennis Wiist looks for a place to hang eagles ready to be sent out in one of the two freezers.

While data is scarce, FWS scientists estimate that poisonings are now the leading cause of anthropogenic-induced death among golden eagles, possibly killing as many as 2,000 a year.</p> <p>Kagan\u2019s exam table was the end of the line for 1703.

The government had made no preparations to increase the supply of testing kits or expand laboratory capacity \u2013 and the UK found itself at the back of the line in a global queue for tests.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65e82655-4a96-4b79-890a-17937da958f3\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Historic factors have also shaped the UK\u2019s current testing capacity. Over the past 20 years, the number of laboratories and testing facilities has shrunk. The public health laboratory service, a network of local and regional laboratories that was established as part of the NHS in 1946 to respond to the threat of bacteriological warfare, was subsumed by the health protection agency in 2003.<strong> </strong>Many of the laboratories in the old network were shut down, taken over by local hospitals or merged into a smaller number of regional laboratories.</p> \n<p>So even if it did have enough kits, the UK would no longer have the capacity, equipment or biomedical scientists to match the testing capacity of its European neighbours. But what if the tests could be done at home?</p> \n<p>This brings us to the question of the kinds of tests the UK will be conducting. Part of the confusion about testing has arisen from the fact there are two different types of test, which measure very different things. One detects the presence of the virus, and is sometimes referred to as the \u201cantigen\u201d test; the other detects the presence of antibodies, sometimes referred to as the \u201cserology\u201d, or \u201cantibody\u201d test.</p> \n<p>The antigen test relies on molecular methods to detect the presence of the viral genetic material, usually in a nose or throat swab. This test is used to tell whether a person is currently infected and possibly infectious, and it needs samples to be sent to a testing laboratory. The antibody test, that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-mass-home-testing-to-be-made-available-within-days\">be available to conduct at home</a>, detects whether the person actually had an infection at some time in the past \u2013 and indicates whether they are likely to be immune to further infection.</p> \n<p>This test is usually done on a spot of blood. Antibody tests typically do not become positive for a week or so after the beginning of an illness, so they are not much use for quickly<strong> </strong>diagnosing an acutely ill person \u2013 and won\u2019t detect those who have only recently caught the virus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/mass-covid-19-testing-is-vital-but-the-data-must-be-localised\">Mass testing is the only way to stop the virus \u2013 it's long overdue | Anthony Costello</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Criticisms of the UK\u2019s testing numbers mainly concern the antigen tests. Several other countries, which have arguably been more successful at controlling their own epidemics \u2013 Germany, China and South Korea \u2013 have done many more antigen tests than the UK. South Korea <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/uk-coronavirus-testing-explainer\">has been running</a> 20,000 tests a day. Even the US has completed more tests than the UK \u2013 2,248 tests per million compared to the UK\u2019s 1,923, according to the <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/us-daily/\">Covid Tracking Project</a>. Importantly, the antigen test can show whether someone may be infectious to others, so it can be used to screen essential workers who may have only mild coronavirus symptoms, or who are asymptomatic.</p> \n<p>For now, the antigen tests are crucial for controlling the spread of the virus. But as we get over the peak of the epidemic, antibody tests will help us recover a semblance of normality. By detecting which individuals are immune from the virus, they could allow them to return to work. Essential workers with immunity would<strong> </strong>not<strong> </strong>need to worry about getting infected or passing the virus to their families. Carers, social workers, the police and priests officiating at funerals could carry out their work as normal.</p> \n<p>Perhaps an even more important use of antibody tests is to fill some of the biggest gaps in our knowledge about the pandemic. How many people get only mild illness, or even do not get ill following an infection? Are younger people getting infected at the same rate as older adults? This information will be vital in helping us decide when and how the current social distancing measures can be relaxed, and when we can finally return to normal life.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Prof Paul Hunter is professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p><br></p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic in Spain is taking a disproportionate toll on the poor, the elderly, the marginalised and those working in low-paid but vital jobs, experts have warned.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://aquas.gencat.cat/.content/IntegradorServeis/mapa_covid/atlas.html\">interactive map produced by the Catalan regional government</a> showing the distribution of the virus reveals that residents of poor Barcelona neighbourhoods are six or seven times more likely to contract the virus than those in wealthy areas.</p> <p>While much of Spain has bounced back from the 2008 economic crisis, many parts of the country suffered deep, lingering cuts. The unemployment rate, which<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics\"> stands at 13.7%, is more than double the EU average</a>, while youth unemployment is at 30.6%. About <a href=\"https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Tabla.htm?t=9985&amp;L=1\">half</a> the population has some difficulty making ends meet, and poverty is persistently higher for <a href=\"https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Tabla.htm?t=10005\">children</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ine.es/jaxiT3/Datos.htm?t=10009\">migrants</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gitanos.org/actualidad/archivo/129382.html\">Roma</a> populations.</p> <p>According to the Catalan government figures, the rate of infection in working-class Roquetes is 533 per 100,000 inhabitants, while in upmarket Sant Gervasi it\u2019s only 77. Similarly high rates are found in the satellite towns of El Prat de Llobregat (604) and Badalona (597).</p> <p>Dr Nani Vall-llosera, a GP in Bon Pastor, a low-income Barcelona neighbourhood, and former president of the Catalan primary care forum, points out that many of those deemed essential workers by the government work in low-status, poorly paid jobs where they have high exposure to the virus.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who work in shopping centres, supermarkets and old people\u2019s homes, as well as cleaners, are working without protection, often without masks,\u201d she said. \u201cThese people get infected, they go home and infect those around them because there\u2019s little possibility of self-isolating if you live in a small apartment.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cFurthermore, poverty and poor health are a vicious circle \u2013 the poorer you are the more likely you are to have health problems. And so the chances of becoming seriously ill with the virus are concentrated in poor neighbourhoods.\u201d</p> <p>Like many colleagues, Vall-llosera, is in no doubt that the ability of the health system to react has been \u201cdebilitated\u201d by years of spending cuts in public health, especially in Madrid and Catalonia, adding that \u201cthose parts of Spain where there have been least cuts are dealing with the virus better\u201d.</p> <p>The doctor also warns of the distortion to the health system caused by the epidemic. \u201cWhile we focus all our resources on the coronavirus, which is probably what we have to do, it\u2019s also reducing our capacity to deal with other issues,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Manuel Franco, a professor of epidemiology and public health at the <a href=\"https://www.uah.es/es/estudios/profesor/Manuel-Franco-Tejero/\">University of Alcal\u00e1 in Madrid</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2119/manuel-franco\">Johns Hopkins School of Public Health</a> (USA), agrees that austerity measures \u2013 particularly around Madrid \u2013 have weakened the healthcare system.</p> <p>He also says that inequalities in income, gender, education and country of origin are becoming increasingly apparent as the pandemic continues.</p> <p>\u201cIn many societies, care work \u2013 cleaning, looking after children and the elderly - is mostly carried out by foreign women,\u201d said Franco. \u201cA lot of them are not on the payroll so they have no rights when it comes to unemployment pay. They also probably live in the worst housing conditions in a city like Madrid.\u201d</p> <p>He said that homeless people were also at risk and the NGOs and charities that helped them were forced to close.</p> <p>\u201cHow do these people get the minimum they need to survive? We don\u2019t have really good maps or ways to track these people and know what their living conditions are like,\u201d said Franco.</p> <p>As Spain experiences its third week of lockdown, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/covid-19-may-be-peaking-in-parts-of-spain-says-official\">all but essential workers ordered to remain at home</a>, income disparities are becoming more apparent.</p> <p>People need to heat their homes as they stay away from work. But they also have to home-school their children, which usually means a computer, tablet or smartphone is needed for distance classes \u2013 as is a good internet connection.</p> <p>Franco said that while Spain\u2019s socialist-led coalition government was working to minimise the economic impact of the health crisis and protect the most vulnerable, basic structural inequalities were persisting and worsening.</p> <p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a will to protect those who will be hardest hit and to cover the gaps that are becoming wider and wider,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut there are many small details of daily life and the social determinants of health are becoming more relevant: housing, income, education.\u201d</p> <p>Franco said the global epidemic, which has so far claimed 8,189 lives in Spain, called for action that went well beyond improving health systems.</p> <p>\u201cOf course healthcare workers are in a very tough situation, dealing with overstretched intensive care units but there are also people working in food stores, police officers, paramedics, firefighters \u2013 they\u2019re also suffering the same lack of equipment,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe never thought about that; we never thought that we could have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/covid-19-workers-in-spain-you-can-feel-the-fear-in-the-air\">such a big public health crisis \u2013 and mortality crisis in cities like Madrid, where the usual morgues can\u2019t cope with this situation</a>. But I think that almost every decision that we have to take right now should be taken from the point of view of these social inequalities.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://web.oxfamintermon.org/sites/default/files/documentos/files/desigualdad-1-igualdad-oportunidades-0.pdf\">report published by Oxfam Intermon last year</a> showed that, as well as a wide disparity of income, there is a difference of life expectancy of nearly 11 years between Barcelona\u2019s richest and poorest neighbourhoods, and seven years in Madrid.</p>",

Once you start looking, Dr Martens are everywhere. Sixty years after launching the eight-hole 1460 boot \u2013 on, as the name suggests, the 1 April 1960 \u2013 it is an undisputed classic, one of those rare-as-hen\u2019s-teeth designs that is as likely to be spotted in a museum as it is (until recently, of course) on the streets outside. It is up there with Levi\u2019s 501s, the Fred Perry polo shirt, the Converse All Star and the Harrington jacket.</p> <p>And, like these other items, the 1460 is enjoying a fashion moment beyond its classic status. Perhaps because the past decade has been so turbulent \u2013 even before we had a global pandemic to contend with \u2013 fashion has returned to the dependable. The Hadids, Baldwin and Kaia Gerber are all endorsing Dr Martens. In other words, as Vogue declared in October, they have become \u201cmodel off-duty staple\u201d. While the vegan range and patterned designs have been credited with a 70% rise in profit for the brand in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/17/oh-so-pretty-political-upheaval-credited-for-dr-martens-sales-boost\">the 1460 remains the bestseller</a> and it is this history that is likely to have attracted rumours in March of a potential \u00a3300m sale to a US private equity firm.</p> <p>Dr Martens, and the 1460, began with a collaboration. If most modern alliances are between two brands (JW Anderson x Uniqlo, Adidas and Raf Simons), this one was a bit less hypebeast-friendly. A small shoe factory in Northamptonshire partnered with two doctors in Munich. Dr Klaus M\u00e4rtens had developed an air-cushioned chunky sole in 1947, after a foot operation following a skiing accident in 1945, and had begun making it with his friend Dr Herbert Funk to sell these comfortable shoes to older women. In Britain, the shoemaking Griggs family saw an ad for Martens\u2019 soles in 1959. After acquiring the licence, <a href=\"https://www.drmartens.com/uk/en_gb/tough-as-you/our-stories/bill-griggs\">Bill Griggs</a> designed the 1460, the eight-hole boot with the now familiar yellow stitching and chunky M\u00e4rtens sole, although when marketing the design for postwar Britain, the umlaut in Martens\u2019 name was removed at launch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f558c9d1282115a8a8e86c793b778de56ecdf1a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f558c9d1282115a8a8e86c793b778de56ecdf1a4/0_519_4192_2514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Griggs family\u2019s Cobb\u2019s Lane factory in Northamptonshire, 1930s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Griggs family\u2019s Cobb\u2019s Lane factory in Northamptonshire, 1930s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Dr Martens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Initially, the 1460s took the lead from M\u00e4rtens\u2019 designs, which were worn by those who prioritised comfort and durability. Marketed as a work boot and sold for about \u00a32 (roughly \u00a338 in today\u2019s money), postmen, factory workers and policemen wore them, and they became part of the uniform for London Underground workers. However, as with army jackets, jeans, even trench coats, the Dr Martens boot secured its place as a staple in our wardrobes after becoming a uniform for a series of subcultures. \u201cIt\u2019s almost easier to list which subcultures haven\u2019t adopted Dr Martens over the past six decades,\u201d says Andrew Groves, a professor of fashion design at the University of Westminster and the curator of <a href=\"https://www.invisiblemenexhibition.com/\">Invisible Men</a>, last year\u2019s exhibition about men\u2019s working wardrobes. \u201cThe list of those style tribes that took the DM to their hearts includes punks, skinheads, northern soulers, scooterists, as well as (later on) teenagers into grunge, two-tone, and Britpop.\u201d</p> <p>As a symbol of working-class culture, it was the original skinheads \u2013 before the term equated to the far right \u2013 who first picked up on the 1460s. When the Who\u2019s Pete Townshend wore them on stage in 1967, he put them on the radar of the band\u2019s growing fanbase in the proto-skinhead scene. In his classic book <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Subculture.html?id=ZLTAPZ4_dLAC\">Subculture: The Meaning of Style</a>, Dick Hebdige sees the take-up of Dr Martens as the rejection of the explicitly aesthetics-based mod culture of the early 60s. Instead, this look was \u201caggressively proletarian, puritanical and chauvinist\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8680b78a3284f94b3a2c0789ecd8b7ccd94c21a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8680b78a3284f94b3a2c0789ecd8b7ccd94c21a9/0_7_1654_992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(L-r) Dr Martens Vegan 1460 boot; the chunky-soled Jadon; and Bape\u2019s camo-print boot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">(L-r) Dr Martens Vegan 1460 boot; the chunky-soled Jadon; and Bape\u2019s camo-print boot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Design Team</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Groves also points out the inherent rebellion of wearing something practical for its aesthetic value \u2013 even if that value is about fetishising working-class culture rather than just wanting to look sharp. \u201cAt their heart, all youth subcultures love nothing better than annoying their parents,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat better way to do that than adopting the boots your dad wears for his respectable job and subverting them into the latest youth craze?\u201d</p> <p>During the 70s and early 80s, the 1460s became part of a uniform worn with skinny bleached jeans, braces and, quite often, a bit of a snarl. Images of skinheads \u2013 either in Gavin Watson\u2019s classic photography book Skins, or Shane Meadows\u2019 This Is England trilogy \u2013 often feature DMs, and they continued to be associated with the subculture, even as, as Meadows documented, it became darker, as the far right infiltrated it.</p> <p>Although this association is still there, it\u2019s now a whisper \u2013 thanks to Groves\u2019 litany of other, less controversial, subcultures that also took up the DM. By the time i-D magazine\u2019s A Decade of i-Deas was published at the end of the 80s, the style magazine had declared them \u201c<em>the</em> fashion accessory of the past five years\u201d. I remember blisters covering the back of my heels for weeks when I got my first pair in the 90s. Groves says he wore them \u201cwhen I was a mod, a skinhead and a casual \u2026 I\u2019ve worn them polished up with Sta-Prest trousers and scuffed-up with jeans. I\u2019ve probably got at least three or four pairs at the moment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f426d4fcaecb70d6ef1a18de4bc007c152c0ce7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f426d4fcaecb70d6ef1a18de4bc007c152c0ce7c/0_56_3257_1954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Skinheads in docs in This Is England, 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skinheads in Docs in This Is England, 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The breaking-in that the 1460 requires has now been a rite of passage for young people for more than 50 years. The current generation \u2013 who would have seen them worn by King\u2019s Road punks, kids in archive rave footage, Damon Albarn in the 90s, as part of queer culture from the 80s onwards, and emo in the 00s \u2013 have a whole archive of #inspo to explore. There\u2019s a democracy and an \u201ceveryboot\u201d quality to them that appeals \u2013 the Hadids might have a very different life from a 90s schoolgirl, but they, too, would have had to go through the blisters stage. Sophie Rhind, the senior footwear buyer at Asos, argues the democracy of the style is its strength. \u201cThe diversity of celebrities and influencers who are wearing DMs further hammers home the point that the brand can be worn by everyone and can be styled any which way possible,\u201d she says. On the site, <a href=\"https://www.asos.com/dr-martens/dr-martens-jadon-8-eye-platform-boots-in-black/prd/8262663\">it\u2019s the Jadon</a> \u2013 a version of the 1460 with an uber-chunky sole \u2013 that is the most popular, with 20,000 pairs sold last year. Dr Martens is also producing a \u201cremastered\u201d series of 1460 collaborations this year \u2013 the Japanese brand A Bathing Ape and Raf Simons have featured so far.</p> <p>While tweaks to the boot are OK (camo print from Bape, ring decoration from Simons, the Jadon chunky sole), the recognisable design has to remain. In times of crisis such as we are experiencing now, perhaps putting on a boot that is tough, familiar, classic and (eventually) comfortable is what we need. While we won\u2019t be venturing far, they are the choice for your daily walk: Bella Hadid was photographed in Los Angeles this week on the way back from Target, wearing her DMs. \u201cThe Dr Marten is such an archetypal object that they can be worn in both an understated manner or used to underplay a full-on fashion look,\u201d says Groves. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine anything else being worn by your postie and Gigi Hadid, and both looking equally good in it.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>For 900 years, Lugg and Hampton wildflower meadows in Herefordshire have bloomed into a wash of colour in spring. These fertile meadows were highly prized, and the Norman lords who owned them used the hay crop to help fund Hereford\u2019s cathedrals, churches and castles. The secret to their wonderful bounty was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/nov/10/top-10-winter-wild-swimming-spots-in-britain\">River Lugg</a> flowing through the middle, fertilising the valley floor with lime and silt each winter it flooded.</p> <p>But this longstanding system is broken. This winter the valley was submerged under several feet of chocolate-coloured water. It has been flooded almost continuously since October, turning the 120-hectare (297-acre) reserve into an inland lake, with just the tops of gates and fence posts peeping out of the water. Now, as spring approaches, the water is still several inches deep and swans and gulls frolic where mice and rabbits would have burrowed six months earlier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/lugg-zip/giv-3902YD0Lv95egvWX/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/lugg-zip/giv-3902YD0Lv95egvWX/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>The damage flooding does to humans has been well-documented, but wildlife populations are unseen casualties, with some ecosystems taking decades to recover. \u201cIt is frightening to think that we have only just begun to see what might be ahead with our climate. The losses could be profound,\u201d says James Hitchcock from Herefordshire Wildlife Trust, which manages the Lugg reserve.</p> <p>\u201cThe rate of change we are seeing and the repetition in extreme events is coming too fast for wildlife to adapt \u2026 The loss of these meadows could take years and years to reverse and we may never see a return of some species.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be1548addebc45f3ccdc31b58d00f39401a5eb3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be1548addebc45f3ccdc31b58d00f39401a5eb3c/0_0_4574_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Snakeshead flowers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lugg wildflower meadows in Herefordshire are home to rare species of plants such as the \u2018Snakeskin\u2019 flower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Holden Landscapes/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Damage to wetland habitats</strong></h2> <p>Months of flooding is turning Lugg meadows anoxic as oxygen is lost. Worms and other insects suffocate and come to the surface where they are picked off by scavengers such as foxes and crows, reducing the larder of food for rarer species that rely on the reserve in spring. Many delicate grass species like vernal grass and red fescue are likely to be weakened by the floods, leaving a flush of resistant weed species such as thuggish dock leaves and thistles to take their place. In 2012, conservationists resorted to weedkiller to get rid of the dock leaves because the valley had been too wet.</p> <p>These meadows are highly valuable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\">sites of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\"> special </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\"> scientific </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/22/more-than-one-in-10-of-englands-wildlife-sites-lost-since-2009\"> interest</a> (SSSIs) and were home to Herefordshire\u2019s only fledged curlew chick last year.

If flooding becomes too frequent, meticulously managed flood plains like this turn into swamps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8bb1d624c4a6c157c4a2dfa804e1b525285c318f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bb1d624c4a6c157c4a2dfa804e1b525285c318f/0_126_1703_1129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bombus ruderarius (red-shanked carder bee) pictured on kidney vetch flower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bombus ruderarius (Red-shanked carder bee), formerly widespread in the area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Falk/Courtesy of CEH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The casualties are far-reaching \u2013 otters that live in the Lugg have been killed on roads after being forced into areas where there is less cover. Kingfisher nests normally built into the muddy banks have been submerged under several feet of water. Soil in the water also chokes filter feeders such as dragonfly and damsel larva.</p> <p>The decline of this rural valley, once rich in meaning and memories, is part of what Hitchcock calls the \u201chomogenisation of the countryside\u201d. All over the country, generalist species like rooks, crows and gulls thrive at the expense of specialised species that are picky about their habitat. Only around 1,200 hectares of species-rich flood plain meadows remain in the whole of the UK, with most of them lost due to the intensification of agriculture. Many of these rare species have nowhere to migrate to if their habitat is destroyed.</p> <p>\u201cThis flooding is one element in a general narrative of decline. When flooding is this prolonged, insects and vertebrates start to die and that includes things like earthworms. It then takes years to recover. In that intervening period you have less food for birds and potentially the loss of some species. Everything is getting hit from every angle,\u201d says Hitchcock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f07b636bffdfdafc123f236ecd40f26790a17994\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f07b636bffdfdafc123f236ecd40f26790a17994/0_0_5464_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flooded fields following Storm Dennis in February 2020 at Symonds Yat, Herefordshire, England.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A series of storms over the winter of 2019-20 caused repeated flooding in Herefordshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Farther down the Lugg at Bodenham Lake, prolonged flooding may have drowned 1,500 young reeds, planted in 2019 as part of a \u00a3520,000 project managed by the Herefordshire Wildlife Trust to create more habitats for declining wetland species such as warblers and bearded tits.</p> <p>Sophie Cowling, senior project officer at Lugg Living Landscape, says: \u201cThe lake\u2019s water levels have been extremely high since the end of October, due to repeated flooding. The floodwaters have fully submerged the young reed plants; if they drown it will be costly to replace them and the conservation of declining wildlife that relies on reedbeds will be delayed by several years.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Damage to river ecosystems</strong></h2> <p>Thirty miles south-west is the village of Llanwenarth in the Abergavenny district in Monmouthshire, Wales. Two 16th-century manor houses and a church perched on land raised from the flood plain are a nod to former rural communities that once thrived in these valleys. The 16th-century houses had never flooded until earlier this year when they had three feet of water running through. The damage to the valley exceeded the three previous large floods in 1853, 1947 and 1979.</p> <p>Fortunately these floods were not at a time when fish were spawning but their regularity worries Simon Evans, chief executive of the Wye and Usk Foundation. \u201cIn the Usk we\u2019ve had record floods in 2018, 2019 and now in 2020. That\u2019s three massive floods in the last 20 months. Imagine each one as a bang on the ecology \u2013 if you keep hitting it it just goes away. Rivers just cannot survive flood after flood after flood.\u201d</p> <p>Fast-moving water causes gravel at the bottom of rivers \u2013 which is key for river ecosystems \u2013 to be ripped away and spat out farther downstream. Macroinvertebrates such as bull head, stone larch and marsh brown lose their homes, says Evans. \u201cThese animals are the life-support systems in the river. They provide food for the dippers and the fish, which provide food for the kingfisher, so if you don\u2019t have the macroinvertebrates because you have taken away their houses then your whole ecology is done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"070046a1416315e2e80b5193742172ce4475fb79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/070046a1416315e2e80b5193742172ce4475fb79/0_0_3508_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Courtship behavior of a pair of kingfishers.

A single flood can impact populations for decades to come; the 1977 flood at Selkirk in the Scottish Borders washed away salmon eggs that had just been laid in the gravel and the effects were apparent on spring salmon catches in the River Tweed 25 years later, according to Evans.</p> <p>In September 2012 more than 200,000 tonnes of soil left the Lugg in one flood, the equivalent of 26 hectares of top soil. There is up to 150mg of soil per litre of water in many of these rivers, and roads are visibly stained red after the water has subsided. This is caused by water flooding agricultural land \u2013 much of which is bare after being harvested for maize or root vegetables \u2013 and washing valuable topsoil into rivers. This soil is often doused in pesticides and fertilisers which cause additional damage to river ecosystems.</p> <p>\u201cOur rivers are not adapted to these elevated sediment loads, and our ecology is not adapted to elevated sediment loads. We should not see big brown rivers sliding past but what we see is big brown rivers sliding past and that\u2019s because of how we manage our land. We\u2019ve got this shifting baselines thing going on \u2013 people think the Lugg has always been brown but it hasn\u2019t,\u201d says Evans.</p> <p>Eggs in the gravel rely on flowing water to bring them oxygen and remove waste, but soil blocks up these holes and reduces the amount of water reaching the eggs, meaning they can suffocate and die. It also reduces visibility so river creatures cannot hunt so easily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d62d29cb23ecccaa68962e8fd08980f550591ce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d62d29cb23ecccaa68962e8fd08980f550591ce9/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Record breaking high water levels in the river Wye at Monmouth, February 2020.2B06R6P Record breaking high water levels in the river Wye at Monmouth, February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Record-breaking high water levels in the river Wye at Monmouth in February</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cheshire/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Divided communities</strong></h2> <p>Historically these traditional farming communities would have been centres for human trade, migration and settlement, but the battle to control water is dividing communities. Tris Pearce, an ecologist and trustee of the Badger Trust, grew up in the Welsh borders where the Severn and Vyrnwy rivers meet. He monitors badger setts near Pentre, Shrewsbury, which sits close to the border between England and Wales. Here, the roads have turned into rivers intersected with islands of tarmac. Some areas have been underwater for more than three and a half months.</p> <p>For badgers, late winter storms come at the worst time because cubs are in underground dens and will drown unless the sow can get them out (which she does by picking them up in her mouth one by one). Pearson feels increasingly concerned about the future of these valleys for both the wildlife and people that live here. His parents were farmers and Pearson kept livestock himself but two years ago turned vegan due to concerns about the environmental impacts of livestock farming.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change is the big thing. We can\u2019t keep ignoring it. You look up at the overgrazed hillside from six feet of water and everything you can see is being propped up by government money. It\u2019s not sustainable. This prolonged flooding is starting to turn into an annual event \u2013 it was once in a lifetime, then once every decade and now it\u2019s all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Samantha Somers, environment manager at Natural England, says the organisation will continue to support natural flood management measures, including creating space for temporary ponds and restoring rivers.</p> <p>\u201cRecent flooding unfortunately caused significant distress and disruption for communities and businesses. However as flooding is a natural process, flood plains can generally continue to support ecosystems which are rich in wildlife and can accommodate floodwaters when rivers burst their banks,\u201d she says.</p> <p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>",

Leaders naturally wanted to act quickly to avoid a dramatic Italian scenario in their territories. Bear in mind, though, that these decisions to limit the free movement of people were made by politicians not by doctors. Just as when Donald Trump imposed his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-global-recession-fears-intensify-as-trumps-europe-ban-fails-to-reassure\">European travel ban</a> selectively at first, the closing of frontiers in central and eastern Europe has a political significance that goes beyond mere sanitary demands. Politics in the time of plague is still politics.

These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. <br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The sequence in which the Schengen provisions were suspended in central and eastern Europe tells us something important about societies in this region and perhaps even about the EU in general.</p> \n<p>First, there is the collective psychological dimension. The question of borders here is not just about geography or history, it is an existential one. For decades, post-communist countries have sought to escape Soviet influence in order to \u201creturn to Europe\u201d. The reasons were only partially economic. In all those memorable pictures of the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, one can see crowds of east Germans who believed they were literally escaping the trap of history. Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and many other nations felt the same. In the 20th century, their central experience was that of cyclical collapse of their states, downfall of sovereignty and existential threat coming from two totalitarian systems. Their desire to join organisations such as Nato or the EU after the collapse of communism derived from their view that the west was a guarantor of institutional stability and personal safety. Joining the Schengen zone in particular, was seen as a way of finally leaving the geopolitical danger zone.</p> \n<p>Those countries should theoretically then have been the last, not the first, to close their borders in 2020. One of the reasons for this is that \u201creturning to Europe\u201d brought on the one hand modernisation and prosperity, but on the other a profound cost. One outcome of Schengen has been the <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/specials/what_europeans_really_want_five_myths_debunked\">mass emigration</a> of well-educated workers. </p> \n<p>The brain drain of doctors has contributed to the dramatic situation facing many healthcare systems in the region. Long before the pandemic, Hungary had considered special contracts for young doctors to stop them emigrating en masse. In Poland, according to official OECD and Eurostat data, the number of practicing physicians per 1,000 inhabitants is <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/healthres/doctors.htm\">only 2.4</a>. Whenthe UK announced new recruitment for the NHS of doctors from the EU, the understanding in Poland was that Britain\u2019s target was not France or Germany but farther east. Closing the borders has in fact been in the central and eastern European air for quite some time and the arrival of Covid-19 is just a catalyst.</p> \n<p>In spite of their extraordinary transformation since 1989 the post-communist states are also still perceived (including by their own citizens) as weak. True or false, this provokes neurotic reactions to almost any political threat. Radical political language and radical measures are taken because fear of another collapse of the state is still deep rooted. These real anxieties may gradually be eroding faith in joint EU solutions, such as the Schengen zone, which were previously seen as benign.</p> \n<p>The same reasons may explain why, for example, the response of Poles to their lockdown has turned out to be so disciplined and relatively well organised. If the state is weak \u2013 including the healthcare system \u2013 we want to stay at home and where possible organise for others. Voluntary networks in Poland cooking free meals for doctors or preparing additional Covid-19 tests are examples of such behaviour.</p> \n<p>There is therefore something of a perverse relief to the closing of borders in central and eastern European countries because of the pandemic. It might be only a fleeting feeling that will soon give way to a longing for European normality. However, it could also be the other way around.</p> \n<p>The second point relates to the way in which exceptional powers are a source of immense temptation for politicians, especially the illiberal populists in our part of Europe. Could they resist the lure of this extraordinary centralisation of power?</p> \n<p>In our city, Warsaw, like others around the globe, almost total silence reigns; drones take photographs of empty streets from above. But silence in the public sphere matters. In classical political philosophy it was associated with the danger of despotism. In The Spirit of the Laws Montesquieu writes about the deadly silence in the cities when the enemy is scaling the walls. Our adversary today has no legions. It is invisible \u2013 but that does not mean it is less threatening. Contrary to democracy, characterised by a robust and lively public sphere, in despotism people\u2019s interests and activities shift to the private sphere, where they focus on material goods and forget about the community. This threatens democracy, because while people are preoccupied, irreversible changes can be made to the political system.</p> \n<p>Silence in the public sphere will not be compensated for by the din online. In a more romantic era we thought the web and social media would give citizens better tools and make them more active. Today the passivity of citizen-followers is a well-established phenomenon, and our worries are about privacy and the lack of regulation of tech platforms. It is hard to assume that the internet will automatically become a remedy for the deserted public sphere.</p> \n<p>The spectre of a sanitary cataclysm effectively pushes democracy to the sidelines. In those countries where respect for democracy has been established over many years, it does not have to be dangerous. But things look different in places where illiberal populists have already started to translate the 2020 health emergency as the victory of the nation-state over a helpless EU, and the liberal rules-based multilateral order. In Hungary Viktor Orb\u00e1n has been allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">rule by decree</a> during this state of emergency without any clear time limit and special measures include jail terms for spreading misinformation.

  "<p><em>These questions were put to the candidates before the coronavirus crisis</em></p> \n<p><strong>1. Is the climate crisis the biggest issue the UK faces as a nation and will you commit to making it Labour\u2019s priority for the duration of this parliament?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Rebecca Long-Bailey</strong></p> \n<p>The climate crisis is the greatest challenge we face as a nation and as a globe, not just for this parliament but in the decades and century to come. The inactions of previous governments have escalated the urgency of the challenge we face; and it is a challenge we can only meet by addressing the crisis in our living standards and the crisis of faith in our democracy.</p> \n<p>As leader I will continue the work I\u2019ve been doing with trade unions, Labour activists and technical experts to develop a plan on how we do this, for example, developing our policies such as insulating 27m homes, using public ownership to transition to a green, affordable energy system, creating an industrial strategy to deliver high-quality, unionised jobs across the country and developing a detailed, properly funded plan to make sure no one loses out from this transition.</p> \n<p>As a Labour party we need to work with communities about what policies they want to see that would transform their lives and meet the climate crisis. We need to continue to harness the energy and enthusiasm of campaigners and young climate strikers who have helped push the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda through their actions, and work with them to show the world we are opposed to Trump\u2019s climate crisis denial when our country hosts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">op26</a> this year.</p> \n<p><strong>Lisa Nandy</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. As prime minister I would make reaching climate safety the top priority for the whole of my government. I know it is not beyond us not only to build a zero-carbon economy but also to lead the global effort required to reach climate safety. I know that solving the climate crisis means integrating the solutions into every part of what the government does and that means hard-wiring the answers into the very foundations of our country\u2019s economic and foreign policies.</p> \n<p>One of the first things I did on becoming Labour\u2019s shadow energy secretary back in 2015 was to read Elizabeth Kolbert\u2019s book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/12/scienceandnature.features\">Field Notes From A Catastrophe</a><em>. </em>It brought home to me the scale of the risks from the climate emergency. Climate breakdown isn\u2019t just a far-off threat to other people in other places in some distant future. You can already see the impact that even the warming to date is having in terms of the horrific fires raging across Australia and California, the shifting rain patterns damaging livelihoods for millions of people across Asia and Africa, and the unprecedented flooding we\u2019ve seen here in Britain in recent years. We don\u2019t have the luxury of time so yes it would be a top priority for me during this parliament too.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea6232cb-2804-49b6-b1eb-3c34a2cf366f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The European Green Deal is the EU\u2019s answer to what the European commission\u2019s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, called the \u201cexistential issue\u201d of the climate emergency.

We all have a common interest in rapid decarbonisation, so it needs to be a guiding thread across all policy areas: from foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing.</p> \n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>As Labour leader, how will you tackle the climate crisis between now and the next general election [ie what can be done while you are in opposition?]. Can you give three specific examples?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RL</strong><strong>B</strong></p> \n<p>As leader I will continue my record of forcing the Tories to U-turn and back down on some of their most destructive policies, such as their support for fracking. It was Labour that meant parliament declared a climate and environmental emergency, work that I led. In parliament we need to keep piling the political pressure on the Tories, for example, using our presence there to bring an end to the ban on onshore wind in England and fighting any attempt to water down our environmental commitments in any trade deals we strike, particularly with the US.</p> \n<p>At the Cop26 later this year as Labour leader I will be stood shoulder to shoulder with campaigners and activists fighting for a landmark series of commitments and agreements. The eyes of the world will be on us when Trump, the climate breakdown denier, arrives and our prime minister gives him a warm welcome. Moves to curb the civil liberties of, or label peaceful activists as extremists, must be resisted.</p> \n<p>As Labour leader I also want to give prominence to what Labour can do in power. Many Labour local councils and mayors are declaring climate emergencies and developing their own Green New Deals with their local communities. The Labour councillors and community activists taking this lead are examples of how we can reach into local communities, organise and campaign \u2013 lessons we need to learn ahead of the next general election.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d82a3fc3-3759-4182-b187-1a6732deadd7\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Labour's 'green new deal' - or 'green industrial revolution' - proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs, and transforming the way people live - from upgrading the housing stock to revitalising public transport,&nbsp;tackling the UK\u2019s air pollution crisis to moving towards a more sustainable agricultural model.</p>\n    <p>Although the initial investment would be huge, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging&nbsp;economic benefits in the medium term,&nbsp;positioning the UK at the forefront of the emerging green industries, which are expected to dominate in the coming years.</p>\n    <p>Crucially, the green new deal would tie radical environmental action to a worker-led \u201cjust transition\u201d, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by \u2013 and benefits \u2013 ordinary people.

The idea has also been championed by leading Democratic presidential candidates in the US&nbsp;2020 race.&nbsp;Internationally, its supporters say any such proposal must also recognise the west\u2019s historic responsibility for the crisis - and its global nature - and support a just transition in the developing world through transfers of technology and finance, while welcoming migrants.</p>\n    <p><b>Matthew Taylor</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>As shadow energy and climate secretary, before the Paris summit, I initiated a collaboration between more than 60 Labour councils across Britain to cut the UK\u2019s carbon footprint by 10% through action in the places where Labour is in power. Before the next election there is the opportunity to build on this with more on-the-ground activism to deliver on the Paris agreement through everything from solar energy coops to community tree-planting schemes and investment in bus services. By showcasing the solutions in our communities, and seizing on the opportunity for good new jobs in every town, Labour can help build out the climate movement into the more broad-based, society-wide force that we need it to be. Only through a movement will we stop a reckless Trump trade deal, which would threaten decades of hard-won rights and protections, and pave our way back to No 10 Downing Street.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>The climate crisis cannot wait until 2024. So, I will work with Labour administrations wherever they are in power \u2013 from councils, city mayors to devolved governments \u2013 as they involve communities, trade unions and businesses, to design their own pathways to zero net carbon by 2030.</p> \n<p>We need to encourage bottom-up solutions through supporting climate assemblies and green cooperatives.</p> \n<p>We must also be an effective opposition in parliament, holding the government to account on the basis of the pace of decarbonisation our planet needs \u2013 not the unambitious targets they have set themselves.</p> \n<p><strong>3. Will Labour under your leadership commit to:</strong></p> \n<p><strong>\u2022 R</strong><strong>etrofitting all UK homes [27m] and buildings by 2030 and fight to ensure all new buildings are zero carbon by the end of this parliament?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>\u2022 </strong><strong>Producing 90% of the UK\u2019s electricity from renewable sources [through 7,000 offshore</strong><strong>, 2,000 onshore turbines and 3x expansion of solar] by 2030?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>\u2022 Producing 50% renewable heating through 8m heat pumps and investment in hydrogen?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes, I commissioned the expert report, <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ThirtyBy2030report.pdf\">Thirty by 2030</a><a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ThirtyBy2030report.pdf\"> (pdf)</a>, these recommendations are based on. It gives us a real plan to not only hold the government to account on what they are failing to do \u2013 but also helps turn what can be abstract targets to most people into real, everyday changes for the better.</p> \n<p>Insulating homes will end fuel poverty. An active industrial strategy will make sure that Britain is the producer of the wind turbines and other technologies we need for the future, creating good jobs and apprenticeships in our towns, cities and regions. The opportunities for large-scale renewal are endless \u2013 we just need to be ambitious and creative. It is a central part of how I believe Labour can sell our aspirational socialism to people across the country.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>I know we need a wholesale transformation in the way we power and heat our homes and businesses but that this is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities. As a windswept nation we can be the Saudi Arabia of clean energy, but all too often we are losing out on the jobs and factories to other countries with a different approach to industrial strategy and that has to change.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>I fully support Labour\u2019s Green New Deal and the proposals for a <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Green-Transformation-Fund.pdf\">Green Transformation Fund (pdf)</a> and a <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/National-Investment-Bank-Plans-Report.pdf\">National Investment Bank</a><a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/National-Investment-Bank-Plans-Report.pdf\"> (pdf)</a>. The proposals offer a pathway to a greener economy married to social justice, which our country badly needs. It should be hardwired into everything we do as a country and as a party.</p> \n<p><strong>4. If yes, how should this work be financed and organised?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>These are huge challenges and it requires bold and ambitious thinking. We already have deepening wealth inequality in this country and a crisis in living standards. The Conservative approach has been to load costs on to households that are already struggling, while letting energy companies profiteer. We can\u2019t have this approach if we are going to turn this into an opportunity to deliver better lives and a better Britain.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s why the proposal I set out at the 2019 election had public ownership and public investment in our energy system as a central plank, so we can be strategic and make sure that extra costs are not loaded on to homes that can\u2019t afford it. For example, when it comes to insulating homes, it makes sense for the government to pay for the work upfront, and for the costs to be repaid by households who can afford it over time through savings on their energy bills. Lower-income households should not have to repay the cost of the works, so they can benefit from all the bill savings immediately. Delivering such a large programme in partnership with local communities, with local councils and public bodies playing a central role, can guarantee the quality of work to people\u2019s homes and the quality of jobs we create.</p> \n<p>When it comes to developing the renewable energy sector and where the public is helping to provide the investment, the public should also get a long-term stake in what are profitable enterprises. The UK, as the world\u2019s largest offshore wind market, should have a far greater role in manufacturing the technology, creating good, skilled jobs here, rather than relying on imports, as is currently the case. We should use our public stake to make sure these projects benefit communities, with local procurement boosting local supply chains.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>I would like to see a bigger role for people in every part of the country to influence and shape the transition so I\u2019m fascinated to see what ideas will emerge from the first national citizens assembly on climate change. What\u2019s clear is that the transition to date has not been funded fairly because low-income households have paid a disproportionately high contribution and the debate so far has been too technocratic and too driven from Brussels and Westminster. For the transition to work the solutions in the next phase must have broad support and benefit communities across the country and that\u2019s more likely to happen if everyone can get involved.</p> \n<p><strong>KS </strong>(see previous answer) </p> \n<p><strong>5. How will you ensure </strong><strong>the poorest people in the UK and around the world are not made to pay disproportionately for the climate crisis?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>For too long in this country, too many of our communities have been ignored and seen the erosion of their local public services. We cannot tackle the climate crisis by loading the costs on to the shoulders of those just making ends meet. As leader I will continue to pursue progressive mechanisms, such as public ownership and strategic public investment in the infrastructure we need for the future, in a way that delivers our broader goals of aspirational socialism.</p> \n<p>For example, expanding our bus networks and creating a public transport system that is integrated, accessible and affordable will improve our air quality and cut emissions, while improving regional connectivity, making life more convenient for millions.</p> \n<p>Internationally, we need to make sure the UK is a world leader not a world lagger \u2013 as the first in the world to industrialise and one of the wealthiest, we need to reduce our emissions at a rate that takes our fair share of the global responsibility to avoid more than 1.5 degrees of warming, as well as ensuring we are doing it in a way that is just and equitable at home.</p> \n<p>Social justice and aspiration go hand in hand with global justice. When Trump comes to this country for Cop26 Labour needs to join the voices from around the globe calling for urgent action. The poorest parts of the globe are already experiencing the worst impacts of climate breakdown, which they are least responsible for creating. That is why I support increasing the amount of international public climate finance the UK provides for mitigation and adaptation, and channelling these funds through the UN\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.greenclimate.fund/\">green climate fund</a>, and away from the World Bank. Rather than welcome Trump to our country, we should be leading international efforts to establish a new fund to compensate countries in the global south for loss and damage suffered due to climate impacts. We can ensure the technologies developed in the UK and create jobs here through our green industrial revolution are also made available at reduced cost in the global south.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>It\u2019s a tragedy and an injustice that it is the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world who are most exposed to the impacts of the climate crisis around the world. Their voice must be heard as we debate the solutions to the crisis, not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do but also because it will help unlock the answers to a just transition. It was Europe\u2019s approach of working together with the small island states of the South Pacific and the vulnerable countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which built the global alliances that unlocked the Paris agreement. Britain\u2019s leadership in international development helped to build these special relationships and shows why social justice and environmental justice go hand in hand. We should never see offsets as a cheap alternative to reducing pollution here at home and we must pay for the investments needed by ensuring the wealthiest who did most to cause the problem invest the most in fixing it, and by exploring the role that well-designed pollution taxes could play to ensure the fossil fuel industry helps clean up the mess it caused.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>The Green New Deal needs to be married to social justice both domestically and internationally. Domestically we need a just transition which provides good unionised green jobs, addresses regional inequalities and does not leave workers behind. The UK has profited from burning fossil fuels in the past, so we must assist developing countries in their leap forward, skipping our bad habits, building renewables rather than coal power stations. We should use our development budget \u2013 and work for greater international financial assistance \u2013 to help developing countries grow their own low-carbon economies.</p> \n<p><strong>6. Do you support more new nuclear power stations after Hinkley C is completed and, if so, how will they be funded?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>I support new nuclear power where it is needed for the UK\u2019s future energy security. We need to find the right funding model that will guarantee value for money for the taxpayer and ensure any public stake is used in a way that benefits local communities.</p> \n<p><strong>Lisa Nandy</strong></p> \n<p>I\u2019m not writing my manifesto for the next general election just yet but I have argued consistently and for many years that now \u2013 right in the middle of a climate emergency \u2013 is not the time we should rule out a role for nuclear power or any other low-emission technology. The biggest challenges for the nuclear industry are the high costs associated with new nuclear stations, and their lack of a long-term sustainable solution to deal with the harmful waste they produce, but we will have to weigh these problems against the contribution nuclear power can make to meeting our energy demands in a way that creates good jobs and is consistent with building a zero-carbon economy and it is most important that we are guided by the science and the evidence on this.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>I support the Labour position that nuclear power is part of the mix of moving away from fossil fuels. But our overwhelming focus must be on increasing the energy share of renewables including solar, wind and tidal energy, and with decentralised energy.</p> \n<p><strong>7. Do you support HS2?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. The government\u2019s mismanagement of the cost and delivery date is a national scandal, and much more needs to be done to manage the local environmental impacts. However, HS2 is needed to increase the UK\u2019s rail capacity, reducing reliance on our roads for passengers and freeing up capacity for more freight travel. This should be part of a more ambitious programme for public transport. For example, we should be building high-speed rail down from Scotland, projects like Crossrail for the north, connections between our towns and reopening branch closures.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>The government has completely mishandled the HS2 project. They have let costs spiral and failed to make the argument for the merits of the scheme. HS2 should never be allowed to justify any failure to invest in the bus networks and other clean public transport projects, which should be a higher priority than this single railway, but it should be possible to both improve the capacity of the existing rail and bus network and expand it too so yes, it should go ahead.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>If we are serious about the climate emergency, we must invest in green public transport. For that to work effectively there has to be a national plan for an integrated public transport network, and HS2 should have been a part of that. I voted against HS2 because of the social and environmental impact it will have on Euston in my constituency. But the project is now inevitably going ahead, and my focus is compensation and mitigation locally. I recognise the need for connectivity in the north and Midlands but the project should have started there, not from London. HS2 should not proceed at the expense of other really important rail upgrades like Crossrail for the north.</p> \n<p><strong>8. Do you support or oppose the third runway at Heathrow and/or all airport expansion?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Labour was clear in our manifesto that any expansion of airports must pass our tests on air quality, noise pollution, climate change obligations and countrywide benefits, including the current proposals for Heathrow expansion. We need to be rigorous in upholding these tests; as leading scientists have again pointed out the proposals do not meet Labour\u2019s tests, particularly on climate change and as such I do not support them.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>I voted against a third runway at Heathrow because of the extraordinary environmental damage it would clearly cause, not just to our climate but to Londoners\u2019 air quality too. I was a councillor in west London and the experiences I witnessed of people suffering from asthma was already shocking many years ago, and it absolutely can\u2019t be allowed to get so much worse because of a failure of imagination in fixing our transport system. On airport expansion elsewhere in the country, we must be guided by the expert advice of the <a href=\"https://www.theccc.org.uk/\">Committee on Climate Change</a> in terms of what level of aviation growth could be consistent with our climate change laws and international commitments.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>I voted against Heathrow expansion because of the impact on climate change. We need to be serious about the climate emergency and our commitments under the Paris agreement. I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s consistent with approving airport expansion but, of course, I\u2019ll look at any proposals and measure them against climate tests.</p> \n<p><strong>9. Do you back financial support specifically for rewilding projects and commit to Labour\u2019s existing policy to create 10 new national nature parks; rewild the 10 existing national parks and create \u201cnatural corridors\u201d in the form of local parks, walking pathways, cycling lanes and canals?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. These are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>Tackling the climate emergency needs to go hand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment. Our country is one of the least wooded in the whole of Europe, and yet we know that trees lock up carbon, provide vital habitat for wildlife, and improve air quality in towns and cities. I also believe that every child deserves to have access to trees and green spaces as they grow up, wherever they live and whatever their parents\u2019 income.</p> \n<p>So I would absolutely create 10 new national nature parks and back natural corridors. I would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them.</p> \n<p>Rewilding is something I think we need to explore with local communities in the places where schemes like this might go forward. I am convinced we can find the right mixture of natural regeneration, new tree-planting and support for sustainable farming in this country, but to do so we first need to see off the risks of a Trump trade deal that would sacrifice environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards and throw many UK farmers on the scrapheap.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>Rewilding is an essential part of the fightback against the climate and environmental emergency. I support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets. Our children are breathing toxic air in 71% of UK towns and cities - this is a national scandal and more green spaces must be part of the solution.</p> \n<p><strong>10. Do you support a post-Brexit agricultural subsidy regime to support environmental schemes such as tree planting, soil and peat restoration and flood protection? Should that funding be at least \u00a31bn a year, ie a third of the current EU CAP scheme?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>I support maintaining the current level of funding support to British farming and farmland management. However, I will pursue a \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d approach, and would want to see agricultural subsidies conditioned on sustainable land use practices like tree planting, soil and peat restoration, flood protection and biodiversity promotion. Under my leadership, Labour would invest in forestation and landscape restoration, for example, our commitment to invest \u00a33.7bn over a decade in tree planting, but this funding would be additional to payments in the agricultural subsidy regime.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>It\u2019s bonkers that millionaires on the rich list are still raking in vast subsidies of taxpayers\u2019 cash from farm subsidies. Investing public money should always be about securing public goods, not offering backdoor handouts to wealthy Tory donors. Our farmers will need to play a crucial role in restoring nature, storing carbon to cut emissions, and growing healthy and sustainable food, and these are public goods our subsidy regime should be helping us to meet. With Boris Johnson pursuing such a hard Brexit, there is a real risk that these goals could be undermined in the pursuit of a low-standards, reckless trade deal with Trump and we must fight that every step of the way.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>Trees, soil, and peat are natural carbon sinks so restoring and replanting them will be key to our aims of net zero carbon emissions. As the recent floods across much of England and Wales demonstrate, the UK\u2019s flood protections are already insufficient, and the worsening climate crisis promises even more violent weather and rising sea levels. Significant investment in flood defences is therefore a priority to mitigate the worse effects of climate change.</p> \n<p><strong>11. Do you support the implementation of policies to reduce red meat consumption in the UK? If so what form might that take?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Growing numbers of people are cutting down on red meat, or becoming vegetarian and vegan, as people think about the environment and their health. It\u2019s been really positive how we\u2019ve seen businesses respond to that growing demand in producing substitutes for old favourites like the sausage roll. Too often the green movement has been painted as telling people what they can and can\u2019t do. We need to find a different way of having discussions as a country on these issues while not losing focus on the most urgent questions facing us. Fighting climate change is about key players across the world coming together to collectively address the challenge we face, and working out in this country how we can restructure our economy so that it is both sustainable and able to support a high quality of life for everyone.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>The priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food.</p> \n<p>In my view this is not about telling people what to eat \u2013 it\u2019s about tackling food waste, working with farmers to reduce pollution from things like artificial fertilisers and pesticides, and protecting high-quality food production in the UK from the impacts of reckless trade deals. I also think we have to have a much stronger focus on food poverty. Children going to school hungry in one of the richest countries in the world is both heart-breaking and shameful.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>After fossil fuels, the food industry \u2013 particularly the meat and dairy sector \u2013 is one of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, to deforestation. All of us should therefore think about how we might reduce our consumption of red meat. But changes in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change. That\u2019s why I support Labour\u2019s plans for a radical Green New Deal to combat the climate and environmental emergency.</p> \n<p><strong>12. Do you support a frequent flyer</strong><strong> tax to reduce air travel?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>At the moment the vast majority of the population fly once a year or less \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t be unfairly taxed. We don\u2019t want to penalise or make it harder for people to go on holiday. But it is right to consider how we ask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights. In government as Labour leader I would ensure we review aviation taxation and consider and consult on the development and implementation of proposals recommended by the Committee on Climate Change.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>It cannot be right that when 70% of flights are taken by just 15% of the public, the wealthiest people who are polluting the most do not pay a level of tax to reflect this and instead pay the same as the family taking their hard-earned rest once a year, so yes as prime minister I would look to make the system fairer and greener.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>Air travel is a particularly fossil fuel-intensive form of travel so, especially while we do not have the technology for green flights, we should encourage people to use alternative forms of transport where possible. We need to make sure that our tax system encourages that.</p> \n<p><strong>13. Will you commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. We need greater funding for and an expansion of public transport, cycling and walking for all sorts of reasons \u2013 not just in tackling the climate crisis, but to improve our economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>It is absolutely scandalous that when 60% of journeys are by bus, literally thousands of local bus routes have been cut since the Tories came back to power, hundreds just in the last year, and fares have been allowed to rocket too. I would invest properly in public transport \u2013 and yes nationalise the railways, but also give councils the power to run bus routes for people not profit so they can set the fares and the routes and ensure all the buses in the fleet are zero carbon by 2025. I know that where Labour is in power, our mayors and councils are paving the way on cycling and as a result the number of cyclists is going up, so I would work with them to ensure communities get the investment they need to build on these successes.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>The government has made a political choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport. I would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system \u2013 with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians.</p> \n<p><strong>14. Do you back clean air zones that charge or ban polluting vehicles in urban areas, which government research shows are the most effective policy to reduce air pollution?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes, I support a new Clean Air Act enshrining the World Health Organization\u2019s advisory air quality standards into domestic law. This would include clean air zones around schools. I was proud to announce Labour\u2019s electric car revolution at Labour conference last year, setting out how an industrial strategy can support the sector to transition to manufacturing electric vehicles and batteries, and proposing creative measures such as electric community car clubs. So alongside an expansion in public transport we are also ensuring that we are transitioning over to zero emission vehicles, and that transition supports jobs and industries here in Britain.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>It is truly shocking that one in 19 deaths in our largest cities and towns are linked to air pollution when we can and should do much more to prevent this. In London, Oxford, Reading and most of the south-east, levels are above the limits recognised as safe by the World Health Organization and on some days many kids can\u2019t even play outside in their school playgrounds without a high risk of suffering an asthma attack caused by the toxic state of the air. Labour in local government is leading the way on tackling this through schemes like [London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s] Ulez [ultra-low emission zone] and [Bristol mayor Marvin Rees\u2019s] diesel ban in Bristol. We need the new clean air legislation expected this year to ensure our air is healthy to breathe, in line with WHO advice, and to bolster the strong local government action Labour is leading.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>Air pollution already contributes to over 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, and is particularly damaging to the health of our children, who are breathing unsafe levels of air pollution in 71% of our towns and cities. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for an immediate Clean Air Act to tackle air pollution by creating clean air zones.</p> \n<p><strong>15. The Committee on Climate Change says the UK is unprepared for the impacts of climate change. Will you increase funding for adaptation and what policies do you support to prepare for the inevitable increases in flooding, heatwaves and summer water shortages?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Yes. I stand by Labour\u2019s 2019 commitment to invest an additional \u00a35.6bn to level up flood defences over 10 years, paid for through public capital investment. The new fund will prioritise areas of need, particularly in regions such as the north-west, Yorkshire and the east Midlands that have been neglected under the Tories.</p> \n<p>Climate change will place huge pressures on our freshwater resources. But the UK\u2019s privatised water companies have done a terrible job managing that resource, with only 14% of rivers safe for swimming, record fines issued for sewage leaks, and 20-25% of our water wasted before it even reaches our taps. That is why managing our water security in a warming climate will require publicly owned, democratically accountable water companies.</p> \n<p>Better insulated homes, delivered through Labour\u2019s mass retrofitting programme, will be better adapted to extreme summer heat as well as keeping us warm in winter.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>Short-term Tory cuts to flood budgets left scars on communities across the country and are one of the worst impacts of their damaging austerity programme. We\u2019re lucky to have some of the foremost experts in the entire world in the Met Office, the Committee on Climate Change, and in many of our universities, to advise us on what we should do to prepare for climate change and so we should heed their advice about what dangerous impacts we must prepare for to ensure we are limiting the damage from worsening extreme weather wherever we can and that means properly investing in flood defences.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>As demonstrated by the recent flooding of much of England and Wales and the fact that the last five years have been the hottest five years on record, the effects of climate breakdown have already begun. Mitigating those effects will be essential and funding needs to match our new needs \u2013 but it should not distract from our absolute commitment to prevention through urgent emission reductions and a Green New Deal.</p> \n<p><strong>16. What direct diplomacy should Labour under</strong><strong>take with international partners to help make C</strong><strong>op26 a success?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>The eyes of the world will be on us at Cop26; we need to show them we reject those who deny the climate crisis or continue to fail to act on its urgency. World leaders have to heed the warnings of young climate activists whose future is at stake; the world is increasingly in flames as we have seen in the Amazon, California, Australia and in Scotland last spring. As Labour leader I will work directly with our sister parties in Europe and across the world, both in power and in opposition, to help make sure an ambitious set of demands and commitments are agreed at Cop26.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>I was proud to lead Labour\u2019s international delegation to the historic Paris summit and to meet the civil society leaders and diplomats who worked so tirelessly to secure that deal. So I know how precious and hard-won it was and is and why it is essential we now defend it and see it implemented in full.</p> \n<p>Across the world it is gutsy, young women like the prime ministers of Finland and New Zealand, who are carrying the hopes and dreams of Greta and the youth movement into the global diplomatic arena and making strides forward and if I am prime minister I promise to join them.</p> \n<p>Ahead of the Cop26 summit in Scotland later this year, there is an opportunity for Labour to build on the initiative I kick-started five years ago to showcase climate solutions where we are in power in local government, city halls and the Welsh assembly and to share the learning from these experiences internationally, as I know Sadiq has been doing with London\u2019s experiences through the C40 network of cities who helped secure the Paris agreement.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>We know that climate change is an unavoidably international problem. So we must match our efforts for a Green New Deal at home with our efforts abroad. The UK should use our Cop26 presidency to build and lead an international net-zero coalition. On 8 March 2020, I\u2019m meeting with activists and experts in Birmingham to begin co-designing the demands that we think the Labour party should make of our government and of governments around the world at Cop26. We will be there in Glasgow alongside our European sister parties to hold governments to account for future generations.</p> \n<p><strong>17. Would you support a progressive alliance with the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Greens and Plaid </strong><strong>Cymru around climate action and backing for a green new deal?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>RLB</strong></p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s green industrial revolution is one of the most ambitious policy platforms in the world for how a country can decarbonise and be sustainable. It can be a rallying call for the concrete demands we need to implement to meet our climate targets, and put the achievement of social justice and the creation of good, unionised jobs at its heart. I will work with anyone who supports those demands in parliament, across our trade unions, the labour movement, civil society and activists. As Labour leader I will make sure that Labour is part of the coalition keeping this issue high on the political agenda and will resist any moves to restrict the civil liberties of peaceful activists and campaigners ahead of Cop26. At Cop26 I think Labour should push for the UK to adopt more ambitious national targets on climate change, to provide increased levels of public climate finance, and to lead international efforts to establish a new fund for loss and damage.</p> \n<p><strong>LN</strong></p> \n<p>I have seen the leadership [Green party MP] Caroline Lucas has brought to the climate debate, and I know that like me she has championed a Green New Deal so yes of course I would work with her and MPs from all parties to make it a reality.</p> \n<p><strong>KS</strong></p> \n<p>We need a Labour government to implement a Green New Deal, hardwired into all our policies to mitigate the damage of climate and environmental breakdown, while empowering communities and creating good, green jobs across the country. Every community deserves the right to vote for a Labour government. But we will work with other parties in parliament where they share our aims.</p>",
  "<p>Transforming the energy efficiency of every home, mass rewilding of the countryside, huge investment in cycling, walking and buses, and a \u201cfrequent flyer\u201d tax are among a raft of green policies being put forward by the politicians vying to replace Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour party.</p> <p>In answers to 17 questions put by the Guardian before the coronavirus outbreak, all three remaining candidates \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Keir Starmer \u2013 set out detailed plans on how they would go about tackling the dual environmental crises of climate breakdown and mass extinction, and shed light on how the party under their leadership would tackle some of the biggest challenges facing the UK, and the world.</p> <p>In the 2019 election, the climate crisis was more prominent than it has been in any previous contest, and voters and green campaigners are increasingly putting pressure on the leadership candidates to stick to the ambition of the Labour manifesto, which for the first time put tackling the climate emergency at the heart of its offer.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Labour for a Green New Deal group, which campaigned for the party to adopt a radical economic plan to deal with the crisis in the run-up to the election, sent <a href=\"https://www.labourgnd.uk/leadership-2020\">five questions to each candidate and scored their answers out of 10</a>: Long-Bailey came out on top, with Starmer second and Nandy third.</p> <p>The Guardian also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/oct/11/guardian-climate-score-how-did-your-mp-do\">scored all MPs on their record on the climate crisis</a> as part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-polluters\">The polluters series</a> last year. In that analysis, Long-Bailey and Nandy both came out with the maximum score of 100%. Starmer had only been present for two votes, meaning there was insufficient information for him to be given a score.</p> <p>In a clear sign of how deeply embedded a radical environmental agenda has become in Labour policy, all three candidates, answering before the Covid 19 outbreak said the climate crisis was the biggest challenge facing the UK. Both Long-Bailey and Nandy highlighted their previous experience \u2013 Long-Bailey as the architect of Labour\u2019s Green New Deal at the last election and Nandy from her time as the party\u2019s shadow energy secretary and her role leading Labour\u2019s team at the Paris climate talks in 2015.</p> <h2>The Green New Deal</h2> <p>All the candidates pledged broad support for Labour\u2019s comprehensive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/tom-bailey-on-labours-green-plans-we-just-need-to-get-on-with-it\">Green New Deal agenda</a>. Both Long-Bailey and Starmer supported the specifics of the plan set out in the 2019 manifesto, spelling out how the UK could rapidly decarbonise the economy and create hundreds of thousands of secure, unionised green jobs.</p> <p>Starmer said the project should be \u201chardwired\u201d into everything a future Labour government did \u201cfrom foreign policy to local government, from transport to housing\u201d, and he flagged up the role of the \u201cgreen transformation fund and a national investment bank\u201d to pay for it.</p> <p>Long-Bailey said that under her leadership Labour would organise and pay for such an ambitious scheme through public ownership and investment in the energy system to ensure \u201cextra costs are not loaded onto homes that can\u2019t afford it\u201d.</p> <p>Nandy did not commit to the details of the plan but agreed there needed to be \u201ca wholesale transformation\u201d in the way homes and businesses were powered and heated, adding that \u201cthis is possible and necessary and offers huge economic opportunities\u201d.</p> <h2>Public transport</h2> <p>Asked whether they would commit to greater funding for public transport, cycling and walking than for road building, Long-Bailey said she would, saying it was necessary not just to tackle the climate crisis, but to improve \u201cour economy, the connections between cities and towns, and rural areas, making our public transport more accessible and to encourage healthier lives and cleaner air.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Nandy nor Starmer specifically committed to spending more on public transport, walking and cycling than roads although both said they would increase investment in those areas.</p> <p>Nandy said she would nationalise the railways and hand over control of buses to local councils so they were run \u201cfor people not profit\u201d.</p> <p>Starmer said the government had made a \u201cpolitical choice to spend transport budgets on roads rather than greener and cheaper forms of transport\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cI would lead a Labour government with different priorities: building a more sustainable, affordable, accessible and integrated transport system \u2013 with investment in bus services, renationalisation of our railways, and support for cycling and pedestrians.\u201d</p> <h2>Airport expansion and frequent flyer tax</h2> <p>All the candidates expressed interest in a frequent flyer tax to ensure that the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/economy/do-15-people-take-70-flights/\">15% of wealthy UK residents who are estimated to take 70% of domestic and international flights</a> pay more for the environmental damage they cause.</p> <p>Nandy said she would look to \u201cmake the system fairer and greener\u201d. Long-Bailey said it was right to \u201cask wealthy frequent flyers to shoulder more responsibility, or reduce the frequency of their flights\u201d.</p> <p>Starmer said the tax system should encourage people to use alternatives to flying.</p> <p>All three said they were opposed to expansion at Heathrow and were sceptical about aviation expansion elsewhere in light of the UK\u2019s legal commitments to reduce carbon emissions.</p> <h2><strong>Nuclear power</strong></h2> <p>None of the candidates came out against nuclear power. Long-Bailey said she supported it where necessary for the UK\u2019s \u201cenergy security\u201d. Nandy said that the middle of a climate emergency was the wrong time to rule it out definitively. Starmer said nuclear power should be \u201cpart of the mix\u201d in the transition away from fossil fuels, but the \u201coverwhelming focus\u201d should be on renewables.</p> <h2>Red meat</h2> <p>Asked whether they would support policies to reduce red meat consumption, Nandy said the focus should be on the fossil fuel industry. \u201cThe priority for governments must be to focus on the biggest driver of emissions, which is the global fossil fuel industry; but the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that we also need to think about how we manage our land and produce our food.\u201d</p> <p>Long-Bailey highlighted the growing number of people who are cutting down on red meat \u201cas people think about the environment and their health\u201d, but stopped short of any specific policy commitments.</p> <p>Starmer acknowledged that the meat and dairy sector was \u201cone of the most significant contributors to climate change and, in many countries, deforestation\u201d, adding that everyone should think about how to reduce their consumption.</p> <p>But he added: \u201cChanges in behaviour, important as they are, should not distract us from the systemic nature of the problem of climate change.\u201d</p> <h2>Rewilding and biodiversity</h2> <p>Nandy said tackling the climate emergency went \u201chand-in-hand with restoring our natural environment\u201d. She backed Labour\u2019s existing policy of creating 10 new national nature parks, adding: \u201cI would also enable more people to take control of the management of their local parks, and ensure that local government had the powers and funding to maintain them.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer agreed rewilding was an essential part of the \u201cfightback against the climate and environmental emergency\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI support ambitious tree-planting schemes and new nature parks to halt the devastating loss of biodiversity and to help in the fight against air pollution which plagues our streets.\u201d</p> <p>Long-Bailey also backed Labour\u2019s existing plans to create new parks and rewild existing ones, as well as \u201cnatural corridors\u201d across the country.</p> <p>\u201cThese are examples of actions we need to take to tackle the climate crisis, but will also make our cities, towns and local communities nicer and healthier places to live, bringing public luxury to the spaces and services we care about.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The plunging demand for oil wrought by the coronavirus pandemic combined with a savage price war has left the fossil fuel industry <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-29/the-global-oil-market-is-broken-drowning-in-crude-nobody-needs\">broken</a> and in survival mode, according to analysts. It faces the gravest challenge in its 100-year history, they say, one that will permanently alter the industry.

The lowest oil prices for almost two decades, with worse potentially on the way. Some oil major stock market valuations halved since January. At least two-thirds of annual investment \u2013 $130bn \u2013 dumped and tens of thousands of job losses. In a few markets prices have gone negative \u2013 sellers will pay you to take the oil, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/oil-price-may-fall-to-10-a-barrel-as-world-runs-out-of-storage-space\">global storage capacity fills</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe price war and Covid-19 have really thrown the oil and gas sector into turmoil, and now we have companies really in survival mode,\u201d said Valentina Kretzschmar, director of corporate research at analysts Wood Mackenzie.</p> <p>Oil wells responsible for almost 1m barrels a day may have already been shut down because the price of oil is now lower than the cost of shipping it, according to US banking giant Goldman Sachs, with the number of wells growing \u201cby the hour\u201d. This is likely to \u201cpermanently alter the energy industry and its geopolitics\u201d and \u201cshift the debate around climate change\u201d, said Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities at the bank.</p> <p>Demand for oil has plummeted as the coronavirus locks down people in their homes and airplanes on runways. \u201cThe virus will bring forward peak demand for fossil fuels,\u201d said Kingsmill Bond, at analysts Carbon Tracker. This latest cyclical oil shock is hitting an industry already heading towards a structural peak created by nations committing to net zero future emissions, he said.</p> <p>\u201cAs for the impact of the virus on the timing [of peak demand], it depends of course on the severity,\u201d he said. In 2018, Carbon Tracker estimated <a href=\"https://carbontracker.org/reports/2020-vision-why-you-should-see-the-fossil-fuel-peak-coming/\">peak demand would come in 2023</a> but Bond said it was possible that the crisis has advanced this by three years. \u201cThat means that peak emissions was almost certainly 2019, and perhaps peak fossil fuels as well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be touch and go if there can be another mini-peak in 2022, before the inexorable decline begins.\u201d</p> <p>While the oil companies themselves have long argued peak demand is too far off to put a number on, most observers thought it would happen this decade. Mark Lewis, head of climate change investment research at BNP Paribas, agreed the crises could bring it closer.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the dust settles, the peak demand narrative will be there stronger than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is particularly true if long-haul aviation fails to recover.

This threatens what Lewis calls the \u201cgolden dividend era\u201d of the last two decades, which has made oil stocks mainstays of portfolios.</p> <p>Wood Mackenzie last week analysed the impact of an oil price of $35 on companies\u2019 previous investment plans for 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very ugly picture,\u201d said Kretzschmar. \u201cAt $35 per barrel, 75% of projects don\u2019t even cover the cost of capital.\u201d</p> <p>Most strikingly, the fat rates of return projected for the oil and gas projects have slumped from about 20% down to 6%, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re very much in line now with what you can get from solar and wind projects.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe oil and gas sector is already a very much unloved sector by investors and in this kind of oil price environment, it becomes low return, high risk and high carbon,\u201d Kretzschmar said. \u201cIt is not a very attractive proposition.\u201d With oil prices predicted by some to collapse even further, Kretzschmar is blunt: \u201cAt $20 [the industry] will be decimated.\u201d</p> <p>The oil industry was already under pressure from investors concerned about the climate crisis and increasing regulation from governments to cut emissions. Colin Melvin, at Arkadiko Partners, a consultancy advising some of the world\u2019s biggest investment management and pension funds, said that after the crisis he expects investment to flow increasingly towards companies perceived to offer wider social benefits.</p> <p>\u201cThe purpose of the investment of capital in business is to create wellbeing, to create wealth in the true sense, and I think that is going to become more and more relevant to investors,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England pensions board, said the implications for the oil and gas sector could be significant. \u201c[Demand reduction] could be the catalyst for rapid change and I think investors are going to look at long term systemic challenges very closely and want to see much greater resilience.\u201d</p> <p>As well as climate concerns, the wild instability of the oil markets provoked by the crises may also deter investors, according to <a href=\"https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/OEF121.pdf?v=79cba1185463\">analysis from the University of Oxford\u2019s Institute for Energy Studies</a>: \u201cThis is a market that is being tested to its limits.\u201d</p> <p>However, not all experts think the oil industry\u2019s loss is necessarily a gain for green energy and the climate. \u201cIf anything it may hold up the share of oil for longer, because it\u2019s cheaper. It could be bad news from a climate point of view,\u201d said Dieter Helm, professor of energy policy at the University of Oxford.</p> <p>He said securing a green economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis will require deliberate policy measures from governments: \u201cThis is where the carbon tax comes in.

Bond said: \u201cThe big difference to 2008 is that the cost of renewables is now below that of fossil fuels. There is no point trying to sustain the unsustainable high-cost fossil assets in any event. It would be deeply ironic for [neoliberal] advocates of Ayn Rand to ask for a government bailout.\u201d</p> <p>Adrienne Buller, an economist at the Common Wealth thinktank, said governments in countries like the UK, US and Canada should now consider nationalising major oil corporations.</p> <p>\u201cFossil fuel companies won\u2019t be allowed to fail en masse.</p> <p> Any bailout should at a bare minimum come with equivalent public stakes in the companies, and strong conditions for environmental and climate protections and a transition away from fossil fuel production.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, given the intent of acquiring this stake should be to wind down production as rapidly as feasible while ensuring a just transition for workers and security of energy supply, nationalisation may be more appropriate and pragmatic.\u201d</p> <p>The global industry trade body, the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, insists its members have a vital role after the pandemic. \u201cOil and gas play a significant role in the global energy mix and will do so in the future,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cIt is too early to predict what the midterm impact will be. But the oil and gas industry has a history of successfully responding to difficult situations and we anticipate that it will adapt as it has before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFurthermore, the industry has been a key engine of prosperity and a driver of innovation for many decades,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has the experience, skills, knowledge and resources needed to realise a low-emissions energy future - a transition that would be more difficult and more expensive without it.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Saudi Arabia is desparate to cash out\u2019</h2> <p>Adding fuel to the fire of the pandemic is the price war being waged by Saudi Arabia and Russia, who increased production just as the pandemic slashed demand, sending prices towards the floor. The moves are seen as an attempt to grab market share by killing the higher cost producers behind the US shale boom.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2944c5fe46dd430496ecf908a6393fc9aae18a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2944c5fe46dd430496ecf908a6393fc9aae18a7/0_139_3679_2209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prof Bernard Haykel, at Princeton University, US, said it also reflects a <a href=\"http://haykel\">more fundamental strategic shift</a> led by Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman: \u201cWith a global clean-energy transition inevitable, he is desperate to cash out while the Kingdom still can.\u201d</p> <p>The lasting impact of the price war depends on how long Saudi Arabia and Russia can keep pumping cheap oil. While their production costs are very low, they depend on high revenues to balance their national budgets.</p> <p><a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/blog/covid-19-the-low-carbon-crisis/\">Michael Liebreich, at Bloomberg New Energy Finance</a>, said the fiscal break-even for Saudi Arabia is around $80 per barrel, meaning its foreign exchange reserves might sustain rock-bottom oil prices for only two or three years. \u201cRussia, with a $40 a barrel fiscal break-even and much more diversified economy, can survive low oil prices for a decade,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Whatever happens, the industry will never be the same again after the double whammy of the pandemic and price war. \u201cThe companies that emerge from the crisis will not be the ones that went into it,\u201d said Carbon Tracker\u2019s Bond. \u201cWe will see write-downs, restructuring and radical change.\u201d</p> <p>Experts, including Currie at Goldman Sachs, say the climate change debate will almost certainly take a difference course after the crisis.

  "<p>New <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.13215\">research</a> has finally demonstrated what many marine biologists suspected but had never before seen: fish migrating through the deep sea.</p> <p>The study, published this month in the <a href=\"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.13215\">Journal of Animal Ecology</a>, used analysis of deep-sea photographs to show a regular increase in the number of fish in particular months, suggesting seasonal migrations.</p> <p>Tracking fish in the deep sea is challenging. They are sparsely distributed, the water is nearly devoid of sunlight, and the monitoring equipment has to withstand enormous pressure.</p> <p>The study used photographs taken by the <a href=\"https://www.delos-project.org/\">Deep</a><a href=\"https://www.delos-project.org/\">-ocean Environmental Long-term Observatory System (D</a><a href=\"https://www.delos-project.org/\">elos)</a>, two observatories on the sea bed 1,400m below the surface, off the coast of Angola. The researchers analysed 12,703 photographs \u2013 only 502 of which had actually managed to capture a fish \u2013 taken over seven-and-a-half years, and found that each year, in late November and June, there was a spike in the number of fish.</p> <p>\u201cIt is certainly not unprecedented but it has never really been demonstrated,\u201d says <a href=\"https://cnso.nova.edu/overview/faculty-staff-profiles/rosanna-milligan.html\">Rosanna Milligan</a>, an assistant professor at Nova Southeastern University in Florida and the lead author on the paper. \u201cThat is what we were able to do with this study.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/12/david-attenborough-calls-for-ban-on-devastating-deep-sea-mining\">David Attenborough calls for ban on 'devastating' deep sea mining</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEven after all these years, one of my favourite parts of being a scientist is when you do those first graphs of your results and start to see something emerging from the data,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/bahcm/staff/davidbailey/\">David Bailey</a>, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow and a co-author on the paper. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the greatest thrills of the whole scientific endeavour.

What does it mean and what are the fish doing?\u201d</p> <p>Very little is known about the behaviour of any of the fish photographed. Grenadiers, a family of fish seen in more than 100 of the Delos photos, have long tails that may allow them to move great distances at low speed \u2013 but despite being a relatively common deep-sea fish, little information exists on how far they can swim.

Plankton blooms off the coast of west Africa every year four months before the deep-sea fish migrate into the area. Given that the deep sea is dependent on life at the surface that dies and sinks to the bottom, it is possible that other animals could be gathering to take advantage of the dying plankton, and the deep-sea fish migrate to eat those.</p> <p>\u201cWe just have no idea how these things act,\u201d says <a href=\"https://museumsvictoria.com.au/about-us/staff/dr-tim-ohara/\">Tim O\u2019Hara</a>, a researcher and senior curator of marine zoology at Museums Victoria, Australia, who was not involved in the research. \u201cWe are literally groping in the dark. It\u2019s kilometres down in the ocean and we get these tiny bits of information from one or two locations and we\u2019re trying to put together a big picture.\u201d</p> <p>Milligan and Bailey hope this discovery encourages other researchers to look for similar patterns in the deep oceans.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe if we had more of this level of surveillance in other places, we would find fish migrations in all kinds of places,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cIt\u2019s just that [Angola] is where we happened to be observing in this level of detail for this amount of time \u2026 This could be happening all over the place.\u201d</p>",

The death toll from the virus in the country passed 4,000 and is greater than that reported by China (3,309). California governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday that the number of Covid-19 hospitalisations in the state had nearly doubled over the past four days and the number of ICU patients tripled during that time.</p> <h2><strong>France, Spain, Russia and the UK record their highest daily deaths on Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>Tuesday was a deadly day across Europe, with the largest increases in the number of deaths from the coronavirus in a number of countries. UK deaths were up 381 from 1,408 on the previous 24 hours \u2013 representing a 27% day-on-day increase \u2013 by far the biggest the country has experienced.</p> <h2><strong>US Navy captain asks permission to isolate 4,000 crew members in Guam</strong></h2> <p>The captain of US Navy aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/captain-of-coronavirus-us-aircraft-carrier-4000-sailors-let-off-ship-die-theodore-roosevelt\">asking for permission</a> to isolate the bulk of his roughly 5,000 crew members onshore after several sailors became infected with Covid-19.

There\u2019s already a lockdown in Herat and around Kabul and Kandahar, and we\u2019re really concerned about the humanitarian impact. It\u2019s already challenging. The border on the Pakistan side is closed and we are expecting more measures.</p> <p>\u201cSupply lines are chocking up which is a real concern in a country on the brink of famine. On top of that there is the issue of the Taliban and other armed groups allowing access in areas that are not accessible, which underlines the talk there has been around a [global] corona ceasefire.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month Joel Millman, of the International Organization for Migration, which has been tracking the returns from Iran, warned of the danger of widespread transiting via unofficial border crossings.</p> <p>\u201cThis is particularly dangerous in a public health emergency, because \u2026 no one is able to check your health conditions or your documents, or know where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d<br></p>",

  "<p>The Coalition just announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/australia-to-subsidise-wages-of-up-to-6m-workers-in-130bn-coronavirus-plan\">$130bn wage subsidy</a> when the budget is already in deficit. As that sinks in, try to absorb the fact that the $130bn wasn\u2019t targeted at any vulnerable group and had absolutely no \u201cmutual obligations\u201d attached to it. It was not \u201cfunded\u201d by spending cuts elsewhere or new forms of revenue.</p> <p>Everything you thought the Coalition believed about economic management was thrown overboard on Monday, and it\u2019s not before time. The silly rhetoric and rules of \u201cneoliberalism\u201d were never based on economic theory or evidence. Fortunately, in the face of a genuine crisis the Morrison government has embraced the reality that the one thing the economy needs most, right now, is an enormous budget deficit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/31/australian-economic-stimulus-package-how-much-governments-have-committed-to-coronavirus-crisis\">In the last 20 days Scott Morrison has spent about $200bn</a>. A month ago, most people thought a country with an annual income of $2,000bn a year spending $10bn was a lot. But when Morrison spent $130bn subsidising businesses to (hopefully) keep employing people he wasn\u2019t asked a single question about \u201cwhere the money would come from\u201d or \u201chow he would fund his new policy\u201d. It\u2019s not just the politicians that have become crisis Keynesians.</p> <p>Australia is on track for a budget deficit of $300bn. In addition to the enormous cost of the wage subsidies and welfare payments, there will be huge increases in spending on health and community services. Once the health crisis begins to clear, there will be hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of further stimulus to bring some, but not all, of our \u201chibernating\u201d economy back from the dead. And then there\u2019s the inevitable decline in tax revenue from business, individuals and the GST. At the end of this crisis commonwealth debt/GDP is likely to hit 100%. The budget deficit will, rightly, be as unprecedented in size as the shock to the economy Covid-19 has delivered.</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just the rhetoric about the \u201cevils\u201d of debt and deficit that now lie abandoned by the Coalition. For decades we have been told by conservatives that the best way for government to boost economic activity is to cut the tax rates paid by high income earners and businesses. But in all the $200bn worth of stimulus spending announced this month, there\u2019s not been a whisper about cutting taxes. Even the Business Council of Australia has been strategically silent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/australias-economic-victims-of-coronavirus-just-like-the-health-victims-need-help-now\">Australia's economic victims of coronavirus, just like the health victims, need help now | Richard Denniss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to last year\u2019s budget papers, the commonwealth expected to collect less than $100bn this year in company tax. But it has announced a so-called \u201cjobkeeper\u201d package of $130bn over six months. If the government really believed that cutting taxes would make firms invest and create jobs, they could have simply abolished company tax, but they now admit that only public spending can be relied on to boost economic activity in times of crisis.</p> <p>Which brings me to the role of the public sector more generally. Last Christmas Eve, the former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/25/barnaby-joyce-sick-government-being-in-my-life-taxes-climate-change\">released a remarkable video</a> in which he concluded: \u201cLook, I just don\u2019t want the government any more in my life, I\u2019m sick of the government being in my life.\u201d</p> <p>Plenty of people are sick right now, but I don\u2019t hear many Coalition MPs saying that they are sick of pesky governments interfering in our lives. Just as firefighters and police risked, and gave, their lives to save others fighting the fires that raged over summer; nurses, teachers, paramedics and police are risking their lives to keep our essential services functioning, as a deadly new threat invades our society and their workplaces.</p> <p>Australia is one of the richest countries in the world, yet we came into a summer of fires and this winter\u2019s deadly virus poorly prepared and poorly resourced to protect ourselves or each other. Decades of funding cuts have stretched our health, welfare and crisis housing services to breaking point. Just as our firefighters lacked essential equipment to deal with summer\u2019s fires, Australian hospitals \u2013 that can barely cope with Friday night workloads during the regular winter flu season \u2013 are working around the clock to prepare for the flood of expected Covid-19 patients. If we had as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-reporting-italy-death-toll\">little time to prepare as Italy</a>, our hospitals would already be overwhelmed.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the Coalition has embraced big spending, but it is still fighting tooth and nail to keep government as small as possible. The vast majority of the stimulus spending has gone to employers \u2013 who now get to decide which staff will be eligible for a $750 a week wage subsidy and which will have to line up for the less generous dole. Hundreds of thousands of Australians will soon be thanking their boss for \u201ckeeping them on\u201d instead of thanking the government for paying 100% of their wage. Well played, Scott Morrison. Well played.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-is-not-the-villain-australias-economy-was-already-on-a-precipice\">Coronavirus is not the villain: Australia\u2019s economy was already on a precipice | Richard Denniss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a big difference between pumping money into the economy and creating jobs. When governments pour hundreds of billions of dollars into existing businesses it\u2019s literally impossible to use that money to encourage new things to happen. Targeted wage subsidies have an important role to play in keeping people working through this crisis, but subsidising the wages of 6 million workers to prevent 1 million of them losing their jobs isn\u2019t targeting, it\u2019s an enormous transfer of wealth to the owners of profitable businesses.</p> <p>The economic crisis isn\u2019t over and neither is the announcement of enormous new spending policies. Rounds four and five of new spending are likely to arrive as quickly as the first three. But unless the government shifts its thinking to recognise the need for bigger government, as opposed to just bigger spending by government, the welfare of the economy and the population will be harmed for years to come.</p> <p>While creating jobs is important, so too is creating the goods and services that the Australian public will need both to get through this crisis and to thrive after it has passed. During the Great Depression, governments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/22/the-wet-wild-and-wonderful-ocean-pools-of-new-south-wales-a-social-history\">built beautiful art deco ocean baths</a> that created jobs at the time and, importantly, still create joy for hundreds of thousands of Australians 90 years later. Good decisions now will deliver benefits for decades to come.</p> <p>The Coalition was obsessed with pointing out during the global financial crisis that pumping money into the economy is the easy bit. Targeting it at things that deliver benefits to citizens is a much, much harder task.</p> <p>In 20 years\u2019 time, kids around Australia will still be benefiting from the school halls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/04/ten-years-on-voters-say-labors-52bn-stimulus-saved-australia-from-recession\">Wayne Swan and Kevin Rudd rolled out</a>, as fast as they could, during the GFC.</p> <p>Unless Morrison starts targeting significant spending at significant problems, it\u2019s possible that all we will remember him for will be the record level of debt.</p> <ul> <li><p>Richard Denniss is the chief economist at the independent thinktank the Australia Institute</p></li> </ul>",

I\u2019ve learned that being able to be vulnerable is the true meaning of intimacy. If you\u2019d have asked me a decade ago, I\u2019d have said being intimate just meant having sex and maybe cuddling afterwards. I now know it means being your true self with another human being, without fear of lampoonery or judgment. Often, that\u2019s platonic. In a corruption of Tina\u2019s famous song: what\u2019s sex got to do with it?</p> <p>One on one, I\u2019m far more likely to let people in. I might cry. I won\u2019t feel anywhere near the pressure to consistently make everyone laugh; the exhausting expectation of maintaining levity is released.</p> <p>I ask different questions from the group catchup, too. We move beyond the inane small talk that I loathe (how are you? what have you been up to?) and go straight for the big talk: how are you coping? What are you grateful for? What are you particularly worried about? What are the top three things you\u2019re looking forward to doing when this whole repressive shitstorm is over? We go deeper, quicker.</p> <p>I\u2019m completely different in a group scenario. I still enjoy them, but I often play a persona. I\u2019m less likely to show fragility.

People sometimes play heightened versions of themselves: overdramatic; nonchalant; boozy. It\u2019s to perform to the rest of the group. It can sometimes feel like every other line must be a punchline. Or a rant. Anything to maintain the varying concentration levels of the group. I\u2019ve even noticed some friends being contrary in a group environment, perhaps to provoke or tease \u2013 albeit affectionately. Those same friends, one on one, are nowhere near as pugnacious; they\u2019re considerate, understanding and listen more.

Bartering is back. In your letterbox are flyers from your actual neighbours. They are introducing themselves and offering to do your food shopping or pick up prescriptions for you. Community libraries are being set up in boxes along suburban streets. There are signs offering seedlings in exchange for cuttings. All along your road your neighbours are planting vegetables.</p> <p>In the sky there are few planes and hardly any cars on the road. Trains and buses are almost empty \u2013 and if you try to sit next to someone, people look really scared and angry and move seats.</p> <p>In the tradition of plain dressed religious groups, people\u2019s hair has also changed. Everyone looks as if they cut their hair at home into bowl cuts, with blunt scissors. Those with coloured hair have stopped maintaining it. They have grey temples, white streaks or skunk stripes down their parts. Men are growing long beards.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the haircuts \u2013 it\u2019s the faces.</p> <p>People, particularly in the more affluent areas, look different: more wrinkled, their faces slacker and less filled out. It\u2019s as if this new sect banned Botox and fillers.</p> <p>Then there are the clothes. In the supermarket queue (hey, did this new sect ban toilet paper and pasta because there\u2019s like none on the shelves?) people stand spaced far apart, looking morose. Everyone is dressed in stained tracksuits, baggy-arsed yoga pants or bedtime wear. Their faces are doughy and pale, their bodies heavier as if they were eating a lot. No one bothers with makeup anymore or perfume. Many people seemed to be either medicated or hungover.</p> <p>The person coming out of the silent retreat might also presume that the sect that\u2019s taken over society has a strict moral code (as well as an appalling dress code).</p> <p>Adulterous affairs the world over have suddenly stopped. All the cover is gone, and suddenly you can\u2019t pretend you\u2019re meeting your colleagues for an after-work drink while you\u2019re actually shagging your bit on the side.</p> <p>Even if you could have an affair, there\u2019s nowhere to have it. The hotels have turned into quarantine stations and illicit couples concerned about being busted via contact tracing (which happened to Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s character in Contagion) have put their affairs on ice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/we-crossed-over-this-week-coronavirus-is-heaping-cruelty-upon-cruelty\">We crossed over this week: coronavirus is heaping cruelty upon cruelty | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Say you\u2019re not having an affair, but you feel like a bit of casual sex or at least a snog. You could go to a bar but they are all shut, so you go on the apps and try to hook up but no one is keen to meet anyone, anywhere, anytime in the next six months.</p> <p>Even your friends have become strangely conservative. Checking your Instagram feed, there\u2019s loads of inspirational quotes, videos of people making sourdough bread, others of people planting herb gardens. No one seems to be going out. You feel an absence of Fomo.</p> <p>And the government itself has radically and rapidly pivoted \u2013 from free-market, neoliberal, conservatives to socialists.</p> <p>Under a conservative government, unemployment benefits have doubled.

The banks are giving struggling businesses a break from their loans.</p> <p>We knew such a widespread pandemic had the capacity to reshape society \u2013 but nobody suspected it would quite look like this.</p> <ul> <li><p>Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist</p></li> </ul>"
