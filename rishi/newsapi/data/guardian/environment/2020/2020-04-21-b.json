passengers on cancelled flights the option of a refund within 20 working days, via its website.</p> \n  <p>The airline has been forced to ground most of its fleet due to the pandemic, although it is still running a few <a href=\"https://www.ryanair.com/content/dam/ryanair/comms-2020/EN_20%20Apr%20Customer%20Notice%20-%20Covid19%20A4.pdf\">flights in and out of the UK</a>, mostly out of Dublin and Stansted.</p> \n  <p>Passengers were initially delighted, but a Ryanair email sent out on Monday, seen by the Guardian, has heralded an about-turn.</p> \n  <p>Instead of the refund, passengers have been sent a link telling them how told <a href=\"https://www.ryanair.com/ie/en/useful-info/refund-voucher\">how to use its vouchers</a> to purchase Ryanair flights and other services over the next 12 months.</p> \n  <p>Passengers can still request a cash refund, it states, but the request will be placed \u201cin the cash refund queue until the Covid-19 emergency has passed\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe highly recommend using the refund voucher as these are readily available and you can book flights on all Ryanair Group airlines in over 200 destinations,\u201d says the airline.</p> \n

all of the options set out under EU regulations, including refunds.\u201d</p> \n  <p>EU rules require the airlines to refund passengers on flights they cancel within seven days, but the airline industry across the board has ignored this over the last month, citing extraordinary circumstances.</p> \n  <p>EasyJet has since reintroduced the option of a cash refund online, while BA requires passengers to call the airline, which is near impossible at the moment.</p> \n  <p>The airlines can only offer credit vouchers with the consent of the passenger but this has not stopped the airlines and travel companies telling passengers, making this the only practical option. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T17:10:58.696Z\">at 6.10pm

publicly for Apple and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a> to weaken privacy protections around digital contact tracing, after its government admitted that its current plans would not work without changes to smartphone operating systems, <strong>Alex Hern</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s tech editor, reports.</p> \n  <p>The criticism comes two weeks after a landmark collaboration between the two companies to build technology enabling digital contact tracing apps, which would track contacts between users in an attempt to help slow the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n

Similar incidents were reported in areas of Strasbourg in eastern France.</p> \n  <p>This appears to be a spread of unrest following an incident in Villeneuve-la Garenne on Saturday evening in which a trail motorbike, ridden at speed by a man not wearing a helmet, hit the door of a police car stopped at a red traffic light.</p> \n  <p>An investigation is ongoing into the incident, which is the subject of conflicting claims: locals say officers opened the door of the unmarked police vehicle deliberately with the intention of injuring the rider, who was thrown from the bike and suffered a fractured femur. The man\u2019s family has announced it will sue the police, who deny the accusation its officers acted deliberately.</p> \n  <p>Seven people were arrested after the unrest on Sunday, which appears to have been sparked by rumours the injured man was so badly hurt he had his leg amputated; four were still in custody on Tuesday morning.</p> \n  <p>It has been reported in some UK media that the violence broke out because of French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to extend the country\u2019s strict lockdown until 11 May, but this seems unlikely as the extension was announced several days before the unrest began. However, tensions in the banlieues are especially high because of allegations of heavy-handed policing of the lockdown in the densely populated housing estates, which are home to many migrant and minority communities.</p> \n  <p>In Strasbourg, rubbish bins and a car were torched and Molotov cocktails were thrown at a police station. The local authorities said images posted on social media looked dramatic, but there was limited damage to the buildings.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T11:08:38.199Z\">at 12.08pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ecdef8f08177aeb18acd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T10:44:41.136Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s more on the decision to cancel this year\u2019s Oktoberfest in Bavaria, from the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Germany, Kate Connolly.</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Bavaria\u2019s leaders have cancelled Oktoberfest, the world\u2019s biggest beer festival, due to fears that it could become a breeding ground for the coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>The 210-year-old festival, which attracts around six million visitors a year, is a major event in the German calendar.</p> \n   <p>Markus S\u00f6der, the premier of Bavaria, which has been one of the regions worst hit by the pandemic in Europe, said the Oktoberfest posed too big a public health risk.

Prof Lars Schaade, the RKI\u2019s vice-president, said: \u201cWe must systematically examine all the evidence, including through autopsies.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He said the decision to relax restrictions across Germany, which has seen some small shops opening, and pupils returning to school to sit exams this week, were \u201csensible\u201d from a societal point of view. But from a purely epidemiological viewpoint restrictions should remain in place. </p> \n  <p>The main aim remained ensuring the number of cases remained in a \u201csafe zone\u201d, he said. Germany\u2019s reproduction rate is 0.9 \u2013 up on Friday when it was 0.7 \u2013 which means every person contracting the illness is infecting a further person. The number of new cases are doubling every 20 days, the number of deaths every 12 days.</p> \n  <p>According to health authority figures this morning, Germany has more than 147,000 confirmed cases, and 4,912 people have died from the disease. Germany\u2019s mortality rate from coronavirus is at 3.2%. Schaade said it had risen, as the amount of infections and subsequent deaths in care homes and hospitals had increased.</p> \n  <p>He said test capacity was at 730,000 a week in Germany, but should ideally be around 1m, with everyone who has a respiratory illness or infection of the airway getting tested. However, he pointed to practical problems with upscaling testing due to a global lack of reagents.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"726dcf73d95a51741075c6cd4fec749c07b7dc70\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/726dcf73d95a51741075c6cd4fec749c07b7dc70/0_177_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lars Schaade, vice- president of the Robert-Koch-Institute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lars Schaade, vice- president of the Robert-Koch-Institute.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernd von Jutrczenka/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Despite reports this morning that children are not spreading the disease as much as had been thought, Schaade said intensive tracking showed children who had contracted the disease in Germany were found to have as much of the virus in their throats as adults, even if they often show no symptoms. He said the RKI believed children played a not-insignificant role in spreading the disease.</p> \n  <p>Schaade said advice about stopping the spread of the virus remained the same, and would do so as long as there was no vaccination: keep a distance of 1.5 metres, cough into the elbow and wash your hands. He advised the wearing of face protection that covered the nose and mouth in public places.</p> \n  <p>He said intensive tracking of those who had been in contact with infected people remained an important part of the strategy to tackle coronavirus, and was a \u201cclassical epidemiological tool\u201d, enabling contacts to be \u201cfound and isolated so that they don\u2019t infect more people\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T10:37:00.485Z\">at 11.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ec0c28f0895b8b228360c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T09:54:31.972Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Singapore lockdown extended until 1 June</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Singapore\u2019s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong has extended a lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus by four weeks until 1 June, after the city-state saw a sharp rise in cases.</p> \n  <p>The measures, which include the closures of most workplaces and schools, were initially set to run from 7 April until 4 May.</p> \n  <p>You can read the prime minister\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-pm-lee-full-speech-circuit-breaker-extended-june-1-12662056\">full speech here</a>.

  "<p>Students whose courses have been thrown into chaos by the coronavirus pandemic should be reimbursed for the year or allowed to retake it at no further cost, according to the National Union of Students.</p> <p>NUS president Zamzam Ibrahim said students were in danger of being overlooked and forgotten in the crisis, and she called on the government to set up a \u00a360m student hardship fund to help support those who are struggling financially.</p> <p>The Covid-19 crisis has caused havoc in universities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/17/universities-having-to-adapt-fast-to-the-coronavirus-crisis\">where face-to-face teaching has been abandoned and courses shifted online</a>, which students report has happened with varying degrees of success.</p> <p>Graduation ceremonies have been cancelled and student life brought to a standstill, with most students travelling home to be with family, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/25/its-a-nightmare-how-coronavirus-is-wreaking-havoc-on-students-exams\">though significant numbers \u2013 including international students \u2013 remain stranded on desolate campuses.</a></p> <p>An NUS survey of 10,000 higher and further education students across the UK, which attempts to uncover the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on their lives, found that up to 85% of working students say they will need additional financial support because they have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown.</p> <p>Almost three quarters said they were worried about the risk to their final qualification as traditional exams are cancelled and assessment moves online, while a third feared they would be unable to properly access their education. Many more were worried about the lasting impact of the virus on their future prospects.</p> <p>Nearly all (95%) were anxious about the impact of the virus on the economy, 81% were worried about their job prospects and 71% were concerned about the impact the pandemic will have on their employability as they emerge from education into what is likely to be a severe global recession.</p> <p>Launching the NUS student safety net campaign, Ibrahim said every student should have the option to repeat their year at no further cost, with full maintenance support. She also demanded the reimbursement of a year\u2019s tuition fees for students who have paid upfront, or a write-off of one year\u2019s debt for those who have paid through loans.</p> <p>\u201cWe urgently need a student safety net for all students across the UK,\u201d said Ibrahim. \u201cCoronavirus has hit thousands of students in the pocket and severely affected the quality of their learning.</p> <p>\u201cThe current crisis has shown that students occupy the worst of all possible worlds \u2013 with the majority paying extortionate fees for their education and treated as consumers but left out in the cold when the product cannot be delivered as described.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, she said, thousands of trainee key workers, including healthcare students, were building up debt while having their education disrupted or volunteering to fight coronavirus on the frontline.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of this disruption will not be felt equally, with those on placements and disabled students feeling the impact particularly severely,\u201d said Ibrahim. \u201cStudents are being forgotten during the Covid-19 pandemic. We are the future workforce that will have to help to rebuild our economy over the coming years.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Universities UK, the umbrella organisation which represents higher education leaders, said: \u201cWe recognise that this is an unsettling and difficult time for all students \u2026 Huge efforts are ongoing so that this year\u2019s finalists can graduate with a degree they can be proud of and which is in line with guidance from the bodies responsible for quality and standards and with the relevant accrediting bodies, and we are looking at ways in which new graduates can be supported as they enter a difficult jobs market later in the year.</p> <p>\u201cWhere there is wide-ranging support for active and ongoing learning and progression, students should not expect any fee refund from their university, and this has been confirmed recently by the universities minister.</p> <p>\u201cStudents who have difficulty continuing with their learning next term, perhaps because of illness, caring responsibilities or lack of access to IT, or who are not satisfied with the alternative provision and support they are getting, should make this known to their university in the first instance. Every university will have their own established process for managing complaints, and will be mindful of the extenuating circumstances.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The world is facing widespread famine \u201cof biblical proportions\u201d because of the coronavirus pandemic, the chief of the UN\u2019s food relief agency has warned, with a short time to act before hundreds of millions starve.</p> <p>More than 30 countries in the developing world could experience widespread famine, and in 10 of those countries there are already more than 1 million people on the brink of starvation, said David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not talking about people going to bed hungry,\u201d he told the Guardian in an interview. \u201cWe are talking about extreme conditions, emergency status \u2013 people literally marching to the brink of starvation. If we don\u2019t get food to people, people will die.\u201d</p> <p>Covid-19 is likely to be sweeping through the developing world but its spread is hard to gauge. What appears to be certain is that the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-disaster-developing-nations-global-marshall-plan\"> fragile healthcare systems</a> of scores of developing countries will be unable to cope, and the economic disaster following in the wake of the pandemic will lead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/16/race-against-time-to-prevent-famines-during-coronavirus-crisis\">huge strain on resources</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis is truly more than just a pandemic \u2013 it is creating a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-double-number-of-people-going-hungry\">hunger pandemic</a>,\u201d said Beasley. \u201cThis is a humanitarian and food catastrophe.\u201d</p> <p>Beasley took his message to the UN security council on Tuesday, warning world leaders that they must act quickly in a fast-deteriorating situation. He urged them to bring forward about $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) of aid that has been pledged, so it can get to the frontline as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Another $350m (\u00a3285m) is also needed to set up the logistics network to get food and medical supplies \u2013 including personal protective equipment \u2013 to where it is needed, including air bridges where ground transport is impossible.</p> <p>Even before the Covid-19 crisis, Beasley was appealing to donor countries to up food relief funding to the poorest, because conflict and natural disaster were putting severe strain on food systems.</p> <p>\u201cI was already saying that 2020 would be the worst year since the second world war, on the basis of what we forecast at the end of last year,\u201d he said.

We are looking at widespread famines of biblical proportions.\u201d</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/global-hunger-could-be-next-big-impact-of-coronavirus-pandemic\">report produced by the UN and other organisations on Thursday</a>, at least 265 million people are being pushed to the brink of starvation by the Covid-19 crisis, double the number under threat before the pandemic.</p> <p>None of those looming deaths from starvation are inevitable, said Beasley. \u201cIf we get money, and we keep the supply chains open, we can avoid famine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can stop this if we act now.\u201d</p> <p>He said the situation even four weeks from now was impossible to forecast, stressing that donors must act with urgency. He urged countries not to put in place export bans or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\">other restrictions on the supply of food across borders</a>, which would lead to shortages.</p> <p>But Beasley also warned that staving off the threat of famine would take months, so assistance would be needed well beyond the initial response. \u201cOur grave concern is that we could begin to put Covid-19 behind us [in developed countries] in three or four months, and then the money runs out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if the money runs out people will die.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, the World Food Programme assisted about 100 million people in desperation, with a budget of about $7.5bn (\u00a36bn). \u201cI could easily see that need [for budget] doubling,\u201d said Beasley.</p> <p>Money alone will not be enough, he added. It is difficult for relief workers to get through lockdowns around the world and set up air bridges when transport is paralysed. \u201cWe need money and access \u2013 not one or the other, both.\u201d</p> <p>Also crucial is ensuring that supply chains stay open in the face of lockdowns and the difficulty of getting workers into the fields to tend crops if they are sick or unable to travel easily. \u201cIf the supply chain breaks down, people can\u2019t get food \u2013 and if they can\u2019t get food for long enough, they will die,\u201d said Beasley.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in this together. We can stop this becoming a widespread famine. But we need to act quickly and smartly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

  "<p>The government has missed opportunities to secure at least 16m face masks for NHS staff in the past four weeks, amid growing frustration from companies who say Britain is losing much-needed equipment to other countries.</p> <p>As ministers faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/turkish-ppe-flight-only-slim-chance-goods-will-arrive-in-uk-today\">relentless questions</a> over a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals, suppliers said their offers to deliver UK-standard face masks were being met with silence from the government.</p> <p>And on another day of chaos over the government\u2019s PPE procurement, a senior civil servant said that its decision to opt out of a joint EU scheme was politically motivated. However he was forced to retract his claim within hours<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/uk-refusal-of-eu-ventilator-offer-was-political-decision\"> after he was contradicted by the health secretary, Matt Hancock</a>.</p> <p>Adding to the confusion, Hancock claimed that the UK had now joined the scheme \u2013 only for EU sources to note that the U-turn had happened recently so Britain would not benefit from the supplies of emergency equipment.</p> <p>As new figures revealed that care home fatalities had quadrupled over the last week and as another 823 deaths were announced, the government faced further acute pressure over difficulties securing protective gear for hospitals and care homes.</p> <p>These problems included:</p> <ul> <li><p>The saga of the PPE shipment sourced from Turkey, which dragged on, with an RAF plane sitting on the tarmac in Istanbul for hours before the first batch was delivered, and two more aircraft yet to leave from the UK</p></li> <li><p>Ministers were forced to defend the disclosure that millions of pieces of equipment including respirators and masks had been shipped from British warehouses to Spain, Italy and Germany</p></li> <li><p>Social care groups struggling to source enough PPE on the open market said that plans to allow them to access the NHS supply chain had left them in a dire situation, with all forms of PPE due to run out within days.</p></li> </ul> <p>Of 8,000 companies so far offering PPE within the UK, the government has engaged with about 1,000 and is working with 159 manufacturers to bring the offered supplies into use. But many of those firms said that they had seen offers of rapidly available and certified equipment ignored.</p> <p>Volker Schuster, the owner of the Merseyside-based chemicals firm EcoLogix, said he wrote to the cabinet office\u2019s \u201cCovid commercial response unit\u201d offering to supply 10m FFP2 masks for frontline medics that would be ready to ship from China within a week. He said he submitted details of the masks, including their European CE certification, but only received a substantive response eight days later \u2013 asking for details he had already provided. By that time the masks had been sold to other countries.</p> <p>Schuster\u2019s MP, Bill Esterson, confirmed that he also contacted the office of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to highlight the offer on 27 March but that he had never received a reply.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, the shadow cabinet office minister, said on Tuesday she had been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RachelReevesMP/status/1251624041577943044/photo/1\">inundated</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RachelReevesMP/status/1251624041577943044/photo/1\"> by manufacturers</a> who had contacted the government offering to make or supply PPE but that she had heard nothing back.</p> <p>Reeves also accused the government of prioritising \u201cmajor fashion and clothing brands \u2026 over companies that may have been better placed to manufacture what is needed as quickly as possible\u201d. Retailers including Burberry and Barbour announced collaborations with the government to help increase availability of PPE supplies.</p> <p>Hancock said in the televised Downing Street briefing that the government was accelerating its response to companies but that officials were having to filter out approaches from firms which were not credible.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to improve the processes that we have in place to make purchases. We want to engage with all those companies who can help us in this national effort and we are accelerating the progress of getting back to all those companies with a substantive response. This is a fast-moving market. There is a global shortage \u2026 and that means we need to be as nimble as we possibly can.\u201d</p> <p>The infectious disease specialists, Landcent, said it could have distributed 6m FFP2 face masks to the UK if the government had placed an order when it first submitted an offer three weeks ago.</p> <p>Arun Prabhu, Landcent\u2019s co-founder, said its UK partner, EFDUK, had contacted the government at the end of March offering to supply face masks, testing kits and protective overalls. He said they received a reply expressing interest in face masks \u201cthree or four days later\u201d but had heard nothing since.</p> <p>\u201cBy now we would have supplied close to 6m face masks,\u201d he said, adding that the firm had already shipped millions of Ply surgical masks to Austria, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.</p> <p>Prabhu said Britain risked losing out to other countries unless it responded more quickly to credible offers. \u201cThere is a global demand but there is no lack of supplies \u2013 it\u2019s just tapping into the right distributing partners. I would urge [the British government] to assign a special taskforce who are primarily focused towards procurement.\u201d</p> <p>Both EcoLogix and Landcent said they submitted detailed information on the specification of their face masks and that these met the UK requirements and were CE approved, meaning they meet EU standards for health and safety.</p> <p>Esterson, the shadow minister for international trade, said the government\u2019s \u201cshambolic\u201d response to credible offers to secure PPE was putting lives at risk from the coronavirus pandemic. He said: \u201cIt cannot be right that companies which can help with PPE and which have offered to help are facing long delays in hearing back from the government. People are dying and this needs to be simplified and speeded up.\u201d</p> <p>Social care companies meanwhile were critical of the government\u2019s plan allowing to them to use the NHS supply chain where commercial options failed. </p> <p>One group, Methodist Homes, called the system \u201cnot clear at all\u201d and said that just two of the firm\u2019s 131 sites had managed to order basic supplies.</p> <p>The Sue Ryder palliative care charity said it was in a diresituation, with all forms of PPE due to run out within days, and that it had not heard from the government that it could access the NHS supply chain.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said there had been more than 8,000 offers of support, adding: \u201cWe are working rapidly to get through these offers, ensuring they meet the safety and quality standards that our NHS and social care workers need, and prioritising offers of larger volumes.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Netflix has more than doubled the number of new subscribers it expected in the last three months as more people signed up amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The streaming giant announced on Tuesday that it added 15.77 million new paid subscribers globally, well above the 7 million it had expected, as people worldwide sought ways to entertain themselves during the lockdowns.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/16/netflix-now-worth-more-than-exxonmobil-as-value-reaches-187bn\">Netflix now worth more than ExxonMobil as value reaches $196bn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The boost led to huge audiences for the service\u2019s hit shows.

Other hits included the reality show Love Is Blind, which attracted 30 million subscribers in the last three months, and its original film Spenser Confidential (85 million).</p> <p>The company acknowledged that the huge surge in membership and audience was probably temporary.</p> <p>\u201cIn our 20+ year history, we have never seen a future more uncertain or unsettling. The coronavirus has reached every corner of the world and, in the absence of a widespread treatment or vaccine, no one knows how or when this terrible crisis will end,\u201d the company said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cAt Netflix, we\u2019re acutely aware that we are fortunate to have a service that is even more meaningful to people confined at home, and which we can operate remotely with minimal disruption in the short to medium term. Like other home entertainment services, we\u2019re seeing temporarily higher viewing and increased membership growth.\u201d</p> <p>Mihir Haria Shah, head of broadcast at Total Media, said the long-term impact of the coronavirus on Netflix\u2019s business remained to be seen.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that Netflix has been helped by the viral sensation that is Tiger King and also new seasons of Narcos Mexico, Ozark and Money Heist \u2013 which are all Netflix originals favourites. The challenge in continuing to grow and also preventing churn is likely to be how long they can sustain dripping in new series with production studios shut for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Netflix, like many other studios and networks, has shut down production on original content since 13 March. The streamer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/20/netflix-100m-coronavirus-fund-relief-creatives\">has since set up a $100m fund</a> for workers whose jobs have been directly affected. Recent weeks have seen a number of large acquisitions, including the Paramount action comedy The Lovebirds and Enola Holmes, with Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown as the younger sister of Sherlock Holmes.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re certainly impacted by the global production pause, we expect to continue to be able to provide a terrific variety of new titles throughout 2020 and 2021,\u201d the statement said.</p>",
  "<p>This is the peak season for the arrival of what is hoped will be millions of glass eels swimming up Britain\u2019s estuaries to reach fresh waters where they can grow into adults. The European eel (<em>Anguilla anguilla</em>) is a curious creature with a complex lifestyle that is still barely understood.</p> <p>Eels are thought to begin life as eggs in the Sargasso Sea; drifting as larvae for about a year 4,000 miles north-east in the Gulf Stream before turning into tiny transparent eels. Their goal is to find a home in rivers, lakes and ponds while growing darker and larger for up to 10 years. When nearly a metre long they set off back across the Atlantic to breed.</p> <p>Eels were once common but the species is now critically endangered. This is partly because many rivers have been blocked with weirs and dams and others polluted. Another only recently discovered reason is that tinned and processed foods made with eels, analysed in Hong Kong and thought to be equally scarce Asian eels, turned out to be the European variety. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2016/feb/09/illegal-eel-black-market-continues-to-taint-europes-eel-fishery\">The</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2016/feb/09/illegal-eel-black-market-continues-to-taint-europes-eel-fishery\"> glass eels had been caught illegally </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2016/feb/09/illegal-eel-black-market-continues-to-taint-europes-eel-fishery\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2016/feb/09/illegal-eel-black-market-continues-to-taint-europes-eel-fishery\"> in Europe and shipped to Asia</a> to be grown in eel farms.

He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>After all, the upside of being the first country in the world to develop a successful vaccine is so huge that I am throwing everything at it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock dismissed a claim from the most senior official at the Foreign Office that the government took a political decision not to participate in an EU-wide ventilator procurement scheme.</strong> Asked about <strong>Sir Simon McDonald</strong>\u2019s comment (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/21/uk-coronavirus-live-parliament-returns-government-lockdown-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9f0e288f0826d9592b5e7e#block-5e9f0e288f0826d9592b5e7e\">4.17pm)</a>, Hancock said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I haven\u2019t seen that exchange but I have spoken to the foreign secretary and as far as I\u2019m aware there was no political decision not to participate in that scheme.</p> \n   <p>We did receive an invitation in the Department of Health and it was put up to me to be asked and we joined so we are now members of that scheme.</p> \n   <p>However, as far as I know that scheme hasn\u2019t [provided] a single item of PPE [personal protective equipment].</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Although Hancock\u2019s comment sounded like a robust denial, it was less than watertight because Hancock just said he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of any political decision to boycott the scheme and he then conflated the EU ventilator procurement scheme with a separate one covering PPE (although, as <strong>Jennifer Rankin </strong>wrote when she first reported on this in March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/24/uk-coronavirus-live-news-lockdown-boris-johnson-sports-direct-abandons-talk-of-opening-stores-as-gove-clarifies-scope-of-lockdown-rules?page=with:block-5e7a305f8f085e31106fe923#block-5e7a305f8f085e31106fe923\">the original UK decision not to get involved covered all the various EU coronavirus procurement schemes.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, hinted that the government is not about to change its policy on members of the public wearing masks.</strong> The government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies, Sage, discussed this today, but no new recommendations have gone to ministers yet. Van-Tam said the advice would change if the evidence justified that. But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is an absolutely enduring principle here that Sage places great value and prime importance on never jeopardising the supplies of PPE to our health and social care workers. That is a line that we are not going to cross.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said the government would start testing NHS staff who do not have coronavirus symptoms. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Van-Tam said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of coronavirus was being spread by people with symptoms. </strong>But there was also likely to be some spread from symptomatic or pre-symptomatic people, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said the government was working with 159 UK manufacturers who may be able to make PPE for the NHS.</strong> But not all offers were credible, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have had to make sure we sort out the creditable offers from those that are not.</p> \n   <p>We have had some offers, for instance, that have come from companies where, upon investigation, the company has only just been formed in the previous day or two before coming and asking for a cash deal with the government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Van-Tam said the UK is not yet seeing a significant downturn in new cases. </strong>he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It isn\u2019t clear there is an enormous downturn at this point. The numbers are varying day to day but they remain high and we remain in a situation of danger that we must take very seriously indeed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In London the number of hospital cases is declining, after hitting a peak probably on 10 April, he said.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson will speak to President Trump later today, in a sign that he is starting to resume some of his duties as prime minister.</strong> He is also due to have a telephone audience with the Queen later this week. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman, as he announced that the calls would take place, refused to accept that this meant the PM was getting back to work. The PM was still recovering, the spokesman said. But he said that the call with Trump, although partly a thank you call for the message of support Trump sent when Johnson was ill, would also involve an update from Trump about what the G7 is doing to address the coronavirus crisis. (The US holds the presidency of the G7.) The spokesman also said that yesterday Johnson sent a message of condolence to Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, in relation to the shootings in Nova Scotia.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, will chair a cabinet meeting on Thursday, the spokesman said. </strong>He will also take PMQs on Wednesday.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman rejected a report claiming No 10 does not support Matt Hancock\u2019s target of getting the number of coronavirus tests carried out each day up to 100,000 by the end of this month.</strong> The Daily Telegraph makes this claim, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/20/matt-hancocks-pledge-test-100000-people-day-coronavirus-arbitrary/\">in a story (paywall)</a> starting: \u201cThe health secretary\u2019s promise that 100,000 people a day would be tested for coronavirus has been criticised as \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cirrational\u201d by Downing Street sources.\u201d The story goes on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Downing Street source said: \u201cThe problem is with this arbitrary target. There is a faint irrationality behind it, just because there was a clamour for mass testing. Hancock\u2019s 100,000 target was a response to criticism in the media, and he decided to crank out tests regardless.</p> \n   <p>\u201cHancock\u2019s not had a good crisis. The prime minister will say he has confidence in him, but it doesn\u2019t feel like that. He set out to buy time by setting this target, and it threatens to come back to bite him. The 100,000 figure was Hancock\u2019s idea \u2013 but he made that figure up.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the story, the spokesman said that the source quoted by the Telegraph was \u201cwrong\u201d. He said 100,000 tests a day was a government target and the government was working to achieve it.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock will take the press conference this afternoon, the spokesman said. </strong>He will be accompanied by <strong>Prof Jonathan Van-Tam</strong>, the deputy chief medical<strong> </strong>officer for England.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government now has the capacity to test more than 39,000 people for coronavirus every day. </strong>But the latest daily testing figure, for the number of tests carried out in the 24 hours up to 9am yesterday, was 19,306. The spokesman said that in total 97,000 NHS and care workers and their relatives have now been tested.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government wanted to open 50 drive-through testing centres open by the end of the month.</strong> There are 27 open now, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed that Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, is meeting today to discuss its advice on face masks.</strong> Sage is holding another meeting on Thursday. The spokesman was unable to say when Sage would come to a decision. When it was in a position to offer advice to the government, it would do so, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman signalled that the government agrees with those NHS bosses who have warned that making the public wear face masks could result in fewer being available for the NHS</strong>. As <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/facemasks-for-public-risk-nhs-shortage-q5bkzvzql\">the Times (paywall)</a> reports, <strong>Chris Hopson</strong>, chief executive of the hospitals group NHS Providers, has said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the government is going to consider advising the general public to wear facemasks it must fully assess the impact on the NHS. Fluid repellent masks for health and care staff are key to safety and to avoid the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>Securing the supply of masks, when there is huge global demand, is crucial. This must be a key consideration. There needs to be clear evidence that wearing masks, along with other measures, will deliver significant enough benefits to take us out of lockdown to potentially jeopardise NHS mask supply.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if the government agreed with this, the spokesman said that Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, recently said that if there were a conflict between NHS staff needing mask and members of the public wanting them, NHS staff should take priority.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street has not agreed to the TUC\u2019s call for a judge-led inquiry into PPE shortages, the spokesman indicated. </strong><a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/public-inquiry-needed-over-grotesque-failure-planning-ppe-says-tuc\">The TUC wants the inquiry to start by the end of this year.</a> Asked about the TUC proposal, the spokesman did not say that the government was adopting it. But he did say that Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, made it clear at the weekend that where there were lessons to learn from what had happened, the government would seek to learn them.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman rejected claims that the UK was dependent on the consignment of PPE due to arrive from Turkey.</strong> There were many more orders for PPE in the pipeline, the spokesman said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"409c15b67505d18d5f64dd20813c5b4b0c5758c0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/409c15b67505d18d5f64dd20813c5b4b0c5758c0/1389_285_2607_1564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10 Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T16:29:20.323Z\">at 5.29pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9edd108f08cd080212f819\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T11:52:27.945Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Scotland records 70 new deaths from Covid-19, taking total to 985</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A total of 985 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 70 from 915 on Monday, Nicola Sturgeon has said.

(\u201cLife events\u201d presumably include dying.) Here are the key points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Stripe said that the ONS death figures released this morning for England and Wales for the week ending 10 April were almost certainly an understatement. </strong>He said 10 April, was Good Friday, and only around a third of registration offices were open. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So actually that number is slightly deflated because if the registration offices had been open, maybe another couple of thousand, if not more, deaths would have been registered.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the ONS figures that were published showed around 8,000 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in the week ending 10 April.</strong> That meant deaths above the five-year average. Of those, only 80% were directly related to coronavirus, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Compared to the five-year average of the same week in the year, it\u2019s 8,000 deaths above that average, of which 6,200 - about 80% of of those deaths - involved Covid.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the ONS was carrying out a research project to establish what was responsible for the other 20% of excess deaths. </strong>They might be related to coronavirus, he said, or they might be related to people not going to hospital. He said fully establishing the reasons for these excess deaths might take months or even years.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that the the ONS\u2019s figures for the Friday up to 10 April were 40% higher than the numbers that were officially announced by the government for coronavirus deaths the following day. </strong>And the ONS figures were about 20% higher than the latest figures for NHS England (which is now publishing figures showing how many people are known to have died from coronavirus in hospital on any particular day).</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said only around 80% of coronavirus deaths were in a hospital.</strong> In the previous week that figure was 90%, he said. He said 13% of coronavirus deaths were in a care home, and 5% were in a private home. In the previous week there were 217 coronavirus deaths in care homes. In the week up to 10 April there were just over 1,000.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the number of deaths in care homes, from all causes, was double in the week up to 10 April what it was two weeks previously. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that around one in three of the death in the week ending 10 April involved coronavirus</strong>.

  "<p>The UK\u2019s Covid-19 crisis has reached the blame phase, with Boris Johnson, ministers, civil servants and scientists coming under criticism that they underestimated the threat, were slow to act and are bungling the country\u2019s response amid a wave of deaths.</p> \n<p>So who is in the line of fire \u2013 and why?</p> \n<h2><br>Boris Johnson</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4439fed8cacaafa0490d145e35714f188fc355a0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4439fed8cacaafa0490d145e35714f188fc355a0/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson in Greenwich on 3 February\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson in Greenwich on 3 February when he said the UK was prepared to fight against countries that wished to put up trade barriers to stop diseases such as coronavirus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Before he became prime minister, Johnson was accused of being too casual and not having a grip on detail, particularly when he was foreign secretary. This week it emerged he had failed to attend five high security Cobra meetings during January and February that were held to prepare for a possible pandemic. The allegation was published by the Sunday Times and later confirmed by Michael Gove. During this period, Johnson went on country breaks with his pregnant fiancee \u2013 fuelling concerns that he hadn\u2019t take the threat seriously enough at an early stage.</p> \n<p>Those fears hardened after it emerged that on 3 February, he claimed the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">UK was ready to be a free trade \u201csuperhero\u201d</a> fighting against those who wished to put up trade barriers to stop diseases such as coronavirus. Stung by the claims, the government issued a long defence of Johnson\u2019s handling of the crisis and said the Sunday Times was guilty of \u201ca series of falsehoods and errors\u201d. Gove said it was not unusual for other ministers to chair Cobra meetings.</p> \n<h2>Matt Hancock, health secretary</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2d86431d-2054-4b08-b889-4fc3ea51d099\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aToM662I9rw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>No other minster has been under more pressure than Hancock, who has been accused of boasting too much, and delivering too little \u2013 particularly on testing the delivery of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline NHS workers.</p> \n<p>His commitment to roll out 100,000 tests a day by the end of April looked overly ambitious when he made it earlier this month \u2013 and with only a week to go, the target looks unreachable.</p> \n<p>Although the UK has the capacity to do around 40,000 a day \u2013 the actual number of tests undertaken stood at 18,206 on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>The boast will also \u201ccome back to bite him\u201d according to one Downing Street insider who was quoted in the Daily Telegraph. </p> \n<p>Ventilator procurement has also been another high-profile issue for Hancock. He has said the UK needs 18,000 machines \u2013 but so far, there are only 10,700 in action. Critics say he has focused on big name brands such as Dyson producing them from scratch, rather than helping pre-existing British ventilator manufacturers increase supply.</p> \n<p>On 3 April he boasted of firms making PPE domestically and gave a \u201cshout out to Burberry\u201d for their offer to help. Weeks later Hancock admitted they were \u201ctight on gowns\u201d, and British companies have repeatedly complained that their approaches to government have not been taken up, with reports on Monday of some firms sending shipments of equipment abroad.</p> \n<h2><br>Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Chris Whitty, chief medical officer</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bae4bff1b81eb2afae5fe63ee5914ba929bbfa9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bae4bff1b81eb2afae5fe63ee5914ba929bbfa9/0_34_3964_2379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Vallance (left) and Chris Whittey in Downing Street earlier this month\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Vallance (left) and Chris Whittey in Downing Street earlier this month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Both won high praise for their calm handling of the crisis during its early days, but their roles have come under increased scrutiny \u2013 not least because ministers keep insisting they have taken decisions based on the advice that they are being given by them.</p> \n<p>Critics of the government will say ministers cannot duck responsibility for taking key decisions \u2013 but there is undoubtedly huge pressure on Vallance, Whitty and the teams around them.</p> \n<p>The concept of herd immunity was first raised publicly by Vallance on 13 March with a comment that it could be an \u201cimportant part of controlling [coronavirus] longer term\u201d. His remark sparked alarm among the public as the UK continued to allow mass gatherings, while European neighbours were banning sports fixtures and closing schools.</p> \n<p>The phrase was quickly shot down by Hancock who said it was not a \u201cgoal or a strategy\u201d of the government.

  "<p>Mountain, meet molehill. Over the past month, countless businesses have had to adapt to survive. Selling more online, having meetings over Zoom, that kind of thing. Yet for its first day back in session, the Commons was struggling big time to adjust. It took more than an hour for a handful of MPs to agree some fairly basic procedures. Everything was most irregular. The like of which had not been seen since 1349.</p> <p>You could tell we were in trouble right from the off as it was Jacob Rees-Mogg who was easily the most enthusiastic moderniser in the Commons. What he was proposing all seemed entirely sensible. Not to mention straightforward. Fifty MPs in the house at any one time, with another 120 logging in online. No tricky votes for at least a week as no one had yet worked out how to make the system work.</p> <p>FFS. Even a Channel 5 gameshow has a secure audience voting system. And if we were still members of the EU, we could have got some guidance from them as the Brussels parliament has been using an online voting system for years. But that ship has long since sailed.</p> <p>The shadow leader of the Commons, Valerie Vaz, was about the only person willing to embrace the new normal. Everyone else was more concerned about having ancient privileges taken away from them in perpetuity. The DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley Jr and Jim Shannon were most exercised that the Commons might use its new regime to sneak through a vote allowing abortion in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The situation cried out for someone to stand up and shout: \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a global pandemic that\u2019s killing thousands of people every day. So stop arsing about and being so bloody precious. No one\u2019s trying to rewrite the rulebook for good. We\u2019re just trying to muddle through and hold the government to account as best they can.\u201d</p> <p>After more than an hour of pointless nitpicking, the few dozen MPs in the chamber grudgingly nodded the new measures through. And then promptly went home. There was no time to ask the government any tricky questions like the future. Best to break off for tea before watching the daily Downing Street press briefing instead.</p> <p>Today\u2019s government frontman was Matt Hancock, who throughout looked to be on the verge of tears, his voice catching with emotion. Normally the health secretary is a walking, talking Tigger, bouncing with man-child optimism in the face of any impending catastrophe. But now he was utterly subdued. Broken, even.</p> <p>And well he might be. The vague sense of a collegiate cabinet truce that had appeared in place when Boris Johnson first fell ill is well and truly over. Since Dominic Cummings came back to work, the knives are out to find a scapegoat for when the coronavirus reckoning inevitably comes. And the blades are all pointing in Matt\u2019s back. Classic Dom. Screw things up and get someone else to take the blame.</p> <p>Part of Hancock\u2019s tragedy is that he is the architect of his own downfall. While other ministers seek to shift the blame and keep things vague, there is an intrinsic goodness and honesty to Matt. He does really care. Out of a dried-out riverbed of talent at the head of government, he is the closest we have got to a politician of integrity.</p> <p>It\u2019s just that he\u2019s not always as competent as he might be. Desperate to provide some hope and answers in a political vacuum of self-distancing from accountability. So he writes cheques he knows can\u2019t be cashed. He makes promises that can\u2019t be kept. There isn\u2019t a prayer that the arbitrary target of 100,000 tests per day he ad libbed a few weeks ago will be met, so this is the cross on which the Grand Inquisitor, Classic Dom, will crucify him.</p> <p>With all this going on, the press briefing was understandably a car crash. With scattered parts all over the place. He promised that anyone who needed a hospital bed would get one. He just couldn\u2019t guarantee that any of the doctors or nurses would have the necessary personal protective equipment to treat them. The transport plane that\u2019s gone missing in Istanbul is now being written in as a character in the latest Dan Brown romp.</p> <p>Matt did also say that the first vaccine would be trialled on a person this coming Thursday. \u201cBut,\u201d said the Anti-Tigger. But the science was very uncertain and so people shouldn\u2019t get their hopes up too much. This from a minister who has consistently trotted out the party line that the science was always 100% accurate and that every decision had been taken in line with scientific advice. Hancock was in freefall, visibly being pulled in two different directions. His centre can no longer hold.</p> <p>Most questions focused on the evidence that Simon McDonald, the permanent secretary to the Foreign Office, had given to a select committee that afternoon. Namely that Michael Gove\u2019s assertion that the UK\u2019s failure to join the EU procurement programme had been an email administrative error was total bollocks. It had been a political decision all along. Who would have guessed the Govester had been caught out lying again?</p> <p>Hancock, though, was adamant. As health secretary he had definitely signed up to the EU programme. Leaving open the possibility that he had been overruled by Boris, Gove or Dominic Raab. Hell, if he was going down he might as well take some of the real guilty parties down with him. For the first time during the briefing, a ghost of a smile crossed his lips.</p>",
  "<p>In the late 1980s, the biggest medical puzzle of the day was how to design an HIV vaccine. Dozens of well-funded laboratories were on the case and a solution seemed within the grasp of researchers. Thirty years on and there\u2019s no HIV vaccine. This sobering fact ought to bring us up short. We want to believe that a treatment for Covid-19 is just around the corner. But we must steel ourselves that a vaccine, as the head of the Wellcome Trust <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wellcometrust/status/1251810174131736576?s=20\" title=\"\">warned</a>, is not a given.</p> <p>While no expense should be <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-uk-vaccine-to-be-trialled-on-patients-from-thursday-says-matt-hancock-11976681\" title=\"\">spared</a> to find a vaccine, the UK government must also display the wherewithal to design an administrative system to support and enable the public to live with this threat. That means getting the basics right. So far the signs have not been good. In Britain, everywhere you look you see a state overstretched and driven by <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\" title=\"\">politicians\u2019 panic</a> rather than careful planning.</p> <p>Compare this with democracies as different as <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/taiwan/\" title=\"\">Taiwan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries\" title=\"\">Australia, Germany and South Korea</a>. They have kept their death tolls low by using a combination of physical distancing, tight travel restrictions, mass testing and contact tracing. The spread of the disease has been mapped and programmes run to identify not just those who are sick but those they\u2019ve been in contact with. What leaders in these countries have not done is make over-the-top claims that they are getting on top of a problem when it is plain they are not. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said we\u2019d have 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month. Mr Hancock is on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-uk-government-to-miss-100000-daily-testing-covid-hancock-2020-4?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">course to miss his target by a large margin</a>. In his defence, the prime minister had gilded the lily more extravagantly than he had.</p> <p>There do not seem to be coordinated, sustained efforts by the government to ramp up capacity to meet the challenge posed by coronavirus. Test kits, reagents, swabs, personnel, personal protective equipment have all been identified as bottlenecks. The longer we take to get mass testing and contact tracing going, the longer Britain is stuck in lockdown. That is why Simon Clarke did little for public confidence when he said it was <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1271755/Simon-clarke-coronavirus-UK-measures-covid-19-testing-uk\" title=\"\">not his job</a> \u2013 despite being the local government minister \u2013 to press council health workers into a contact tracing programme.</p> <p>Ministers need to level with the public over the shortfalls and blockages. The NHS, the Department of Health and Social Care, and devolved administrations should be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52362707\" title=\"\">publishing</a> what PPE is being distributed and how far this falls short of what is required by hospitals or by how much it exceeds their need. This is about being accountable, not a finger-pointing exercise. There should be no reason for doctors to wear ski goggles instead of masks, and nurses using <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8239063/Nurses-coronavirus-line-given-cagoules-wear-wait-proper-medical-gowns.html\" title=\"\">cagoules</a> rather than protective gowns. In Italy, healthcare workers <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006141\" title=\"\">experienced</a> high rates of infection and death partly because of inadequate access to PPE. Here the death toll of such staff has risen past 100. Clarity needs to replace ambiguity when dealing with matters of life and death.</p> <p>If ministers respond imaginatively to the coronavirus crisis, they will have a chance of reversing a decade of decline. They need to change tack. They must shed ideas of British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/coronavirus-exposed-myth-british-exceptionalism\" title=\"\">exceptionalism</a> that saw them waste chances to purchase kit and protective equipment on the global market, as well as harbour delusions that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/herd-immunity-is-a-fatal-strategy-we-should-avoid-at-all-costs\" title=\"\">herd immunity</a>\u201d was a way out of the pandemic. We must look to other nations to see what works, and copy it. At some point ideology will intervene \u2013 usually to the detriment of the country. Conservatives have done great damage by finding succour in Ronald Reagan\u2019s wrong-headed declaration that \u201cgovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem\u201d. What the pandemic has taught us is that our health depends on each other. The fight against a virus is necessarily collective \u2013 and a creative government acting decisively needs to lead it.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 April 2020.

  "<p>Councils are burning household recycling after being hit by a massive surge in domestic waste and coronavirus-related staff absences during the pandemic, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Councils in Cardiff, St Helens and Inverclyde confirmed they were temporarily incinerating recycling, while those in Oldham, Redbridge and West Dunbartonshire also said they had stepped down their recycling services for the time being. A further six authorities have stopped collecting glass or cardboard.</p> <p>Cardiff city council said it was continuing to collect recycled material as usual and was asking residents to rinse out their recycling and sort items in the correct bags even though the materials would be incinerated for the near future.</p> <p>\u201cStrange as it seems, we still need you to put recyclables into your green recycling bags so that we can return to recycling the waste when we are able,\u201d the council said in a statement.</p> <p>The coronavirus lockdown has generated a massive increase in domestic waste collection UK-wide, with nearly a third of authorities reporting an increase of between 20% and 50% on normal volumes of waste collected through household bins. Nearly one in 10 reported waste increases of up to twice as much as usual.</p> <p>The pressure on local waste disposal services has been underlined by data showing that huge areas of the country have suspended bulky waste collection (55% of councils), garden waste disposal (29%), and food waste (10%) to cope with the crisis.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.adeptnet.org.uk/covid-19-waste-survey-results\">survey </a>of 250 UK councils carried out by the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (Adept) found that a quarter of local waste teams reported losing up to 40% of staff through illness or self-isolation last week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8543090f714d88a07a622555c9ae1221dd9d6e11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8543090f714d88a07a622555c9ae1221dd9d6e11/0_181_5472_3285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pile of fly-tipped rubbish in a north London street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fly-tipping has increased since the closure of household recycling centres.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The charity Keep Britain Tidy has warned that some councils are struggling to keep on top of fly-tipping, suggesting that it might be linked to an increase in DIY and decluttering as people stay at home, as well as the widespread closure of household recycling centres under physical distancing rules.</p> <p>However, all councils have maintained normal or near-normal levels of domestic refuse collection, and just 2% have suspended recycling. Fears that reductions in recycling collection would lead to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/31/uk-faces-cardboard-shortage-due-to-coronavirus-crisis\">shortage of cardboard packaging</a> have receded, with about 10 councils restarting suspended recycling services.</p> <p>Ian Fielding, chair of Adept\u2019s Waste Group, said: \u201cIt is encouraging to see that local authorities are maintaining core waste services with minimal disruption and that councils are able to put resources into tackling fly-tipping.\u201d</p> <p>Just 32% of councils are operating normal levels of street sweeping, the Adept survey showed, although the majority were experiencing only moderate or minor disruption. About 7% reported \u201csevere disruption\u201d to street cleaning services.</p> <p>Richard McIlwain, deputy chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy, said: \u201cAs organisations providing key frontline services, local authorities are having to prioritise core services, including the regular collection of our household waste.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, we are aware that some local authorities are reporting an increase in fly-tipping, potentially linked to the temporary closure of recycling centres. Fly-tipping is a serious environmental crime that blights local communities and harms wildlife, and local authorities should not be having to deal with increased illegal dumping.</p> <p>\u201cAt a time of national crisis, we all have a personal role to play in keeping our environment safe. If you have rubbish you can\u2019t put in your normal bin, either store it until the recycling centres are open or pay for a waste company to take it away, checking first that they are correctly licensed as a waste carrier with the Environment Agency and always ask for a receipt.\u201d</p> <p>An Inverclyde council spokesperson said: \u201cThe reintroduction of recycling collections remains an urgent priority. Like most Scottish councils, we experienced a significant reduction in workforce due to national guidance around self-isolation.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It is clear that the ways we travel, and use transport, will not be the same after the coronavirus outbreak as they were before. What we don\u2019t know is which changes will turn out to have been temporary, and which permanent. Flights from European airports are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/19/air-traffic-before-after-europe-coronavirus-lockdowns-video\" title=\"\">down by 90%</a> from a year ago, for example.

But it is to be hoped that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/uk-road-travel-falls-to-1955-levels-as-covid-19-lockdown-takes-hold-coronavirus-traffic\" title=\"\">huge reduction in motor traffic</a> caused by the virus will not be completely reversed. Already, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/milan-seeks-to-prevent-post-crisis-return-of-traffic-pollution\" title=\"\">cities including Milan</a> and New York have announced ambitious plans to reconfigure roads in such a way as to make more space for cyclists and pedestrians.</p> <p>Improving air quality is one motive, particularly in cities, not least because pollution is thought to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/air-pollution-may-be-key-contributor-to-covid-19-deaths-study\" title=\"\">contributor to Covid-19 deaths</a>. Encouraging people to walk and cycle is another. Fitter, less overweight people are less at risk from all sorts of diseases, particularly respiratory ones.</p> <p>For health reasons, as well as a wish to reduce noise pollution, improve road safety and the public realm more broadly, green transport campaigners have long argued for space to be redistributed, for example by the creation of new cycle lanes and walking routes. Town and city pavements are generally narrow, with carriageways taking up twice or three times as much space \u2013 much of it for parking. But the need for physical distancing makes the case for change unarguable. While those who need to drive for business or personal reasons must, of course, be allowed to, the presumption of an entitlement to drive must not continue to trump the right to walk and cycle safely.</p> <p>English councils have been granted <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52353942\" title=\"\">temporary powers</a> to close roads and should use them. As the lockdown continues, the importance of promoting healthy lifestyles, including regular exercise, grows. From many points of view, public transport remains preferable to the use of private cars. But the danger now associated with mixing with strangers in crowded places means it makes sense, at least in the short term, to shift attention and resources towards walking, scootering and cycling (while promoting measures to make public transport as safe as possible, for both workers and passengers).</p> <p>The UK has already set a course to a much lower-carbon transport future. A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creating-the-transport-decarbonisation-plan\" title=\"\">government document</a> published in March acknowledged the need for dramatic reductions in car use, with trains, buses and active travel becoming the \u201cnatural first choice\u201d. It promised to place transport emissions at the heart of the government\u2019s strategy for the postponed Cop26 climate talks that the UK will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\" title=\"\">host next year</a>.</p> <p>The chance to move around more freely again is something to be looked forward to, especially for those who are separated from loved ones. Motor traffic and aviation will, at some point, increase. But the journey away from fossil fuels and towards low- and zero-carbon alternatives must continue. Whenever the lockdown lifts, the increased opportunities for walking and cycling that have been among the unexpected side-effects of the crisis must be locked in.</p>",

Thirty of these people were rejected because of a lack of staff.</p> \n<p>The planned transfer of more than 30 patients from established London hospitals to the Nightingale was \u201ccancelled due to staffing issues\u201d, according to NHS documents seen by the Guardian. All the patients had been intubated and were on a ventilator because they were so unwell.</p> \n<p>The revelation raises questions about the role and future of the hospital, which up until Monday had only treated 41 patients, despite being designed to include almost 4,000 beds.</p> \n<p>That means that the hospital has rejected more patients, owing to a combination of understaffing and the patients\u2019 health, than it has treated. Of those 41 patients, four have died, seven have been discharged to a less critical level of care, and the other 30 were still being cared for at the Nightingale.</p> \n<p>The hospital is being obliged to reject people needing care because it cannot get enough of the nurses usually based in other hospitals to work there, staff at the new facility claimed.</p> \n<p>One member of staff said: \u201cThere are plenty of people working here, including plenty of doctors. But there aren\u2019t enough critical care nurses. They\u2019re already working in other hospitals and being run ragged there. There aren\u2019t spare people [specialist nurses] around to do this. That\u2019s the problem. That leads to patients having to be rejected, because there aren\u2019t enough critical care nurses.\u201d</p> \n<p>Almost 20 other patients have been rejected by the Nightingale on medical grounds, for example because they were \u201ctoo unwell to transfer\u201d or had had a tube inserted into their throat to help them breathe, or because they did not meet the new hospital\u2019s strict clinical admission criteria.</p> \n<p>The Nightingale, which was opened in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/03/prince-charles-opens-nhs-nightingale-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-video\">high-profile ceremony</a> involving Prince Charles on 3 April, admitted its first patient on 7 April and rejected the planned transfer of a patients from another London hospital for the first time on 9 April.</p> \n<p>NHS England decided to create the hospital because they feared that within weeks hospitals in the capital would have been overwhelmed by the numbers of people needing intensive care.</p> \n<p>At the time the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said that the NHS was \u201cpreparing for the worst but hoping for the best\u201d.</p> \n<p>One senior intensive care doctor said: \u201cThe Nightingale is clearly not a hospital. It\u2019s an emergency overflow facility to ventilate patients to stop them from dying when hospitals have run out of space.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sir David Sloman, head of the NHS in London, oversaw the project, in which the army was closely involved, and it was approved by Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, and the prime minister, Boris Johnson. </p> \n<p>Sloman wrote to NHS heads in London last Friday asking them to provide about 200 doctors and nurses so that the Nightingale could be used for a growing number of patients needing critical care and help established hospitals resume operations and preparations for the winter ahead.</p> \n<p>Despite this, the Nightingale\u2019s inability to admit patients has left established London hospitals unable to relieve the pressure on their overcrowded intensive care units by transferring people suffering from the coronavirus. </p> \n<p>That has had the biggest impact on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/london-hospitals-struggle-to-cope-with-coronavirus-surge\">Northwick Park hospital</a>, north-west London, which had to declare a \u201ccritical incident\u201d and temporarily shut its doors to new admissions last month as the impact of the coronavirus worsened. It has been unable to transfer more than 30 patients to the Nightingale since 9 April, with many of those planned switches \u201ccancelled due to staffing issues\u201d, the documents show.</p> \n<p>The Royal Free hospital, in Camden, London, has also had to abandon plans to transfer about 15 patients from its ICU to the Nightingale. Again, that was often due to lack of staff. Other hospitals in the capital, including St Mary\u2019s, the Royal London and North Middlesex, have also had transfers blocked.</p> \n<p>The Nightingale is already under intense scrutiny amid disagreements among NHS leaders and senior doctors in the capital over its purpose and whether or not it is a good use of resources.</p> \n<p>A senior official at a London trust said: \u201cIt\u2019s a white elephant. When it was conceived a month ago we were facing the prospect of hospitals in London being overrun and mass burial sites like in New York. We thought that London would be Italy and there would be more patients needing level 3 intensive care treatment by this stage.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut the expected doubling every three days in the number of patients needing to be admitted to ICU didn\u2019t happen. London hospitals doubled, tripled and in some cases quadrupled the capacity of their ICUs, so still have spare capacity, which means the Nightingale hasn\u2019t been needed.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"780c85dc-9ed5-46a3-83d5-1027c68f2804\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H6pDcV2Lnno?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Other NHS planners said it was better to over-prepare for the pandemic. A senior intensive care doctor said: \u201c It was a sensible project designed to stave off the type of situation we saw in Italy. It may have just been a matter of days and we would have been thankful it existed. Thankfully, good surge planning to massively increase critical care capacity in hospitals, and a last ditch redistribution effort to move patients from stressed small hospitals to larger hospitals with space, has meant that we have not needed this type of facility.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stevens echoed that view at the weekend, saying: \u201cWe have not yet had to make extensive use of the Nightingale London thanks to the hard work of NHS staff, who have freed up more than 30,000 existing hospital beds, and the public, who have played their part by staying at home and saving lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>An NHS London spokesperson said: \u201cThe most important point about staff at the Nightingale is that thanks to their care and expertise, patients in that hospital are being successfully treated, discharged and ultimately having their life saved.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThere remains spare capacity in the critical care network across the capital to look after all coronavirus patients and others who need our care, and while it is incredibly reassuring for both staff and patients to have backup capacity at the Nightingale to alleviate pressure on ICU departments where needed, patients can be transferred to other hospitals in the city if they are better placed to receive them at that time \u2013 as is always the case.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said:<strong> </strong>\u201cIt is misleading to suggest coronavirus patients are being turned away from NHS Nightingale due to a shortage of staff.</p> \n<p>\u201cNHS Nightingale has been set up to treat patients if the NHS was overwhelmed but thanks to the great work of selfless NHS staff, there is spare capacity in existing London hospitals to treat all coronavirus patients there instead.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>With more than 16,000 people already dead in the UK and more tragedies to inevitably come, both at home and as the virus terrifyingly tears through the global south, dealing with Covid-19 and saving lives must be the unremitting focus of our thoughts and actions.</p> <p>But in these long days of lockdown, other concerns sometimes intrude.</p> <p>Last week a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/hostility-to-corbyn-curbed-labour-efforts-to-tackle-antisemitism-says-leaked-report\">leaked Labour p</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/hostility-to-corbyn-curbed-labour-efforts-to-tackle-antisemitism-says-leaked-report\">arty report</a> examining the handling of antisemitism complaints seized the attention of thousands of our members. The report was the result of an internal investigation into the party\u2019s governance and legal unit, which handles disciplinary cases, and was meant to be submitted as the annex to the party\u2019s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission.</p> <p>The document chronicles many failures in the complaints process, and includes evidence from thousands of emails, messages and two WhatsApp groups featuring senior management. These internal messages have sparked further controversy, as they appear to show that senior party staff were viciously cruel to members of our shadow cabinet, and were even actively working to undermine the party\u2019s electoral success.</p> <p>The report will have been especially affecting for those who worked so hard and enthusiastically, delivering leaflets, knocking on doors and hitting those phone lines, to try to secure the election of a Labour government in 2017. If its contents are accurate \u2013 and so far, I understand that there has been no public denial of the veracity of the internal communications exposed \u2013 the hearts of many party members and supporters will be broken.</p> <p>It has <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/corbyn-election-results-votes-away-prime-minister-theresa-may-hung-parliament-a7782581.html\">been calculated</a> that Labour came within 2,500 votes, spread across a limited number of constituencies, of forming a government in 2017. If what is reported in the leaked document is true, that a group of senior staff undermined the chances of Labour going into government, it would represent the most shocking act of treachery against the party, its members and our supporters in Labour\u2019s century-long history.</p> <p>It would also represent a betrayal of all those who desperately needed a Labour government, especially in light of the current crisis.</p> <p>We could now have been in the third year of a Labour government fully funding an NHS, which would consequently be so much better resourced and prepared for the coronavirus pandemic. The nurses and health workers and carers we go out to clap every Thursday evening would have had a decent pay rise, which the Conservatives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/28/public-sector-pay-cap-could-be-lifted-downing-street-hints\">voted to deny them</a>. We would have celebrated the third anniversary of Labour\u2019s formation of a National Care Service, fully funded to provide quality care for our elderly and vulnerable fellow citizens, with carers professionally recognised and properly paid.</p> <p>So if the report has weight, expect all of us whose dreams of this transformative Labour government were shattered in 2017 to be angry.</p> <p>Actually, bloody angry.</p> <p>As well as staff undermining the party\u2019s election chances, the report suggests that attempts to root out antisemitism in the party were also undermined by basic failures to catalogue complaints or seriously investigate allegations. The document also dispels the myth that the antisemitism problem among Labour members was merely a smear or part of a conspiracy. They existed and were serious.</p> <p>That\u2019s why it is equally scandalous, if the allegations are found to be correct, that staff not only failed to deal with cases of antisemitism effectively but also covered up their failure, providing inaccurate information on progress in tackling them.</p> <p>The alleged abuse of Diane Abbott, Dawn Butler and Clive Lewis, three prominent black shadow ministers, was appalling and, as others have commented, betrayed a deeply worrying underlying strain of racism. The report also appears to document alleged attempts by party staff to fix the election of a new party leader, to manipulate parliamentary selections, and even to throw a byelection for factional advantage. All of these issues need thorough investigation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/13/labour-leaked-report-party-unity-keir-starmer-corbyn-faction\">Labour's leaked report is a major blow for 'party unity' \u2013 Keir Starmer has his work cut out | Sienna Rodgers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report should never have been leaked, or otherwise made public, without redactions to protect the identity of victims and complainants.

  "<p>Two of the biggest names on the British high street have spelled out the damage being done by the coronavirus lockdown, putting tens of thousands of staff on the goverment\u2019s job retention scheme and slashing spending as sales plunge. </p> \n<p>Primark and John Lewis have together furloughed more than 80,000 staff. John Lewis said it feared department store sales could fall by one third. It is furloughing 14,000 staff and slashing hundreds of millions of pounds from its spending plans.</p> \n<p>The employee-owned group, which also owns the Waitrose supermarket chain, said it was planning for a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in which John Lewis would experience steep sales declines until June, followed by a period of weak demand.</p> \n<p>Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of Primark, said it had furloughed 68,000 workers around the world. It has also written off \u00a3284m of stock, including Euro 2020 merchandise and spring fashions, which it is unlikely to ever sell.</p> \n<p>The fashion chain has also rented nearly a third more warehouse space to help store \u00a31.5bn of stock already ordered from suppliers which it cannot sell because its entire global network of 370 stores is closed during the crisis. It does not sell online.</p> \n<p>The group has cancelled its interim dividend, worth \u00a395m last year, while executive directors will halve their pay during the crisis. The company said Primark was losing \u00a3650m in sales and paying out \u00a3100m in cash for every month its stores remained closed.</p> \n<p>George Weston, the chief executive of ABF, said he was keen to reopen Primark\u2019s stores but urged the government not to lift restrictions too early as a second lockdown would be the \u201cworst thing\u201d.</p> \n<p>The company said it had the necessary finances to survive even its worst forecasts, under which stores would remain closed until next May. Weston said: \u201cIn time we can rebuild the profits. We can\u2019t replace the people we lose.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/sharon-white\" title=\"\">Sharon White</a>, who was installed as the John Lewis group\u2019s chairman in February, said it was a time of \u201cgreat uncertainty and volatility\u201d with the full-year picture for its finances \u201cimpossible to predict\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8113512b-8ee0-49dc-80d3-0b56df87e441\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What\u2019s the problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, rising costs and broader economic problems as well as unseasonable weather. In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \"stuff\" as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no-deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs at the end of this year. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the December 2019 Queen's speech, the government announced plans for further reform of business rates including more frequent revaluations and increasing the discount for small retailers, pubs, cinemas and music venues to 50% from one-third. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \"future high streets fund\" under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2020?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further potential Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing another tough year in 2020. The latest rise in the national minimum wage in April will also add to costs and hit profits. On the plus side, there are hopes of a boost to the housing market from increased certainty about Brexit after the general election. There are also signs that the shift to online shopping is slowing, potentially easing the pressure on high streets.</p>\n    <p><b>Sarah Butler</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOver the course of the full year, this worst case would result in a sales decline of around 35% in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis\">John Lewis</a> \u2013 around double the current level \u2013 while at Waitrose it would result in a more modest decline of less than 5%.\u201d</p> \n<p>The store group\u2019s financial performance has been hit hard by the lockdown which forced the closure of John Lewis\u2019s 50 stores.

Two Amnesty International reports have also condemned Kean, who was put in charge of the Fiji prison service in 2016, and the environment surrounding him.</p> <p>World Rugby had pledged to investigate the allegations of homophobia against Kean as they contravened the governing body\u2019s code of conduct, but initially said it cannot influence who the FRU selects as its representative for the council. Sufficient pressure has been put on the FRU, however, to ensure Kean has been stood down. The FRU\u2019s chief executive, John O\u2019Connor, has replaced him on World Rugby\u2019s council.</p> <p>\u201cWorld Rugby takes all allegations of behaviour that is not in keeping with the sport\u2019s strong and inclusive values and bylaws extremely seriously,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.world.rugby/news/568656\" title=\"\">read a statement</a>. \u201cWhile it is important to stress that any allegations must be validated, following dialogue with World Rugby, the Fiji Rugby Union recognises the seriousness of the allegations made and the need for them to be fully investigated, and that it is in the best interests of the sport that Mr Kean steps down from the council and his executive committee candidature be withdrawn.\u201d</p> <p>Kean\u2019s resignation eases the pressure on Beaumont but his bid for re-election is still likely to be tarnished. His nomination was seconded by the FRU and while he would insist it came from the union rather than Kean, many will consider that to be splitting hairs.</p> <p>Kean, furthermore, who is the brother-in-law of Fiji\u2019s prime minister, was backed in his attempt to join the executive committee by the French federation\u2019s president, Bernard Laporte, who is running to be Beaumont\u2019s vice-chairman.</p> <p>Voting in the election for the chairmanship \u2013 in which the former Argentina captain Agust\u00edn Pichot is also running \u2013 as well as the executive committee, begins next week but the results will not be announced until 12 May.</p> <p>A key part of Beaumont\u2019s manifesto is an overhaul of World Rugby\u2019s governance, including the introduction of a fit-and-proper persons test which Kean would have fallen foul of before his nomination.</p> <p>In his open letter Leo wrote: \u201cIf the values of World Rugby really are integrity, respect, solidarity, passion and discipline, all of this \u2013 and the claim to have been building character since 1823 \u2013 will be utterly debased if Kean is elected to the [executive committee].\u201d</p>",

The plant alone accounts for 777 known infections and one of seven Covid-19 deaths in the state.</p> <p>The Republican mayor of Sioux Falls, Paul TenHaken, immediately called on Noem to strengthen existing orders that have closed schools, recreational areas and discouraged large gatherings such as in churches, and told people to stay at home. TenHaken is backed by the mayor of Rapid City, the state\u2019s second largest town. But Noem has refused, noting that the Smithfield plant would still have been open as an essential business.</p> <p>Professor John Schaff, a political scientist at Northern State University, said Noem\u2019s position was mostly driven by an ideological commitment supported by a majority of South Dakotans.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a governing ideology that says that people are free to make their own choices, and if people want to engage in some behaviours that in other parts of the country would be restricted, they\u2019re not restricted here,\u201d said Schaff.</p> <p>\u201cI think the governor is seeing that for most of the state, we\u2019re not in any kind of crisis mode, so why give an order to the entire state, when it\u2019s really this one very specific geographic spot? In that sense I think the governor is probably where most South Dakotans are, in that they don\u2019t want to be dictated to that they have to follow highly restrictive rules when the virus is yet to make a major impact on most people\u2019s lives.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24fd63e4888520664888c8345627da600e4bab20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24fd63e4888520664888c8345627da600e4bab20/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Smithfields meat plant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Smithfields meat plant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Brouillette/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Schaff lives in Aberdeen, the state\u2019s third largest city with a population of just 26,000 people. \u201cYou have to drive 100 miles to get to another town of 25,000 people. Our nearest neighbour is five miles away. That\u2019s how remote South Dakota is, and we have entire counties which have zero cases of coronavirus. I think that is really what\u2019s driving the governor,\u201d he said.</p> <p>TenHaken has faced his own attacks for attempts, now withdrawn, to impose a stay-at-home order in Sioux Falls.</p> <p>\u201cI am called everything from Hitler to Mayor Mussolini, to everything in between,\u201d he said. \u201cIt pains me to have to bring things like this forward \u2013 I don\u2019t want to do that. But we\u2019re continuing to have to balance this fluid, very delicate, delicate situation.\u201d</p> <p>One farmer threatened to let loose his pigs on the streets of Sioux Falls.</p> <p>While Minnehaha county grapples with more infections, a third of South Dakota\u2019s 66 counties have no cases at all. \u201cI think there\u2019s an increasing questioning of how serious the virus is and how deadly it is,\u201d said Michael Card, a political scientist at the University of South Dakota. \u201cIn our state, we\u2019ve cut in half the predictions of what we figure will be the peak hospitalisations in mid-June.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ccdbcfb4f0e68973249ebb974814c55b0e67b339\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccdbcfb4f0e68973249ebb974814c55b0e67b339/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Commuters wait at the bus stop in Sioux Falls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Commuters wait at the bus stop in Sioux Falls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Brouillette/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s reflective of broader questioning in areas of the midwest. Away from the fury of the organised protests in some cities, a quieter scepticism is infusing parts of the region that have not yet been badly hit by infections and deaths, but which are bearing a severe economic cost including huge numbers of people made unemployed. There is not much open questioning of the science, but states such as Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska can count lives lost to Covid-19 in the dozens while unemployment has surged into the millions.</p> <p>In South Dakota, its two biggest industries, agriculture and tourism, have taken a severe hit and do not look likely to recover for months.</p> <p>Noem\u2019s stand also conveniently coincides with her unflinching support of Trump, which will not do her any political damage in South Dakota, where the president remains popular. </p> <p>But Schaff said Noem will ultimately be judged on how badly South Dakota is hit by the virus. \u201cHow smart the governor looks will probably depend on the total number of cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mere fact that we do not have the major outbreak in most of South Dakota doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t happen very quickly.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The public should wear homemade masks when they venture outdoors to help reduce the spread of coronavirus, according to scientists who claim Britain\u2019s masks policy does too little to prevent infections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/how-to-make-no-sew-face-mask-coronavirus\">How to make a non-medical coronavirus face mask \u2013 no sewing required</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Prof Sian Griffiths, who led the Hong Kong government\u2019s investigation into the 2003 Sars epidemic, said Britain should adopt the same approach as the US, where people are advised to make their own \u201ccloth face coverings\u201d and wear them in public spaces.</p> <p>Trish Greenhalgh, a professor of primary care health sciences at Oxford University who recently completed a review on face masks, also advocated the use of masks in public and suggested an old T-shirt combined with kitchen paper would suffice.</p> <p>The US policy is being directed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is designed to reduce at least some transmission of the virus while preventing a run on medical-grade masks needed by frontline health workers.</p> <p>\u201cThe CDC advice in the US is pragmatic,\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cIt recognises both the need to ensure the supply of masks for clinical situations where they are obviously needed at the same time as recognising that there could potentially be benefits in wearing \u2018masks\u2019 in public to prevent passing on the infection.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/facemask-zip/giv-3902CN5iba3GbXmu/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/facemask-zip/giv-3902CN5iba3GbXmu/\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The government\u2019s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) met on Tuesday to review the evidence on wearing face masks. The Guardian understands that the group is split on the best policy to adopt because the evidence is so weak.</p> <p>Ministers are deeply reluctant to recommend the use of even homemade masks amid concerns that people will rush to buy medical masks and leave the NHS facing even greater supply shortages.</p> <p>Asked about potential changes to the advice on the face masks, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said at the daily No 10 press conference that ministers would be \u201cguided by the science as always\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking at the briefing, Professor Jonathan Van-Tham, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, said advice from Sage would be passed on to ministers. But he stressed there was \u201can absolute enduring principle\u201d not to jeopardise supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) to health and social care workers, adding: \u201cthat is a line that we are not going to cross under any circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>Public Health England recommends face masks for the NHS and in social care settings but does not advise healthy people to wear them outside. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines state that while masks can help prevent people from passing on coronavirus, they are inadequate protection on their own from contracting it.</p> <p>Greenhalgh, on the back of a review on face masks, said homemade versions could dramatically reduce the amount of droplets sprayed from people\u2019s mouths, which can carry the virus if the person is infected.</p> <p>\u201cWe should be covering our faces with homespun materials like cotton. Medical-grade masks are scratchy and uncomfortable. Your old T-shirt is soft and nice, and with a couple of layers of kitchen paper inside a double layer, it will reduce the droplets coming out of your mouth and nose by about 95%,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She added: \u201cThe public should not and must not divert medical-grade supplies.\u201d</p> <p>There is growing unease over the government\u2019s reluctance to recommend the use of face masks. Doctors across the UK have now backed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/how-to-make-no-sew-face-mask-coronavirus\">Masks4AllUK</a> movement, which argues that people should wear homemade masks when they go out.</p> <p>At a press conference on Friday, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said that while Sage would look at the evidence, it was \u201cabsolutely crucial\u201d that masks were available in hospitals and other high-risk transmission areas.</p> <p>Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents healthcare trusts across England, said the impact on the NHS must be fully assessed. \u201cFluid-repellent masks for health and care staff are key to safety and to avoid the spread of coronavirus,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSecuring the supply of masks, when there is huge global demand, is crucial. This must be a key consideration for government. There needs to be clear evidence that wearing masks, along with other measures, will deliver significant enough benefits to take us out of lockdown to potentially jeopardise NHS mask supply.\u201d</p> <p>Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who chairs an independent advisory group to the WHO emergencies programme that is managing the Covid-19 pandemic, said the purpose of wearing face masks was to prevent the wearer from spreading the virus if they were infected themselves.</p> <p>\u201cMasks should not be worn by the general public to protect themselves as there is evidence that masks do not prevent infection by other respiratory infections such as flu,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe best way that the general public can support government policy is to understand how to protect themselves and protect others if they are sick or believe they may be infected. This is by physical distancing, social distancing and frequent handwashing.\u201d</p>",

Indeed, those close to the deal believe the takeover is now unstoppable.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Amnesty UK\u2019s director, Kate Allen, has written to Richard Masters, the Premier League\u2019s chief executive, to warn him his organisation\u2019s credibility will be threatened should he rubber-stamp a buyout that can be interpreted as a shameless exercise in soft geopolitical power.</p> <p>Allen wrote: \u201cSo long as these questions [concerning Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record] remain unaddressed, the Premier League is putting itself at risk of becoming a patsy of those who want to use the glamour and prestige of Premier League football to cover up actions that are deeply immoral, in breach of international law and at odds with the values of the Premier League and the global footballing community.\u201d wrote Allen.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record has been widely condemned, with Amnesty highlighting the imprisonment and torture of government critics and the execution of others following unfair trials.</p> <p>Allen fears the coronavirus emergency will dictate that Newcastle\u2019s takeover receives significantly reduced scrutiny. In a statement separate to the letter sent to Masters, she said: \u201cThe coronavirus crisis has already thrown a spotlight on football and its need to treat players and staff fairly, and now there\u2019s a danger that the pandemic could obscure the need for a cool, measured and genuinely ethical decision over this deal.</p> <p>\u201cAll businesses need to safeguard against any possible links to human rights violations, and English football is no different. This is more than just a financial transaction \u2013 it\u2019s an image-building exercise that draws on the prestige of the Premier League and the passion of Newcastle United\u2019s fanbase.</p> <p>\u201cWhether or not this deal goes ahead, we\u2019re calling on Newcastle United staff and fans to familiarise themselves with the dire human rights situation in Saudi Arabia and be prepared to speak out about it.</p> <p>\u201cAt the very least, the Premier League should make a clear statement over how its owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test has been applied in this case, and what assessment has been made of Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record under Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Newcastle or the Premier League will comment on the takeover but Masters was asked about a potential Saudi buyout in February. \u201cThe owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test is about as private and confidential a test as it comes, so it is impossible for me to comment on what the conclusions of the Premier League board would be in such a scenario,\u201d he said at the time.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a set of objective tests which are financially related and there are also tests \u2013 and again, I am not linking this with anybody \u2013 about crimes committed overseas or activities which might be seen as criminal in this country might be taken into account.\u201d</p> <p>Newcastle supporters are almost universally delighted at the prospect of seeing the back of the unpopular Ashley and, albeit with certain caveats, the new owners can expect a warm welcome on Tyneside where they are understood to be committed to hefty investment in both the playing squad and urban regeneration projects.</p> <p>The Premier League checks are expected to be completed within the next fortnight.</p>",
  "<p>The days of cheap air travel will be over if airlines are forced to introduce physical distancing measures on planes because of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 pandemic</a>, the industry has warned.</p> <p>Alexandre de Juniac, the director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said that if governments ordered airlines to adopt physical distancing onboard aircraft, at least a third of seats would remain empty and airlines would have to raise their ticket prices by at least 50% or go bust.</p> <p>\u201cEither you fly at the same price, selling the ticket at the same average price as before, and you lose enormous amounts of money so it\u2019s impossible to fly for any airline, particularly low cost; or you increase ticket prices by at least 50% and you are able to fly with a minimum profit. So it means that if social distancing is imposed, cheap travel is over.\u201d</p> <p>Iata said domestic air traffic had slumped 70% since early January because of the pandemic and warned that any global recovery was likely to be slow. While domestic routes will open sooner than long-haul, weak consumer confidence amid recession fears will undermine a quick recovery, said Brian Pearce, Iata\u2019s chief economist. Vietnam plans to restart all domestic flights from Thursday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pearce pointed to China, where air travel bounced back initially when domestic flights resumed in mid-February, but said the recovery had since stalled with the number of domestic flights at just over 40% of pre-pandemic levels. In Australia, domestic flights are 10% of pre-crisis levels even though new Covid-19 infections are close to zero.</p> <p>Iata is conducting regional summits with governments this week and called for confidence-boosting measures. While several European countries are starting to ease national lockdowns, \u201can immediate rebound from the catastrophic fall in passenger demand appears unlikely\u201d, said de Juniac.</p> <p>The aviation body expects 2020 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-outbreak-could-cost-worlds-airlines-up-to-314bn\">global passenger revenues to more than halve from last year</a>, a loss of $314bn (\u00a3255bn).</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The government has won an appeal over its controversial right to rent scheme, which was last year ruled by the high court to be racially discriminatory.</p> <p>The scheme, which is a key element of the Home Office\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d for illegal migration, requires private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants and prospective tenants. Those landlords that fail to complete checks can face fines and up to five years in prison.</p> <p>The high court found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/right-to-rent-scheme-ruled-incompatible-with-human-rights-law\">last year</a> that requiring landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants was unlawful and racially discriminatory because it caused landlords to discriminate against British citizens from minority ethnic backgrounds and against foreign nationals who had a legal right to rent.</p> <p>The court ruled that the policy had a \u201cdisproportionately discriminatory effect\u201d, as well as \u201clittle to no effect\u201d on controlling immigration, and was incompatible with the right to freedom from discrimination, enshrined in European human rights legislation.</p> <p>But the Home Office appealed against that ruling, and the appeal court found that while some landlords did discriminate against would-be tenants who had no British passport, the scheme was nevertheless \u201cjustified\u201d as a \u201cproportionate means of achieving its legitimate objective\u201d.</p> <p>The judgement acknowledged that some landlords discriminated against people without a British passport due to \u201cadministrative convenience and a fear of the consequences of letting to an irregular immigrant\u201d, but added that most complied with the requirements without discriminating.</p> <p>Lawyers acting for the Home Office told the appeal court in January that the government could not be held responsible for landlords \u201cchoosing\u201d to discriminate by preferring tenants with a UK passport. About 17% of the population in England and Wales do not hold a passport.</p> <p>The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), which opposed the government\u2019s appeal, argued that the state \u201cplainly is responsible for the discriminatory effects of its actions, whether intended or not\u201d.</p> <p>The JCWI said it was preparing to appeal against the ruling at the supreme court and renewed calls for the scheme to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/06/government-faces-high-court-challenge-right-rent-scheme\">repealed</a>.</p> <p>Chai Patel, the JCWI\u2019s legal policy director, said that the appeal court had upheld the high court\u2019s finding that landlords were discriminating against migrants or people of ethnic minority backgrounds as they sought to adhere to the right to rent legislation. However, the ruling did not conclude that this meant the scheme was in violation of human rights law.</p> <p>\u201cThe Home Office has always maintained that this racial discrimination wasn\u2019t caused by the scheme. Now we have two court rulings confirming that the government is causing racial discrimination in the housing market against ethnic minority British people, like the Windrush generation,\u201d Patel said. \u201cAt a time when our lives depend on our ability to stay at home safely, ethnic minorities and foreign nationals are being forced by the government to face discrimination in finding a safe place for them and their families to live.\u201d</p> <p>The junior immigration minister Chris Philp welcomed the decision. \u201cAs we have made clear throughout, the scheme ensures that only those with a legal right to be in the UK are able to access benefits and services, and [it] discourages people from entering the country unlawfully. This is also a question of fairness to UK citizens and the many people who come to the UK legally who all need to access housing.\u201d</p>",

It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage. Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs.

  "<p>Motorboating enthusiast Richard Branson is playing a particularly idiosyncratic game of Monopoly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/richard-branson-renews-virgin-plea-for-coronavirus-support\">He would like to mortgage his private Caribbean island</a>. In return, you, the taxpayer, have to buy him Mayfair and Park Lane, all the greens, all the yellows, all the reds, and stick a hotel on every one of them.

The only bright side is that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/14/firstgroup-consortium-to-replace-virgin-on-west-coast-mainline\">no longer operates</a> out of any of the stations.</p> <p>But perhaps we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves. By way of a recap, the tycoon is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/richard-branson-facing-backlash-over-plea-for-uk-bailout-of-virgin\">seeking a reported \u00a3500m government bailout</a> of his Virgin Atlantic airline, and has stated in a blogpost that he is willing to put Necker Island up as collateral to secure lending for his businesses.</p> <p>Without wishing to ask the cursory amount of questions, is this the same island that seems to get virtually destroyed every couple of years? I do believe it is. So \u2026 nice try, hotshot. This feels like being offered the chance to underwrite Richard Hammond\u2019s car insurance. A quick archive trawl confirms that Necker has in recent years been struck by both a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41224243\">devastating fire</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14616123\">devastating hurricane</a> \u2013 which, if I were religious, would probably make me think God was a guy who believed in paying UK income tax. Either way, offering up Necker is arguably the most WTF-tinged piece of collateral action since that late-1980s moment when Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/arts/a-27-million-loan-by-sotheby-s-helped-alan-bond-to-buy-irises.html\">bought Van Gogh\u2019s Irises</a> at Sotheby\u2019s, using a loan from Sotheby\u2019s, for which the painting itself was collateral. Confused? Don\u2019t worry; the short version is that it ended badly in a number of ways.</p> <p>But back to the present day, and Britain\u2019s Best-Loved Businessman\u2122. You will note that there has been some debate as to whether this is quite the moment for a man who once sued the NHS, and who has not paid income tax in this country for 14 years, to request a taxpayer bailout. The way Richard sees it, judging by his lengthily defensive blogpost on Monday, is that he\u2019s lifted so many people up. And he has. Mainly women \u2013 and bodily. The sheer volume of archive photos of a guffawing Branson carrying some stilettoed lovely, usually in water, makes it a genre all of its own.

  "<p>Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to try to prevent billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money being spent on a huge road-building programme, which they say breaches the UK\u2019s legal commitments to tackle the climate crisis and air pollution.</p> <p>Lawyers acting for the Transport Action Network (Tan) have begun legal proceedings against the Department for Transport calling for the road-building scheme, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/chancellor-announces-27bn-for-roadbuilding-in-budget\">confirmed last month by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak</a>, to be suspended.</p> <p>They argue that ministers did not take into account the government\u2019s legally binding commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. They also say the government has not considered whether the \u00a327bn programme is in line with its obligations under the Paris climate agreement.</p> <p>The move follows a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/heathrow-third-runway-ruled-illegal-over-climate-change\">successful challenge</a> to the proposed third runway at Heathrow. In that case the court ruled that the planned airport expansion was illegal because ministers did not adequately take into account the government\u2019s commitments to tackle the climate crisis.</p> <p>The road-building programme is thought to be the UK\u2019s largest and would lead to thousands of miles of new roads being built across the country in the coming years \u2013 with at least 50 projects due to be under way in the next two years.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s road network and its wider transport infrastructure are crucial in the country\u2019s efforts to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The transport sector is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and the only one to have <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/roadtransportandairemissions/2019-09-16\">increased its emissions in recent years</a>.</p> <p>Chris Todd, Tan\u2019s director, said it was impossible to take the government seriously on the threat posed by climate change when it is \u201cset to burn billions on the largest ever roads programme\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis massive roads programme has become like a juggernaut that\u2019s out of control, that no one can stop. We now have no choice but to go to court to prevent an unfolding disaster.\u201d</p> <p>Tan wrote to the secretary of state following the court of appeal\u2019s Heathrow decision in February requesting a pause in the road-building programme to allow time to reconsider its environmental effects. It said it did not receive a response to that letter. Lawyers have sent a pre-action protocol letter that is the official start of legal proceedings.</p> <p>Rowan Smith, from the solicitors Leigh Day, which is pursuing the case on behalf of Tan, said the group was raising \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d at a time when it was widely established that the climate emergency \u201cdemands a move away from a continued reliance on fossil fuels towards more sustainable transport\u201d.</p> <p>The government\u2019s climate change adviser has joined calls for ministers to reconsider its road-building plans.</p> <p>Chris Stark, the head of the Committee on Climate Change, said it would be better for the economy and the fight against climate breakdown for the billions of pounds allocated for road-building to be invested in broadband \u2013 especially in light of the coronavirus crisis, which has led to many more people working from home.</p> <p>\u201cThe government mustn\u2019t be investing in anything likely to increase carbon emissions,\u201d Stark told the BBC. \u201cI expect that video-conferencing will become the new normal and we won\u2019t return to travelling the way we did. I would spend the roads budget on fibre. You would get a huge return to the economy with people having better connections. You would save people\u2019s time and increase their productivity.\u201d</p> <p>His comments echo those of the head of the motoring organisation the AA, who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52137968\">said this month</a> that government money would be better invested in broadband than roads.</p> <p>In response to the legal challenge, a spokesperson for the Department for Transport defended its plans. \u201cThe second road investment strategy is consistent with our ambitions to improve air quality and decarbonise transport,\u201d they said. \u201cWe have received the letter and will respond formally in due course.\u2019\u2019</p>",
  "<p>Last December, Lucrecia Dalt travelled to a rainforest in Colombia that is part of the Choc\u00f3, a biodiversity hotspot stretching all the way from Costa Rica to Ecuador.

Pons hopes it teaches listeners about European deforestation, which doesn\u2019t get nearly as much attention as what\u2019s happening in the Amazon. \u201cA lot of people told me it\u2019s soothing,\u201d she says, \u201cbut there are quite oppressive moments.\u201d</p> <p>There are physical benefits as well. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep45273\">Studies</a> have found that the sound of gurgling streams and soft breezes can stabilise the blood pressure and heart rate of patients on the operating table, while terminally ill cancer patients have reported feeling less discomfort and anxiety if nature sounds are played at their bedside.</p> <p>In the late 1980s, when musician-turned-bioacoustician <a href=\"http://www.wildsanctuary.com/index.html\">Bernie Krause</a> put out such recordings as Distant Thunder and Dawn at Trout Lake, he found an audience among the unwell. \u201cPeople who had just gotten out of heart surgery, or undergone kidney replacement, would be in hospital writing to us about how these albums made them feel better.\u201d </p> <p>This aspect of field recordings is familiar to Emmy-winning acoustic ecologist <a href=\"https://www.soundtracker.com/\">Gordon Hempton</a>. When his wife found herself in hospital a few years ago, she listened to his 2005 albums Ocean Dreams and Songs of Spring. Both were recorded in Washington state\u2019s Olympic National Park, using binaural equipment.</p> <p>Apparently, she found the recordings more effective than oxycodone. \u201cThe sounds conveyed to her a sense of prosperity and security,\u201d says Hempton. \u201cThat was enough for her body to fight the pain.\u201d Those albums, among others, are currently available for <a href=\"https://www.quietparks.org/last-echos-of-nature\">free</a>, just in time for Earth Day on 22 April.</p> <p>There are some who believe that field recordings work on an even deeper level.

Early in July 1960, the very same week he was nominated to be the Democratic candidate for the presidency, Kennedy was playing Cypress Point in Monterey. At the par-three 15th he hit a fine five-iron off the tee and watched the ball land on the front left of the green and kick straight on towards the hole.</p> <p>\u201cGo in.

When Kennedy finally moved in he found that the wooden floor of the Oval Office was pitted with cleat marks.</p> <p>Which was precisely why Kennedy didn\u2019t want anyone to know he played, too. So he tried hard to keep it secret. He would skip the holes that passed closest to the clubhouse so he could keep from being seen, and had his secret service staff wear golf gear and play in the groups either side of his so that they could go incognito, although, Fay noted, they were such poor players that they stood out like \u201csomeone attending a formal dinner in a sport shirt\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/us-open-2020-coronavirus-decision\">USTA to decide on US Open by June with no spectators 'highly unlikely'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was only when wild rumours started swirling among the press pack about exactly what else the president might be up to when he kept disappearing in the afternoons that Kennedy\u2019s men finally admitted he was sneaking over to the Burning Tree club to fit in nine holes.</p> <p>Trump, though, is pretty unashamed about where the game fits in his list of priorities.

After all, he\u2019d had one idea that changed the face of pop music in the UK. Radio Caroline wasn\u2019t the first pirate radio station \u2013 Denmark\u2019s Radio Mercur had begun transmitting from a ship moored in international waters back in 1958 \u2013 but it was by far the most important and influential. O\u2019Rahilly had become fixated on the idea while managing Soho nightclub The Scene and working as a manager for Georgie Fame. The Scene was very successful: it catered to mods, playing soul, blues and R&amp;B, music for which there was no outlet on British radio. The BBC\u2019s Light Programme restricted pop music to two shows a week, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/51XHB1mgDFXf5TkHWDrzPVN/the-bbc-studios-in-60s-london\">Saturday Club and Easy Beat</a>, and the chart rundown Pick of the Pops. It wasn\u2019t interested in playing the Georgie Fame single that O\u2019Rahilly had pressed up, so O\u2019Rahilly announced he would start his own radio station to play Fame\u2019s music, using the Radio Mercur model.</p> <p>Launched in March 1964, apparently named after John F Kennedy\u2019s daughter and staffed by DJs recruited from dancehalls and bars \u2013 among them Tony Blackburn, Johnnie Walker and Tony Prince \u2013 Radio Caroline, \u201cyour all-day music station\u201d, was an instant sensation, not least because its only competition came from Radio Luxembourg, always marred by poor reception in the UK, and a plethora of imitators: Radio Atlanta, Radio London, Radio City, Swinging Radio England. It displayed a willingness to promote artists too wild or innovative for the BBC to touch \u2013 riot-provoking R&amp;B iconoclasts the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/25/we-were-reprobates-the-pretty-things-on-being-loved-by-bowie-and-smoking-a-spliff-with-norman-wisdom\">Pretty Things</a> were Caroline regulars; in early 1965, the station alighted on the chiming guitars and harmonies of the Byrds\u2019s Mr Tambourine Man.</p> <p>It developed an ability to turn singles into hits and artists into stars: the Honeycombs\u2019s Have I the Right? and Tom Jones\u2019s It\u2019s Not Unusual, both No 1 singles, were initially broken by Radio Caroline; Pete Townshend was always quick to credit Caroline\u2019s importance in the Who\u2019s rise to success. In addition, there developed a kind of underclass of singles that never actually became hits, but entered the national consciousness as a result of Caroline playing them to death: Marc Almond recalled hearing David McWilliams\u2019s psychedelic oddity The Days of Pearly Spencer over and over again as a child (Caroline\u2019s attachment to the song was linked to the fact it was released on a label owned by one of its directors); in 1992, his cover of the song finally turned it into a Top 5 smash.</p> <p>It even affected the English language: the term \u201canorak\u201d, meaning nerdy obsessive, was apparently first coined by Caroline DJ Andy Archer to describe the station\u2019s die-hard fans, who would sail out to the ship on which it was situated in order to meet the DJs.</p> <p>Eventually, the success of the pirate stations provoked both the government and the BBC into action. In August 1967, the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act was introduced; the following month, most of Caroline\u2019s big stars abandoned the station for the newly launched Radio One, a legal station created in its image. The pirate era\u2019s eulogy was provided by the Who: their December 1967 album Sell Out was modelled as a fake broadcast by the now-defunct pirate Radio London.</p> <p>O\u2019Rahilly and Caroline doggedly carried on \u2013 Johnnie Walker stuck with them for a little while longer \u2013 but became increasingly obscure: Radio Caroline tended only to impinge on the national consciousness when its ship sank, necessitating rescue by lifeboats. If O\u2019Rahilly\u2019s subsequent schemes tended to the hare-brained, they occasionally contained the germ of an idea. Pirate TV eventually came to pass, without the aid of aircraft; the members of the unfortunate Loving Awareness formed the core of Ian Dury\u2019s Blockheads.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b68fafceea728594247d0e15dcd28a0525a0cd4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68fafceea728594247d0e15dcd28a0525a0cd4c/0_0_4794_3216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Next generation ...

Rinse FM founder Geeneus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a sense, it didn\u2019t matter. An entirely new breed of pirate station emerged, with more or less the same USP as Caroline had once had: playing music that the BBC tended to ignore and helping to change pop in the process. Launched in 1970, Radio Invicta was \u201cEurope\u2019s first and only all-soul station\u201d, and eventually launched the careers of Pete Tong and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/16/gilles-peterson-club-culture-jazz-nubya-garcia-nightports-shabaka-hutchings\">Gilles Peterson</a>; Kiss FM, which appeared after Invicta went off air, featured Tim Westwood, Trevor Nelson, Coldcut and Soul II Soul\u2019s Jazzie B among its alumni. The Dread Broadcasting Corporation was Britain\u2019s first black-owned station; largely remembered as an outlet for reggae, it featured a hip-hop show presented by Neneh Cherry. A bigger explosion in pirate radio came with the rise of acid house and its myriad subgenres: Kool FM was instrumental in the development of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/drum-n-bass\">drum\u2019n\u2019bass</a>; Rinse, Deja Vu and Delight did the same for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/grime\">grime</a>.</p> <p>It was all a long way from Tony Blackburn on board the Mi Amigo, but whether they knew or cared, all these stations effectively owed Ronan O\u2019Rahilly some kind of debt. \u201cWho knows what would have happened had Ronan not got hold of my brain?\u201d pondered George Lazenby, a little dolefully, in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/21/ronan-orahilly-radio-caroline-founder-uk-pop-pirate-radio-dies-aged-79-james-bond-george-lazenby\">posthumous tribute</a>. British pop music could ask itself the same question.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 April 2020 to correctly reflect the range of BBC radio shows playing pop music in the mid-1960s and because an earlier version said that those radio shows were on the BBC\u2019s Home Service. In fact they were on the BBC\u2019s Light Programme.</p>",
  "<p>If there has been a small moment of joy in lockdown, it was the image of a silver-clad Sophie Ellis-Bextor, sequin-spattered kids in tow, performing her disco hits from her living room on a Friday night. The live-streamed party, during which she interrupted her hit song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6gLOmjP5GY\">Take Me Home</a> (the lyrics changed to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZu3eOQU06E\">\u201cstay at home\u201d</a>) to tell one of her children: \u201cDon\u2019t step on the baby!\u201d has become a weekly event to look forward to.</p> <p>\u201cAny kind of work at the moment is quite a challenge, I have to say,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the second week, I really wasn\u2019t in the mood. I was feeling quite flat and a bit down. Then I found myself putting my rollers in, putting my makeup on, choosing the songs, putting my sequins on ... and I felt lifted. Totally lifted.\u201d</p> <p>Ellis-Bextor is somewhat harried today, speaking on Skype from the music studio in her west London home \u2013 usually the domain of her husband, Richard Jones, the bassist in the Feeling. It is a cosy grotto, complemented by mic stands, neon lights and a guitar. It is, she says, the only place she can find respite from the strain of navigating lockdown with five children, four of whom were in school or nursery until a month ago, one of whom is trying to work on his GCSEs. \u201cI didn\u2019t set out to home-school my kids,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t find it comes particularly naturally.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZu3eOQU06E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TZu3eOQU06E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>\u2018Jesse, it\u2019s government advice!\u2019 Ellis-Bextor and her sons dance to her song Take Me Home, with the lyrics changed to \u201cstay at home\u201d.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>She is much more accustomed to the glitz and chaos of showbusiness. She first spun into the music mainstream in 2000, with a feature spot on the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syOK6zmpOe0\">Groovejet (If This Ain\u2019t Love)</a> by Spiller, which remains a British radio staple, and she had a steady pop career with follow-up singles Murder on the Dancefloor and Music Gets the Best of Me, plus a run of seven albums. In 2013, she dazzled on Strictly Come Dancing, wowing the judges with, among other performances, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRsan_COiD0\">a memorably bouncy whirl through the </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRsan_COiD0\">charleston</a>. In the end, she lost out in the final to Abbey Clancy.</p> <p>She was born into the world of entertainment: her mother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/21/blue-peter-badge-bad-sex-award-fiction-janet-ellis\">Janet Ellis</a>, was a presenter on Blue Peter, while her father is the film producer Robin Bextor. She recalls a cosmopolitan childhood, filled with brunches and celebrity parties. \u201cIt definitely shaped me,\u201d she says. She began performing in childhood, later moving into modelling. Before her chart success, she developed a cult following in the late 90s as the sultry singer of indie rock group Theaudience.</p> <p>With her summer touring schedule wiped out due to lockdown, she is finding it hard adjusting to not performing. \u201cI miss it terribly,\u201d she says. \u201cI miss performing, I miss all the plans I had ... but so does everybody.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1b65cbb435badd327d9b3685ba0b3d9ac785499e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b65cbb435badd327d9b3685ba0b3d9ac785499e/0_0_3040_2044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Ellis-Bextor with her mother, Janet Ellis, in 1989\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Famous family ...

Before lockdown, the idea of letting a camera into her home, and filming her children, would have been inconceivable \u2013 but life has changed irrevocably. \u201cI suppose, over the years, I\u2019ve always been quite a private person,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t normally show the inside of my house. I definitely never show my kids anywhere. But suddenly, I think with everything we\u2019ve all been going through collectively, it just felt like that was totally irrelevant. Like, who cares? No one\u2019s interested in prying; we just want to feel a connection. We just want something silly.\u201d</p> <p>The height of her fame came during a frenzied period for the tabloids, which were splashed with women of a similar age \u2013 such as Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears \u2013 being pilloried for their lives seemingly careering out of control. She, too, was briefly tabloid fodder, when Groovejet went up against Victoria Beckham\u2019s debut solo single, Out of Your Mind, for the No 1 chart slot. The perceived \u201cbattle\u201d spawned sniping from both parties, most notably when Ellis-Bextor wore a T-shirt emblazoned \u201cPeckham\u201d, a tongue-in-cheek reference to her competitor\u2019s name. In the end, Ellis-Bextor and Spiller won out.</p> <p>\u201cSome of it was probably just quite good fun,\u201d laughs Ellis-Bextor. \u201cQuite cartoony, wasn\u2019t it? Victoria Beckham from the Spice Girls, who were massive and really well liked, and then someone who most people had never heard of ... I just found it bonkers. I tried to remember as much as possible, because I knew that I\u2019d never find myself in a situation like that ever again.\u201d</p> <p>At one point, she toured with George Michael, but, bizarrely, never met him. \u201cHe\u2019d built an entrance on the front of his dressing room, so that you couldn\u2019t walk past it and see in accidentally. He was obviously just going through a bit where he needed a lot of privacy, for whatever reason.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ab6cce2cd464fd21d94a5dffa6ea5e01c770d04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ab6cce2cd464fd21d94a5dffa6ea5e01c770d04/0_0_747_748/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Ellis-Bextor and her youngest son, Mickey\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lockdown living ...

I do think it\u2019s difficult sometimes for women to be given any sort of authority with their work, or for there not to be a question mark over who\u2019s doing what behind the scenes, which I used to find so tedious when I was younger.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started, I just felt like everybody assumes that the record company are making decisions for you all the time \u2013 you know, before you go and get your fringe cut, you have to go and see the board and ask if it\u2019s OK. But, actually, I think some of that is a slightly misogynistic view, really \u2013 that a young woman wouldn\u2019t be able to make her own decisions.\u201d<br><br>While she is not widely known as a songwriter, she has written or part-written the bulk of her back catalogue. \u201cSometimes you can feel a bit insecure about the fact that most people assume you\u2019re not doing any of that kind of thing. I was quite sensitive to it.\u201d She learned \u2013 for better or for worse \u2013 to let it go. \u201cI quickly realised that it wasn\u2019t that relevant to people, if I write or not. The fact of the matter is: my job as a songwriter and my job as a singer are compatible, but they don\u2019t depend on each other. But I don\u2019t really want people wondering about who wrote what. I just want them to get lost in a story. I\u2019ve written the majority of what I\u2019ve done, but I don\u2019t need people to necessarily think about that.\u201d</p> <p>After the success of Groovejet, she released her debut studio album, Read My Lips, in 2001 \u2013 for which she brought in musicians including Blur\u2019s Alex James and Moby. She followed it up over the next decade and a half with five more studio albums, all breezy dance-pop records, most of which were big in Europe. In 2019, she released her seventh and most recent musical project, The Song Diaries, an orchestral reworking of her biggest hits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6615013150a01624072e1c29d03c887bbe14c518\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6615013150a01624072e1c29d03c887bbe14c518/0_0_5450_3664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellis-Bextor with Theaudience in 1998\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cult following ...

Her melding of 70s disco aesthetic and 90s club hits enchant DJs and punters in gay clubs, and she is no stranger to the smoke machines of Soho, which has long been the centre of London\u2019s gay scene. \u201cMy relationship with my gay fans is very precious to me \u2013 it\u2019s shaped the career I have. After I had my first baby, I hadn\u2019t performed for a while and I did my first gig back at [the London LGBTQ+ venue] G-A-Y ... I honestly feel like that night was pivotal for me. It was like a wall had come down and I felt my inhibitions go. Since then, I feel like I\u2019ve been a different kind of performer.\u201d</p> <p>She rarely lets a summer pass without an appearance at a Pride festival (she headlined Birmingham Pride in 2017, London Pride in 2018 and Bristol Pride in 2019) and often tours with the drag collective <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/23/how-club-night-sink-the-pink-is-saving-queer-nightlife\">Sink </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/23/how-club-night-sink-the-pink-is-saving-queer-nightlife\">the Pink</a>.

Why on earth should someone say: \u2018I need to adhere to that list of gender specifics\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnce people feel like they can define themselves the way they want to, then we can have a debate about nuance,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat works for one transgender individual is not the same for another. We\u2019ve got to get to a point where we can have their voices heard. But the main point is about just making sure that, socially and economically, [trans people] are supported in the right way.\u201d</p> <p>She is concerned about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/toys-kids-girls-boys-childhood-development-gender-research\">how gender roles are still imposed on children through consumer culture</a>. \u201cIf you look at kids\u2019 toys, it\u2019s very much girls\u2019 toys and boys\u2019 toys, maybe even more than I remember when I was small. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s some weird fear that, if you give kids lots of choice and let them interpret themselves as they are, then you\u2019re going to encourage some sort of craziness. I think a lot of people feel very uncomfortable about it and I don\u2019t really know why.\u201d</p> <p>On how she has broached the subject of gender identity with her five boys, her answer is simple and matter-of-fact: \u201cI\u2019m not really bothered about what they choose \u2013 I just want them to feel like they have choice. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how most people must feel about raising their kids.</p> <p>\u201cActually, I do meet some people, even close friends, who are surprisingly traditional in their thinking. I\u2019ve been given my children and I can\u2019t mould anything about them. I\u2019ve just got to support them and love them and try to guide them. And that\u2019s probably why most of them are feral,\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>For the foreseeable future, she will be at home, physically distancing with her husband and their boys. \u201cNow that we\u2019re a few weeks in, I\u2019ve got better at not hanging off the news stuff all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel a bit like I\u2019m on a long-haul flight. The world\u2019s going on out there, but for the time being this is what you\u2019re doing, this is where you are. So you\u2019ve just got to get on with it.\u201d</p>",

And while the UK health budget is $4,000 per citizen per year, in African countries it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c5d83d2-7595-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca\">averages $12</a>, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p> <p>In China and much of Europe, the coronavirus crisis precedes an economic crisis. But in many developing nations the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/pressure-grows-for-developing-world-debt-relief-over-coronavirus\">economic shock</a> has come first, as governments have locked down their economies to reduce the speed of contagion. As a result, countries in Africa and Latin America, together with Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, are expected to suffer their greatest ever economic decline. One immediate effect of the lockdown is hunger, as transport and distribution systems are severely disrupted and the food supply in many countries \u2013 already depleted after years of drought, extreme weather events and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/13/second-wave-of-locusts-in-east-africa-said-to-be-20-times-worse\">recent locust infestations</a> \u2013 becomes scarce.</p> <p>Then there is the question of how countries will cope with the coming medical emergency.<strong> </strong>In South Africa, for example, it is expected that the pandemic peak will only be reached <a href=\"https://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/sa-health-department-peak-coronavirus-lockdown/\">in September</a>, but incomes have already shrunk due to a lockdown that was announced before the UK\u2019s and is every bit as stringent as that in Italy. South Africa has mobilised domestically, working with civic organisations and businesses to create a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/south-africa-to-go-into-21-day-lockdown-on-thursday-night\">solidarity </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/south-africa-to-go-into-21-day-lockdown-on-thursday-night\">fund</a> to address the food and other needs of citizens, and reached out globally. However, even for one of Africa\u2019s richest countries, this may be inadequate to address the scale of the challenge.</p> <p>Many leaders are doing all they can under the circumstances, but both domestic and international action is required to limit the damage caused by Covid-19. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s evidence- and equity-based approach stands in stark contrast with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/lula-bolsonaro-brazil-to-slaughterhouse-covid-19-coronavirus\">Jair</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/lula-bolsonaro-brazil-to-slaughterhouse-covid-19-coronavirus\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/lula-bolsonaro-brazil-to-slaughterhouse-covid-19-coronavirus\">Bolsonaro\u2019s denialism</a> in Brazil, or Donald Trump\u2019s divisive actions in the US. But, while Covid-19 is a test of leadership everywhere, in countries with widespread and deep poverty where medical supplies are severely limited, even the best leaders cannot save their populations from health and economic vulnerabilities. Foreign assistance is essential.</p> <p>While rich countries can issue more debt in their own currencies, developing countries require foreign exchange to pay for much-needed imports, from lightbulbs to syringes. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/07/world-must-combat-looming-debt-meltdown-in-developing-countries-covid-19\">cost of foreign debt repayments</a> and imports have soared as the relative value of currencies in developing countries have declined by around 25%. Meanwhile, government revenues have plummeted due to a collapse in tax, tourism and migrant remittances as a result of the pandemic. Many<strong> </strong>cash-strapped governments can\u2019t adequately provide for their citizens\u2019 needs in normal times, let alone meet an unprecedented global emergency like this. The resulting cuts in other health areas, such as HIV therapies, and malaria- or cholera-eradication programmes, pose at least as big a risk to communities as Covid-19.</p> <p>International support has been lacking precisely when it is most needed. The US has turned its back on the world. The UK, like Europe, appears preoccupied with its own medical and economic emergencies; the ability of Commonwealth countries to cope with the pandemic appears to have fallen off its domestic agenda. Defeating Covid-19 and preventing future outbreaks around the world can only happen through cooperation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2020/apr/13/were-taking-matters-into-our-own-hands-bracing-for-impact-in-kenya\">Kenya is mobilising against coronavirus \u2013 but like the rest of Africa we need help | Kennedy Odede</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need a global Marshall plan that would write off the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-global-leaders-urge-g20-to-tackle-twin-health-and-economic-crises\">$44</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/coronavirus-global-leaders-urge-g20-to-tackle-twin-health-and-economic-crises\">bn in debt</a> due by African countries in 2020 (an amount that is tiny compared to the <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/04/04/bail-outs-are-inevitable-and-toxic\">$8tn</a> that US and European governments have committed to keeping their businesses alive), and give at least $2.5tn in aid to poor countries, with a single condition: that it is used to alleviate the impact of the pandemic and to write off significant amounts of debt.<strong> </strong>This support, equivalent to barely 3% of global income, is essential not only to prevent the derailing of agreed UN development and climate goals, but to ensure that Covid-19 is not allowed to continue to spread.</p> <p>If there is one lesson Covid-19 has taught us, it is how interconnected our lives are.

But this doesn\u2019t tell us much either. The US jobless claims are a genuine flash estimate: they provide information about what was happening last week, whereas the UK figure doesn\u2019t even give a full picture of what was happening last month.</p> <p>This is a point made by two labour market experts \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/recession-depression-data-coronavirus\">D</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/recession-depression-data-coronavirus\">avid Blanchflower</a> and David Bell \u2013 in a study due to be published by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research later this week. They estimate that the US unemployment rate will have risen almost five-fold in April to 20%. Given the paucity of data, all they can reliably say about the UK is that it has gone up a lot, but they have a stab at an estimate nevertheless.</p> <p>On the assumption that furloughed workers are in reality unemployed, Blanchflower and Bell predict unemployment in the UK will rise by 5 million to more than 6 million by the end of May. If they are right, this would give the UK a jobless rate similar to that of the US \u2013 about 20%.</p> <p>The government would argue that the whole idea of the furlough scheme is to ensure that the lockdown does not result in a massive increase in unemployment. But Blanchflower and Bell are right to say that furloughed workers are really an army of the hidden unemployed, and they will become a lot more visible if during the second half of this year, the government ends the wage subsidies but the economy does not snap back as quickly as ministers hope.</p> <h2>The wrong sort of cheap oil</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/oil-prices-fall-below-zero-coronavirus-barrels-crude\">Falling oil prices </a>are normally good for growth because cheaper crude means business costs come down and consumers have more disposable income.</p> <p>This time is different, not least because you can\u2019t take advantage of less expensive fuel if your business is shut down or your car is sitting on the drive for weeks on end.</p> <p>Oil prices are weak because the global economy is weak.

  "<p>The loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic is now very likely before 2050, new research shows, even if the carbon emissions driving the climate crisis are cut rapidly.</p> <p>The result has alarmed scientists but they said slashing greenhouse gases remained vital as this would determine whether Arctic summer ice vanished permanently or could recover over time. If emissions remain very high, there is a risk the Arctic could be ice-free even in the dark, cold winter months, a possibility described as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d.</p> <p>The last global scientific assessment of Arctic ice was in 2013. It predicted a complete loss of ice in the month of September, when it reaches its annual minimum, would occur only if CO2 emissions from human activities remained high. The new results are based on 40 of the latest computer models and is the best assessment to date of the fate of the Arctic ice.</p> <p>Since satellite records began in 1979, summer Arctic ice has lost 40% of its area and up to 70% of its volume, making it one of the clearest signs of human-caused global heating. In 2019, it shrank to its <a href=\"https://nsidc.org/news/newsroom/arctic-sea-ice-minimum-extent-2019\">second lowest extent</a> on record.</p> <p>The loss of the ice exposes the dark ocean, which absorbs more of the sun\u2019s heat and further ramps up temperatures. These changes are also being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/19/arctic-ice-melt-already-affecting-weather-patterns-where-you-live-right-now\">increasingly linked to more extreme weather</a> including severe winters, deadly summer heatwaves and torrential floods at lower latitudes such as in Europe and the US.</p> <p>\u201cAlarmingly the models repeatedly show the potential for ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean before 2050, almost irrespective of the measures taken to mitigate the effects of climate change,\u201d said Ed Blockley, who leads the UK Met Office\u2019s polar climate programme and was one of the team behind the new research. \u201cThe signal is there in all possible futures. This was unexpected and is extremely worrying.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Dirk Notz, at the University of Hamburg, Germany, coordinated the analysis and said: \u201cIf we keep global warming below 2C, Arctic sea ice will nevertheless likely disappear occasionally in summer even before 2050. This really surprised us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is the state-of-the-art in terms of sea ice simulations,\u201d said Till Wagner, of the University of North Carolina Wilmington, US, and not involved in the new study.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/04/a-third-of-himalayan-ice-cap-doomed-finds-shocking-report\">A third of Himalayan ice cap doomed, finds report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new research, <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL086749\">published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters</a>, uses the latest generation of climate models from 21 research institutes from around the world. In climate studies, the Arctic Ocean is said to be ice-free when it shrinks to fragments with a combined area below 1m sq km, which is 75% lower than in 2019.</p> <p>The models are not perfect and struggle to match closely the ice loss and global warming seen in historical data. \u201cThere is still a lot of uncertainty,\u201d Blockley said. \u201cBut all the models are clear that the sea ice will continue to decline. At some point, it will be gone, but when that happens is still uncertain.\u201d</p> <p>Sea ice also varies naturally from year to year, making it hard to predict the date of the first ice-free summer. \u201cThere are some models [in which the summer Arctic] goes ice-free in the next few years,\u201d said Blockley. But he cautioned that these are considered outliers and that climate scientists use the combined set of models to calculate the likelihood of events.</p> <p>Another surprising finding from the study is that an ice-free Arctic in the winter months appears possible if CO2 continues to be emitted at high levels. \u201cThat\u2019s not something we\u2019ve seen before in these projections,\u201d Blockley said. \u201cA winter ice-free event would be catastrophic, for some wildlife species [like polar bears] for example, that live and hunt around the sea ice.\u201d</p> <p>Wagner said the loss of Arctic sea ice could have far-reaching consequences, from increasing global heating to harming wildlife: \u201cIt also opens up a new ocean for human exploration, from oil and gas extraction, to increased shipping, to increased tourism, each with their own perils and benefits.\u201d</p> <p>Prof James Screen, at the University of Exeter, UK, said: \u201cIt is important to keep in mind that although we might see an ice-free Arctic in all scenarios by 2050, the expected frequency of ice-free summers differs between scenarios. Under a higher emissions scenarios there may be ice-free summers every year, but in lower emissions scenarios they might be occasional.\u201d</p> <p>Blockley said the new research showed cutting carbon emissions remained vital to prevent the worst impacts on the Arctic, adding: \u201cWe are showing there is still hope.\u201d</p>",

Now start a band.\u201d Forty-five miles away in Birmingham, GBH singer Colin Abrahall \u2013 still spiky-haired at 58 \u2013 saw the Ramones play at Birmingham\u2019s Top Rank and decided: \u201cThe day I leave school I\u2019m going to become a punk.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhoJj022nQk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZhoJj022nQk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Birmingham scene was centred around <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/sorry-state-black-sabbaths-birthplace-16464512\">the currently disused Crown pub</a> near New Street station, which had once hosted the first Black Sabbath gig but by the late 70s was a punk-rock hotbed where GBH played (initially as Charged GBH), rehearsed, and even built the stage. \u201cEveryone in there seemed to be in a band,\u201d says Abrahall, when we meet pre-coronavirus crisis in their Digbeth rehearsal room, surrounded by posters from 40 years of his band. Birmingham was erupting with chart-bound pop \u2013 Duran Duran, UB40 and Dexys Midnight Runners \u2013 but the punk scene was DIY.</p> <p>\u201cI bought a bass guitar off a kid at school for \u00a318,\u201d says the singer. \u201cOur first drum kit was an electric fire.\u201d Hair was spiked up with everything from \u201cVaseline to egg whites, which made your head stink, so I discovered soap. That was great unless it rained, in which case we\u2019d run around with Tesco bags on our heads.\u201d</p> <p>Unbeknown to either band, the man who would bring their music to the world was undergoing his own awakening in London. Mike Stone, pushing 30, wasn\u2019t exactly a punk rocker. The former mobile DJ was working for the fledgling Beggars Banquet label when chancing on the Lurkers (who he\u2019d subsequently manage, then sign to Clay) playing in a basement made him want to get involved. \u201cThey had the same energy and excitement as the Who,\u201d he says over a coffee in Stoke. \u201cI\u2019d watched the Who open-mouthed live in Leeds when I was 15. But music had become stagnant \u2013 punk was what was missing.\u201d</p> <p>Stone relocated to Stoke after meeting and marrying a woman who lived there. He started a shop, Mike Stone\u2019s Records, and a label called Clay Records at 26 Hope Street, funding the latter with \u00a31,000 from a relative and naming it after the city\u2019s potteries. Today, the site \u2013 now a disused fast-food joint awaiting demolition \u2013 looks lonely and unloved. Back then it was a dynamo of musical revolution, the wheels of which were initially set in motion by a 17-year-old girl.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d3de7788935cb37b7effbd03bfe4a82f8923dba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d3de7788935cb37b7effbd03bfe4a82f8923dba/0_0_726_1037/700.jpg\" alt=\"Tanya Rich on the day she met Discharge.\" width=\"700\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanya Rich on the day she met Discharge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Privately educated Tanya Rich, an unlikely rebel, had cut her hair and dyed it \u201call sorts of colours\u201d after hearing the Saints song (I\u2019m) Stranded. Punks in Stoke were rare enough; female ones nonexistent. \u201cAkko, the original Discharge drummer Anthony Axon, saw me and ran down the road to tell the boys, \u2018There\u2019s a female punk in Stoke!\u2019\u201d she says with a laugh, still blue-haired at 59. \u201cThey ran back and said, \u2018We\u2019re a band\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Rich dated Rainy, then became Discharge\u2019s manager, driving their success. \u201cPunk had all these female artists, from Siouxsie Sioux to Beki Bondage,\u201d she explains. \u201cFemale managers were unknown. But I had chutzpah. I got them gigs with the Clash, the Ruts and the Damned.\u201d Rich gave Stone a demo tape containing songs such as Acne. He remembers saying: \u201cYou sound like the Sex Pistols \u2013 what\u2019s the point? But then they came back with something else.\u201d</p> <p>As Tezz tells it, the classic Discharge sound resulted when roadie Kelvin \u201cCal\u201d Morris replaced him as vocalist, bringing growling, shouty vocals of the kind that are now standard in extreme metal. \u201cI switched to drums and did the [furiously fast] D-beat,\u201d Tezz says. \u201cThe band changed overnight.\u201d Stone saw the revamped band play live \u2013 a slab of raw meat hurled his way almost hit him. \u201cI think they were trying to impress me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut suddenly, Discharge sounded like a bulldozer. They made the Pistols sound like Take That.\u201d When Stone saw GBH supporting Discharge at the Victoria Hall in Hanley he thought: \u201cI\u2019ll sign them as well.\u201d</p> <p>GBH singer Abrahall\u2019s theory about why punk\u2019s second wave was much harder and faster is that \u201cthe audience had become the bands, but we didn\u2019t have the same musical skills [as the Clash et al], so we went 100mph\u201d. Tezz suggests that the growing metal element was because: \u201cwe all loved Mot\u00f6rhead, although punks wouldn\u2019t admit it\u201d.</p> <p>The intense music also mirrored its environment. \u201cPeople would either take photographs of us or want to fight us,\u201d Rich says, while Abrahall remembers \u201cbeing chased by bikers, skinheads, or straights \u2013 as we called normal people. Police vans would wait outside the Crown targeting punk rockers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe gigs were like wars,\u201d says Discharge\u2019s Tezz. \u201cViolence every night. People would think, \u2018What\u2019s this noise?\u2019 and throw shit at us. When we opened for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/feb/17/cult-heroes-charlie-harper-uk-subs-punk\">UK Subs</a> it turned into a massive battle.\u201d A wry laugh. \u201cWhen we started getting popular it thinned out the criminals.\u201d</p> <p>Abrahall wrote GBH\u2019s first song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPBiSOvGH_0\">Generals</a>, on hearing that the government were considering bringing back conscription. Discharge meanwhile sang about \u201cbeing shit on far too long\u201d (Decontrol) or the evil of warfare (Never Again). \u201cCal was into Crass and always had his head in pamphlets,\u201d Tezz explains. \u201cThat\u2019s where he got ideas from.\u201d They showed <a href=\"https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/films/1964to1979/filmpage_warnings.htm\">the nuclear survival film series Protect and Survive</a> at gigs, while scene character Biffo the Gasmask would \u201cdress up as a housemaid in a gas mask, vacuuming the stage\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"55dea65e14466479e8d7be22162b247678233991\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55dea65e14466479e8d7be22162b247678233991/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Stone, who ran Clay Records in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, outside his former shop in the city centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Stone, who ran Clay Records in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, outside his former shop in the city centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stone captured this creative explosion as label head and producer, despite knowing little about studios. \u201cBut I\u2019d watched Steve Lillywhite working with [mod band] the Merton Parkas,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn my naivety, I recorded Cal singing twice and layered one vocal over another. It sounded like a wall of sound. So I did the same with the guitars.\u201d</p> <p>For Discharge\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/Discharge-Realities-Of-War/release/380859\">Realities of War EP</a>, in 1980, Stone went to take a band shot at the back of 26 Hope Street. \u201cBut Cal didn\u2019t want his photo taken, so turned his back\u201d. The resulting closeup of Morris\u2019s studded leather jacket became \u201cthe most iconic sleeve I ever released\u201d. Stone drove a bootful of the EP to \u201csmirking distributors, who\u2019d go, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll take a few.\u2019 But then after John Peel played it on Radio 1 it was like a hurricane. Punks all over the country wanted the record, and thousands of them copied that leather jacket.\u201d</p> <p>Clay\u2019s roster weren\u2019t the only British hardcore punk bands. Other labels sprang up, notably No Future. In 1981, Edinburgh band The Exploited \u2013 who formed two years after Discharge \u2013 appeared on Top of the Pops. After the show, guitarist Big John Duncan says, \u201cwomen old enough to be our mums were coming up to us and being really nice, but the song Dead Cities captured a moment when cities were rioting\u201d. The BBC producers also wanted Discharge, but Morris turned them down. \u201cReal shame,\u201d sighs Tezz, drily. \u201cIt would have been nice for my mum.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k7Yb65cqrU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9k7Yb65cqrU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Nevertheless, Discharge\u2019s 1982 debut Hear Nothing, See Nothing, Say Nothing went Top 40, while GBH\u2019s City Baby Attacked By Rats reached No 17 on the charts. \u201cIn between a Jimi Hendrix collection and Paul McCartney,\u201d chuckles Stone. \u201cI thought, fuck me, I\u2019ve done it.\u201d Both bands enjoyed more success before the collapse of distributor Pinnacle in the mid-80s took the label down. \u201cI lost \u00a325,000,\u201d Stone says. \u201cIt wiped me out.\u201d</p> <p>GBH continue touring and recording, reaching a new audience after Slayer covered Sick Boy. Abrahall has spotted Travis Barker and Rita Ora wearing GBH T-shirts, and is grateful to Stone for \u201cgiving me a start, and a very happy life\u201d. Gizz Butt, former guitarist of English Dogs who began their career on Clay as hardcore punks, remembers the 1984 article hailing them as \u201cthe dawning of speedcore\u201d. Meanwhile, three-quarters of the classic-era Discharge lineup are together, and Metallica have been spotted at their gigs.</p> <p>Forty years on, Tezz is keen to credit Stone for \u201ctaking a chance, when other labels said we made noise, not music\u201d, although he struggles to comprehend the impact of a band he started after selling frozen fish to buy equipment. \u201cI can\u2019t listen to those bands and say, \u2018That\u2019s what we invented.\u2019 But I know we changed the direction of music.\u201d</p> <p>The man who made it possible still manages old signings Demon and recently did courier work. Sadly, Stone sold the rights to his catalogue when he was broke years ago, but is proud of what his label started. As he drops me off at Stoke station, he nods towards the statue of renowned potter Josiah Wedgwood and jokes: \u201cThere should be one of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Discharge\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/discharge/protest-and-survive-the-anthology\">Protest and Survive \u2013 The Anthology</a> is out on BMG. GBH are scheduled to play <a href=\"http://www.rebellionfestivals.com/\">Rebellion punk festival</a> in Blackpool, 6-9 August.</p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on 21 April 2020 to correct the origins of band The Exploited, who are from Edinburgh not Glasgow. An earlier version also wrongly described Sepultura as one of the \u201cbig four\u201d thrash metal bands, widely acknowledged as Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth.</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic may be prompting some anti-vaxxers to question their views, experts say, but others are doubling down \u2013 and vaccine hesitancy, amplified by some celebrities, could seriously undermine a future inoculation programme.</p> \n<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), <a href=\"https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/Novel_Coronavirus_Landscape_nCoV_11April2020.PDF?ua=1\">70 candidate coronavirus vaccines are being developed</a>, with three already in clinical evaluation. The world\u2019s small but vocal anti-vaccination community seems divided on how to respond.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe extremists, the belief-driven groups who reject vaccination on principle, whose aim is to disrupt and polarise, they\u2019re not changing, in fact they\u2019re capitalising,\u201d said Heidi Larson, director of the London-based Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP).</p> \n<p>Some high-profile personalities with big social media followings have also expressed scepticism. Novak Djokovic, the world No 1 tennis player, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/novak-djokovic-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-tennis\">suggested on Facebook</a> that his opposition to vaccines might prevent his return to the sport, saying he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine\u201d to travel.</p> \n<p>The outspoken British rapper M.I.A. also drew widespread criticism for tweeting: \u201cIf I have to choose the vaccine or chip I\u2019m gonna choose death\u201d, while the Australian actor Isabel Lucas was dropped as ambassador for a girls\u2019 charity after saying she did not \u201ctrust the path of vaccination\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse/status/1242788551563128833\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If I have to choose the vaccine or chip I'm gonna choose death - YALA</p>\u2014 M.I.A (@MIAuniverse) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse/status/1242788551563128833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 25, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>However, Larson said there was also evidence that people who were \u201cless sure for some reason, who maybe have issues with just one particular vaccine \u2013 the MMR jab for their children, for example \u2013 may behave differently in the context of this pandemic\u201d.</p> \n<p>The VCP has launched an 18-month study with local partners around the globe, conducting national polls and examining online conversations about the coronavirus to try to measure attitudes towards a future vaccine.</p> \n<p>Larson said that after analysing more than 3m social media posts a day between January and March, she was confident the vast majority of people were \u201ceager for a coronavirus vaccine, and as soon as possible\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49295d4f2df34a4f3b69ae42e6f1dcbc4a46d5f7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49295d4f2df34a4f3b69ae42e6f1dcbc4a46d5f7/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Novak Djokovic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">World no 1 Novak Djokovic said his opposition to vaccinations could prevent him from returning to tennis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon M Bruty/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There will, however, be resistance. The anti-vaccination movement has been growing globally in recent years, fuelled partly by a long-discredited paper by the disgraced British doctor Andrew Wakefield, who fraudulently claimed a link between the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism in children.</p> \n<p>According to the WHO, which identified \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d as one of the top 10 health threats to the world last year, depending on the disease between 75% and 95% of the population must be vaccinated to ensure herd immunity.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018/chapter-5-attitudes-vaccines\">2018 Wellcome Trust survey of attitudes to vaccines</a> globally found eight in 10 people (79%) somewhat or strongly agree vaccines are safe, while 7% somewhat or strongly disagree. Numbers vary around the world, with 72% in North America and 73% in northern Europe agreeing vaccines are safe, but only 59% in western Europe and 40% in eastern Europe.</p> \n<p>The scale and gravity of the global coronavirus crisis may, however, be eroding vaccine resistance. A recent VCP survey in the world\u2019s most immunisation-averse country, France, where 33% do not view vaccines as safe, found only 18% of respondents would refuse a coronavirus vaccine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A poll in the UK in mid-March found about 7% of people would reject a coronavirus vaccine, while a second survey in early April \u2013 by which time the Covid-19 death toll was beginning to rise fast \u2013 showed the percentage had dropped to 5%.</p> \n<p>In Russia \u2013 where according to the Wellcome Trust only 62% of people agree vaccines are effective \u2013 there are signs that concerns over the coronavirus crisis have caused conflict among anti-vaxxers and medical sceptics.</p> \n<p>The administrator of The Truth about Vaccines, one of the largest social media groups dedicated to the issue, expressed frustration about the lack of discipline among its 100,000 members.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou know what surprises me?\u201d the anonymous administrator posted. I\u2019m surprised by the reaction of vaccine opponents in this group. Many \u2026 believe there\u2019s a coronavirus epidemic in Russia. That people are sick and dying from coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Italy, Claudio Simion of the leading anti-vaxxer group Comilva said a vaccine was not the only solution and \u201cmay be a way to calm people\u201d, but added: \u201cWe are not hostile towards vaccines out of principle\u201d.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, however, the pandemic appears to have hardened anti-vaxxer attitudes. In the US, prominent figures in the movement have seized on Covid-19 to reinforce their arguments and push conspiracy theories.</p> \n<p>Del Bigtree, the producer of Vaxxed, the 2016 \u201cdocumentary\u201d written by Wakefield, has put together an hour-long presentation \u2013 still available on Facebook and YouTube \u2013 that argues that Covid-19 is a set-up by the pharmaceutical industry to enrich itself.</p> \n<p>Robert Kennedy Jr, the son of the assassinated Democratic leader, accused Bill Gates and top public health officials on Twitter of plotting to produce a vaccine with \u201cunique and frightening dangers\u201d.</p> \n<p>Scott Ratzan, of the City University of New York\u2019s school of public health, said he was alarmed by the results of a poll in New York City showing that only 53% of residents were sure to take a coronavirus vaccine and 29% would refuse.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat if large numbers of people decide not to vaccinate themselves or their children?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/this-staggering-number-of-new-yorkers-say-gov-cuomo-is-their-most-trusted-source-for-covid-19-news\">Ratzan said</a>. \u201cRight now, barely half of New Yorkers tell us they\u2019ll do that. If that is the case, we won\u2019t be able to protect our community against a new wave.\u201d</p> \n<p>Larson said the timing of the vaccine\u2019s release, forecast for some time in 2021, could be critical, with many likely to be deterred by any suggestion it might have had been rushed and not properly tested.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On balance, Larson said, she was not convinced the coronavirus would have a direct impact on anti-vaccination sentiment. But she did foresee a possible indirect impact, with coronavirus fears leading to the delay of measles vaccinations in 24 countries and their cancellation in 13 others, prompting concern from both the WHO and Unicef.</p> \n<p>If vaccine hesitance does decrease after the Covid-19 crisis, Larson said, it would likely be as a result of \u201coutbreaks of other diseases such as measles increasing because parents are afraid to take their infants to health centres during the pandemic\u201d.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Ed Pilkington, Andrew Roth and Angela Giuffrida</em></p>",

  "<p>If a shiver ran down your spine at the news that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/17/suppliers-ration-stocks-tinned-tomatoes-after-surge-demand\">supplies of tinned tomatoes are running low</a> because of coronavirus, you are not alone. They\u2019re the \u201cas long as I have that, I\u2019m OK\u201d ingredient for many home cooks. Yet pasta is just as possible, just as comforting, with a host of other dressings. Here are 10 of the best.</p> <h2><strong>Cream and lemon</strong></h2> <p>Food52 calls <a href=\"https://food52.com/recipes/69153-barbara-kafka-s-creamy-lemon-pasta\">Barbara Kafka\u2019s</a> creamy lemon pasta \u201cthe most luxurious-feeling dinner you can conjure from near-thin air\u201d. Combine the zest of two lemons with 230ml double cream (the key!), and salt and pepper to taste, and bring to the boil over a medium heat. Add drained noodles and the juice of those lemons (to taste, also) and stir to coat. More cracked pepper and you are sorted.</p> <p>(Serves two to four. All the recipes below serve four, where quantities of ingredients are specified.)</p> <h2><strong>Cheese and toasted nuts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"790f976f0a8009ce7f78f9e35ea42baf94d92905\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/790f976f0a8009ce7f78f9e35ea42baf94d92905/0_709_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lello Favuzzi\u2019s gnocchi with taleggio and roasted hazelnuts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lello Favuzzi\u2019s gnocchi with taleggio and roasted hazelnuts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ola O Smit/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lello Favuzzi makes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/14/pasta-recipes-pappardelle-wild-boar-ragu-pumpkin-lasagne-gnocchi-taleggio-bigoli-oxtail-tomato\">toasted hazelnut and taleggio sauce</a> for fresh gnocchi that could definitely be adapted to other fondue-style hard cheese and the nut of your choosing. Mix 100g roughly chopped cheese with 300ml whole milk, place in a bain-marie and stir to melt and combine. Add your cooked pasta and a big pinch of parmesan and stir to combine. Top with toasted roughly chopped nuts.</p> <h2><strong>Garlic and anchovy sauce with broccoli</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/30/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-sprouting-broccoli-tagliatelle\">Thomasina Miers</a> adds purple sprouting florets in the last minutes of her pasta cooking time, then dresses the lot with a sauce of two crushed garlic cloves, 300g creme fraiche, six anchovy fillets finely chopped, two egg yolks and 140g parmesan, simmered in a bain-marie for 15-20 minutes until thickened. Experiment with other cheeses, different cream and a variety of green veg.</p> <h2><strong>Sausage, mushroom and green olive</strong></h2> <p>I would happily replace the freshly made fettucine with which Anna Del Conte serves this in <a href=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/classic-food-of-northern-italy.html\">Classic Food of Northern Italy</a><em> </em>with whatever pasta I had in my cupboards. Soak 20g porcini in boiling water and leave for an hour, then drain, rinse, dry and chop, coarsely. Fry 225g pork sausage, cut into rounds, in olive oil. In a large frying pan, saute the porcini with 90g sliced brown mushrooms in some butter for five minutes; season to taste then stir in some chopped parsley, a little lemon zest and a crushed garlic clove. Cook for a minute or two, then add the sausage and a handful of large green olives (pitted and sliced). After a few more minutes, add the cooked pasta with two tablespoons each of olive oil and the pasta water. Give it another minute on the heat, then toss until glistening. </p> <h2><strong>Tuna, eggs and capers</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/14/10-best-pasta-sauce-recipes\">A winning combo </a>from Oretta Zanini De Vita and Maureen B Fant\u2019s Sauces &amp; Shapes: Pasta the Italian Way. Fry the tuna (tinned, in olive oil) with a chopped onion. Add some white wine, fish stock, lemon juice and roughly chopped capers. Cook until thickened, then toss with cooked pasta and stir in a mixture of milk and egg yolks. Finish with olive oil.</p> <h2><strong>Miso and mushrooms</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://food52.com/recipes/77676-miso-mushroom-pasta\">Yi Jun Loh uses a mix of shimeji, eryngii and oyster mushrooms</a>, saying others will work too in this beauty of a sauce with garlic, butter, red miso and cream. He tops the final dish with green onion and black pepper.</p> <h2><strong>Carbonara</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca3834c385e107c3e67665d75d48acb0b324e2a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca3834c385e107c3e67665d75d48acb0b324e2a0/0_0_2000_1331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russell Norman\u2019s carbonara.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russell Norman\u2019s carbonara.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You don\u2019t need cream for this, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/28/russell-norman-polpo-spaghetti-carbonara-recipe-taste-of-home\">according to the restaurateur Russell Norman</a>. While your spaghetti is cooking, saute some pancetta in olive oil until golden, then add your cooked pasta, stirring to coat. Remove the pan from the heat, add a well-beaten mix of egg yolks, grated parmesan, lots of black pepper and a little pasta cooking water and stir until glossy. Top with grated pecorino and more black pepper to serve.</p> <h2><strong>Avocado, basil and lemon</strong></h2> <p>I still love that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/14/10-best-pasta-sauce-recipes\">avocados can be used in place of cream</a>. Blend the scooped-out flesh of five avos with the juice of two lemons, two garlic cloves, 75ml olive oil and a whole lot of fresh basil until smooth. Season to taste and toss through your pasta, serving with grated parmesan.</p> <h2><strong>Caponata</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/21/pasta-sauce-recipes-felicity-cloake\">An Italian ratatouille of sorts</a>, but without the tomato: sweat one teaspoon of fennel seeds, two sliced garlic cloves, an onion and two sticks of celery, both diced, in four tablespoons of olive oil. Add one courgette and one aubergine, diced, and fry for five minutes, before stirring in one tablespoon of capers and a handful of chopped olives, with a pinch of sugar and three tablespoons of red wine vinegar. Turn the heat up a little for a minute, then reduce to simmer, adding the parsley and season to taste.</p> <h2><strong>Pesto</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a008d8a4fbddea2accd0c643c0eb282536b7e2a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a008d8a4fbddea2accd0c643c0eb282536b7e2a1/0_0_3872_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\u2019s pesto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake\u2019s pesto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Follow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/sep/02/how-to-make-perfect-pesto\">Felicity Cloake\u2019s lead</a> and learn how to make to the real deal (lightly crush two tablespoons of toasted pine nuts with a pinch of salt in a pestle and mortar, add 250g fresh basil leaves, a few at a time, and work quickly to bash into a thickish paste.

  "<p>How would you expect a trainee detective to describe herself? Perhaps not as \u201cpink and fluffy\u201d, but that\u2019s how Tariro Kufa, 29, sees herself. She concentrates on the softer sides of her personality and insists it\u2019s important to be true to yourself. She explains: \u201cPeople relate better to that than being something that you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>Kufa is almost six months into the two-year Police Now National Detective Programme. She used to be a social worker but was looking for a change. \u201cI enjoyed my previous job, but I was looking for something that was challenging, fast-paced and exciting. I still wanted to use the skills I\u2019d gained from my time as a social worker, like being a good communicator, empathetic and being resilient,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause Police Now looks for candidates who have never considered policing, I thought it\u2019d be a conducive environment for me to be able to learn something completely new.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s seven weeks into her practical training, after spending her first three months learning a combination of theory and practical delivery at the Police Now Detective Academy. But before she joins the detectives in the field, she will spend 10 weeks shadowing a police constable throughout their everyday activities.</p> <p>The day-to-day monotony of the nine-to-five doesn\u2019t seem to exist for Kufa, because \u201cno two days are the same\u201d. After attending a briefing and being given the duties for the day, she could be doing anything from interviewing suspects in custody, property searches, responding to reports of antisocial behaviour, responding to 999 calls, to patrolling her allocated \u201cbeat\u201d. She explains: \u201cOn our beat there\u2019s an area that is well known for drug dealing, so we\u2019ll go and patrol there. In this case, when there is drug paraphernalia around (needles, etc), being aware of officer personal safety is important.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6fdb2c0a6dfd60efea03892a224da95e5485969d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fdb2c0a6dfd60efea03892a224da95e5485969d/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Trainee detective Tariro Kufa\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve been out on the street and it\u2019s really good when I see girls like me waving at me. I hope I\u2019ve inspired that little girl to want to be a police officer one day.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Cherry/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part of her duties also includes taking victim statements. She explains that, as well as the functional side of recording the information, safeguarding vulnerable victims of crime is a key part of the role. Getting the opportunity to use her existing people skills but now combining that with being the reassuring police presence a victim needs, she can see how everyday duties like this go a long way in helping build public trust and confidence in the police.</p> <p>Over a 10-week period, she is assessed by her tutor constable with the aim of achieving her independent patrol status. Once she achieves this, she\u2019ll be allowed out on patrol on her own. This is also the key to progressing to the next stage of the programme: her time with the criminal investigation department (CID). \u201cWhen I land in CID, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll be in the company of a detective constable,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While getting to CID is the driver behind Kufa\u2019s career change, she appreciates the value of spending time with uniformed officers: \u201cI think training to be a police officer is very important, I can\u2019t fully grasp the detective part if I haven\u2019t done this \u2013 there would be a gap in my knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>One unexpected bonus of being in uniform happened when Kufa, who is black African, was spotted by some young girls: \u201cI\u2019ve been out on the street and it\u2019s really good when I see girls like me waving at me. I hope I\u2019ve inspired that little girl to want to be a police officer one day. It\u2019s something I never thought I\u2019d be able to do. But if I\u2019m inspiring young people, especially girls and boys like me, to join the police, then that\u2019s a good thing because it\u2019s important to have police who are more reflective of the community and can relate to a wide range of people and experiences.</p> <p>\u201cIf the police want to have good relations with the community, they need to be representative of those communities,\u201d she says. This was a key motivation for Kufa when joining the Police Now National Detective Programme.</p> <p>While she\u2019s only a quarter of the way through her training, she\u2019s proud of the contributions she\u2019s already made to investigations so early in her journey to becoming a detective. \u201cIt\u2019s a rewarding career,\u201d she says. \u201cJust arriving at a scene where there is havoc, your mere presence calms things down. For me, that\u2019s important, as I would like to foster good relations within the community. It feels really good when you make that difference.\u201d</p>",

Some of these solutions will have a lasting impact on the fight. Others, in many cases, are only delaying the inevitable. But in every situation, doing something is preferable to doing nothing at all.</p> <h2><strong>Sea level rise</strong></h2> <p><strong>The threat:</strong> By any estimation, Florida is drowning. In some scenarios, sea levels will rise <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article237997454.html\">up to 31in </a><a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article237997454.html\"> by 2060</a>, a devastating prediction for a region that already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/28/rising-elizabeth-rush-extract-towns-flooding\">deals regularly with tidal flooding</a> and where <a href=\"https://sealevelrise.org/states/florida/\">an estimated 120,000 properties</a> on or near the water are at risk. The pace of the rise is also hastening, scientists say \u2013 it took 31 years for the waters around Miami to rise by six inches, while the next six inches will take only 15 more. At such a rate, many of Miami Beach\u2019s landmarks, the world famous South Beach, and the picturesque art deco hotels of Ocean Drive, will be lost within three decades, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_87zfBFviQ\">according to some studies</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"795e5971d4f07623f4a9129e24f1e5394509853a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/795e5971d4f07623f4a9129e24f1e5394509853a/0_0_3000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A king tide in Hollywood, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A king tide in Hollywood, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anastasia Samoylova</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Possible solutions:</strong> Dozens of municipalities, the four counties of south-east Florida, and partner groups such as the <a href=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/florida/stories-in-florida/florida-climate-change-adaptation/\">Nature Conservancy</a> have combined their efforts through the <a href=\"https://southeastfloridaclimatecompact.org/about-us/what-is-the-rcap/\">south</a><a href=\"https://southeastfloridaclimatecompact.org/about-us/what-is-the-rcap/\">-east regional action climate plan</a> to tackle the crisis.

In the Florida Keys, the approach will probably tilt more towards <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/climate/florida-keys-climate-change.html\">managed retreat</a>: abandoning areas too expensive to maintain and focusing on measures with a better cost-benefit ratio. Parts of the Keys are going to simply disappear, <a href=\"https://www.winknews.com/2019/12/05/officials-could-let-roads-homes-in-florida-keys-be-swallowed-up-by-rising-sea/\">some within two decades</a>.</p> <p><strong>The cost</strong>: The participating counties and municipalities are contributing to a $4bn statewide spend, including Miami Beach\u2019s $400m <a href=\"https://www.miamigov.com/Government/Departments-Organizations/Office-of-Capital-Improvements-OCI/Miami-Forever-Bond\">Forever Bond</a>, a $1bn stormwater plan and $250m of improvements to Broward county\u2019s sewage systems to protect against flooding and seawater seepage.

  "<p>Back in the distant past when fans could watch live games, the 2019 NFL regular season ended with a flurry of dramatic moments.</p> <p>Green Bay mounted a comeback to clinch a first-round bye. Many of the other NFC playoff seedings were determined by a frenetic finish in Seattle. In the AFC, the mighty Patriots were denied a first-round bye when the Miami Dolphins came to town and pulled off the shocker of the season.</p> <p>And yet many eyes were looking at the bottom of the standings. No, the NFL hasn\u2019t suddenly instituted promotion and relegation, though the remaining fans of the dreadful Washington team may appreciate it at this point.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/isaiah-simmons-nfl-draft-football-clemson\">Is the positionless Isaiah Simmons a glimpse of the NFL's future?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For weeks, the focus was on draft position. Which team would be lined up to get LSU quarterback Joe Burrow, who opened the national college football playoffs by shredding Oklahoma\u2019s defense with seven touchdown passes in the first half? Or maybe Chase Young, the Ohio State pass rusher who is likely to give NFL quarterbacks nightmares for years to come?</p> <p>Draft position is, of course, decided by taking the inverse of the previous year\u2019s standings. If two teams have a 2-13 record entering the last week of the season, they have a vested interest in losing that last game. And that should change. It won\u2019t, because the current system is the product of decades of minor adjustments that were painstakingly negotiated between the league and the players union, but it should.</p> <p>Fortunately, not every team subscribes to the philosophy of \u201ctanking\u201d a season. The Dolphins had an atrocious start to the season but fought back down the stretch, dropping a few spots in the draft order in the process.</p> <p>The NBA and the NHL have addressed the tanking problem <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/nba-draft-lottery-explainer\">with a lottery system</a> in which the worst team in the league is not guaranteed the No1 pick. The annual drawing keeps teams from racing to the bottom, but it also introduces an element of random chance. The NFL can do better, using a mechanism that will look familiar to old-school fantasy sports players. Have an <a href=\"https://www.dummies.com/sports/fantasy-sports/fantasy-football/fantasy-football-auction-leagues-and-rules/\">auction draft</a>. </p> <p>Here\u2019s how it works in fantasy leagues: the first person to make a pick is simply putting up a name for bidding. Each fantasy player has a salary cap. If your cap is $200 and you spend $150 on Christian McCaffrey or Saquon Barkley, you\u2019re going to spend the rest of the draft figuring out which third-string tight end is worth $2.</p> <p>The NFL already has a salary cap, so the amount of money available for bidding can be determined rather easily. If a team cleared house, maybe it has $40m to bring to the table. If that team is weighed down after giving Kirk Cousins $84m over three years, it will watch a lot of draft targets go elsewhere.</p> <p>To keep things relatively simple, the NFL would have to institute a standard rookie contract with a set length, maybe three or four years with predetermined options and bonuses, so teams are bidding in a controlled environment. Whoever can offer the most money gets the player.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a free-agent frenzy that takes months to play out. The NFL can still stage an event that draws live crowds (once the pandemic is out the way) and TV viewers.</p> <p>Players and their agents will love it. As it stands now, NFL teams have all the leverage once a player is drafted. In the NBA or NHL, a player can always choose to go to Europe instead, as some National Women\u2019s Soccer League draftees have done in recent years. Many baseball players still have the option of going to college instead. Apart from a move to the relatively poorly paid Canadian Football League, an NFL player had nothing but the threat of holding out, eventually costing himself his rookie season, and that threat all but went away with the adoption of <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/agents-take-fixing-the-rookie-wage-scale-plus-a-look-at-its-history-and-how-it-works/\">the rookie wage scale</a>. Under this system, bidding would drive up top players\u2019 pay.</p> <p>Veteran players may be worried that a team will clean out their roster to have more money to spend at the draft. The league can guard against that problem by declaring a minimum number of players or a minimum amount of guaranteed money on the books on draft day.</p> <p>This system would keep intact the parity on which the NFL has always insisted, even if the Browns and Patriots have shown that parity mechanisms only go so far. A team\u2019s success will still be determined by how well they build a roster within a salary cap and how strong of a coaching staff they can assemble.</p> <p>As with any draft system, the league can always tinker. Maybe the teams that don\u2019t make the playoffs can get some cap relief. Maybe the first few picks can be restricted to the league\u2019s worst teams. Maybe the auction system could be used only for the first round or two, with the next few rounds proceeding in more traditional fashion.</p> <p>In any case, teams will no longer have any incentive to prefer a 2-14 season to a 5-11 season. And then the only \u201ctank\u201d we\u2019ll hear about is a 300lbs lineman who runs a 4.85 40-yard dash. </p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> has forced theatre-makers to change the ways in which they collaborate, with many starting to make work remotely. But Belarus Free Theatre\u2019s founders, Natalia Kaliada and Nikolai Khalezin, have had to work this way for years. Exiled from their home country for a decade, and living in London, their circumstances have obliged them to find creative new ways of continuing to make work. \u201cWe were one of the first theatre companies to use Skype,\u201d explained Khalezin when we spoke earlier this year, \u201cbut this was a necessary measure. In 2011, when we ended up here and our cast was back in Belarus, we still needed to make shows, so we started trying out different technologies.\u201d</p> <p>Their latest production is an adaptation of Alhierd Bacharevic\u2019s 2017 novel, Dogs of Europe, a 900-page dystopian political thriller with a section written in a language of Bacharevic\u2019s own design. It is considered one of the most important literary works ever published in Belarus. Kaliada and Khalezin, who are married, have been working with a composer in Toronto, one in Berlin and a video director in Kiev. From their kitchen in London, we watch a scene play out in a warehouse in Minsk, before Khalezin embarks on a discussion with one of the cast members about the feasibility of him running around the stage naked for the duration of the interval.</p> <p>In the last few weeks, BFT has doubled its activities. When the UK went into lockdown they instructed their company in Minsk to self-isolate, though there had been no official guidance in Belarus about doing so. They then set about creating <a href=\"http://belarusfreetheatre.com/15th/\">the Love Over Virus project</a>, an attempt during a time of fear to \u201clet people dream again\u201d. Actors will be reading fairytales they were told as children, or that they tell their children, with contributions from trustees and supporters, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/juliet-stevenson\">Juliet Stevenson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/samuel-west\">Samuel West</a>, as well as Kaliada\u2019s own actor father, Andrej. </p> <p>They are also resurrecting their Kitchen Revolution project, an online space for provocation, conversation and communal dining. A recipe is shared with participants, before they debate, among other things, how it is possible to survive our current situation, survival being an area in which the theatre-makers have considerable experience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94b7de5d1142f93eeca68d2e8bb62b8f8bf04338\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94b7de5d1142f93eeca68d2e8bb62b8f8bf04338/0_171_2346_1408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicolai Khalezin and Natalia Kaliada, founders of Barus Free Theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicolai Khalezin and Natalia Kaliada, the founders of Belarus Free Theatre, exiled in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniella Kaliada</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year marks the company\u2019s 15th<sup> </sup>anniversary. Over that time, through a combination of tirelessness and fearlessness, they\u2019ve found ways of continuing not only to exist but to flourish creatively in a repressive environment: operating underground, risking arrest and worse. Shows are performed in private, such as in homes, garages, street cafes and outside the city in the woods, with audience members informed of the location via social media. In 2016, to mark their 10th anniversary, they simulated the experience for London audiences, keeping the locations \u2013 including a former ambulance garage \u2013 secret, and communicating with audiences by text.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether it's a dictatorship or democracy, there is always a necessity for artistic provocation</p> <footer> <cite>Natalia Kaliada</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The company\u2019s work made them a target of the authorities in Belarus. In August 2007, the entire BFT company, as well as the audience, were detained before their performance of an Edward Bond play. Company members have lost state jobs and been beaten up. In 2011, while abroad, they discovered they would face imprisonment if they returned to their home country. Driven into exile, they sought asylum in the UK.</p> <p>They founded Belarus Free Theatre with the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/sep/20/british-theatre-finance-funding-grants\">Vladimir Shcherban</a> in 2005. Khalezin was already an established playwright but, even though his work was not explicitly political, it wasn\u2019t allowed on the stage in Belarus. So they set about creating their own theatre, with no building but a clear ideological purpose. By 2006, they were touring internationally. It soon became apparent to Kaliada that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter whether it is a dictatorship or democracy, there is always a necessity for artistic provocation in order to create public discussion, to make the audience think\u201d.</p> <p>In the Belarus Free Theatre model, art and activism are indivisible. Kaliada has proved adept at attracting high-profile patrons and supporters, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/stoppard\">Tom Stoppard</a>, in order to ensure the plight of her country and its citizens remains visible in the eyes of the west.</p> <p>Belarus is still somewhat simplistically described as \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictatorship\u201d, as if other countries weren\u2019t edging closer to that status. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alexander-lukashenko\">Alexander Lukashenko</a> has been in power since 1994, and his presidency has been characterised by a climate of extreme political repression, enforced disappearances, systematic harassment of activists and independent media, a woeful track record on the human rights of disabled people, the LGBT and Roma communities. Belarus is also the only European country that still has the death penalty. A journalist before he was a playwright, Khalezin edited three newspapers until, one by one, they were closed by the government.</p> <p>\u201cPutin has a programme for the resurrection of the empire,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a new ideology which other countries gladly accept. Not a dictatorship but a monarchy without the monarch. Can you imagine a president being in power for 25 years in a normal society? It\u2019s a new type of monarchy. This is what many democratic leaders want. Boris Johnson would give his left arm to rule the country in the same way.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past 15 years, the company have addressed many of the issues facing Belarus, including the position of LGBT and disabled people in society. Kaliada believes that theatre can help bring about change but says: \u201cI also don\u2019t believe it is possible to change something with one performance,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to work from the grassroots to the top and in all possible directions, to make all layers of society talk to each other.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61d4b9047c45bb5ef295e987ca2bfd91d47ddd4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61d4b9047c45bb5ef295e987ca2bfd91d47ddd4d/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dogs of Europe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A very powerful warning\u2019 \u2026 Dogs of Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kolya Kuprich</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The position of artists in Belarus is slowly changing, explains Khalezin. Having been prohibited for 15 years, BFT were recently invited to participate at a national showcase. In the end, they performed in a garage, as they have in the past, because they would otherwise have been required to get the minister of culture\u2019s approval for their work. \u201cIt\u2019s the illusion of freedom,\u201d says Khalezin. \u201cBut it\u2019s still better than the situation where every week you have police. We\u2019re in a stage neither of war nor peace.\u201d</p> <p>When I went to Minsk to see the premiere of Dogs of Europe in March, the location of the performance was leaked, but this didn\u2019t seem to deter or worry people overly. What was most palpable was the exhilaration people felt in seeing this book, which intertwines the country\u2019s history, present and future, brought vividly to life, in a production staged with a characteristic combination of intense physicality and striking visual imagery \u2013 most notably a sequence in which books burst into flame, words burning.</p> <p>Bacharevic\u2019s novel tells us, according to Khalezin, that \u201cin a dictatorship the authoritarian leader isn\u2019t guilty but all of us are\u201d. He regards it as \u201ca very powerful warning\u201d. He fears that the UK is in danger of heading in the same direction because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have enough strength to stop this process. There is not enough political will and not enough will in general.\u201d</p> <p>Over the last 10 years, Kaliada has seen the erosion in the UK of many human rights, freedoms of expression and internationalism, and she feels that they arrived here at the \u201clast moment when it was possible to touch what freedom is\u201d. Their work has often ended up feeling predictive, she says, citing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jun/23/belarus-free-theatre-red-forest-review-young-vic-lift\">Red Forest</a>, their 2014 play about the global toll of environmental catastrophe that predated the refugee crisis. \u201cThe majority of critics in London said you don\u2019t understand anything, it won\u2019t happen here. But we spent time in a refugee camp talking to refugees about what was happening, and it was so clear to us.\u201d</p> <p>Dogs of Europe was supposed to play at the Barbican in London in May but the performance has been cancelled because of the lockdown. In Belarus, very little has been cancelled. Lukashenko <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2020/mar/29/there-are-no-viruses-here-belarus-president-plays-ice-hockey-amid-covid-19-pandemic-video\">has been dismissive</a> of what he calls \u201ccoronavirus psychosis\u201d, claiming the world has gone mad. The western coverage has chiefly focused on his statements about combating the virus with vodka and saunas, often treating it like a joke, seemingly oblivious to the fact that people will die as a result. While mass gatherings are banned in most countries, Lukashenko is building a 9,000-seat arena for a military parade due to take place in May. The KGB have been tasked with tracking down those \u201cspreading disinformation\u201d. </p> <p>There\u2019s a dangerous tendency, Kaliada says, for the west to dismiss Lukashenko as a \u201cpolitical clown\u201d. The west does not understand what it is like to live in a dictatorship, she says. \u201cThis is a major threat to the population. He\u2019s using the same methods used during the time of Chernobyl. Mass disinformation. This is another way to kill his people.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.belarusfreetheatre.com/\">Belarus Free Theatre</a> is making its archive available online each weekend for the next three months via <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/BelarusFreeTheatre\">its YouTube channel</a>.</p>",
  "<p>That coronavirus is colour blind and respects no borders is true enough, although far from being the great equaliser, <a href=\"https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2020/04/social-borders\">it forces the poor to bear the brunt</a>. And given the prominent role played by experts in epidemiology who speak in a universalising language of objective science and mathematical curves, attempts at containing or mitigating the spread of Covid-19 sound similar around the world.</p> <p>Yet the responses differ significantly from country to country, even among richer countries; shaped by historical legacies, political culture and social mores. The Swedish historian Sverker S\u00f6rlin, himself a Covid-19 survivor, <a href=\"https://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/sverker-sorlin-vi-forsoker-gemensamt-finna-en-vag-dar-en-vag-aldrig-funnits/\">noted in a recent article</a> that there was never just one global pandemic but many, each shaped by its own national logic. S\u00f6rlin was building on <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-H-McNeill\">William H McNeill</a> and his classic <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/112492/plagues-and-peoples-by-william-h-mcneill/\">Plagues and Peoples</a><em> </em>from 1976, in which McNeill tried to show that epidemics mirrored each affected society. There is not a universal biological enemy waging war, these global viruses strike societies, as much as the individuals within them.</p> <p>Indeed, the pandemic constitutes a huge stress test for countries, a test that brings to the surface their deep, sticky societal structures. Values, institutions and practices, that in ordinary times are partially hidden by global fashions and trends, come to the fore, protruding as safe rocks in a stormy sea.</p> <p>For us \u2013 a repatriated Swede who spent 40 years living abroad, and a self-exiled Turk who has lived in Sweden but is now based in Spain \u2013 cultural collisions are a touchstone of our efforts to understand both global commonality and national difference.</p> <p>We\u2019ve always had our differences, but with coronavirus, we\u2019ve also found ourselves subject to very different European pandemic regimes.</p> <p>Spain, one of the worst affected countries in Europe, imposed a strict lockdown to slow the spread of the virus and ease the burden on already overcrowded hospitals. Confinement was not a matter of personal choice; social distancing became the law of the land and a matter of surveillance and policing.</p> <p>Sweden opted for a calmer \u2013 and highly controversial \u2013 approach led by the state epidemiologist, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-19/sweden-says-controversial-covid-19-strategy-is-proving-effective\">Anders Tegnell</a>. Instead of draconian lockdown, social distancing is a matter of self-regulation. Citizens were instructed to use their judgment, and to take individual responsibility within a framework that rested on mutual trust, rather than top-down control.</p> <p>We were both convinced that the \u201cSwedish model\u201d could not be exported to countries such as Spain or Turkey, where levels of social and institutional trust are much lower. But could it work in Sweden itself? And why did Sweden choose to stray from the path followed by the many, including its Nordic neighbours? Here, our views diverged.</p> <p>The itinerant Turk (also a Swedish citizen) was convinced that Tegnell\u2019s approach was far too lax \u2013 considering the health risks involved \u2013 even for high-trust Sweden, where personal independence, including among the elderly, is cherished. In any case, lockdown was not only a matter of saving lives, but also mitigating the workload of overcrowded hospitals. The repatriated Swede, on the other hand, believed that an all-out war to save individual lives involved huge costs to the social fabric \u2013 beyond the health versus economy debate. So we decided to shift our attention to the societal consequences of different paths chosen.</p> <p>For Sweden, a total lockdown was unsustainable in the long term. If schools and pre-schools were closed, for instance, parents would have to leave work to home-school. This would potentially make matters worse by removing workers in critical sectors such as healthcare, or exposing grandparents to the disease, not to mention depriving children of crucial time in school.</p> <p>In a society where gender equality and children\u2019s rights are paramount, these risks understandably touched a raw nerve. Lockdown might work for the middle and upper classes with comfortable houses, especially in societies with more traditional gender norms. In Sweden, schools are key institutions not least for disadvantaged children, and single and/or low-earning parents.</p> <p>This raises the question of whether policy choices across the world are made on strictly rational, scientific grounds, or <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/can-europe-make-it/coronationalism/\">if they reflect culturally rooted constraints and possibilities</a>. Take social distancing: it now appears to be an internationally shared goal. The crucial choice is between achieving it through commands backed up by threats of fines and arrests, or though recommendations that appeal to a sense of a shared individual responsibility.</p> <p>In Sweden, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/24/sweden-coronavirus-open-for-business/\">the path chosen may be less draconian</a> but it is possibly more demanding, since it shifts the burden from laws and policing to self-regulation. While social media memes at times suggest an endless after-ski party afoot in the hipster joints of Stockholm, for those of us who live here the reality is a more sombre balance between distancing and the remaining freedoms to move about and carry on a normal life, while supporting local businesses.</p> <p>And to be sure, even in Sweden there are many who call for a more radical closure of society. It may yet come to that. But others continue to plead for continued calm, reminding us that the word for society in Sweden is <em>samh\u00e4lle</em>, to hold together. They worry that the stricter measures entail the privatising of suffering by justifying social closure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">Anger in Sweden as elderly pay price for coronavirus strategy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Swedish experiment, however, clearly touches a raw nerve abroad. The choice though is not simply between individual freedom and authoritarian rule. In Spain, lockdown measures also enjoy broad popular support, and security forces spend more time organising <a href=\"https://videos.elmundo.es/v/0_uiqicjxk-la-guardia-civil-le-lleva-una-tarta-a-nieves-por-su-90-cumpleanos?count=0\">ad hoc birthday parties</a> for the elderly than issuing fines. But there too, voices of dissent are raised as the societal consequences of the confinement become clearer. \u201cFree our children!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ada.colau/\">said Ada Colau</a>, the leftwing mayor of Barcelona, in a Facebook post on 15 April, paradoxically just before the Madrid government declared that schools would <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-04-17/government-advisors-support-reopening-spanish-schools-in-september.html\">not be reopened</a> this term.</p> <p>There is no doubt that what we will see \u2013 globally, in the wake of the coronavirus crisis \u2013 is the return of the state. The question is what state.</p> <p>For the likes of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who are busy exploiting the pandemic to further cement their authoritarian rule, the answer is clear: less liberalism and less democracy. But both the Swedish and Spanish examples show us, in their own way, that another answer is possible: the rollback of neoliberal democracy and the return of the social democratic welfare state.</p> <p>And here we agree with S\u00f6rlin. It is wise to respect citizens as responsible, ethical beings, equal in their contributions. This may, in fact, be the best way to develop the reciprocity that is the hallmark of a high-trust society: mutual trust between citizens, and between the citizens and the state.</p> <p>\u2022 Lars Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh is a professor of history and civil society studies at Ersta Sk\u00f6ndal University College in Stockholm, Sweden. <a href=\"https://likesonlikefather.com/\">Umut \u00d6zk\u0131r\u0131ml\u0131</a> is a visiting professor at IBEI (Institut Barcelona d\u2019Estudis Internacionals) and Blanquerna - Universitat Ramon Llull, and senior research associate at CIDOB (Barcelona Centre for International Affairs).

So this has to be the time, at last, for the UK to put vocational courses and qualifications centre stage. That means recognising them for what they are, not chasing the chimera of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jan/21/snobbery-vocational-academic-education-opportunities-children\">parity of esteem</a> with academic ones, as in the past.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/12/t-levels-vocational-qualifications-forgotten-delayed\">T-levels: The latest in a series of quickly forgotten vocational qualifications | Fiona Millar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We don\u2019t need only doctors, lawyers, civil servants, accountants and money analysts.

There are concerns about the number of hours students will need to clock up, and whether the extra funding will cover the cost. There are also fears the government will switch funds away from the well-established <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/26/dear-damian-hinds-killing-off-btecs-wont-get-it-right-for-young-people\">BTec</a> qualification, with its emphasis on practical skills assessed in the workplace.</p> <p>But if T-levels fail like their many predecessors \u2013 TVEIs, CPVEs, NVQs and GNVQs \u2013 it won\u2019t be entirely the government\u2019s fault. A serious barrier to their success is public perception. According to an <a href=\"https://www.nfer.ac.uk/t-levels-research-study-how-are-providers-preparing-for-delivery/\">study</a> by the National Foundation for Educational research last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/10/t-level-courses-may-not-be-ready-by-2020-warns-education-union\">parents</a> are hanging on to the idea that the academic A-level is the gold standard against which everything else turns to putty.</p> <p>It is wrong and it is dangerous, even more so as we start to rebuild a post-coronavirus world. Exam boards are going to save a lot of money this year with teachers doing the bulk of their work for them. Perhaps they could spend the savings on promoting vocational qualifications. Unless someone does, the UK will limp on, clinging to the belief that a person who can do, invent, make and care for others is somehow inferior to a clever thinker. The pandemic has proved that entirely wrong.</p>",

  "<h2>Top story: \u2018Attack from the Invisible Enemy\u2019</h2> \n<p>Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray presenting the stories to get up with this morning.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has announced he will sign an executive order <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/trump-says-he-will-impose-immigration-ban-in-bid-to-tackle-coronavirus\">\u201ctemporarily\u201d banning immigration into the US</a> because of the \u201cattack from the Invisible Enemy\u201d, meaning the coronavirus pandemic. David Smith, the Guardian\u2019s bureau chief in Washington, writes that nearly all visa processing by the state department has been on hold anyway, including immigrant visas, with asylum claims in effect suspended and thousands swiftly returned to Mexico without due process. The Democratic congressman Don Beyer wrote: \u201cFrom the beginning Trump has flailed about seeking someone to blame for his own failure \u2026 Immigration has nearly stopped and the US has far more cases than any other country. This is just xenophobic scapegoating.\u201d</p> \n<p>After US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund\">oil prices dipped below zero</a> for the first time on record, Trump played it down as only \u201cshort term\u201d. US oil prices have started to recover after oil producers ran out of space to store the oversupply of crude sparked by the virus crisis.</p> \n<p>Singapore has reported a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/singapore-coronavirus-outbreak-surges-with-3000-new-cases-in-three-days\">record 1,426 new coronavirus cases</a>, mostly among foreign workers, pushing its total number of confirmed infections to 8,014. This represents the highest number of cases in south-east Asia. Hong Kong has announced an extension of the city\u2019s social distancing measures for another 14 days \u2013 its chief executive, Carrie Lam, said \u201cnow is not the time to let down our guard\u201d.

But other ministers appear to have taken on board the latest evidence from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/advisers-warn-over-coronavirus-lockdown-relaxation-amid-cabinet-split\">any relaxation of lockdown measures could trigger an exponential rise in cases</a>.

Kim\u2019s health had deteriorated in recent months due to heavy smoking, obesity and overwork, said the Daily NK website, which is run mostly by escapees from North Korea.

  "<p>A few weeks ago, on a day that was probably like today now that the days are all frighteningly different and yet strangely the same, Disney launched Disney+, its new streaming service, in the UK. The precise date, for those that are still tracking such things, was 24 March, which was also, by coincidence, the date the British lockdown officially started. I had been waiting, impatiently, for both. One felt frivolous, the other historic \u2013 a new thing to watch to add to the endless other things to watch versus the sudden transformation of an entire population\u2019s way of life \u2013 and yet here they were entwined, perfectly compatible bedfellows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/08/feasting-on-fantasy-my-month-of-extreme-immersion-in-disney-plus-podcast\">\u2018Feasting on fantasy\u2019: my month of extreme immersion in Disney Plus \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Disney couldn\u2019t have known that the launch of Disney+ would fall upon the same day that 66 million people would be instructed to stay at home for 23 hours a day. They must have set their launch date months ago, long before the first coronavirus case hit Britain, or travellers returned from their fateful half-term Italian skiing holidays, or the prime minister glad-handed his way around a hospital. But to the cynical, it felt like the workings of a darkly prescient marketing strategy. I mean, the timing was <em>ideal</em>. Someone, somewhere in the Disney multiverse must have celebrated \u2013 shyly, inappropriately, a quiet elbow bump in a meeting room, perhaps.</p> <p>For anyone with a thing for family-friendly entertainment, the prospect of Disney+ was inviting. But for those of us coming to terms with home schooling and Easter \u201cholidays\u201d, followed by yet more home schooling, days upon weeks upon days of <em>time</em> \u2013 and not the kind of time you can revel in, but time that would be filled with fear for the wellbeing of people you love, and panic at the conundrum of trying to earn a living and look after your kids \u2013 well for us, the launch of Disney+ was a goddamn digital miracle.</p> <p>Maybe it didn\u2019t feel like that for everyone. Maybe the parents who secretly love the home schooling vibe, the timetables and worksheets, the children sitting happily at kitchen tables, tongues sticking out of the side of their mouths as they complete little astronomy quizzes while the parent stirs a healthy stew, maybe they didn\u2019t sign up for Disney+ a full week before it launched. For the rest of us, hurling fish fingers into the oven with one hand while trying to tap out a piece of work with the other and break up a fight with a toe, the relatively low cost of a Disney+ subscription (\u00a35.99 a month) when contemplating the long, long, just so very <em>long,</em> period of time ahead of us, felt like a sensible investment.</p> <p>Sure, there\u2019s other TV. There\u2019s the BBC. There\u2019s Netflix. I dabble in it all, unfussy when it comes to shiny, child-absorbing entertainment. But Disney+ is a luxury bath of content, of Disney old and new. When you log on to its sleek black home page, it shows off its wares so easily: thumbnails of Toy Story 4 and the new Star Wars spin-off series, The Mandalorian<em>,</em> casually sitting next to each other like reunited friends from different planets. The animated classics are all there \u2013 Cinderella, The Lion King, Aladdin \u2013 accompanied by their \u201creimagined\u201d live-action versions, updated and often unambiguously ruined. But there are also hidden treats, movies you\u2019d forgotten exist but sentimentally love more than members of your family (Cool Runnings). There\u2019s an entire section devoted to nostalgia. Three Men and A Little Lady? Yes, please. Nestling among it all is almost the entire back catalogue of The Simpsons, more than 600 episodes, patiently waiting to swallow the rest of your life.</p> <p>Some early adopters have quibbled that once you get past The Mandalorian and a few other new offerings (Meghan Markle narrating the nausea-inducing nature \u201cdocumentary\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/30/elephant-review-meghan-markle-adds-schmaltz-to-disney-yarn\" title=\"\">Elephant</a><em>,</em> anyone?), there\u2019s not much to go on, but perhaps they don\u2019t have kids happy to watch the same movie until they can recite it by heart. At some point, my husband put on the 2008 movie Bolt, about a run-of-the-mill little white dog, voiced by John Travolta, who is under the false impression that he is a superhero. A bulletproof concept, and sure enough, the movie went down so well that my kids, aged six and three, requested to rewatch it the moment the credits rolled. Forget awards, forget reviews: there is no better compliment a movie can receive than the immediate need a child can feel to watch it again. I remember that feeling. We wallpaper our souls with this stuff.</p> <p>Disney has been colonising the minds and hearts of children for decades. Wade through Disney+ as an adult and you find that, inevitably, some of the movies aren\u2019t as flawless as you recall, but you also find yourself blinking rapidly, at the mercy of a cinematic formula that knows the synaptic shortcut to both your childhood memories and your tear ducts. The nostalgia section \u2013 delivered at a time when reality can be hard to stomach and worries rise at unexpected times of the night \u2013 has the calming effect of one of those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/mar/10/feel-better-now-the-rise-and-rise-of-the-anxiety-economy\" title=\"\">weighted anxiety blankets</a>. When the outside world has shut down, you can burrow inwards and time travel through whatever anachronistic creation \u2013 Hannah Montana, Boy Meets World, DuckTales \u2013 transports you to your younger self, when you watched TV on a sofa you didn\u2019t have to buy with your own money, and someone else was doing most of the worrying so you could eat toast and think only about what you might eat after the toast.</p> <p>So yes, I admit it. I subscribed to Disney+ on the pretext of occupying my kids, but of course \u2013 of <em>course</em> \u2013 I actually bought it for myself.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>We began our Disney+ immersion, out of respect, with the canon. It happened to be the week my husband had the virus mildly, days he spent mostly unconscious except when he rose from his sweat pool to recount the plotlines of his hallucinatory nightmares. With a cursory nod to the abandoned ideals of home schooling, I decided to embrace Disney+ with a certain academic rigour. We started at the beginning, and worked our way through Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Pinocchio (1940), before making a leap forward to Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1953) and Sleeping Beauty (1959). Not all on the same day, I should add, but I\u2019m not going to lie: the viewing schedule was intense.</p> <p>In many ways, this part felt like duty: ticking off the fundamentals before we could get on to the good stuff. In the early movies, the animators are so deferential to their source material that the \u201caction\u201d starts with an ancient book of the tale being opened, its pages of gothic script and hand-drawn pictures very slowly turned, as a sonorous male voice earnestly narrates the story. \u201cCome ON,\u201d my six-year-old yelled at the television, used to a more intense fix of cortisol to propel her through her entertainment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"587935125848ea639677fcd47031c3d0047572df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/587935125848ea639677fcd47031c3d0047572df/0_0_1816_2775/654.jpg\" alt=\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, from 1937.\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, from 1937.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cinetext/Disney/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The animation itself is disconcertingly 2D, but from the off, you can\u2019t help credit Disney with its sheer devotion to its own shtick. Snow White might be almost featureless in her aesthetic simplicity, like a particularly extreme Botox victim, but that winning alchemy of cute animal friends and tuneful songs, adorable eyes and tightly waisted dresses, is all there in 1937 just as it\u2019s there, still, in Frozen 2, 82 years later. There are some formulas so reliable that nothing needs to change, except the sheer variety of associated merchandise.</p> <p>Inevitably, there are some jarringly anachronistic moments. Many of the early films have a warning at the start that they contain images of smoking. (In one comic set piece in Pinocchio, a cute fish blows thick grey smoke rings out of its bowl, an image that really wouldn\u2019t fly nowadays.) The age of Disney\u2019s heroines being symbols of women\u2019s empowerment is still some way off \u2013 many of the early female leads share a kind of saccharine fragility that would make Moana scoff from her one-woman sailing mission. And there are episodes of flat-out racism, too. Peter Pan, for example, has a physically-painful-to-watch number about Native Americans, called What Made The Red Man Red. Disney has added a euphemistic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/14/disney-attaches-warnings-of-outdated-cultural-depictions-to-classic-films\" title=\"\">disclaimer</a> to Peter Pan and other movies containing similar disasters: \u201cThis program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.\u201d The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/19/song-of-the-south-the-difficult-legacy-of-disneys-most-shocking-movie\" title=\"\">most egregious example</a> of all \u2013 Song of the South, from 1946, set on an uncritically idealised plantation and ridden with stereotypes \u2013 has been kept off the service altogether.</p> <p>Aside from their missteps, the early movies contain moments that ring oddly true in a pandemic. While my kids protested at the lethargic pace of Alice in Wonderland, I found myself absurdly over-identifying with her Wonderland experience, a place where things seem superficially familiar but are fundamentally altered. Near the end, Alice reaches a door through which she can see herself sleeping: \u201cBut that\u2019s me! I\u2019m asleep! Alice, wake up! Please wake up, Alice!\u201d Who <em>hasn\u2019t</em> felt like that, these past weeks? Not just the whole living-nightmare scenario, but that particular dissociation of constantly seeing yourself in the corner of a laptop screen while you try and listen to someone else talk. Wake up, I want to say to myself. Stop looking at yourself! Wake up!</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Enough cartoons: we were ready for real people. One eternal Saturday, though it could have been a Sunday or a Tuesday, or any of the other \u201cdays\u201d, I decided it was time. The kids had ravaged their way semi-dismissively through the old animations and plenty of the new ones were already as familiar to them as their own beating hearts: no one in this flat needs to watch Frozen again. At this point, Bolt was already on its fourth viewing, and had infiltrated many aspects of our lives. Our football had been renamed after the deluded dog and, like Wilson in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jan/12/culture.reviews\" title=\"\">Cast Away</a>, become our beloved inanimate pet. In a distinct bid for freedom from each other and their parents, the kids had built their own cushion-walled enclaves at opposite ends of our flat, both of which were guarded by soft-toy dogs, also called Bolt. Before Bolt became the only name my son would answer to, I decided it was time to move my offspring forward in their cultural education, to expose them to one of the great artefacts of the late 80s, to a piece of cinema that will stand the test not just of its time, but all time. It was time to watch Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.</p> <p>Jesus, the opening shot. A mailman delivers letters down an anytown residential street, and it is the fantasy version of American suburbia in its absolute blue-skied, big-shirted, ice-cream-sundae heyday. I can\u2019t tell you how much, aged 12, I wanted to live in one of these clapboard houses, with a white picket fence and grass on either side of the sidewalk, with kids on bikes in the middle of the street and mailboxes at the end of the front path. I think I still do. In Honey, there are so many period-specific elements that seem designed to spark joy: a woozy saxophone soundtrack, those round foamy headphones, one of those long spiral cords from a phone attached to the kitchen wall in which characters get tangled, baseball caps and lumberjack shirts, collared sweaters with the collars up. For the kids, it was like watching a movie about the Victorians: the funny costumes! The funny cars! But for me, it was like falling back in love with someone I\u2019d forgotten existed. I went deep, losing myself not just in reminiscence or a fresh appreciation of superlative film-making, but in the movie\u2019s surprising thematic relevance to our current state. (Apologies in advance.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c65e69897e43469f4cc04d8a4c61e66fc546caaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c65e69897e43469f4cc04d8a4c61e66fc546caaa/0_0_2864_1719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Honey I Shrunk The Kids, from 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honey I Shrunk The Kids, from 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the unfortunate minority unfamiliar with the plot of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids \u2013 well, it\u2019s all in the title, my friends. The cast includes a wacky scientist dad (an irrepressible Rick Moranis as Wayne Szalinski), a long-suffering mum, two kids, the neighbours and their two kids, and a crucial dog called Quark. When Szalinski is out one day, all four kids are accidentally shrunk by his shrinking machine in the attic. When I say shrunk, I mean <em>shrunk</em>. They\u2019re tiny. Significantly smaller than Lego men. Smaller than ants. At some point they actually encounter an ant and it appears elephantine. Later, they ride it. Crucially, no one can hear them \u2013 their parents think their kids have gone missing and call the police. There\u2019s a tragic moment when Szalinski comes home from the shops, can\u2019t hear them screaming at him in the attic, and then smashes up the shrinking machine on which he believes he\u2019s wasted years of his life. As the screws start to fall, not only is he destroying a miracle machine that we now know works \u2013 the dramatic irony! \u2013 but he\u2019s endangering four children\u2019s lives as debris rains down on their heads. He then unknowingly sweeps them up and dumps them in a rubbish bag at the end of the garden.</p> <p>So begins this particular Odyssey. Honey is a classic journey movie: but instead of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/04/the-revenant-review-gut-churningly-brutal-beautiful-storytelling\" title=\"\">Revenant</a>-ing across wilderness, or 1917-ing through the trenches, the kids have to traverse a back garden to get home. Don\u2019t, for a <em>second</em>, doubt the scale of this challenge. When they rip open the rubbish bag and look at the jungle of grass they have to cross, it is a shattering sight. Much of the threat relies on the excellent effects. A butterfly flies overhead, and its wings beat and throb like a military helicopter. A monstrous dead beetle floats down a trickle of dirty water that resembles the Amazon. There\u2019s a swarm of bees: pure horror.</p> <p>To cut a predictable story short, they make it, only for one of them to end up on Szalinski\u2019s spoon and almost get eaten with a mouthful of Cheerios. But eventually they are restored to normal size and all ends well. As with any good Disney film, all sorts of lessons have been learned along the way, such as teamwork, taking care of siblings, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and not having to be manly in the traditional sense. Disney dishes up its little morals so expertly, with a wink and joke, that we just drink them down like milkshake.</p> <p>As with everything, I struggled to rewatch Honey without making questionable comparisons to our current situation. Not to get excessively earnest about a movie charting the unique risks involved in constructing a machine that can without your knowledge reduce your children to the size of breadcrumbs, but it was striking how ultra-vulnerable these kids suddenly were, cowed by forces in nature far greater than them. Being human wasn\u2019t a power any more, it was a weakness. On this scale, an ant can have dominion. Of course, the kids befriend the ant, grow to love and respect it, and when the ant has a fight with a giant beetle and dies defending the kids from its attack, the bully kid breaks down in tears. Lessons learned: the bully was dependent on a fellow creature he\u2019d barely noticed before, and might even have stamped on. The very creature who protected him was the one to lose its life in the process. We have to look after each other to survive. We all lose creatures we love.</p> <p>Proudest parenting moment of lockdown so far? When the six-year-old requested to watch Honey, I Shrunk the Kids for a second time. If that is the peak of my home schooling efforts, which it undoubtedly is, I\u2019ll take it. As for this great parable for our age, well, a reboot is in the works \u2013 according to the film site IMDb, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11399224/\" title=\"\">Shrunk</a> is a thing. Who knows if it will happen, given that Disney has had to halt production on possibly higher-priority projects such as a live-action Little Mermaid and four Avatar sequels. But I have faith. By the time Shrunk gets made, we\u2019ll probably have rushed back to our old habits and humanity will be cruising to oblivion again. Or maybe Shrunk will appear just in time to remind us of our essential vulnerability and human co-dependency. It\u2019s possible, I realise, that I\u2019m overstating the future power of Shrunk, but you never know.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Deep in the bowels of Disney+, a clutch of self-serving documentaries reveal how drunk the company has become on its own myth over the years. The Imagineering Story (first episode: \u201cThe Happiest Place on Earth\u201d) tells us the story of Walt Disney, a father of two daughters who first drew Mickey Mouse on a train journey and based his first design for Disneyland on his hometown of Marceline, Missouri. We meet, too, the \u201cImagineers\u201d: people tasked with making new attractions at Disney\u2019s theme parks. \u201cCreating happiness is hard work,\u201d croons Angela Bassett in the voiceover. \u201cOnly a unique army of people is equipped to undertake such an enterprise. Since its inception, this merry band of misfits has defied the odds.\u201d Did she really just say \u201cthis merry band of misfits\u201d? Yes, she did.</p> <p>Another Disney-on-Disney documentary, called One Day at Disney<em>,</em> zooms in on a selection of employees, including Mark, who is almost moved to tears by his own life story \u2013 from being a train obsessive as a kid to running the steam train service at Disneyland, California. That\u2019s the way all the character arcs go in One Day at Disney, sculpted into the kind of perfect Disney shape that strongly resembles the now almost blackly comic notion of the American dream: I had a passion, I worked hard, my dream became a reality, and now the physical and emotional health of myself and my family, my entire life, really, is owned by a thumpingly profitable corporation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4fa8e53c0f47bd2922bba323cfb1a529c4e80b1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fa8e53c0f47bd2922bba323cfb1a529c4e80b1c/0_293_3218_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Disney CEO Bob Iger at Mickey Mouse\u2019s 90th anniversary celebration in Los Angeles in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disney CEO Bob Iger at Mickey Mouse\u2019s 90th anniversary celebration in Los Angeles in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto E Rodr\u00edguez/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All the Disney documentaries feature Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s outgoing CEO, who likes to tell his own neatly crafted story, from how he started out 45 years ago earning $150 a week at ABC before rising to the top through sheer hard work and optimism. Iger always appears grandfatherly, in cable-knit sweaters and cosy cardigans, with deep grooves that fan out round his eyes gained by years of smiling in the service of corporate warmth. He often says things like: <strong>\u201c</strong>We\u2019re all trying to do the same thing, in very compelling ways: we\u2019re trying to touch people\u2019s hearts.\u201d</p> <p>During Iger\u2019s reign, Disney has become the entertainment behemoth of our age, acquiring Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm (and thus Star Wars) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/20/disney-seals-71bn-deal-for-21st-century-fox-as-it-prepares-to-take-on-netflix\" title=\"\">21st Century Fox</a> among others. The company now owns so much of the entertainment landscape that it can function like surround sound. There have been strings of mega-hits: last year alone included Toy Story 4, Avengers: Endgame, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2 contributing to a total <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/22/walt-disney-stable-of-heroes-dominate-box-office-galaxy\" title=\"\">box office haul</a> of $11bn. Iger has been vastly rewarded for his efforts: in 2019, he earned $48m. The year before, he earned $65.7m, more than 1,000 times the median salary \u2013 about $46,000 \u2013 of all Disney employees. Many of Disney\u2019s workers, like those who filed a <a href=\"https://www.classaction.org/news/class-action-claims-disney-failed-to-pay-employees-anaheims-15-per-hour-living-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">class action lawsuit</a> in California\u2019s superior court last December, earn less than $15 an hour.</p> <p>The triumphant launch of Disney+ was supposed to be Iger\u2019s closing flourish, a final high-five as he left the building. The early signs were good. Pre-launch, Disney had established a target of 60 to 90 million subscribers by 2024. On 9 April 2020, the company announced it had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/09/disney-netflix-rival-doubles-subscriptions-in-virus-lockdown\" title=\"\">hit 50 million</a>. (It took Netflix seven years to reach that point.) As Iger\u2019s retirement approached, there was persistent chatter in the media about him running for president, rumours he eventually had to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/09/bob-iger-disney-president-politics-1202744699/\" title=\"\">deny</a> publicly. But just as his character journey was coming to its satisfying close, the story changed. By late March, most of Disney\u2019s operations were suspended due to coronavirus. Disney had <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/03/19/disney-debt-coronavirus-disneyland-mulan-marvel/\" title=\"\">lost a third</a> of its market value, $78.5bn, in the space of a month.

Rightly, the company isn\u2019t high on anyone\u2019s worry list. But it\u2019s striking how far the current reality of Disney is from its well tended corporate image. In late March, various news outlets <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/disney-world-empty-coronavirus_n_5e7b618bc5b6dc206c4a8f08?ri18n=true\" title=\"\">published pictures</a> of Disney\u2019s closed theme parks \u2013 empty car parks, rollercoasters, cafes, golf courses and a lonely-looking Millennium Falcon at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2019/may/30/star-wars-galaxys-edge-disneys-new-theme-park-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge</a>. The photographs are somehow more sinister than those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-us-cities-quarantine-in-pictures\" title=\"\">empty cities</a> that have been doing the rounds. Cities, at the best of times, are conflicted and messy, beautiful and cruel. They rarely pretend to be anything they\u2019re not, unless there\u2019s an Olympics going on.</p> <p>Disney, on the other hand, is always pretending to be something it\u2019s not: it is a highly efficient profit machine that presents itself as a place where a merry band of misfits conjure happiness. Its theme parks are places constructed for children and commerce, and the optimised interplay of those two things, but in these images they look ghostly, frozen in time like the cursed inhabitants of the castle in Sleeping Beauty, still technically in existence but, in the absence of anything animate, turned into the lifeless sets of a horror movie. I doubt, somehow, that this is what Disney\u2019s \u201cImagineers\u201d had in mind.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On some days, when we\u2019ve been outside in the weird quiet and heard only birds and sirens, the line between fantasy and reality feels pretty blurred. The world doesn\u2019t look real; something to do with the clean sunlight, the blossom, the way everyone walks around under a glaze of heightened self-awareness. There is deceptive peace, when we know, just around the corner, there is the opposite. We lurch between learning of the cruellest of realities, and feasting on fantasy to distract ourselves. Sometimes, emerging from a Disney haze, I wish I\u2019d stayed in the hard reality, because then at least you don\u2019t have to wake up from it.</p> <p>Kids are instructive, somehow able to navigate this time with a bracing honesty that adults nervously evade. There are ups and downs, sure: there are escape fantasies and berserk, semi-violent frustrations born of unchanging close-quarters proximity, but then they seem able to reset. Snacks help. So do lavatorial jokes. Or some sort of half-arsed slide made out of sofa cushions. A mood can descend and then pass like a rain shower, rather than descend and fester, which seems to be their parents\u2019 preference.</p> <p>The kids seem to have an appropriate amount of curiosity about bad news \u2013 a curiosity that knows when to move on to fresh ground instead of feeding itself with extraneous and panic-inducing information. When a situation is explained, they ask questions, listen to maybe 10% of the answers before becoming deeply bored by the sanctimonious tone of my voice, and then wander off, rather than spending the next eight hours scrolling through Twitter looking for fresh and conflicting perspectives about PPE provision and the precise timing of different nations\u2019 lockdown strategies until they can\u2019t sleep and want to go out on the empty streets and rage at the perfect moon. They are very, very frank about death. Before the schools closed, my daughter came home one day and told me it was unlikely she\u2019d die from coronavirus as she was a child, \u201cbut old people might\u201d. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, grateful for her direct approach to the subject, \u201cthey might.\u201d</p> <p>Also, distraction isn\u2019t distraction for them: it\u2019s occupation, it\u2019s <em>life</em>. When I interrupt the three-year-old in one of his deep-play sessions, something to do with small figures either warring or performing intricate stunts on Lego motorbikes, he looks at me sternly and says: \u201cI\u2019m <em>busy</em>.\u201d Meanwhile, the disapproving label of \u201cscreen time\u201d does a gross injustice to the six-year-old\u2019s capacity to immerse herself in a film. Watching her watching Bolt for the seventh time is like watching an athlete, a formidable effort of concentration that blocks out all external noise, attempts at conversation, offers of food.</p> <p>Disney+, inevitably, stole her heart. I could tell it from the moment I saw her face during that opening ident \u2013 the shooting star over the Disney castle, the background sky sunset-pink. They know what they\u2019re doing, these people: even the branding gives you an endorphin hit. During that seventh Bolt viewing, I realised why the kids wanted to keep watching the same movie over and over again. There\u2019s the expert appreciation for a fine piece of computer animation, no doubt, but there\u2019s also the deep comfort to be found in repeat viewing. Even multiple screenings in, they both covered their eyes in terror during a chase scene. The fear was real, but it was that pleasurable kind of fear you know will pass. There\u2019s no uncertainty, no risk. You know, for a fact, that everything will be OK. It\u2019s fear with a happy ending.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/26/game-of-thrones-the-crown-nina-gold-casting-director\">From Game of Thrones to The Crown: the woman who turns actors into stars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some sad, jaded part of me wanted to point out to my kids the degree to which life, especially right now, is not at all like a Disney movie. But what would be the purpose when we were here surrendering to a Disney movie precisely for its moral consolations, for its rewarding of the good and punishment of the bad, for the right things happening to the right people in the end. We could watch, godlike, in the safety of foreknowledge. At the movie\u2019s dramatic climax \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 when Bolt rescues his beloved owner from a raging fire and they both fall unconscious, my daughter turned to me and said reassuringly, with the wisdom of hard-won experience and the beautiful relief of knowing the future: \u201cIt\u2019s OK.

In a letter to the immigration minister, Kevin Foster, seen by the Guardian, Lynch said: \u201cIf those with NRPF status are not entitled to welfare support and cannot undertake their paid roles due to lockdown measures, they face an impossible choice.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey either continue to work, undermining public health measures endangering themselves and others, or alternatively stay at home with no pay or support and face destitution.

The industry also put a halt to key events like the New York Metropolitan Museum\u2019s Met Gala, the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards, and the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers.</p> <p>London fashion week is now set to merge womenswear and menswear, following a recent trend for mixed shows from heavy-hitting brands including Burberry, Gucci and Jacquemus.</p> <p>Currently halted in its tracks, the fashion industry has been forced into a period of reflection with questions being raised about consumption and the number of shows held each season.</p> <p>Last week, designer Marc Jacobs argued that it was only necessary to have two shows a year. \u201cThe amount of stuff we make and the quantity we make and the amount of time it\u2019s shown \u2013 it\u2019s just so excessive,\u201d he told the <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com.au/fashion/news/15-inspirational-lessons-from-virgil-abloh-marc-jacobs-and-stella-mccartney/news-story/56338cf629a468564f9721e84aeed1ff\">Vogue Global Conversations</a> webinar.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything to such excess that there is no consumer for all of it, and everyone is exhausted by it.

However, unfortunately I don\u2019t see it working for prospecting new designers as there is too much risk.\u201d</p> <p>With an unsure economic future, a digital-only fashion week feels like the most economically viable decision for now.</p> <p>\u201cWe will look to China and South Korea to show us when consumer interest will return,\u201d Rush told the Guardian earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to learn from that.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Much as I love toad breeding season for the way it brings thousands to Lightwood\u2019s ponds, it\u2019s actually a dangerous time for them. For seven evenings a friend\u2019s daily exercise involved patrolling a stretch of river with a bucket to retrieve trapped toads. This year we estimate that he, with minor contributions from others, including me, has saved 1,100.</p> <p>The problem is that toads arriving from the north and west are channelled, before they reach the spawning ground, into a stone-lined culvert that contains the flow of Hogshaw Brook. They are then blocked by a two-metre wall and are doomed, unless they can find a way over. One route for 30 of them was in the pockets of my smock, after which I released them on the lip of the water \u2013 a moment that felt wonderful for the old toad in my soul.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are other hazards. In normal circumstances, a female acquires her mate en route to the pond or in the water. (Apparently it\u2019s the quality of his voice that determines her choice.) They couple and the female spawns. But a small number, possibly the largest females, are subjected to a frenzy of attention from mateless males. They can become completely enfolded in would-be suitors and loll helplessly, the males with faces squashed on some part of her as if to smother her in adoration; in these stressed circumstances, she can drown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6165b3116cb4623f50e64ef0b47153d9f6751cdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6165b3116cb4623f50e64ef0b47153d9f6751cdf/0_113_2717_1630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Females toads are far larger than their mates but both possess extraordinary orange-gold eyes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Females toads are far larger than their mates; both possess extraordinary orange-gold eyes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Cocker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I observed one aggregation where the female surfaced intermittently as the whole body-ball slowly, randomly, revolved in the water.

Very rude. It\u2019s like brain-body whack-a-mole: every repressed burst of terror pops back up again in the form of a clicking hip ligament; every hour in the same position on the couch results in an hour of shoulder stiffness that interferes with my ability to calm down. There are no strict Cartesians during a global pandemic.</p> <p>I realised fairly early on that if I didn\u2019t find a way to do some regular exercise indoors my sanity was going to disintegrate like a clump of precious toilet paper left in the rain.

Many of Mishler\u2019s videos are oriented towards the management and relief of suffering: she has yoga videos for sadness, anxiety, stress, anger, and various kinds of injury and physical pain.

  "<p>The agreement between Rugby Australia and the Rugby Union Players Association for players to take 60 per cent pay cuts will provide critical short-term financial relief for the struggling code during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>But as drawn out as these negotiations were, they should be just the first step towards striking a new deal between RA and its most valuable asset, serving as a precursor to a re-negotiated Collective Bargaining Agreement which will give the code a greater chance to achieve long-term sustainability.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/rugby-australia-set-to-benefit-from-world-rugby-relief-fund\">Rugby Australia set to benefit from World Rugby relief fund</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/31/rugby-australia-agm-financial-crisis\">interim pay deal gives RA another six months\u2019 breathing space</a> to survive the current crisis, but the CBA looms as a potentially even more important negotiation for the future of the game. RA needs to rethink how it is going to engage with the players in order to be on a stronger footing to survive downturns, particularly unexpected ones.</p> <p>Both RA and the RUPA seemed to come out of the negotiation with a reasonably fair deal based on the understanding that they need each other. Similarly, the two parties need to come to a mutual understanding on what is a sustainable business model for the future or they will not have a game to administer and play, at least not one as we know it.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s professional players are entitled to seek the highest salaries they can, but for the last decade or so Australian rugby has been forced to pay a premium for players because of strong competition from rich clubs in Europe and Japan. This has placed a strain on Australian rugby\u2019s capacity to invest in the grassroots of the game, which has fallen well behind its major rivals, especially the AFL.</p> <p>Under the current CBA, players receive a generous 29 per cent of player-generated revenue regardless of the game\u2019s income streams or player performance. That\u2019s a pretty good deal for the players, but for a financially fragile code like rugby, it may not be sustainable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/20/australia-maverick-aubrey-hodgson-rugby-union\">Long-lost letter reveals my ineptitude let down an Australian rugby legend | Barry Glendenning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During the life of the current CBA the Wallabies have slipped to seventh in the world, their lowest ever ranking, while no Australian Super Rugby team has won the title in this period. Yet, the players\u2019 pay scale remains the same. RA should seek a player payment model that rewards success. Australian players give their all, but sport is driven by results and Australia\u2019s professional rugby teams have not delivered for some time.</p> <p>A tiered payment model which might begin at a minimum of 20-to-25 per cent of player-generated revenue and increase in line with success on and off the field is possibly a more realistic option for a cash-strapped code. The Wallabies receive bonuses when they win the World Cup. Why not extend this to winning the Bledisloe Cup, The Rugby Championship and the Super Rugby title?</p> <p>As well, if players successfully re-engaged with Australian rugby\u2019s disillusioned fan base, perhaps they could also benefit indirectly from increased crowds and television ratings by factoring bonuses into the CBA. This would give the players skin in the game.</p> <p>The players have accepted massive pay cuts now because really there was no other choice. RA was in danger of becoming insolvent and players would have lined up with the rest of the creditors for whatever cents they could get out of dollars owed.</p> <p>The pay cuts allow RA to slash its overall wages bill by around 80 per cent and have cleared the way to secure a $16m loan from World Rugby to help keep it afloat until play resumes and revenues are generated again.</p> <p>But without a broadcast deal beyond the end of this year, Australian rugby remains in a vulnerable position. Whether RA secures a new broadcast partner such as Optus or returns to long-time partner Fox Sports, it is hard to imagine it negotiating a better deal than the current $57m-a-year in the current economic climate.</p> <p>RA will need the cooperation and goodwill of the players more than ever in a post-coronavirus world. As part of the interim agreement the players will be involved in discussions about any future competitions and structures.</p> <p>Any new CBA negotiation needs to recognise the fact Australian rugby players are a valuable commodity on the global market. How can RA keep costs down in an uncertain future and ensure its top players are properly rewarded?</p> <p>Part of the solution may already lie in the interim agreement. Up to six highly paid players will be allowed to take sabbaticals overseas to recoup lost earnings from their salary sacrifice. Perhaps this measure could be expanded to allow more players to take sabbaticals so that Rugby Australia could pay its leading players what it could afford without players being financially penalised.</p> <p>It would not be an ideal solution as the Super Rugby teams would bear the brunt of being without some of their star players, but if RA can successfully reduce the salary burden in the next CBA it could free up much-needed revenue to invest in the growth of the game.</p> <p>Rugby is a players\u2019 game, not just present players, but players of the future also.</p>",

And not only did we catch it, we are now the king of ventilators all over the world.<br><br>\u201cWe have thousands being made a week and they\u2019re very high quality and that wasn\u2019t playing well, so then they said, \u2018Testing, testing, ah, we\u2019ll get him on testing\u2019. Well, testing is much easier than ventilators.\u201d<br><br>In fact governors\u2019 demands for ventilators were based on the White House\u2019s own projections and, far from being new, their pleas for testing go back many weeks. Trump\u2019s words are also unlikely to comfort the afflicted for whom a ventilator is a lifeline.<br><br>Later at Monday\u2019s briefing, the president\u2019s ability to show empathy was again in question. </p> \n  <p>Yamiche Alcindor of PBS News recalled one of her interviewees: \u201cA man said his entire family got sick because they listened to you and didn\u2019t stay home.

A lot of people love me, you see them all the time, right. I guess I\u2019m here for a reason. To the best of my knowledge, I won, and I think we\u2019re gonna win again. I think we\u2019re gonna win in a landslide.\u201d<br><br>The president went on to tout his travel restrictions on China, adding that \u201cbefore March\u201d he also banned travel from Europe (it was in fact announced on 11 March). The back and forth continued.

It was all ventilators ... We did a great job with the ventilators.\u201d He said \u201cat some point soon\u201d, the US would be helping Mexico and Italy with ventilators. </p> \n  <p>It is true that some states, so far, have ended up with more ventilators than they originally projected they would need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. \u201cThat has put less strain and pressure on the state\u2019s effort to procure additional ventilators,\u201d Newsom said.</p> \n  <p>However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689\">31 times that number</a> to treat coronavirus patients. </p> \n  <p>An article in the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMp2006141\">New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March </a>categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months.</p> \n  <p>The authors, American public health experts, wrote: \u201cThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap.

That is significantly better than rates in hard hit countries such as Italy, Spain, the UK and France, and similar overall to Iran, which was also an early hotspot. But death rates are higher in the US than Germany, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and many other countries. </p> \n  <p>The death rate in China had been recorded as 4% of cases and 0.2 deaths per 100,000 population. That was before the Chinese government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-denies-cover-up-as-wuhan-coronavirus-deaths-revised-up-50\">increased</a> the official death toll from Wuhan, the original base of the outbreak, by 50%. And there are ongoing questions about all of China\u2019s reported numbers in relation to the coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, the New York Times has published a long and useful <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-death-rate.html\">article</a> detailing the enormous difficulties in pinpointing death rates in different countries and even different areas and populations within countries.</p> \n  <p>The virus swept in so quickly and is still so relatively new that we are only now grasping that there may be huge numbers of people who have or had Covid-19 without showing symptoms, have not been tested or who died at home or in a care home without that death ever being verified as resulting from coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The New York Times gives a rough rule of thumb that, according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the <a href=\"https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html\">number of known cases</a>, about 6.4% of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide. But it adds that \u201chealth officials and epidemiologists have estimated there are five to 10 people with infections for every confirmed case in some communities, and at least one estimate suggests there are far more\u201d.</p> \n  <p>So ultimately the worldwide death rate, if it can ever be verified, is likely to be a much, much lower number than currently understood. And data for the US and other countries could change a lot going forward.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T22:03:43.249Z\">at 11.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9e15c48f0895b8b228320d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T21:41:00.495Z\">10.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump press conference begins</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The president is at the podium now, talking about his guidelines for reopening the country. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9e148d8f08ce473efe2a17\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T21:35:20.852Z\">10.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Joe Biden gets progressive House endorsements</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While we wait for the White House briefing to begin, here\u2019s some quick non-coronavirus news: a number of former Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters in Congress have officially endorsed Joe Biden: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cmarinucci/status/1252295568086335490\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New!
