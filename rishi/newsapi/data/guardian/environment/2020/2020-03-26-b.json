  "<p>Advocates for American workers praised a \u201chistoric\u201d increase in unemployment benefits included in an emergency $2tn relief package <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">approved by the US Senate</a>, which will offer special \u201cpandemic unemployment\u201d to gig workers, self-employed workers, and some people forced to leave their jobs because of the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>But although the unemployment payments will offer months of support to many vulnerable Americans, advocates said that the bill threatens to leave too many people out. Even $2tn in emergency aid, experts said, is probably too little for the size of the crisis.</p> \n<p>As part of the unprecedented relief package approved by the Senate on Wednesday night, millions of Americans would get an individual, $1,200 check to help them weather the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. The bill would also create a $500bn lending program for businesses, cities and states and a $367bn fund for small businesses, which would focus on helping small businesses to pay their employees\u2019 salaries through the next weeks of pandemic-related shutdowns, rather than laying them off.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/us-coronavirus-stimulus-all-you-need-to-know\">US coronavirus stimulus checks: are you eligible and how much will you get?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The bill\u2019s major benefit to American workers is not that single cash payment, but the sweeping expansion of unemployment benefits<strong>, </strong>labor experts said.<strong> </strong>The bill offers laid-off workers an additional $600 a week for four months and extends unemployment benefits to gig workers, independent contractors, and others who have not previously been eligible for unemployment, including people forced to leave their jobs to care for family members with coronavirus, or to care for children whose schools have closed.</p> \n<p>Despite some flaws, the emergency bill offers \u201cthe largest expansion of unemployment benefits in history\u201d, Senator Bernie Sanders, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said on Wednesday night before the bill\u2019s passage. About $250bn in federal funds would go to expanding these benefits, Sanders said.</p> \n<p>For many workers, the $600 added to their weekly state unemployment checks would mean that the checks would come close to matching their original salaries, labor experts said, and the measure would increase most unemployment payments to around the median weekly income of <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf\">$936</a>.</p> \n<p>A worker who files for unemployment in New York, for example, would typically get just $435 a week. Under the new emergency relief bill, that amount would increase to $1,035 a week, said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive thinktank. This was a \u201cmajor boost of benefits\u201d, he said, and would ensure that most workers filing for unemployment during the pandemic \u201cdon\u2019t experience an economic catastrophe\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are, by historic standards, probably the most generous unemployment benefits we\u2019ve given,\u201d said Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress, a leading liberal thinktank.</p> \n<p>So generous, in fact, that a<strong> </strong>small group of Republican senators made a last-minute effort to try to change the benefits Wednesday night, arguing that the bill as written would temporarily give some laid-off workers benefits larger than their pay on the job.</p> \n<p>Senators Lindsey Graham, Ben Sasse, and Tim Scott called this a \u201cstrong incentive for employees to be laid off rather than going to work\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sanders lambasted his Republican colleagues for trying to reduce unemployment benefits, an attempt which failed in the senate late Wednesday night.</p> \n<p>During \u201can unprecedented economic crisis\u201d, Sanders said, \u201cthey\u2019re very upset that someone who is making $10, $12 an hour might end up with a paycheck for four months more than they received last week.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow absurd and wrong is that?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cadefc22-6bff-4cf8-adce-c413778f0d4b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qCyyfquAJgU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The boost in unemployment insurance comes as<strong> </strong>the US labor department announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">3.3 million</a> Americans filed unemployment claims last week, the largest number the department had ever recorded. Millions more are expected to file for unemployment in the coming weeks. In California alone, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/california-coronavirus-unemployment-newsom\">more than a million </a>people filed unemployment claims in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>The relief bill offers other lifelines to workers, including $367bn to help small businesses cover their employees\u2019 salaries and keep afloat. An estimated <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/cares-act-senate-coronavirus-bill-economic-relief-plan/\">94% of Americans who file taxes</a> will also get the one-time emergency payment: $1,200 for most individuals, $2,400 for couples, plus $500 per child in the household, with the payments reduced or eliminated for people at higher income levels.</p> \n<p>Most Americans will be able to receive these emergency payments through direct deposit in their bank accounts, and the payments will go out \u201cwithin three weeks\u201d, the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on Wednesday.</p> \n<h2><strong>Many </strong><strong>could be left out</strong></h2> \n<p>Experts said that allowing self-employed and gig workers to receive unemployment checks was a crucial step forward, since these workers make up growing portion of the national workforce and have not previously been eligible for federal unemployment insurance.</p> \n<p>But the emergency relief bill still threatens to leave many people out, they said, including domestic workers paid in cash, undocumented workers, homeless Americans, people who do not have bank accounts, and some people who have not filed taxes recently.</p> \n<p>Even people who are eligible for unemployment may face delays in actually getting their checks. State unemployment systems have been overwhelmed by an unprecedented number of applicants. New York\u2019s online unemployment application website reportedly crashed multiple times this week. So did Oregon\u2019s.</p> \n<p>In addition, people who do not have direct deposit accounts on file, or who have moved since last filing their taxes, may face delays in getting their emergency payments. Some Americans who have not filed taxes recently may be entirely left out. The <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/16rpsaeztabulations.pdf\">Internal Revenue Service estimates</a> that about 30 to 40 million American adults, or about 15% of the population, do not file tax returns, Garrett Watson, an analyst at the conservative Tax Foundation, said.</p> \n<p>Some experts said there was also a more fundamental problem: even though the senate\u2019s $2tn coronavirus package is being hailed as the largest emergency relief bill in American history, it may still not be enough to match the scale of the problem.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-us-economy-health-lives-trump\">The economy v our lives?

Some of that money could also go to supporting small businesses, but it\u2019s not clear how much. The Fed \u201chas to divvy up that money in a lot of different ways\u201d, Tedeschi said. \u201cThere are a lot of different fires to put out.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Political protests</strong></h2> \n<p>Experts and advocates also said that a single direct payment of $1,200 for individual adults was unlikely to be enough to help Americans weather a crisis that has no clear end in sight.</p> \n<p>\u201c$1,200 is the average rent for most Americans,\u201d said Natalie Foster, the co-chair of the Economic Security Project, which advocates for a guaranteed income for all Americans. \u201cThis first check is eaten up, and what are they supposed to do after that?</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you look at overall numbers to see how much is going to shoring up big corporations, compared to how little is going to Americans,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p>While \u201c$1,200 per adult is very meaningful, no matter who you are\u201d, Tedeschi said, \u201cit\u2019s not going to be this ongoing safety net that is going to keep families afloat\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50e28122abd61f5193f8d1545fb24cb8f96c1d29\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50e28122abd61f5193f8d1545fb24cb8f96c1d29/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Employees of Junior\u2019s Restaurant in Brooklyn sort paychecks for fellow workers who are picking them up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Employees of Junior\u2019s Restaurant in Brooklyn sort paychecks for fellow workers who are picking them up.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If the crisis continues past the short term, \u201ca one-time payment may not be sufficient,\u201d said Watson, of the Tax Foundation.</p> \n<p>Some Democratic lawmakers had proposed making larger, more continuous direct payments to individual Americans, to provide support throughout the crisis.</p> \n<p>A group of progressive state Democratic lawmakers and other progressives led a rallying cry on Twitter on Wednesday, repeatedly sharing the same message: \u201c$1,200 isn\u2019t enough.\u201d They pointed to the vast benefits the emergency bill offers to large corporations.</p> \n<p>Some libertarians took a similar view, arguing that individual direct payments in a crisis were more efficient, and would be more effective, than government welfare for big corporations.</p> \n<p>\u201cJust ten years after the Tea Party movement, Republicans in Congress are defending a $500 billion corporate welfare fund for a select group of large companies,\u201d Justin Amash, a Michigan congressman who left the Republican party in 2019 to become an independent, wrote on Twitter.</p> \n<p>He called the Senate compromise a \u201craw deal\u201d for Americans and said bigger direct payments \u201cwould be far more helpful to the people\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor $2 trillion,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1242881655712473097\">wrote on Twitter</a>, the government could \u201cgive every family of four $7,000 per month for three months\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/us-coronavirus-relief-package-airlines-fossil-fuel-companies-climate\">$2tn US coronavirus relief comes without climate stipulations</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Wednesday that the Senate\u2019s compromise bill offered relief that would not come fast enough for most Americans: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s reasonable to expect what could be millions of people and small businesses, who suddenly had their incomes cut off, to pay rent, mortgages, &amp; major bills on Apr 1st without any payment moratoriums or immediate relief,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.</p> \n<p>Despite public objections from some House members, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on Thursday that she was \u201ccertain\u201d that the Senate bill would also pass the House and be signed into law by Donald Trump. But she also said that lawmakers would need to pass an additional round of legislation offering more aid to those who had been left out of the current plan. The current bill is \u201cjust not doing enough for state and local government\u201d, she said. Future legislation should also include additional funding for food stamps, she said.</p> \n<p>Some labor experts and economists said they believed further emergency aid bills would be necessary unless the coronavirus pandemic is resolved in just a few weeks.

What no one could have predicted is that when the doomsday prophecy came true, it would be the result of a lightning bolt not of Trump\u2019s own making.</p> <p>The scale of the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic became clear on Thursday when it emerged that 3.3 million people filed for unemployment insurance last week. It was almost five times the previous record, set in 1982, and by some estimates the jobless figure could reach 12m to 15m before the storm has passed.</p> <p>Suddenly the political landscape has changed. A presidential election and races in the Senate and House are set to take place with an economy undergoing both the biggest contraction and the worst surge in unemployment ever seen. In Washington, a city of heroic statues and soaring monuments, the most relevant now is <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2011633289/\">the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial</a>, with its bronze figures huddled in a Great Depression breadline.</p> <p>In the race for the White House, there are some key questions. Will Trump be blamed, justifiably or otherwise, for millions losing their jobs? Or will voters embrace his claim to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/22/trump-coronavirus-election-november-2020\">\u201cwartime president\u201d</a> and conclude this is no time to change? Can his likely opponent, Joe Biden, capitalise on his own strengths as a voice of competence and experience, to present himself as the moral leader the nation needs?</p> <p>For Trump, this is personal. As a billionaire businessman, he predicated his entire political identity on his ability to steward the economy by slashing regulations, shredding trade deals and reviving manufacturing towns.</p> <p>For three years he bragged \u201cJOBS JOBS JOBS!\u201d and never missed a chance to tout unemployment figures for the population at large \u2013 just last month, the rate was at a 50-year low of 3.5% \u2013 and African Americans and Latinos in particular. The true picture was more complicated and unevenly distributed, but the central message was: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/16/harold-macmillan-never-had-it-so-good\">you\u2019ve never had it so good.</a></p> <p>Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/opinion/coronavirus-trump-economy.html\">other vital sign of virility,</a> the stock market, has been smashed too, nearly all the gains of his presidency wiped out. It was this more than anything, perhaps, that belatedly persuaded him the virus could not simply be wished away.</p> <p>It is therefore no surprise the president is itching to get the economy fired up again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/trumps-push-to-shorten-the-coronavirus-shutdown-proves-the-captain-is-flying-blind\">His push for an Easter Sunday</a> deadline may be ethically callous and scientifically ignorant but politically shrewd.

The message, doubtless amplified by Fox News, will be: \u201cLook, I tried, but my hands were tied.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is about to sign Congress\u2019s $2.2tn aid package designed to prevent complete economic collapse. His treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, did most of the hard work but the president gets to claim the credit. For Democrats, like all opposition parties in wartime, there is a difficult balance in holding Trump accountable while not appearing to undermine national unity. They also have to work with Republicans to keep the money flowing until there is light at end of the tunnel.</p> <p>Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/25/were-not-killing-economy-over-coronavirus-were-putting-it-into-coma/\">wrote in the Washington Post</a>: \u201cWe should know by June if this approach works.</p> <p>\u201cIf it does, the number of Covid-19 infections will have plummeted, deaths from the virus will have flatlined, and people will be coming back to work in droves. It could be the biggest V-shaped economic recovery in US history \u2013 the political-economy version of the resuscitation of a patient after an induced coma.\u201d</p> <p>Olsen added: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to predict what the political fallout from a successful pirouette would be, but it\u2019s hard to see how it doesn\u2019t at least insulate President Trump from much criticism about the virus\u2019s arrival to begin with. Democrats can say he should have done more, but the fact remains that no other western leader did better to anticipate the onset of the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s critics are not going to change their stripes, but the few people who remain open to persuasion are as likely to credit Trump as to blame him.\u201d</p> <p>This is the best-case scenario for the president: presenting himself, however spuriously, as the man who led America through its greatest crisis since the second world war, early missteps long forgotten. Biden, meanwhile, is struggling to break through the cacophony and to master the internet, his thunder stolen by New York\u2019s Democratic governor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/cuomo-wins-praise-for-wisdom-amid-coronavirus-crisis-as-trump-blusters\">Andrew Cuomo.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/william-a-galston/\">Bill Galston,</a> a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington and former policy adviser to Bill Clinton, said: \u201cMost people believe this kind of crisis plays to Biden\u2019s strengths. Against that, with the people involved in his campaign, he\u2019s not been very effective at showing that strength.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/us-coronavirus-stimulus-all-you-need-to-know\">US coronavirus stimulus checks: are you eligible and how much will you get?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not very innovative. They don\u2019t seem to have a strategy to keep him in the conversation. They seem a little flummoxed by the technology of the situation.\u201d</p> <p>The worst-case scenario for Trump looks very different. If the death toll keeps climbing, big and small businesses are ruined and the economy sinks into 1930s-style wreckage, his early denialism will be played endlessly in election attack ads. His mendacious press briefings will be taken as proof that he could not rise to the challenge and Democrats will be more energised than ever to dispatch him.</p> <p>So far, polls suggest Trump is getting a bump like George W Bush after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. A Gallup survey published on Tuesday showed 60% of Americans gave him positive reviews for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and his overall approval rating matched the highest point in his presidency, at 49%, included rises among independents and even Democrats.</p> <p>But this was taken before he reversed his reversal and went back to downplaying the virus, and before the unemployment figures delivered an almighty gut punch.</p> <p>There is a long way to go. It is hard to believe that Trump\u2019s impeachment trial ended only last month. In those terms, the November election is still a lifetime away.</p>",

  "<p>European leaders have clashed over how to pull their economies through the coronavirus crisis, as Italy accused other member states of a timid response to an unprecedented economic shock.</p> <p>Meeting via a video link, the EU\u2019s 27 leaders papered over deep divisions by agreeing that another fortnight was needed to discuss ambitious economic recovery plans. After a testy debate over \u201ccoronabonds\u201d, i.e raising funds through issuing shared European debt, the bloc kicked a decision down the road, by calling on EU finance leaders to present proposals within two weeks.</p> <p>Even as the virtual summit was still ongoing, Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, released a statement rejecting an earlier pre-prepared draft statement because he thought it was a weak response to the scale of the crisis.</p> <p>Hours before the summit, Conte called for \u201cextraordinary and exceptional measures\u201d to help Europe\u2019s battered economies deal with a sharp downturn and the expected surge in joblessness resulting from coronavirus.</p> <p>Backed by France, Spain and seven other eurozone countries, Italy wants a \u201cEuropean recovery bond\u201d or \u201ccoronabonds\u201d \u2013 namely, EU-backed debt to lift member states out of a recession and increase spending on healthcare.</p> <p>But the idea of shared debt remains anathema to Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, who shunned the similar concept of \u201ceurobonds\u201d during the eurozone crisis a few years earlier.</p> <p>In a video conference summit \u2013 their third in as many weeks \u2013 talks ran four hours over schedule as leaders sparred over a single paragraph in the communiqu\u00e9 about how best to aid their economies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/a-warning-to-europe-italy-struggle-to-convince-citizens-of-coronavirus-crisis\">Italy struggled to convince citizens of coronavirus crisis. What can Europe learn?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the meeting, Charles Michel, the head of the European council, told journalists the EU was ready to do \u201ceverything it takes in order to find the right solution\u201d and needed to continue work with the 19 finance ministers of the eurozone. \u201cWe had tonight a very strong political debate. It was a useful debate, it was a necessary debate,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But hope of a breakthrough remain elusive, as eurozone finance ministers earlier this week failed to agree on common European debt \u2013 passing the issue to Thursday\u2019s EU leader meeting.</p> <p>With Italy\u2019s economy on a downward spiral as a result of the lockdown to fight the outbreak, Conte unveiled a second stimulus package worth more than the \u20ac25bn package ($27.43bn) adopted in March. But the extra spending will send the government shooting over budget deficit targets.</p> <p>EU leaders, however, were able to unite over the idea of more careful screening of foreign investment to protect Europe\u2019s \u201cstrategic assets\u201d. The decision comes days after the German government said it had rejected a bid from the Donald Trump administration to buy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/trump-offers-large-sums-for-exclusive-access-to-coronavirus-vaccine\">a German medical company working on a Covid-19 vaccine.</a></p> <p>The bloc also said it was prioritising the search for a vaccine for all in need \u201cwithout geographical barriers\u201d, vowing to increase funding for research.</p> <p>EU leaders also agreed to set up \u201ca more ambitious and wide-ranging crisis management system within the EU\u201d. The EU already has an emergency response coordination centre, which operates 24/7 and can organise help, if asked, when any country in the world suffers an earthquake, forest fire, floods or pandemic.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, rebuked member states for \u201clooking out for themselves\u201d during the early phases of the crisis.</p> <p>Taking an unusually critical tone, she said the story of the past few weeks had been partly a painful one.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Europe really needed an all-for-one spirit, too many initially gave an only-for-me response. And when Europe really needed to prove that this is not only a fair weather union, too many initially refused to share their umbrella,\u201d she told members of the European parliament in a sparsely-attended session in Brussels to vote through emergency measures.</p> <p>MEPs were advised to stay away and given the right to vote electronically for the first time.</p> <p>Von der Leyen was referring to export bans on critical medical goods, as well as the closure of borders, which have created massive delays in moving food and healthcare supplies around the bloc.</p> <p>She went on to say, however, that Europe was now \u201cstepping up\u201d, pointing to Germany\u2019s decision to bring French and Italian patients to German hospitals, as well as a similar help from Luxembourg to France.</p> <p>The commission also released statistics on Twitter stating that France and Germany combined had donated more surgical masks to Italy than China.</p> <p>EU leaders are increasingly worried they are losing \u201cthe battle of narratives\u201d, after Russia and China rushed to aid Italy, while European neighbours <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/italy-criticises-eu-being-slow-help-coronavirus-epidemic\">failed initially to respond to Rome\u2019s calls for help</a>. The EU\u2019s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, wrote earlier this week that there was \u201ca struggle for influence through spinning\u201d of \u201cthe politics of generosity\u201d.</p> <p>But an internal report by Von der Leyen\u2019s team underscored concern about the patchwork of national responses. The document lamented that transport had been paralysed by border closures, leading to lorries being stuck in queues at EU internal borders for 24 hours, with problems most acute in central Europe. So far, only three countries have followed the commission\u2019s advice to create \u201cgreen lanes\u201d (minimal checks) to speed up the traffic.</p> <p>On the day when the EU marked the 25th anniversary of the entry into force of the border-free travel zone, every EU member state barring Ireland had closed or put restrictions on their border. <em>\u201c</em>A crisis without borders cannot be resolved by putting barriers between us and yet this is exactly the first reflex that many European countries have,\u201d Von der Leyen said.</p>",

  "<p>As clubs across Europe move to reduce or defer their footballers\u2019 salaries, one thing is crystal clear. There will be no comfortable, one size fits all solution to an issue that faces almost everyone: the need to save money during the coronavirus crisis in an industry that, taking the continent as a whole, pays out 64% of its revenue in wages.</p> \n<p>That figure, Uefa\u2019s latest, is accurate up to 2018 and will certainly have risen. It is no wonder that, with income streams compromised indefinitely, clubs at all levels are seeking new arrangements. Goodwill \u2013 and an understanding that no two situations are the same when dealing with governments, leagues, clubs and even individuals \u2013 is essential and the positive stories are offset by examples of clubs being, at best, ham-fisted in their attempts to force through cuts.</p> \n<p>It is a precarious enough state of affairs to concern Fifpro, the global players\u2019 union, although it is aware every league has its unique challenges and a particular level of recourse to state support. Two cases provide a glimpse into how fraught things may become without compromise.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/premier-league-players-wage-deferrals-coronavirus\">Premier League players likely to accept wage deferrals to ease pressure on clubs</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At Sion, in Switzerland, nine players \u2013 including the former Arsenal pair Alex Song and Johan Djourou \u2013 were sacked last week after refusing a proposal that would, according to one source close to the squad, have seen the highest earners take a reduction of up to 80%. A raft of legal cases is inevitable. The club claim just cause but the players\u2019 stance is that the deal involved a government support package for \u201cpartial unemployment\u201d that had not been put into law for footballers at that point.</p> \n<p>The players are believed to be happy to enter into individual negotiations. Sion have emphasised that the dismissed players were asked for their agreement in the event that the government\u2019s deal, which subsequently came into force, was passed and that they were not fired for rejecting a wage cut per se.</p> \n<p>The standoff at Dinamo Zagreb, whose players have refused the imposition of a six-month package that would see a third of their wages paid, a third deferred and a third cut entirely, risks becoming similarly drawn out. The Croatian footballers\u2019 association said that, even though the squad want to help, it is too early for such decisions and that the measure seems drastic given the low matchday and TV revenues in the local league. It claims the players were not consulted. Dinamo are yet to respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, the Guardian has learned of clubs in Scandinavia that have told foreign players to take cuts of between 25% and 50% if they wish to spent the Covid-19 shutdown in their homelands. There is an acknowledgement at all levels below the very top that the issue is an existential one, but the balance between clubs\u2019 financial needs and those of their players is highly delicate and may prove impossible to strike.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are concerned that a significant number of clubs are acting to unilaterally reduce the salaries of players,\u201d the Fifpro general secretary, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, told the Guardian. \u201cWe are aware of such situations in more than half a dozen countries. In one case, within days of the suspension of the national league, players had their salaries immediately and arbitrarily decreased by two-thirds for a period of six months. While we fully understand the economic pressure employers are facing, we cannot accept unilateral actions that are based neither on individual consent nor collective agreements. As is already happening in other countries, clubs and leagues with cashflow difficulties should meet with national player unions to discuss and negotiate fair and proportionate arrangements.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"24b9a91f492cbbbeda6e92e006dd59901c362f2c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24b9a91f492cbbbeda6e92e006dd59901c362f2c/0_0_7686_4611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dortmund are among the top German clubs whose players have all taken temporary cuts of varying degrees to help lower-paid employees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dortmund are among the top German clubs whose players have all taken temporary cuts of varying degrees to help lower-paid employees.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ina Fassbender/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The willingness of some clubs to take such firm action has led, in certain quarters, to a growing sense that the decks are being cleared for a universal termination of the 2019-20 campaign. But others are keener to bide their time before making demands of their players. The president of a club dominant in its nation\u2019s top flight said he accepted \u201cnothing will be like it was before\u201d when coronavirus has subsided, expecting sponsorship deals to take a particularly punishing hit. But he did not want to rush into a decision about passing any costs on to his team, particularly when football\u2019s legal status in the economy of that country remains unclear.</p> \n<p>One agent describes wage cuts or deferrals as essentially a two-tier issue, with leading Premier League sides operating in a different sphere to everyone else. Top-flight clubs are understood to be monitoring the subject closely although, in many cases, requests to forego money would be viewed dimly unless they were with the express intention of assisting support staff. While the players and staff at Championship club Leeds have taken a wage deferral for that reason, it is pointed out that a second-tier player in the autumn of a time-limited career who has \u2013 for example \u2013 a year left on his contract is not as financially secure as most might assume. The implication from many in the game is that livelihoods may be severely damaged if cases are not viewed one by one, as grinding a process as that might be.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"30dbd695-69dc-431e-8426-c53b535d1a5e\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>English chief executives will have noted the examples of Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, whose players have taken temporary cuts of varying degrees to help lower-paid employees. Barcelona\u2019s situation, while caught up in a tangle of complex Spanish employment regulations and existing tensions between squad and board, will also not have escaped attention. Their players are yet to agree reductions of up to 70%. The problem with imposing a blanket decrease within a single club is highlighted by the fact that, as currently proposed, the Barcelona deal could see staff from lesser-remunerated areas \u2013 such as the women\u2019s operation or handball team \u2013 take the same percentage cut as the likes of Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez.</p> \n<p>The number of players across Europe whose contracts expire in June, or in some cases sooner, brings a further layer of difficulty. As another player representative puts it, most of those trying to pick a way through this situation feel completely in the dark. The worry is that, for all the attempts to meet in the middle, good intentions may not be enough for an industry that has never faced challenges like these.</p>",
  "<p>We may be fighting the deadly spread of a tiny foe, but this is not a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5945c61a-6dc7-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\" title=\"\">wartime economy</a>. In war, governments try to increase economic activity to produce weapons and are forced to tamp down inflation. Today governments deliberately want to lower economic activity to cut the risk of a virus transmission. Many Conservatives\u2019 key belief in free-market societies is that they reward the industrious and punish the idle. Yet the mass joblessness, income shortfalls and business failures we hear about are not because of any human flaw, but because of a government-led shutdown and the fear coursing through the economy. The upshot is that GDP will fall. However, we must not let this situation spiral out of control. Letting a shutdown that lowers aggregate demand lead to unemployment that further cuts demand could put the economy into a tailspin. What is needed is for people and firms to maintain cashflow and help with bills, until some semblance of normality returns.</p> <p>While businesses have been bailed out, there has been a slower move to put money in the pockets of people. Last week the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the government would pay 80% of the wages of the UK\u2019s 28 million private sector employees. It was not until on Thursday that he did the same for the nation\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18334915.rishi-sunak-set-aid-package-5m-self-employed-workers-help-survive-pandemic/\" title=\"\">5 million self-employed</a>. This is in part because to help these workers meant dealing with the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.fissuredworkplace.net/\" title=\"\">fissuring</a>\u201d of the workplace, where people doing the same job in many sectors have increasingly different pay, benefits and privileges. While the complexity and precarious nature of the labour market has helped companies, especially those who can skilfully navigate lightly regulated employment rules, these fissures undermine the safety net which depends crucially on employment status.</p> <p>The support scheme for self-employed workers announced by the chancellor, at a cost of around \u00a310bn, is welcome. But he has not gone far enough for the lowest-paid. The self-employed <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/two-million-self-employed-adults-earn-less-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">earn about half</a> the amount of those in employment. Covering 80% of poverty wages is just another form of financial destitution. And the money doesn\u2019t come until June. The chancellor did not address the gig economy\u2019s precarious nature \u2013 or offer to help those whose hours have been cut during this crisis. If he wants them to pay national insurance at the same rate as employees then he must also make their work secure enough so that they cannot be pressured into working when sick during a pandemic. Workers can have flexible work without denying them basic rights.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has exposed the holes in the UK\u2019s social security net. These were well known to the growing ranks of poor, but unfamiliar territory to many people who will encounter the hostile environment of the benefits system in the coming months. In the last nine days more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/universal-credit-claims-almost-impossible-as-more-than-500000-apply\" title=\"\">500,000</a> people, mainly employees who lost their jobs, have applied for universal credit. A system designed for welfare recipients politically denigrated as shifty is now being swamped by \u201cupstanding citizens\u201d. It will have to be reshaped and resized. The five-week wait for universal credit will have to disappear. The rate of sick pay \u2013 \u00a394.25 a week \u2013 is not enough to live on.</p> <p><a href=\"http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/CASE/_new/events/event/?index=7401\" title=\"\">John Hills at the LSE</a> suggests using child benefit to get money straight to struggling households. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14771\" title=\"\">total bill will run to \u00a3120bn</a>. Conservatives appear to accept the need for generous benefits reluctantly and without much conviction, aware that perhaps they will be hard to reverse. But to defeat coronavirus there will probably have to be many more converts to the gospel of big government.</p>",
  "<p>From the moment that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/alex-salmond-trial-key-events-in-lead-up-to-verdicts\" title=\"\">Alex Salmond</a> found himself facing allegations of sexual misconduct in office, it was clear his trial would have huge consequences. So it has proved. Mr Salmond is 21st-century Scotland\u2019s most significant politician. The 13 cases of sexual offences involving nine women, mostly Scottish government or Scottish National party officials, were extremely serious. The former first minister has always been a \u201cMarmite politician\u201d, as his <a href=\"https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/politics/scottish-politics/2089072/salmonds-defence-say-former-first-minister-could-have-been-better-man-but-say-he-is-innocent-of-criminality/\" title=\"\">defence lawyer</a> admitted to the jury last week, adding that Mr Salmond \u201ccould have been a better man\u201d. Whatever the outcome of the trial, the consequences were likely to be explosive.</p> <p>Mr Salmond\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/23/alex-salmond-acquitted-of-all-charges-in-sexual-assault-trial\" title=\"\">acquittal</a> on all counts this week ensures that. High on any list of the immediate consequences of such a high profile case is where it leaves women who accuse men of sexual harassment. That impact is likely to be compounded by Mr Salmond\u2019s intention to take the fight to his accusers, and to attack senior figures in the SNP and the Scottish government, above all his successor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/18/alex-salmond-trial-told-sturgeon-took-part-in-meeting-with-complainant\" title=\"\">Nicola Sturgeon</a>, whom he charges with conspiracy to remove him from politics. Mr Salmond <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/24/alex-salmond-allies-say-he-plans-to-sue-the-scottish-government\" title=\"\">may sue</a> the Scottish government. He wants to put his case to a Holyrood inquiry. He is writing a book. His supporters are revved up. If nothing else, this is a difficult environment for victims.</p> <p>The struggle between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon can only generate problems <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/24/salmonds-acquittal-could-make-him-the-snps-biggest-challenge\" title=\"\">for the SNP</a>. But the battle draws energy from many other issues. Mr Salmond thinks Ms Sturgeon has become too cautious in her efforts to break Scotland away from the United Kingdom. Some of his supporters dislike Ms Sturgeon\u2019s feminism and her backing for women and LGBTQ+ activists within the party. Many of Ms Sturgeon\u2019s supporters dislike Mr Salmond\u2019s bombastic style and his involvement with the Kremlin-backed RT broadcaster. It adds up to a bitter yet complex fight for supremacy, which will be fought out in multiple ways, including SNP candidacies for next year\u2019s Holyrood elections.</p> <p>There is nothing in this for the SNP. The party remains ascendant, as the 2019 general election confirmed. Its rivals are all in various states of eclipse. Yet the SNP has been in government since 2007. Its record on domestic issues is not one to boast about. Once the power struggle is resolved, the SNP will either be led by the woman who is responsible for that vulnerable record, or by the man whose pitch to the court, in the words of <a href=\"https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/opinion/alex-bell/1222015/alex-bell-when-your-best-defence-is-im-sleazy-but-not-criminal-its-nothing-to-smile-about/\" title=\"\">his own former speech-writer</a> this week, was \u201cI\u2019m sleazy but not criminal\u201d. Traditionally, voters punish divided parties.</p> <p>We shall soon see if that rule applies to the SNP. If \u2013 and it is an enormous \u201cif\u201d \u2013 one or more of the opposition parties gets its act together better, the SNP could struggle to win the decisive majority in 2021 that it seeks in order to increase the pressure for another referendum.</p> <p>Right now, all this awaits the outcome of the coronavirus emergency. All politics, even the SNP\u2019s internal battle, has to defer to the public health crisis. Yet the Covid-19 lockdown will play its part when politics resumes. The crisis puts Ms Sturgeon in the spotlight, and she is handling it well \u2013 more surely and fluently, for many, than Boris Johnson in London. Yet it is also the UK Treasury, with its deep pockets and borrowing ability, that has stood behind the Scottish economy as the crisis has brought Britain to a standstill. Scottish voters will have to factor both realities into their view of the SNP that eventually emerges from its own incipient civil war and the national crisis that now engulfs us all.</p>",

Multiple Republican politicians tweeted accusing Democrats of trying to usher in a Green New Deal with massive climate spending during a crisis.</p> <p>In the end, the stimulus package focused on direct aid to individuals and the worst-hit industries, while setting climate considerations aside.</p> <p>Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/\">Environmental Defense Fund</a>, said that while the situation for airlines and their workers was dire, the industry should have had to commit to slashing emissions as a condition of the aid.</p> <p>\u201cThe provisions we were focused on simply would hold the airlines to what they already said they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Petsonk said. \u201cPeople do not want to solve one crisis by making another crisis worse.\u201d The 2008 auto industry bailout, in comparison, led to stricter rules for pollution from vehicle tailpipes.</p> <p>The bill, the third in a series of stimulus packages, offers virtually nothing to climate advocates, but it is not the last word. Scott Segal, a lawyer and lobbyist with the firm Bracewell LLC, which represents energy industry clients, said a fourth stimulus deal was likely to involve \u201csignificant discussions of green objectives\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWas this a missed opportunity for climate? I think the answer to that is no,\u201d Segal said. \u201cThis stimulus package was primarily about getting money into the hands of individual households and workers and in some service sectors that were particularly hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Book, the managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm, said: \u201cCongress is going to be making more deals, and as long as there is a deal to be made, Democrats have made clear what they want.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats negotiated multiple measures meant to prevent abuse of the $500bn available in lending, including an oversight board, a special inspector general and provisions aimed at limiting Donald Trump\u2019s businesses from benefiting \u2013 an issue that has already come <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/virus-fineprint-stimulus-bill.html\">under scrutiny.</a></p> <p>But climate hawks said those stipulations were not strong enough. \u201cWhat makes this so frightening is that there are very few binding restrictions on how this money can be used that the secretary of treasury cannot waive,\u201d said Lukas Ross, a senior policy analyst with Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that [Trump\u2019s son-in-law ] Jared Kushner isn\u2019t going to get a subsidised line of credit.

As PA Media reports, in an email to staff, the inventor said his eponymous company designed the \u201cCoVent\u201d at the request of Boris Johnson, and promised to donate 5,000 to the international relief effort. Dyson said teams of engineers had been working solidly on the design since receiving the call from PM 10 days ago, and the UK government had placed an initial order of 10,000 units. He added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have received an initial order of 10,000 units from the UK government, which we will supply on an open-book basis.</p> \n   <p>We are also looking at ways of making it available internationally.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The company is now waiting for the design to receive regulatory approval so manufacturing can commence.</p> \n  <p>Created in partnership with Cambridge-based science engineering firm TTP, the new ventilator had to be safe, effective, efficient in conserving oxygen and portable, Dyson said. It also had to be bed-mounted, easy to use and not require a fixed air supply. The battery-powered machine has been designed for use in different settings, including field hospitals and when patients are being transported, PA reports.</p> \n  <p>In his email Dyson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The core challenge was how to design and deliver a new, sophisticated medical product in volume and in an extremely short space of time.

  "<p>The Spanish government has defended its response to the coronavirus pandemic as the death rate in the country slowed for the first time in a week, insisting its actions have always been firmly rooted in scientific advice.</p> \n<p>Spain recorded 655 deaths from Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 4,089, the health ministry said on Thursday.

  "<p>G20 leaders have committed to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to minimise the social and economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic, in a largely unspecific and uncontroversial joint communique issued after a video conference call.</p> \n<p>In a two-hour meeting the leaders agreed to assess gaps in pandemic preparedness and increase funding for research and development in vaccines and medicines, an area in which the G20 has shown an interest in the past.</p> \n<p>A call by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a doubling of its funding to $2tn was not addressed specifically in the communique. The statement said G20 members had undertaken a $5tn stimulus through targeted fiscal policy and insurance schemes, and members would look to increase funding to multilateral bodies as required. Central bank governors were urged to draw up an action plan in conjunction with finance ministers.</p> \n<p>G20 leaders, whose countries account for 80% of the world\u2019s GDP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/g20-hold-emergency-video-summit-discuss-coronavirus\">have been criticised</a> for failing to produce a quick response to the pandemic of the quality of that in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash.</p> \n<p>Their summit was due to be followed by a virtual meeting of EU leaders, whose countries were rebuked on Thursday morning by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, for \u201clooking out for themselves\u201d during the early phases of the crisis.</p> \n<p>Taking an unusually critical tone, von der Leyen said the story of the past few weeks had been partly a painful one. \u201cWhen Europe really needed an all-for-one spirit, too many initially gave an only-for-me response.\u201d</p> \n<p>She was referring to export bans on critical medical goods, as well as closures of borders, which have created delays in moving food and healthcare supplies around the bloc, especially in central Europe.</p> \n<p>An internal report by von der Leyen\u2019s team lamented that transport had been paralysed by border closures, leading to lorries being stuck in queues at EU internal borders for 24 hours. So far only three countries have followed the commission\u2019s advice to create \u201cgreen lanes\u201d with minimal checks to speed up traffic. An EU statement is due later on Thursday.</p> \n<p>The G20 communique said members were united in their response and they would use all available policy tools to minimise the economic and social damage, restore global growth, maintain market stability and strengthen resilience.</p> \n<p>In an assertion of the relevance of multilateralism, the communique said the pandemic was \u201ca powerful reminder of our interconnectedness and vulnerabilities\u201d, and the virus \u201crespects no borders\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, locked in a growing propaganda battle with the US over the cause of the outbreak, focused in his remarks on US trade barriers rather than a domestic Chinese fiscal stimulus as the best route to growth. He urged G20 members to boost the world economy by cutting tariffs, removing barriers and facilitating the unfettered flow of trade.</p> \n<p>China\u2019s economy ground to a halt in February as authorities shut factories and imposed drastic lockdowns. Since then it has started to recover, but that can only continue if western markets also bounce back.</p> \n<p>The communique committed to ensuring cross-border flow of vital medical supplies, agricultural products and other goods and services. Some countries have been withholding export permits of medicines or masks. </p> \n<p>Britain, in its main contribution to the discussions, offered an extra \u00a3210m to speed up vaccine development. The extra funding makes the UK the largest single contributor to the international coalition searching for a vaccine. </p> \n<p>In the only sideways reference to the row between China and the US, the G20 statement said: \u201cWe stress the importance of responsible communication to the public during this global health crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Wednesday G7 foreign ministers were unable to agree a joint communique after the US insisted Covid-19 be described as the Wuhan virus, in a reference to the city where it originated. On the other side, China has been trying to claim that US soldiers may have planted the virus there. </p> \n<p>The G20 communique reflected concern about the impact of the disease on health networks in poor countries. \u201cWe are gravely concerned with the serious risks posed to all countries, particularly developing and least developed countries, and notably in Africa and small island states,\u201d it said.</p> \n<p>Before the EU summit, France, Italy, Spain and six other member states called for \u201ca common debt instrument\u201d \u2013 in other words, a eurozone bond \u2013 to raise funds for all member states. But Germany, the Netherlands and Austria oppose any shared debt. </p>",

Areas of crossover include digital motors, battery packs, airflow analysis and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.</p> <p>Nor has Dyson been working alone. It teamed up with the Technology Partnership, a Cambridge-based melting pot of scientists and innovators, some of whom have significant medical experience.</p> <p>The government\u2019s medical and healthcare products and regulatory agency has also been looking at Dyson\u2019s plans. It has yet to give final approval for the CoVent but it has been involved in testing.</p> <p>Not everyone is happy about the way Dyson has gone about trumpeting its role in the effort. Dozens of companies are working on separate efforts to produce ventilators and all have kept their plans relatively secret until the government is ready to give an official update.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the green light to start talking about it and Dyson jumping the gun wasn\u2019t helpful to anyone,\u201d said a source at one company.</p> <p>The fact that the government has placed firm orders for 10,000 CoVents pending regulatory approval indicates that the plan has legs. Dyson has also promised to donate another 5,000 to aid global efforts to fight Covid-19, with 1,000 of them reserved for the UK.</p> <p>\u201cThe government will be looking at all options to make sure they have the right technology available to them,\u201d said Neil Campbell, whose company Inspiration Healthcare has a \u00a34m contract to import ventilators from overseas while the UK production effort gathers pace. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for an awful lot of ventilators and if someone has a plan you\u2019re going to look at it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Dyson is not a complete outlier in claiming it can design and build a ventilator \u2013 a complex and highly specialised piece of equipment \u2013 from scratch. The defence and engineering firm Babcock followed suit on Thursday, working in tandem with an unnamed company that already has expertise in the area.</p> <p>Sources in government and among industrial firms taking part in the effort say no one thinks of the various plans released by Dyson, Babcock and the Ventilator Challenge UK consortium as being in competition with one another.</p> <p>Rather, the government is adopting a blunderbuss approach, throwing as much ammunition as it can at a problem that cannot yet be quantified.</p>",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A small firm called Inspiration Healthcare has received a \u00a34m order from the NHS for which it will import hundreds of the devices \u2013 used to keep patients with respiratory problems breathing \u2013 from the US and Israel.</p> \n<p>Late on Thursday, the government said it would also join an EU scheme to procure ventilators, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\">initially said it would not take part</a> because it had missed an invitation to do so owing to a \u201ccommunication problem\u201d.</p> \n<p>A Westminster source said it made sense for the government to pursue multiple strategies in parallel to mitigate the risk of any one option failing.</p> \n<p>The firms involved are waiting for the government to go public with its plans but the delay in announcing them is not thought to be holding up the production effort.</p> \n<p>Dyson has revealed the most detail about its progress, including pictures of its CoVent prototype.

  "<p>Andrew has always wanted a cat of his own. When he was 10 he presented his parents with a dossier that laid out the case for getting him a kitten. His request was denied. Twenty-three years later, he brought home Maximum \u201cMax\u201d Tony Valentine, named in part after his grandfather.</p> <p>What better time to bring home an animal than during a global pandemic, right? All those days at home, all the soothing chin scratches at a time of profound anxiety. Andrew is self-isolating because he has a compromised immune system, which makes him especially vulnerable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a>. He and his fiance, Cameron, have just had to postpone their April wedding until the end of the year.</p> <p>This cat provides just the joy and solace they need.

Other shelters around the country are wondering what they\u2019re going to do with all the creatures in their care.</p> <p>The Australian Animal Protection Society, for example, has had to stop accepting new animals. It has also cut the cost of adopting a pet by half, to encourage people to take home an animal. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll be able to keep functioning,\u201d says the society\u2019s general manager, Megan Seccull. \u201cWe had 15 kittens this past weekend alone.

If the government tells us we have to close to the public, where will they all go?\u201d</p> <p>Seccull is hoping that people will at least volunteer to foster animals temporarily, through this crisis. Most animal shelters have a fostering system, where they recruit and train kind human beings to care for their animals until they can be adopted permanently. Anyone who can commit to caring for an animal for the rest of their lives might consider adoption.</p> <p>Meanwhile, RSPCA shelters around the country are bracing for drastic changes to the way they operate. They\u2019re losing volunteers and donations, as well as simply seeing fewer people turn up to meet their animals.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned about the impacts of the crisis \u2013 for example, people losing work or income and struggling to afford pet food and vet care bills,\u201d says Dr Sarah Zito, senior scientific officer at the RSPCA. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet seeing a significant increase in intake or more people surrendering their pets during the coronavirus pandemic \u2026 Sadly, we do expect this will happen over time. The likelihood of a drop in adoptions, donations and volunteer support, as well as an increase in surrenders is a very real concern for us at the moment.

  "<p>In a way I\u2019m glad that Kim Kardashian has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/24/kim-kardashian-west-accuses-taylor-swift-of-lying-over-leaked-tape-kanye\">reignited a four-year-old feud with Taylor Swift</a> based on an 11-year-old feud with Taylor Swift that was all started by Kanye West, a man who has hardly been involved in it since about 2017. In a way, that\u2019s good.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard not to [<em>gestures at current reality</em>] be constantly thinking about, you know, rather more pressing matters. The cleanliness of door handles, for example. The intensity of other people\u2019s coughs, or how far to veer away from each other on the pavements while out on your government-mandated walk. Whether you have enough food in the cupboards to last two weeks. Whether daytime TV will ever go back to normal. How deeply we can possibly scrape the bottom of the Netflix barrel. How desperate for entertainment we will have to be to plunge ourselves into going on YouTube and watching a vlog. Right now, these are my worries. It\u2019s nice of Kim Kardashian to try to distract me with something totally and utterly facile and pointless at a time of global crisis.</p> <p>On the other hand, come on. To help you catch up, this all truly started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/14/kanye-west-taylor-swift-vmas\">at the VMAs in 2009</a>, when Swift was 20 and Kardashian was three years away from even dating Kanye, in fact was still at the \u201cCarl\u2019s Jr advert and a guest appearance at WrestleMania\u201d level of fame. In 2016, Kanye released the song Famous, featuring the eternally controversial lyric: \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.\u201d Swift rightly took exception to having her career as one of the most successful singer-songwriters in global history getting reduced down to \u201cthat bitch\u201d.</p> <p>At which point Kardashian \u2013 now an ascendent, royalty-level celebrity, married in a palace \u2013 released a Snapchat video of Kanye on the phone to Swift before the song was even recorded, openly discussing the lyrical content. The intimation was: Swift knew about the lyric, she fully had the heads up, she can\u2019t be mad at being called \u201cthat bitch\u201d in one of the biggest songs of 2016, and by being in any way upset at being called \u201cthat bitch\u201d she is somehow Playing The Game. This is the natural starting point of our feud.</p> <p>I have gone through some changing feelings about Swift over the years, because I don\u2019t really like her music \u2013 which is a fine and normal opinion to have. But something about the hugeness of Swift, and her ubiquity, makes \u201cnot really liking the sounds she makes\u201d become something close to political. Here\u2019s a rough Marmite analogy for you. Swift is the semi-popular yeast spread Marmite, in that if you love her, you love her with an intensity that blocks out the sun; if you don\u2019t, she leaves you utterly cold. But because her songs constantly loop on the A-list of society, you cannot escape Marmite, and now you\u2019re starting to really get rubbed up the wrong way by Marmite.</p> <p>Every Friday afternoon, all the people in the office take control of the shared kitchen and make you eat a slice of bread and Marmite. At every wedding you are at, there is a tangible point in the evening when everyone, fuzzy drunk and joyful, kicks their shoes off and loudly heaps an entire spoon of Marmite into your mouth. Every time you tell someone you don\u2019t like Marmite, they bore on at you for ages about how much umami her new album adds to stews and bologneses. At this point, you cannot avoid Marmite, because every advert is for Marmite and every time Marmite releases a new jar, every headline is about Marmite, and how Marmite \u201cdid that\u201d. Despite not even liking Marmite, you somehow know about Marmite\u2019s thing with Tom Hiddleston where he wore that vest.</p> <p>And now your feelings about Marmite aren\u2019t about Marmite any more. They are fixed towards the celebratory Marmite culture that has been built around it, one you are constantly on the outside of, looking in. </p> <p>Anyway, this week the full and explicit 25-minute video of Kanye\u2019s call to Taylor in 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/24/kim-kardashian-west-accuses-taylor-swift-of-lying-over-leaked-tape-kanye\">got leaked</a>. It went a fair way to vindicating Swift and making it clear she was unprepared to be called \u201cthat bitch\u201d in the song. And Swift reacted to the leak <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1242206240618446850\">by posting</a> on Instagram: \u201cInstead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that <em>somebody</em> edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years) \u2026 SWIPE up to see what really matters.\u201d And she added a link to various charity organisations supporting those on low income in the whole global pandemic thing. Kardashian responded by going on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/1242299582136098821\">a Twitter rant</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s actually quite fascinating how badly Kardashian has played this one, because normally the dynasty is so good at upselling bad news in a way that just makes them richer and more adored. In the past few years they have managed to turn secret pregnancies, cheating scandals, Kanye\u2019s personal debt and the Kendall Jenner Pepsi advert into major PR wins. Each time, Kardashian somehow comes out of each one more regal and elegant and more on the cover of Vogue. </p> <p>But her feud with Swift has been a bum note from the off. What is it that Swift has been doing wrong, again? Being slightly too earnest in a hard-edged industry that clomps her around like a pair of shoes in a tumble dryer? Being gracefully tight-lipped in the face of years of provocation? Linking to a charity organisation on Instagram? Not liking being called a bitch? At this point, whatever your feelings about Marmite, it\u2019s really hard not to take its side in the face of relentless attempts by Nutella to reignite a feud with it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2e62ee2d03d431b021a58f5a5c1f8044db91e9b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e62ee2d03d431b021a58f5a5c1f8044db91e9b0/591_67_1229_1786/688.jpg\" alt=\"Britney Spears\" width=\"688\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comrade Britney rocks a revolutionary-red off-the-shoulder number</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>We\u2019ll meet you on the barricades, Britney!</h2> <p>A word on Comrade Britney, now, to whose revolution I offer humbly my hands and heart. While Kim Kardashian has been holed up in a Calabasas mansion going on about arguments that happened an entire World Cup cycle ago, Britney Spears has been a sunbeam of support to her fans throughout this pandemic, offering aid to those who are struggling and reaching out to her via DM. And, in really quite an unexpected zig, she has amplified an artist\u2019s call for a general strike and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/25/comrade-britney-spears-star-calls-for-strike-and-wealth-redistribution\">redistribution of wealth in the US</a>. All right, Britney, let\u2019s \u2026 all right man. Let\u2019s do this. Drag them out by their hair.</p> <p>On Instagram, Britney <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-FppKxAFxm/?utm_source=ig_embed\">shared</a> a quote from the writer Mimi Zhu, saying: \u201cDuring this time of isolation, we need connection now more than ever [\u2026] We will learn to kiss and hold each other through the waves of the web. We will feed each other, redistribute wealth, strike. We will understand our own importance from the places we must stay. Communion moves beyond walls. We can still be together.\u201d</p> <p>Personally, I\u2019m a little unsure how much of that Britney actually meant. Over the course of her long career, she has only touched on politics once or twice, endorsing the Iraq war, being registered in Louisiana as a Republican (in 2001) and, in 2017, encouraging her followers to support the Dream Act, which would have offered legal status to undocumented immigrants who went to school in the US. So, \u201ca mixed bag\u201d. But then, in a nice font and on an orange background, and talking so charmingly about reaching out to friends and family \u2026 it does sort of look like a generically wholesome Instagram quote, if you squint and look at it.</p> <p>Like \u2026 you really have to read down to see the bit about taking the wealth and striking hard. I still back her pivot to communism to the hilt. And who among us hasn\u2019t accidentally called for a revolution by sharing a meme they liked on Instagram? If she comes out of this with a Vegas show that calls for us to bring society crumbling down and rebuild it again from the rubble up, cool. And if she doesn\u2019t? That is also OK. Stay safe, Britney Spears. Stay golden.</p>",

For others, though, it was their first choice. We asked online learners and tutors for their tips on how to make it work.</p> <h2>Create a study area \u2026</h2> <p>Although you may be competing with others in your household, try to mark out a work space. \u201cEven if this is temporary each time you use it, place some physical objects around you to customise it. Make it comfortable,\u201d says Martin Weller, professor of educational technology at the Open University. Set boundaries with others. If your study space is now the kitchen table, try to get an agreement that it is yours alone for a set time period.</p> <h2>\u2026 and keep it tidy</h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to be disciplined to work at home, and even harder if the place is cluttered. \u201cIf you have piles of dishes or laundry around you it can be difficult to focus. I like to set a timer for 15 minutes and do a quick blitz of a room. It makes for a calmer environment,\u201d says Kimberley Lowe, who studied Spanish and English at the Open University.</p> <h2>Keep socialising</h2> <p>Although you may miss campus and socialising in person, reaching out and connecting with staff and other students can maintain a sense of community. Use the online systems to maintain social contact. Stephane Bignoux, senior lecturer in management at Middlesex University, says although it can feel lonely, posting on discussion boards and reading other student\u2019s posts can help. Set up informal discussions via Skype or FaceTime if you can.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/25/its-a-nightmare-how-coronavirus-is-wreaking-havoc-on-students-exams\">'It's a nightmare': how coronavirus is wreaking havoc on students' exams</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Reach out for help</h2> <p>Not everyone has access to a laptop and reliable wifi.

  "<p>Coronavirus testing checkpoints and isolation units could become features at grounds around the country this summer as English cricket explores the possibility of staging major matches behind closed doors.</p> <p>As it stands there will be no professional cricket in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/ecb-no-cricket-may-battles-save-season\" title=\"\">before 28 May at the earliest</a>, and the England and Wales Cricket Board is drafting possible schedules while it waits for the government to give sporting events the green light. There is no guarantee that crowds will be allowed in to grounds when this comes, however. When announcing the delay last week the ECB revealed it was looking into \u201cstarting the season behind closed doors\u201d and \u201cgiving sports fans the opportunity to watch live broadcast action\u201d.</p> <p>Steve Elworthy, the tournament director for last year\u2019s World Cup who has since become the ECB\u2019s director of events, is charged with exploring the logistics of this and has outlined the challenge. \u201cWe\u2019re mapping out what international matches would look like behind closed doors,\u201d Elworthy says.</p> <p>\u201cThe advice around mass gatherings [before the current period of lockdown] was 500 people or fewer. That was guided by the potential impact on critical services like paramedics and doctors.</p> <p>\u201cYou would likely have to work within that number, which includes teams, match officials, support staff, broadcasters and media, commercial partners, safety and security teams, third-party suppliers, replay screen operators, [the teams that control] the LED boards, ground staff, catering and more. </p> <p>\u201cThen you have to think about medical provisions, creating a safe and sterile environment around that venue, so that everyone who comes in is clear. So it\u2019s how you test them at the gate, the isolation units that you have to put in. These are all the considerations we are thinking about.\u201d</p> <p>The ECB\u2019s medical team is devising a protocol for how testing would work, as well as possible isolation booths for temporary use while anyone testing positive for Covid-19 waits to leave the ground. There can be around 1,500 people working on a normal major matchday, but it is believed this headcount can be shrunk to some 350 with no spectators, aided by the reduction in stewards and catering.</p> <p>However, Elworthy\u2019s events team must also consider transport and accommodation logistics for players, staff and officials in a way that ensures the desired \u201csterile\u201d bubble is not only upon arrival at the stadium. While operational manuals for staging domestic cricket behind closed doors will also be produced, internationals have the added complication of travel for the touring teams. Much hinges on the resumption of flights and the lifting of travel restrictions, such as quarantine periods.</p> <p>There are four sets of visitors scheduled in the men\u2019s game this year \u2013 West Indies, Australia, Pakistan and Ireland \u2013 each with scheduling issues to consider should fixtures need moving, while England\u2019s women are due to host South Africa and India.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re now thinking of all these things, the risks posed, and it just gets bigger and wider,\u201d Elworthy says. \u201cBut if that is the situation we are faced with then we will deliver on absolutely every single one of those to make sure it does happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"421a9db3d38ddce050051f32213a05e8d1a2038e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/421a9db3d38ddce050051f32213a05e8d1a2038e/831_113_3425_2056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cricket stewards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stewards huddle before play at the Lord\u2019s Test against India in 2011.

Two models in particular are proving popular: the Tyvek 800 J, featuring a hooded coverall, overtaped seams and self-adhesive zipper, and the Tyvek 600 Plus, which comes with attached socks and boot flaps.

There is a long history of personal protection, but not from bacteria, as scientists didn\u2019t have the understanding of it we do today.\u201d</p> <p>The origins of the modern hazmat suit lie in the Manchurian plague of 1910, where doctor <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4791421/\">Wu Lien-teh</a>, says Lynteris, \u201chad the theory that the plague was airborne and spread like the flu. He insisted that all doctors, nurses and burial staff wore a simple gauze mask he designed. It was the first time we had a mask devised for use during an epidemic.\u201d</p> <p>At first, Wu was ridiculed by his peers. But when a celebrated French doctor operated without a mask to prove Wu wrong and died days later, everything changed. He saved untold lives. By the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu\">Spanish flu</a> pandemic of 1918, masks were commonplace. Through the 20th century, the chemical and nuclear sector developed the modern hazmat suit, with medical versions coming into widespread use during the Ebola outbreaks of the 1990s.</p> <p>The public has always been fascinated by the sight of medical workers in protective gear. \u201cThe Manchurian plague was covered by the media across the globe,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cBecause newspapers could print photographs, people saw plague masks for the first time. It was a visually powerful image that worked well in black and white.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2791e846a0883e344abb2952488800a7a808624\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2791e846a0883e344abb2952488800a7a808624/0_0_1772_1119/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A doctor in protective clothing examines a man during the Manchurian plague, in 1911.

In movies and TV shows, hazmat suits evolved into an evocative signifier of peril and death. Part of the reason that the hazmat suit is so useful to film-makers is because it makes visible what cannot be seen to the naked eye: the threat to life posed by disease. The act of donning a hazmat suit and venturing into a stricken area is a visual representation of extreme heroism in films such as Outbreak, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sYSyuuLk5g\">Contagion</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BvKZMg2LjU\">Flu</a>. \u201cThey are a great prop to visualise danger,\u201d Lynteris says.</p> <p>The 1995 pandemic blockbuster <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuuvllUlHCE\">Outbreak</a> begins with the reflection of a dying man in the mask of epidemiologist Dustin Hoffman\u2019s hazmat suit and the actors wear little else throughout. \u201cDustin was more miserable than he has ever been in his life, wearing that suit \u2013 they were boiling,\u201d says Outbreak<em> </em>costume designer Erica Edell Phillips. The distinctive blue and yellow suits were modelled on those used in the field. Phillips used airflow packs to prevent the helmets from fogging up and remodelled the helmets so the actors\u2019 faces could be seen. \u201cWe wanted the suits to look real, but to have some style,\u201d she says.Warner Bros later rented out her suits to films and TV shows: \u201cThey became the<em> </em>definitive biohazard suit for decades.\u201d </p> <p>The wearing of hazmat suits is central to the plot of Outbreak, underscoring the danger medical personnel confront for the greater good. A scientist who breaches his hazmat suit dies a bloody death. Another character accidentally sticks herself with a needle through the suit: the hazmat suit is imperfect, the boundary between life and death only a scalpel nick away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fabaf9eb9d98ffb302e24e714445f4acbc10e8bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fabaf9eb9d98ffb302e24e714445f4acbc10e8bc/0_92_2912_1905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They became the definitive biohazard suit for decades\u2019 ...

But they are also someone who promises to restore society.\u201d The hazmat suit signals a looming catastrophe: in these films, a pandemic is usually accompanied by the collapse of society. (In Contagion, Matt Damon watches as home raiders murder his neighbours; in <em> </em>Flu, screaming shoppers descend locust-like on a supermarket.) \u201cThe epidemiologist is the rational person who brings society back from catastrophe,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cThey are Noah, the person who will save humanity and restore social order.\u201d</p> <p>The hazmat suit creates a barrier between humanity and nature. Nature is conceived as hostile, full of threat. The opening scene of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksGH1NN8TBA\">I Am Legend </a>shows Times Square overgrown by vegetation following a global pandemic. \u201cThe virus is a revenge of nature,\u201d Lynteris says. \u201cIt decimates humanity, and then nature flourishes.\u201d The hazmat suit represents humanity\u2019s resistance to this existential crisis. Like a knight going into battle in a jangling suit of armour, the epidemiologist dons the hazmat suit to wage war on nature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f6289c2cc1cdea86f55a53267cc7bd2697fae45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f6289c2cc1cdea86f55a53267cc7bd2697fae45/0_23_960_1257/764.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It\u2019s when the taking it off that people get infected\u2019 ... doctors Joseph Fair and Sheik Umar Khan at work.

Meaning that, right now, we are at war with coronavirus \u2013 and the medical personnel you see wearing hazmat suits are soldiers. But as any soldier knows, in war there are casualties. \u201cIt\u2019s still difficult for me to talk about,\u201d says virologist Dr Joseph Fair of his friend Dr Sheik Umar Khan, his voice thick with emotion. </p> <p>In 2014, they worked side by side in Sierra Leone. A staff of around 17 medics had to cope with hundreds of Ebola patients. \u201cThe walls of the hospital were covered in blood, vomit, and stools,\u201d says Fair. \u201cThere was no one to clean them because all the cleaners had died.\u201d When Khan contracted Ebola, Fair desperately tried to arrange a medevac. Two days later, Fair received word that <a href=\"Kinema\">Khan</a> had died. \u201cI completely broke down,\u201d he says. Khan was buried in Kenema, alongside the people he died trying to save.</p> <p>Fair believes Khan contracted Ebola when taking off his PPE. \u201cThe protective equipment is solid, but it\u2019s when taking it off that people get infected. You are exhausted, you have worked for 23 hours with no sleep; inside the suits, it\u2019s like wearing a garbage bag in sub-Saharan Africa, so you\u2019re sweating non-stop, dehydrated and hungry. Your first inclination when you walk outside is to get the damn thing off as quickly as possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSafely removing a PPE requires meticulous concentration,\u201d says Dr JaHyun Kang of Seoul National University and Harvard\u2019s TH Chan school of public health, who has conducted research showing how medical workers can contaminate themselves during the removal of hazmat suits. \u201cWe need to develop better PPE out of more breathable material, so medical workers don\u2019t get so hot and aren\u2019t in such a rush to get them off,\u201d she says. \u201cWe also need to standardise the PPE protocols and train healthcare personnel so they become confident about how to remove PPE without contamination.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e308991e301b34e03e4340cfae6484d62ee91b17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e308991e301b34e03e4340cfae6484d62ee91b17/0_109_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A hazmat suit looming over you is not something you ever want to see, but it is better than a lonely room, with no medical intervention.

In 2015, a team at Johns Hopkins University redesigned the hazmat suit to make removal safer. In addition to simplifying the zips and improving the cooling system, they created more transparency around the face. \u201cWe tried to make the face very visible \u2026 [That is] really important for someone on their deathbed,\u201d one of the researchers <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/01/brilliantly-designed-hazmat-suit-ebola-workers/\">told Wired</a>. But these suits are not yet in widespread use.</p> <p>Making hazmat suits less alienating can save lives. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa, infected people avoided medical personnel because their hazmats were frightening. This is an age-old problem: just as in those Ebola-stricken villages, 17th-century plague victims cowered from doctors in their beak suits, Lynteris says.</p> <p>On a fundamental level, being treated by a medical worker whose face is obscured has a dehumanising effect. The patient realises they are no longer just a person, but a vector of disease. A hazmat suit looming over you \u2013 well, it\u2019s not something you ever want to see. But it is better than the alternative: a lonely room, with no medical intervention at all. Because, although the person in a hazmat suit may seem far away, or even uncaring, they are doing the most humane thing imaginable: putting themselves in harm\u2019s way, to save a stranger\u2019s life.</p> <p><br></p>",

Other teams are now expected to follow suit.</p> <p>Bremner was aptly described as \u201c10 stone of barbed wire\u201d on the pitch but he would surely have approved of the current Leeds captain Liam Cooper\u2019s role in negotiating an arrangement designed to prevent the loss of homes and livelihoods.

An awful lot of hard work \u2013 mental as well as physical \u2013 has gone into reaching this position but the bigger picture has been grasped.</p> <p>Already Bielsa\u2019s squad have donated sufficient money to prevent the largely matchday-funded Leeds fans\u2019 food bank from folding, while individual players, most notably Cooper and Stuart Dallas, have gone into role-model mode, using social media to promote social distancing. Holbeck Together, a local charity helping the elderly, has received the club\u2019s entire food stocks.</p> <p>Cooper and company can only hope the Elland Road larders will be refilled and the season eventually concluded with the team still in the top two.

Their planned Google hangout \u201cmight become unmanageable otherwise,\u201d says Hardcastle.</p> <p>Communities have not just formed online; they have migrated there. \u201cReal life\u201d book clubs more disciplined than mine have already relocated to virtual meeting rooms such as Google Hangouts, or the suddenly ubiquitous video-conferencing platform <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2020/mar/25/zoom-the-29bn-video-call-app-youd-never-heard-of-until-coronavirus\">Zoom</a>.</p> <p>Sarah West, an academic based in York, has hosted her seven-person book club around her dining table each month, for three years. Last Monday, they gathered to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/08/supper-club-lara-williams-review-cooking-storm\">Lara Williams\u2019 Supper Club</a> on Zoom. After initial hellos \u2013 \u201cso that we could see each other\u2019s setup: \u2018Here I am sitting on the sofa with a cup of tea\u2019, \u2018Here I am at my table with a glass of wine\u2019\u201d \u2013 cameras were turned off to save on bandwidth and batteries.</p> <p>Without cues from body language, and with only one person able to speak at a time, the discussion required \u201cmore active management\u201d than usual, says West. But \u201cit went really well \u2013 so well that I woke up the next day and thought, \u2018God, I haven\u2019t cleaned up after book club last night.\u2019 It was quite a long time before I went downstairs and realised it had just been me, sat on the sofa. It felt really genuine.\u201d</p> <p>With her energies split between work and her two young children, West says it was a relief to find that her book club would not be disrupted. \u201cI have confidence that, at least once a month, it\u2019s going to feel like I\u2019ve had a night off, being sociable.\u201d</p> <p>The relaxed formality of book clubs might be a boon as we adjust to the age of the \u201cvideo hang\u201d, lending structure to an unfamiliar and often stilted interaction. Virtual pub quizzes are proving similarly popular right now.</p> <p><a href=\"https://pamcottman.com/\">Pam Cottman</a>\u2019s book club, based in Beaconsfield, has moved through several platforms in 15 years \u2013 from email to WhatsApp and now, Zoom. All bar two of the eight active members are over 60; Cottman predicts that their first virtual meeting next Tuesday, to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/05/invention-wings-monk-kidd-review\">The Invention of Wings by Sue Monk Kidd</a>, will mostly be given over to tech troubleshooting. But as a former teacher turned resilience coach, she says connection, community and \u201cholding on to a bit of normality\u201d will be crucial to weathering the weeks and months to come.</p> <p>Books themselves can help to inspire resilience, says Cottman \u2013 her group\u2019s last pick, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/02/mind-power-in-auschwitz-and-healing-decades-later-edith-eger\">The Choice by Edith Eger</a>, an Auschwitz survivor, is a case in point. \u201cIn so many stories of challenge and trauma, there\u2019s hope and positivity and that mindset shift that enables us to keep going,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Macfarlane says that he chose The Living Mountain \u2013 a \u201cmasterpiece of close observation\u201d of the Cairngorm mountains in Scotland, and the book he has given as a gift more than any other \u2013 so as to venture beyond our quarantine confines. \u201cObviously we can\u2019t reach distant landscapes at the moment, but we can read and dream our way into them,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0bb30914b21c381b0f4ed8ce383709186839f16b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bb30914b21c381b0f4ed8ce383709186839f16b/0_11_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"While films such as Contagion (pictured) have experienced a resurgence, book clubs are steering clear of virus talk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">While films such as Contagion (pictured) have experienced a resurgence, book clubs are steering clear of virus talk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shepherd wrote the slender volume during the second world war, and her reflections on love, loss and goodness are set against a backdrop of distant disaster. Macfarlane calls it a \u201cbook of beauty born of crisis\u201d, with echoes of the one that we are currently facing; but, as the first choice for #CoReadingVirus, it is \u201cneither a work of escapism nor a work that confronts\u201d coronavirus head-on.</p> <p>His ambitions for his book club are modest, Macfarlane says, but not frivolous. \u201cI don\u2019t see reading as turning away from what\u2019s happening. Dreaming other places into being, other ways of being \u2013 these are powerful needs.\u201d</p> <p>It is noteworthy that as the 2011 medical-thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion\">Contagion has experienced a resurgence</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/05/pandemic-netflixs-new-series-about-global-outbreaks-is-eerily-timed-and-moved-me-to-tears\">docu-series Pandemic trends</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/05/pandemic-netflixs-new-series-about-global-outbreaks-is-eerily-timed-and-moved-me-to-tears\"> on Netflix</a>, none of the book clubs I spoke to had themed their reading material around the coronavirus. It suggests, that in connecting over literature, we are seeking to align over a common experience \u2013 other than our shared experience of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cI think escapism is going to be the way forward,\u201d says West, of her book club.

  "<p>Landowners have been told to stop burning moorland for grouse shooting after firefighters condemned them for using up valuable emergency resources at a time when the the UK is fighting the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The Moorland Association, an industry body for landowners, said this week landowners must stop any controlled burning. The instruction came after a managed fire in West Yorkshire got out of control and spread into a mile-long fire front.</p> <p>West Yorkshire fire brigade urged all landowners to cease controlled burning after the uncontained moorland fire at Deer Hill reservoir in Marsden tied up firefighters for days.</p> <p>The fire brigade said: \u201cWe are currently trying to focus our resources on supporting the national effort to respond to coronavirus and this is unhelpful to us. We will be making every effort to contact landowners over the forthcoming days and to reiterate this message.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not where we want to be focusing our energies at this time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/20/grouse-moors-owners-threaten-government-with-legal-action\">Grouse moors owners threatened government with legal action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Campaigners say their request was ignored by many landowners, and this week the Moorland Association stepped in to call for landowners to cease burning.</p> <p>The association said: \u201cFollowing the increased risks of wildfire and Covid-19 restrictions we have supported the suspension of heather burning and have advised our members to use cutting instead.\u201d</p> <p>Landowners burn moorland to remove old shoots and expose new shoots that are a source of food for grouse, in preparation for the shooting season. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/20/grouse-moors-owners-threaten-government-with-legal-action\">They have threatened to take legal action</a> if the government imposes a ban on burning.</p> <p>Moorland burning is condemned by environmentalists, and the environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, has promised to put an end to the burning with a new law. He has said legislation is necessary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/29/grouse-shooting-estates-face-ban-on-burning-of-peat-bogs\">because a voluntary approach has not worked.</a></p> <p>Peat bogs, a threatened moorland habitat, are one of the UK\u2019s biggest carbon stores, yet they are intensively managed by grouse moor estates, who burn the moorland heather to maximise numbers of grouse for shooting.</p> <p>Green campaigners argue the burning harms the environment and wildlife by releasing climate-changing gases into the atmosphere, worsening flooding and degrading a precious habitat.</p> <p>The Peak District national park \u2013 where several moorland fires have got out of control, has also asked people to cease burning.</p> <p>Sarah Fowler, the park\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAt a time when our emergency services are already under enormous strain as a result of Covid-19, it is vital that we do not add to this pressure.</p> <p>\u201cWith these services already stretched, we cannot expect our fire crews to attend incidents that are putting their teams in close proximity to each other, as well as the risk placed on moorland managers not being able to heed the need for social distancing, and taking fire crews to often remote locations. Our focus must rightly be on supporting the coronavirus response for all our local communities.\u201d</p> <p>Fowler said it was unacceptable the burning was taking place at a time when many wildlife species were at the beginning of their breeding season. The burning season begins on 1 October and lasts until April.</p> <p>Campaigners said a curb on burning should be made permanent. Luke Steele, a spokesman for Ban Bloodsports on Yorkshire\u2019s Moors, said: <em>\u201c</em>It speaks volumes that it has taken grouse shoot operators sparking a mile-long fire on Meltham Moor during a national emergency to persuade the Moorland Association to call off the burning season.<em><br><br>\u201c</em>Burning moorland on sensitive peatland degrades ecosystems releases climate-altering gases into the atmosphere and worsens flooding and wildfire risk.\u201d<br><br>Steele said there had been more than 550 burning incidents recorded on Yorkshire\u2019s moors since October, including fires that had started after the request to cease from the West Yorkshire fire brigade. He said it was time the government ensured the burning season ended for good.</p> <p>The Moorland Association said they decided to ask for burning to be suspended after being contacted by a large number of landowners who had already ceased controlled burning.</p> <p>Amanda Anderson, director of the MA said: \u201cControlled burning is an important tool in managing our moorlands when used in the right place at the right time. This is not the right time.\u201d</p>",

doing TV and radio interview this morning talking about the grim state of the airline industry.</p> \n  <p>He told ABC TV that about 1,000 of the 8,000 staff the airline stood down on Wednesday will probably be made redundant, AAP reports.</p> \n  <p>Earlier, speaking on ABC radio, he said that every airline in the world would need government money to survive if the coronavirus crisis went on too long and hit back at Qantas boss <strong>Alan Joyce.</strong></p> \n  <p>As Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/23/virgin-australia-qantas-accc-investigate-campaign-competition\">reported on Monday,</a> Scurrah has complained to competition tsar <strong>Rod Sims </strong>about Joyce\u2019s public campaigning against Virgin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/24/rod-sims-accc-virgin-australia-stoush-qantas-coronavirus\">prompting Sims to tell Qantas to knock it off.</a> Scurrah said nobody knew how long the crisis would go for.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf it goes too long, there won\u2019t be an airline in the world that can survive without government support,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Asked by host <strong>Fran Kelly</strong> about his complaint to Sims, Scurrah said he would \u201ctake any action I need to to make sure we get through this and our reputation is intact\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe need a strong aviation sector that can provide competitive pricing, it\u2019s in the public interest and it\u2019s in the tourism industry\u2019s interests as well.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked about Joyce\u2019s sledge that the Australian government should not support \u201ca company that\u2019s owned by Singaporeans, Chinese, Abu Dhabi and a British billionaire\u201d \u2013 a clear reference to Virgin\u2019s shareholders.</p> \n  <p>Scurrah agreed that they should be approached for money first, saying: \u201cAs a responsible company, yeah, we have to make sure that if and when we need cash that we try every avenue we possibly can.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He dodged questions about how long the airline could survive with its fleet largely grounded, but said any bailout of the industry should be for everyone.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat I have said to the government is that if this goes on for a prolonged period, every airline will be turning to the government for assistance \u2013 it won\u2019t be

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>WHO sees \u2018encouraging signs\u2019 in Europe</h2> <p>The World Health Organi\u200bzation says it is encouraged by the lower rate of new infection in Italy. Its regional director, Hans Kluge, said: \u201cWhile the situation remains very serious, we are starting to see some encouraging signs. Italy, which has the highest number of cases in the region, has just seen a slightly lower rate of increase.\u201d</p> <h2>Slower rise in deaths reported in Spain</h2> <p>Spain has announced \u200ba further 655 coronavirus fatalities, taking the country\u2019s total to more than 4,000. As the increase is below the daily rise recorded on Wednesday it offers support to government claims that the rise in deaths in Spain is stabilising.</p> <h2>India announces stimulus package</h2> <p>India has announced a 1.7tn-rupee ($22.5bn/\u00a318.9bn) economic stimulus plan to help millions of people \u200baffected by a nationwide lockdown. \u201cWe do not want anyone to remain hungry,\u201d said the finance minister. He said the government aims to distribute 5 kilograms of staple foodgrains wheat or rice for each person free of charge, with a kilogram of pulses for every low-income family, helping to feed about 800 million poor people over the next three months.</p> <h2>Iran posts record rise in cases</h2> <p>The health ministry confirmed another 157 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours, taking Iran\u2019s total to 2,234 fatalities. A record 2,389 new cases had been recorded over the same period. Five days ago, the numbers being infected daily was below 900.</p> <h2>Moscow shuts down as Russia bans flights</h2> <p>Moscow has announced it will close restaurants, bars, parks, and shops other than grocery stores and pharmacies. It came as Russia posted record growth of confirmed coronavirus cases for the second day in a row. Russia now has 840 cases, a rise \u200bof 182 in 24 hours. The Kremlin has \u200b halted all international air traffic, both for airlines and charter flights, excluding flights repatriating Russian citizens to the country.</p> <h2>US deaths exceed 1,000 as Senate approves $2.2tn package</h2> <p>US deaths from the coronavirus pandemic have topped 1,000. Worldwide, the death toll climbed past 21,000, according to a running count kept by Johns Hopkins University, and the US had 1,046 deaths and nearly 70,000 infections. The US Senate passed a $2.2tn emergency relief package marking the biggest rescue deal of its kind in US history.</p> <h2>Only new imported cases reported in China</h2> <p>China reported no new locally transmitted cases for the second day in a row. Mainland China did, however, report an increase in the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases, all of which involved travellers arriving from abroad. Almost one in five coronavirus cases in Singapore are among people who travelled from London. </p> <h2>WTO warns the economic downturn will be worse than 2008</h2> <p>The economic downturn and job losses caused by the pandemic is likely to be worse than the 2008 recession, according to World Trade Organization projections.</p>",
  "<h2>25. Larry Crowne (2011)</h2> <p>Yikes. This was one of the Hankster\u2019s two directorial credits and it is a dull and lifeless autumn-years romcom, with Hanks playing opposite Julia Roberts, who is every bit as uneasy as the man himself.</p> <h2>24. Elvis Has Left the Building (2004)</h2> <p>Hanks has a cameo as a dead Elvis Presley impersonator here; ironic, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/tom-hanks-coronavirus-actor-and-wife-rita-wilson-test-positive-in-australia\">he got Covid-19 while on location in Australia filming Baz Luhmann\u2019s Elvis biopic</a>, in which he was due to play Presley\u2019s manager, Colonel Tom Parker.</p> <h2>23. The Da Vinci Code (2006) / Angels &amp; Demons (2009)</h2> <p>Hanks is the dashing Harvard symbologist Dr Robert Langdon, who deciphers occult signs in Renaissance artworks about Jesus in these clunky adaptations of the bestsellers by Dan Brown (whose books had specified that the hero resembled Harrison Ford).</p> <h2>22. The \u2019Burbs (1989)</h2> <p>A nosy suburbanite obsessed with his neighbours\u2019 supposed dirty dealings? That\u2019s the role here with which Hanks does his best. Maybe it would have worked better if he was the straightahead good guy whose innocent pastimes were misinterpreted.</p> <h2>21. Road to Perdition (2002)</h2> <p>A darker role for Hanks; notable, although it doesn\u2019t really play to his strengths. He plays a mob hitman in 1930s Chicago who, with his small son in tow, is going to track down the guys who killed most of his family. A high-minded oddity on his CV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"166c278246beebb078b241004a42eb87afe082ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/166c278246beebb078b241004a42eb87afe082ef/433_0_3071_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aaron Eckhart and Tom Hanks in Sully.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aaron Eckhart and Tom Hanks in Sully.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>20. Sully (2016)</h2> <p>Clint Eastwood directed Hanks in this true-life hagiopic about the heroic airline pilot Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger III who, with staggering coolness under pressure, landed his damaged US Airways Flight 1549 on New York\u2019s Hudson river and got all 155 passengers and crew off unscathed, only later to suffer an investigation from the contemptible pen-pushers and corporate bean-counters. Not a bad role for Hanks, but it doesn\u2019t quite come to life.</p> <h2>19. Catch Me If You Can (2002)</h2> <p>Hanks is the cool counterweight to a young Leonardo DiCaprio here; he plays the stolid, even-tempered FBI man on the trail of DiCaprio\u2019s notorious teenage conman in this stranger-than-fiction true story. While DiCaprio fakes being a lawyer or an airline pilot, Hanks is the authentic authority figure, who seems to have a sneaking admiration for DiCaprio\u2019s ingenious illegal hi-jinks.</p> <h2>18. Turner &amp; Hooch (1989)</h2> <p>Playing opposite a big adorable dog is something only an adorable actor can do. Hanks plays a cop called Turner, who has to take care of a big, sloppy lovable dog called Hooch who is the only witness to his owner\u2019s murder. There is joint relatability and some inter-species chemistry, it has to be admitted, and this film played an important part in establishing Hanks\u2019s brand identity.</p> <h2>17. Charlie Wilson\u2019s War (2007)</h2> <p>Again, it is weird here to see Hanks play someone who is not the good guy. He is playing something of a cynical slimeball in this true-life political drama from the screenwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/aaron-sorkin\">Aaron Sorkin</a> and the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/nov/20/mike-nichols\">Mike Nichols</a>. Hanks is the 80s Reagan-era congressman Wilson who masterminded the covert war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He brings natural charisma and presence, but the part-sentimental-part-cynical vibe feels wrong.</p> <h2>16. The Terminal (2004)</h2> <p>Hanks is not like Meryl Streep: accents are not his thing. But here he is giving us an outrageous Ryussh-yun ick-syent as a wacky innocent from a fictional ex-Soviet state who has to live hobo-ishly in New York\u2019s JFK airport terminal building when a coup back home renders him stateless. Stanley Tucci plays the flustered immigration officer who has to deal with him. As so often in Hanks\u2019s CV, his mojo would work better as the kindly authority figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbde80e360b9d53045aedf687b261bd002c86b26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbde80e360b9d53045aedf687b261bd002c86b26/0_61_2649_1589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks in Cast Away.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks in Cast Away.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Allstar/DreamWorks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>15. Cast Away (2000)</h2> <p>Robert Zemeckis\u2019s film, with Hanks as the FedEx employee who is marooned on a desert island, is taken very seriously by Hanks fans; the initial \u201ccrash\u201d scene is certainly a corker, and Hanks is also a likable castaway with his tattered trousers and straggly beard, capering with self-congratulatory delight when he makes fire for the first time. But there is something a bit silly about this; with anyone less seductive than Hanks, it would have sunk.</p> <h2>14. Saving Mr Banks (2014)</h2> <p>In his senior years, Hanks has a new mastery of playing iconic real-life figures who are part of the US\u2019s pop-cultural landscape. Here he is playing Walt Disney; really, no other casting was possible. He is the kindly, persistent movie impresario persuading Emma Thompson\u2019s cantankerous author PL Travers into letting him do a film version of her creation Mary Poppins. As ever, Hanks is a genius at embodying pure likability and his Disney has to be a nice guy (there is no question of mentioning the <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2013/12/walt-disney-anti-semitism-racism-sexism-frozen-head.html\">darker sides</a> to Disney\u2019s personality). In fact, most people will assume that Disney was naturally like Tom Hanks.</p> <h2>13. Sleepless in Seattle (1993) / You\u2019ve Got Mail (1998)</h2> <p>Maybe it is wrong to bracket these together, at least partly because Sleepless in Seattle is appreciably better: lighter of touch, lighter in heart. In SiS, Hanks is still in his big-haired younger-man mode, but by YGM, he is older with smaller hair. But, of course, it is still very much Hanks in each case conducting a poignantly/hilariously long-range relationship with Meg Ryan and jointly becoming the nation\u2019s sweethearts. They work well together, without a doubt.</p> <h2>12. The Post (2017)</h2> <p> Hanks is an actor born to work with Steven Spielberg; in many ways, he is the actorly embodiment of what Spielberg is as a director, and he gives a richly entertaining and watchable performance as the renowned Washington Post editor and liberal lion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/22/ben-bradlee-washington-post-alan-rusbridger\">Ben Bradlee</a>, sparring amiably with his boss Kay Graham (Streep) as they chase the Pentagon Papers scoop in 1971, which paved the way for the paper\u2019s Watergate investigation. In this role, Hanks delivers pure Jimmy Stewart decency straight into your veins.</p> <h2>11. Splash (1984)</h2> <p>A great early role for the boyish and unthreateningly cherubic Hanks, who at the time was considered by some pundits insufficiently like a leading man. He is the single guy who falls for the mermaid who saves him from drowning and who comes to Manhattan to get wet and reveal her true nature in his bathtub \u2013 although the film adroitly swims around the potential for smut. Darryl Hannah is terrific in this (and there is a Hollywood sexism story to be told in the list of Hanks\u2019s female leads whose careers have faded while his has motored ever onward). Hanks first sneakily gained cinemagoers\u2019 love in this film, as the boy-next-door who is the man-next-door.</p> <h2>10. Philadephia (1993)</h2> <p>A key moment in Hanks\u2019s early-90s golden age, winning an Oscar in this courtroom drama for playing a gay man who contracts HIV and sues his employer for wrongful dismissal. In some ways, the film conforms to the \u201cliberal balancing\u201d template by pairing Hanks with Denzel Washington as his personal-injury lawyer who is a soon-to-be-reformed homophobe, and there is a new debate now about straight actors playing gay. But nothing could have signalled empathy and respect more clearly than casting Hanks. It is a Hollywood \u201cissue\u201d movie, yes, with the self-consciousness that this implies; but Hanks brings intelligence and sensitivity.</p> <h2>9. Captain Phillips (2013)</h2> <p>You do not expect to see Tom Hanks in an action movie, but that is what\u2019s happening in this gripping hijack thriller from the director Paul Greengrass, based on a true story. Hanks plays the merchant navy captain in charge of a colossal container ship as it sails round the Horn of Africa, a great big slow-moving easy target for Somali pirates with semi-automatic rifles, motivated by poverty. Hanks gives a great performance as the authority figure under stress; the good guy who, like everyone else, is at the mercy of the vast globalised forces of capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e63665bcf41b7bbb10de084390138aeeaf507360\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e63665bcf41b7bbb10de084390138aeeaf507360/0_45_2555_1533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Loggia and Tom Hanks in Big.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Loggia and Tom Hanks in Big.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th C Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>8.<strong> </strong>Big (1988)</h2> <p>This fantasy comedy, directed by Penny Marshall and written by Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg (sister of Steven), features Hanks in his \u00fcber-Hanks role, the breakout part that really did put him on the map. It is a role that speaks to everyone who feels in their heart that they are impostors, deeply implausible as adults and basically bewildered (or excited) little kids. Hanks plays Josh Baskin, the boy who resents the rules laid down for kids, wishes to be big and then \u2026 well \u2026 be careful what you wish for. Like no one else, Hanks could persuasively embody an adult with adult presence who is nonetheless someone with a child\u2019s innocence and fun. (Try to imagine Tom Cruise doing it, and you realise how quickly it could be a scary movie.) It is never better demonstrated than in the giant toy piano scene, with Hanks joyously dancing on the keys.</p> <h2>7.<strong> </strong>Saving Private Ryan (1998)</h2> <p>Another great Spielberg-Hanks pairing, with Hanks rising to the challenge of a big movie on a big subject. He is the everyman hero Captain Miller in the second world war after D-day who leads a platoon whose purpose is to find Private Ryan (Matt Damon) on the field of battle and order him home on compassionate grounds, because all his brothers have been killed. Importantly, Miller is not a professional soldier, but a teacher in civilian life, someone who feels the burden of leadership keenly, but with great modesty and seriousness: a matter of civic values rather than macho heroism. He also has to try concealing that he has a tremor in his hand. The paradox of Hanks is that he is pure Hollywood star quality mixed with self-effacement and it works very well in a drama where the huge impacts of warfare distract you from the acting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3c19ed403739f50e780da4ba3f1f419c2bac75d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3c19ed403739f50e780da4ba3f1f419c2bac75d/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks in Bridge of Spies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks in Bridge of Spies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/DreamWorks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6. Bridge of Spies (2015)</h2> <p>One of the very few Hanks movies in his later period in which he goes toe-to-toe with an actor of equal heavyweight stature \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/05/bridge-of-spies-film-review-tom-hanks-steven-spielberg-cold-war-gary-powers-u2\">the result</a> is a balanced double act, rather than a Hanks leading turn. Mark Rylance plays the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in early 60s America, whom the US government was about to hand over to the Russians in a spy-swap at the Glienicke bridge linking east and west Berlin, the \u201cbridge of spies\u201d. This hair-raisingly dangerously manoeuvre is planned by Abel\u2019s modest but courageous lawyer James Donovan, played of course by Hanks; a man whose amateur enthusiasm and impulsiveness marks him out as a non-diplomat, but someone who nonetheless gets things done. Hanks\u2019s Donovan is superb: homely, wily and sweet, an inspired straight man to the deadpan humour of Rylance\u2019s spy. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d Hanks asks Rylance, who comes back with: \u201cWould it help?\u201d</p> <h2>5. A League of Their Own (1992)</h2> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no crying in baseball!\u201d Hanks delivers a classic axiom in this Penny Marshall gem, about the foundation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during the second world war. He is the grumpy former baseball star who hit the skids due to booze, and is now given his comeback chance by managing what he derisively thinks is an absurd novelty: a female baseball team, featuring Geena Davis, Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Madonna. It\u2019s when he yells at right-fielder Evelyn Gardner (played by Bitty Schram) for screwing up that she begins to cry, and he lets her have it with that iconic line. Perhaps this is the one and only time that Hanks fully inhabits an unsympathetic role, and that is probably only because we know it\u2019s just temporary, and that he is basically a father/brother figure, subordinate to the women and bound to be redeemed by them.</p> <h2>4. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019)</h2> <p>If Hanks has a late-period masterpiece, it is his extraordinary work in this film about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/23/everyone-said-dont-ruin-my-childhood-director-marielle-heller-on-how-her-mr-rogers-film-finally-got-made\">the real-life US children\u2019s TV presenter Fred Rogers</a> in the late-90s, when he was sliding out of fashion and a little derided by the media establishment. However, he succeeds in profoundly impressing a cynical hardbitten magazine journalist (played by Matthew Rhys) who has come to interview him. This is a genuinely complex, difficult-to-read performance from Hanks, who creates an amazingly detailed, eccentric collection of physical and vocal mannerisms based on the real Rogers, quite different from the aw-shucks routine that people might more readily associate with him. It is especially amazing when he asks Rhys to remain absolutely silent with him over lunch in a restaurant for a solid minute so that they can reflect on the people important to them.</p> <h2>3.<strong> </strong>Forrest Gump (1994)</h2> <p>Look upon the colossal importance of Forrest Gump in Hanks\u2019s career and in 90s Hollywood generally, ye mighty arbiters of taste, and despair! If not despair, exactly, then sadly concede the massive showbusiness firepower that Hanks brought to this folksy parable of \u2026 what exactly? Robert Zemeckis (second only to Marshall and Spielberg as a Hanks director) shot this Zelig-ish, or John Irving-ish story of a young man growing up in the 50s with learning difficulties (as no one then phrased it) and a low IQ, whose essential innocence, niceness and luck cause him to rise to greatness, with a college football career, distinguished service in Vietnam, mastery of table-tennis, a thriving shrimp-fishing business and then brilliance in stock-market investment \u2013 and he becomes a national celebrity for running across the whole country. It is the walk and halting voice that nail it (he was to modify it a little bit, arguably, for his performance in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood). Forrest Gump was made in Bill Clinton\u2019s 90s, but Gump is pure Reagan: the simple patriot who wins through.</p> <h2>2. Toy Story (1995) / Toy Story 2 (1999) / Toy Story 3 (2010) / Toy Story 4 (2019)</h2> <p>The pure essence of Hanks is distilled for his inspired vocal role as Woody in Pixar\u2019s glorious animated Toy Story movies. He voices the pull-string cowboy figure who is the favourite toy of Andy, but in danger of being supplanted in his affections by astronaut Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen), just as westerns were supplanted by space-race-inspired sci-fi in America\u2019s heart generally. Hanks\u2019s vocal work in these movies is a total joy, and it is one of the most heartwarming, heartrending pieces of casting in Hanks\u2019s career. It also puts him under pressure as an actor in a way few of his other films have, especially in TS2, when his old toy comrades tell him to forget about being the favourite of fickle kids and instead embrace being the pampered possession of adult collectors, because children will only break your heart. There is greatness in this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d83fcc47ef64c84671f3372c69e3ca80e28a3500\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d83fcc47ef64c84671f3372c69e3ca80e28a3500/0_94_2094_2095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell in Apollo 13.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell in Apollo 13.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>1. Apollo 13 (1995)</h2> <p>Something very, very wrong has happened and the whole world holds its breath. The Nasa moon missions, which the US and every other country had come to take for granted as an untarnished, ongoing success, look like becoming a terrible catastrophe. In 1970, the Apollo 13 spacecraft suffers an onboard explosion on its way to the moon, depriving it of most of its electric power and oxygen. There is every chance its astronauts will die, in real time, on national television. Who can save them and all of us? Who can pluck a pyrrhic victory from this defeat?</p> <p>The answer of course is the solid, dependably heroic Hanks, playing Apollo 13\u2019s modest commander Jim Lovell, on whose memoir this movie is based. It is directed with a sure hand by Ron Howard, creating a wonderfully well-made, suspenseful, exciting, poignant Hollywood classic. Hanks is an actor who has something Nasa-ish in his own professionalism, a guy who has refined and fortified his technique over a long period of time and just gets on with it. Cleverly, it is the calm and unshowy Hanks who negotiates the loss of innocence involved in all this: the Apollo 13 near-miss was the event that showed that the US was not all-powerful and also caused the country to begin losing interest in moon landings.</p> <p>Importantly, Hanks leads the operation that brings Apollo 13 and its pilots back, unharmed, and brings our idealism back to Earth as battered but also unharmed. This was a heroic adventure, given an added piquancy by the fact that they didn\u2019t get what they wanted. And Hanks embodies all of this: tough, resourceful, a leader, a pragmatist and a modest hero.</p> <blockquote> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Halifax, the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, has withdrawn the majority of the mortgages it sells through brokers, including all first-time buyer loans, citing a lack of \u201cprocessing resource\u201d.</p> <p>In a message sent to mortgage brokers this morning, Halifax said it would no longer offer any mortgages with a \u201cloan-to-value\u201d (LTV) of more than 60%. In other words, only buyers able to put down a 40% deposit will qualify for a loan.</p> <p>It is understood the lender\u2019s mortgage department is currently flooded with requests for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/rbs-natwest-mortgage-loan-coronavirus-bank-credit-card-limits\">mortgage payment holidays</a>, which are being offered as part of the response to the coronavirus crisis, while its valuers are also unable to inspect properties.</p> <p>In the note to brokers, Halifax said: \u201cOur priority remains the wellbeing of our colleagues and customers and we\u2019re closely monitoring the developing situation and continue to follow official guidelines. <br><br>\u201cThis has had a direct impact on our available processing resource and we have therefore withdrawn new mortgage and remortgage products across our residential range with a loan-to-value ratio of over 60%.\u201d</p> <p>Halifax said the mortgage withdrawals apply across its Halifax Intermediaries, Scottish Widows Bank and BM Solutions brands. \u201cCustomers can still apply for a mortgage directly online with Halifax and Lloyds Bank,\u201d said a spokesperson.</p> <p>The lender added that transfers and advances on existing loans will remain unchanged.</p> <p>Mark Harris, chief executive of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a funding crisis \u2013 the banks are awash with liquidity.</p> <p>\u201cThere are two main issues. The first is a processing one \u2013 they are not all set up for staff to work from home. The big processing centres are closed and they are operating with a skeleton staff.</p> <p>\u201cThere is also the issue with valuations. A lot of the big lenders will accept desktop valuations but only to a certain loan-to-value. As they can\u2019t get a valuer out to inspect the property, it is very difficult to process a mortgage application for a higher LTV.\u201d</p> <p>Mortgage brokers said Halifax\u2019s decision to halt much of its lending is the most serious since the credit crunch.</p> <p>Andrew Montlake, managing director of broker Coreco, said: \u201cThe Halifax\u2019s decision to stop lending above 60% LTV reflects the wholesale recalibration of risk that is unfolding in the mortgage market.\u201d</p> <p>Other lenders are likely to follow Halifax. HSBC said: \u201cThere are no current plans to change our mortgage lending approach at this stage, though clearly we will have to monitor service levels in these unprecedented times.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Nationwide said: \u201cWe continue to support the market within the constraints of the current environment. We do not plan to pull our mortgage products at this time, but certain applications may take longer to progress.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the reason for Halifax\u2019s decision is that its staff are dealing with an unprecedented flood of requests for mortgage holidays.</p> <p>Harris added: \u201cLenders are throwing all their resources into dealing with payment holiday requests. In the same way that people are buying food they don\u2019t need, people are asking for payment holidays when they don\u2019t need them. That is blocking the line for those who do.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Ultras are notoriously difficult to define. They are the most hardcore and extremist of football fans, but while many groups have become criminal gangs, morphing into semi-secretive, paramilitary organisations that accumulate great power and wealth, others are idealistic crusaders against injustice and tyranny. Plenty of ultras are neo-fascist, but there are many far-left groups, too. The ultra mentality is all about the local \u2013 your street, suburb or city \u2013 but it\u2019s also a globalised subculture in which fans thousands of miles apart influence each others\u2019 songs, protests, politics and philosophies.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesmontague\" title=\"\">James Montague</a> has spent many years with them (his subtitle \u2013 \u201camong the ultras\u201d \u2013 seems a conscious nod to Bill Buford\u2019s acclaimed if flawed book on British hooligans, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/mar/18/sport.comment\" title=\"\">Among the Thugs</a></em>). The \u201c1312\u201d of the title refers to the alphabet code for ACAB, an ubiquitous acronym which stands for \u201call cops are bastards\u201d. It\u2019s that which unites the movement: there is, Montague writes, a \u201cmistrust in any type of authority\u201d. There\u2019s a bloody-minded contrariness to the ultras. It is typified by the word <em>di\u0161pet</em> used by its members from Hadjuk Split: \u201ca term of defiance that roughly means to oppose something no matter the consequences \u2026 <em>Di\u0161pet</em> means to be anti-everything.\u201d</p> <p>Montague is a brilliant and daring guide. Travelling to 25 countries to compare ultra movements around the world, he takes the reader to warehouses, forests, terraces and underpasses. In Albania, a nationalist called Ismail drives with his knees as he loads, cocks and fires a gun. In Indonesia the author is chased by rival ultras armed with machetes. He smokes weed with a fascist mobster in Rome. It\u2019s frequently pretty dangerous: \u201cI had been warned that if we ever got into trouble that I should not, under any circumstances, fall over. \u2018If you fall, you\u2019re dead.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s an immersive account, partly because it is clearly a world Montague enjoys. He hints that he was something of a scallywag in his youth: \u201cAs a teenager I must have been arrested a dozen times. Getting caught was almost as big a rush as getting away.\u201d Researching and writing the book was a way to recapture that teenage buzz. After one scrape \u2013 and there are many here \u2013 he says: \u201cMy heart was beating fast and I felt something approaching elation after my escape. I was fifteen again. I turned on the light in the bathroom and stared at myself in the mirror. I was smiling.\u201d</p> <p>But the first-person is never overdone or naff: there\u2019s enough of it to capture the fix and the fear, but it mainly serves to explain the existential attraction of the ultra life: the absorption of the self into something far greater, into the group, into a tribe or a brotherhood. It\u2019s \u201ca sound\u201d, he writes poetically, \u201cthat you could lose yourself into\u201d. In some ways it\u2019s nothing to do with football but all about danger and adrenaline, about vulnerability and protection, about piggy-backing football to enjoy an emotional rollercoaster. Every ultra, Montague writes, has the same \u201corigins story, the same recollection. They looked at the pitch, but were drawn to the danger and the noise of the crowds behind the goals. They didn\u2019t just want to watch football. They wanted to feel it too.\u201d</p> <p>Montague never shies away from the darkest aspects of this subculture. At Boca Juniors in Argentina the Doce crew allegedly pull in $3m a month. Even if other sources have suggested a lower figure of $400,000 a month, it\u2019s still big money, especially since many come from the slums. The stakes are so high that many ultras have, over the decades, been murdered. Much of that money comes not only from dealing tickets and drugs, but from being hired as foot soldiers to do the dirty work of politicians, unions and narcos, who need boots on the ground. As one ultra in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil\" title=\"\">Brazil</a> says: \u201cThe politicians, judges, the chief police officers \u2013 on one side they reject me. But on the other side, they want to talk to you, to get closer, to arrange something with you.\u201d Very often the ultras are like mercenaries, hired thugs who can fight, intimidate and cajole: \u201cIt\u2019s organised like an army,\u201d says a Serbian ultra. \u201cIn a very short period of time they can organise ten thousand men here in Belgrade.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The drunk brawls of British hooligans have been replaced by arranged fights in forests between sober martial arts obsessives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The disorganised, drunk brawls of British hooligans have now been replaced by arranged fights in forests between sober, highly trained martial arts obsessives. So it\u2019s not, perhaps, surprising that \u2013 for all their avowed independence from power \u2013 ultras have sometimes been pawns in geopolitical scraps. More than 60 per cent of Azov (far-right) fighters who helped liberate Ukrainian Mariupol from Russia came from the ultra scene. The Russian oligarch, Ivan Savvidis (who owns PAOK in Greece) was alleged to have funded Macedonia ultras to campaign against the renaming of the country, which was seen as a prelude to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\" title=\"\">Nato</a> access. The ultras are the hardest edge of football\u2019s soft power.</p> <p>But just as one is becoming jaundiced about this subculture, Montague offers examples of ultras going toe-to-toe with autocratic states. They were instrumental in protests in Tahrir and Maidan squares in Egypt and Ukraine respectively. They have often been on the frontline of civil disobedience in Turkey, Brazil, Sweden and Germany. They \u201cdespair at the commercialisation of the modern world\u201d and often fight, literally, against corruption. Without organised fans, it\u2019s likely that German\u2019s revered \u201c50+1\u201d rule (meaning that fans have a majority say in the running of their clubs) would have been abolished. It\u2019s almost as if only ultras can endow football with the metaphysical profundity to which it aspires. Montague describes one silent stadium protest as \u201csucking the importance and the significance out of what was happening on the pitch. The 22 footballers seemed small and irrelevant compared to the weight of self-discipline and control that was bearing down from four sides of the arena.\u201d</p> <p><em>1312</em> is such a global tour that the reader occasionally risks jet-lag. The countries, clubs and characters come so thick and fast that it can be, even for an expert, bewildering. But that, perhaps, is the point: the reader is left as woozy and punch-drunk as if they had been on tour themselves, with \u201cthe light from skyscrapers smearing past on either side\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>1312: Among the Ultras \u2013 A Journey with the World\u2019s Most Extreme Fans is published by Ebury.

Designed to appeal to people working from home as well as stay-at-home parents, sick kids and hungover students, its scattergun approach can make it one of the most strangely enlivening yet comforting sections of the TV schedule \u2013 the perfect background scene to your day\u2019s activities.</p> <p>For 18 months, when I was working from home as a freelance, I would eat my breakfast in front of the TV, usually opting for a dose of Homes Under the Hammer or Frasier, then get dressed and get to work. Alternatively, I would stay where I was, melting into the sofa, unable to find the remote as the entirety of This Morning (all 150 minutes of it) gave way to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/01/letting-it-all-out-behind-of-the-scenes-of-loose-women\">Loose Women</a> and \u2013 on particularly unfruitful days \u2013 Jeremy Kyle. Those days stretched the definition of \u201cwork\u201d.</p> <p>Yet there was one daytime staple that would forever lurk in the periphery, a bizarrely reassuring presence that celebrates its 20th anniversary this week: Doctors. Set in the fictional West Midlands town of Letherbridge, its daily 28-minute episodes unpick the middling dramas of a local GP surgery and its surprisingly wacky cast of characters.</p> <p>While Doctors may sound like a sanitised Holby City or House, it operates in a far more obscure and \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 avant-garde space. On the surface, each episode contains one medical predicament that is usually neatly resolved, while affairs and longstanding resentments bubble throughout the weeks. The seasoning, though, is sprinkled liberally in the form of a two-pronged attack: truly absurd plot scenarios and acting that is so wooden it almost seems as if the whole show is a running joke at the viewers\u2019 expense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa360a642c0479ed25a8a63361d38850f64618b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa360a642c0479ed25a8a63361d38850f64618b8/346_37_1464_879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Pasquale in Doctors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Double Joe party ... Pasquale makes an appearance or two.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take a recent genius episode in which a patient, Lizzie, suffered from a condition that made her see every white man she encountered (and some white women with short hair) as Joe Pasquale. That\u2019s right, early 00s variety show comedian Joe Pasquale \u2013 who gamely appeared in the episode, as if to prove his enduring existence. You would think such a severe break from mental acuity would prompt some sort of panic. But no, this is Doctors, so Pasquale is used as a running gag and Lizzie is ultimately carted off for \u201cneurological testing\u201d. We never see her again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/30/david-lynch-interview-manchester-international-festival\">David Lynch</a> would never be so brave as to attempt a Pasquale in one of his dream sequences.</p> <p>In another episode, a man entered the surgery to have a vasectomy, only to find out \u2013 on the suspiciously unsterilised surgical table \u2013 that his partner had been cheating on him all along, that the child he thought was his was the product of a Mallorcan one-night stand and that he should retain his vas deferens after all. He found this out because his partner was watching him have the surgery (in the same room!) and stepped in at the last minute to deliver another Doctors mannequin monologue.</p> <p>It may seem surprising that the drama has clung on for so long \u2013 having borne no notable acting talent \u2013 but its fans are a committed bunch, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCDoctors/photos/a.377035905709708.93903.359687864111179/1709991015747517/?type=3&amp;theater\">taking to social media</a> to vent their outrage when it has been placed on summer hiatus in favour of the football and ensuring its steady survival in the ratings. Even now, as production has halted owing to the coronavirus, there have been numerous <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCDoctors/photos/a.377035905709708/2764685640278044/?type=3&amp;theater\">Facebook messages of support</a> to cast and crew.</p> <p>These fans are on to something in their avid loyalty, since the drama in Doctors is so inconsequential that it makes for perfect background viewing during the coronavirus lockdown. It is a familiar hum of conversation to tune out while you work, just as you would at the office, or a woozy fever dream to accompany your own lethargy.</p> <p>Now that most of the UK population will have the chance to watch the show in real time, tuning in at 1.45pm in a post-lunch haze after their 15th consecutive meal of pasta and toilet paper to absorb whichever new medical drama and C-list celebrity cameo comes to light. Home workers of Britain, unite and take solace in half-ignoring storylines while aimlessly scrolling through your emails! Doctors is the perfect quarantine TV. Long may it continue.</p>",
  "<p>Egyptian authorities have forced a Guardian journalist to leave the country after she reported on a scientific study that said Egypt was likely to have many more coronavirus cases than have been officially confirmed.</p> <p>Ruth Michaelson, who has lived in and reported from Egypt since 2014, was advised last week by western diplomats that the country\u2019s security services wanted her to leave immediately after her press accreditation was revoked and she was asked to attend a meeting with authorities about her visa status.</p> <p>On Sunday 15 March, Michaelson had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/egypt-rate-coronavirus-cases-higher-than-figures-suggest\">reported on research</a> by infectious disease specialists from the University of Toronto as well as public health data and news stories that pointed to Egypt having a higher rate of coronavirus cases than the number confirmed by the government.</p> <p>She cited a study accepted for publication in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, which had analysed flight records, traveller data and infection rates to estimate that Egypt could have had 19,310 coronavirus cases by early March, with the lower end of the range about 6,000 cases. The Egyptian government\u2019s official count at the time period covered by the data was that three people were infected.</p> <p>The day after the story was published, Michaelson was called to a three-and-a-half hour meeting with officials including the chairman of the state information service (SIS), Diaa Rashwan, where she says she and another journalist who had tweeted about the research were accused of misreporting an unreliable study and spreading panic.</p> <p>The Egyptian officials demanded the story be retracted or that the Guardian publish an official apology.</p> <p>On 17 March, Michaelson\u2019s press accreditation was revoked. The Guardian offered the Egyptian authorities the chance to write a letter for publication rebutting its report or the Canadian study, but received no response to the offer.</p> <p>The following day, British diplomatic officials and the SIS passed on the message to Michaelson that she needed to meet Egypt\u2019s visa issuance authority.</p> <p>Michaelson, who is also a German citizen, said she was advised by German diplomatic officials in Cairo that she should not attend the meeting under any circumstances. \u201cThey said, \u2018We do not believe it\u2019s safe for you to go to this meeting. You\u2019re at high risk of arrest and you should get on a plane,\u2019\u201d she said.</p> <p>Flights out of Egypt were due to be suspended at noon the following day, Thursday, and with so many foreign tourists trying to flee the country as travel bans kicked in around the world, most planes were fully booked.</p> <p>Michaelson said she was advised by the British embassy and her own contacts that members of the country\u2019s security apparatus were seeking to immediately remove her from the country. \u201cThe national security agency told British diplomats that there was a plane one evening and they \u2018wanted me on it\u2019,\u201d she said.</p> <p>A lawyer who attended the meeting with the visa issuance authority on Michaelson\u2019s behalf was given the same message, she added.</p> <p>She left Egypt on a flight ferrying stranded tourists and foreign nationals to Germany on Friday evening.</p> <p>Michaelson\u2019s departure leaves the north African country with no full-time British newspaper correspondents. Bel Trew, a correspondent for the Times, was threatened with a military trial and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/23/bel-trew-egypt-british-journalist-expelled-the-times\">expelled from Egypt</a> in March 2018.</p> <p>\u201cThe Guardian is a global news organisation that strives to report with clarity and integrity at all times,\u201d a spokesperson for the Guardian said. \u201cIn this instance we reported on scientific findings by credible infectious disease experts. We have offered the Egyptian government opportunity to comment and respond to our reporting in the normal way.</p> <p>\u201cWe regret that the Egyptian authorities have chosen to revoke accreditation from a reporter working for a trusted, independent media organisation like the Guardian.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: \u201cThe UK supports media freedom around the world. We have urged Egypt to guarantee freedom of expression. UK ministers have raised this case with the Egyptian authorities.\u201d</p> <p>Asked for comment, an Egyptian official directed the Guardian to a letter sent last week by the SIS to the newspaper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.<strong> </strong>It argued the University of Toronto research cited in Michaelson\u2019s story relied on speculation, and that its approach and results had been rejected by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p> <p>In fact, the WHO said it was unable to verify the methodology used in the study, and said its own data was drawn from hospitals, meaning there was often a reporting delay. \u201cIt is possible that there are many other cases with mild symptoms which did not result in hospital visits, and therefore are not detected or reported,\u201d a WHO official told reporters in Cairo.</p> <p>Egypt had 366 confirmed cases of the virus by Monday with 19 deaths, according to the country\u2019s health ministry.</p> <p>Press freedom in Egypt has severely deteriorated since the military took power in 2013 and the former commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, became president the following year.</p> <p>The Committee to Protect Journalists said in <a href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2019/12/journalists-jailed-china-turkey-saudi-arabia-egypt.php\">its annual report last year</a> that 26 reporters were detained in the country and that most had been prosecuted in groups on charges of terrorism and reporting false news.</p> <p>Domestic media has gradually come to be dominated by the state, which exercises widespread censorship. The office of the country\u2019s last major independent news outlet, Mada Masr, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/egypts-security-forces-raid-online-newspapers-office-in-cairo\">was raided late last year</a>. Access to its website from inside Egypt has been blocked.</p>",

But this mode of thought is all too common among those who can\u2019t see beyond their economic textbooks or their stock portfolios. And it has troubling intellectual roots.</p> <p>In the late 18th century, Malthus warned that the poor would breed at a rate that would outpace the resources necessary to sustain a growing population, resulting in famine and misery. His predictions failed but were still deployed for decades to limit public amelioration of poverty.</p> <p>In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Bentham promoted the idea that public moral decisions should be made to foster the greatest good for the greatest number, forging the calculus that has pushed policymakers and economists to invoke simplified \u201ccost-benefit analyses\u201d to decide if a measure is worthy of consideration.</p> <p>Overall, this approach is a stark example of a troubling ideology that grips too many of those with power and influence in the world. <a href=\"https://economism.net/\">Economism</a> is a belief system that leads people to believe that everything can be simplified to models and curves, and that it\u2019s possible to count and maximize utility in every circumstance. What <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/01/economism-and-the-minimum-wage/513155/\">economism</a> misses includes complexity, historical contingency and the profound, uncountable power of human emotion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-coronavirus-economy-america-business\">Trump's 'back-to-work' plan would only make things worse, experts say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To set up a false choice between driving the economy into the ground while saving millions of lives or reviving the economy while sacrificing millions of lives ignores a core fact: the global economic depression unleashed by the deaths of millions in the United States, millions in Europe, millions in Asia, millions in India, millions in Mexico and millions in Brazil would be beyond our experience or imagination.</p> <p>No one would trade with anyone for years. Trade would grind to a halt because of mourning, fear of infection, society-wide trauma and social unrest. Let\u2019s note that despite the late and insufficient responses by North American and European leaders, those leading <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/es/2020/03/24/espanol/opinion/coronavirus-mexico-lopez-obrador.html\">Mexico</a> and Brazil have yet to take the threat seriously at all.

But millions of Indians have no door to close, no place to store food, and no way to distance themselves from those infected. Corpses will soon pile up, waiting for cremation or burial, reinfecting communities weakened by this disease. No one is ready for the social, spiritual and economic devastation that is sure to come by June.</p> <p>Anywhere in the world, positing this problem as a tradeoff between the economic interests of the young and the lifespan of the old is a terrible error. As the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/people-at-higher-risk.html\">US Centers for Disease Control explains</a>, those vulnerable to serious or fatal cases of the infection include not just the elderly, but anyone who is obese, diabetic, has high blood pressure, is HIV-positive, has undergone cancer treatment, suffers from asthma or smokes. Those factors are more common among poorer Americans as well as older Americans.

Not a lot. Maybe $100. But that\u2019s more than a lot of people, especially in my industry. I know a lot of my comrades out there only had $20 in their pocket when the restaurant closed. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Until the end of last week, Brown and his wife, Alex Smith, still had a lifeline. Smith worked as a bartender at a hotel which remained open in a neighbouring county. But that closed on Friday and now the couple, both in their mid-40s, are down to the cash in their pockets with no savings and no health insurance.</p> <p>\u201cWe took the little money we have and came down to get groceries so we at least had some food for the next few weeks,\u201d said Brown outside the Save A Lot discount food store on Kansas City\u2019s east side, one of the poorest parts of the city.</p> <p>Coronavirus has been relatively slow to reach the sprawling plains of Missouri and Kansas, although deaths have been creeping up. But its impact is already felt among the hardest-up residents of Kansas City, which straddles the Missouri River dividing the two states. Both are reporting a spike in unemployment claims and they\u2019re likely to go on rising with the Kansas City metro area under a stay-at-home order from Tuesday and more businesses closing.</p> <p>Even when they were working, Brown and Smith earned only $2.15 an hour, the federal minimum wage for servers, plus tips.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d1da42e9c6978bc4a51993d9a2ed7983ec6e599\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d1da42e9c6978bc4a51993d9a2ed7983ec6e599/0_259_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Smith and Chris Brown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Smith and Chris Brown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGreal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve maybe got two or three weeks before we run out of food,\u201d said Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s on the razor\u2019s edge for sure.

I\u2019m trying to prepare for the worst.\u201d<br>Smith is worried. \u201cHe could definitely put us out,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the question of what happens if either or both of them catch coronavirus. \u201cWe don\u2019t have health insurance,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAt home sick is pretty much what we would do.\u201d</p> <p>With some people hit with hospital bills for <a href=\"https://time.com/5806312/coronavirus-treatment-cost/\">tens of thousands of dollars for treatment</a>, Brown and Smith are not alone on Kansas City\u2019s east side asking whether they would run up a debt they might never be able to pay or take a chance on shutting themselves away and hope to make it through. Even if they catch coronavirus, it may not officially be confirmed. Getting a test in Missouri is still a challenge, even for those showing symptoms of the disease and they require a prescription from a doctor who all too often <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/coronavirus/article241336251.html\">has to be paid</a> as well.</p> <p>No one in Kansas City expects to starve but the fear of catching coronavirus is often secondary to the worry about financial calamity.</p> <p>Outside the Save A Lot, Linda Flores made her two young children wait in the car while she went shopping. Her husband is an itinerant construction worker stuck on the west coast without the pay he used to send home weekly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last of the money on food,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Flores\u2019s bags are crammed with instant pasta meals, pot noodles, tinned beans, anything to fill the children up. \u201cWe have enough food in the house for two or three weeks. I don\u2019t know what happens after that. Will we still be made to stay home?\u201d she said. \u201cWe can sell things. We could try and sell the car. We can go to our church. Maybe they will help us.\u201d There are also food banks, although some in Kansas City have closed because donations have dropped off sharply and volunteers are staying away.</p> <p>Johnetta Greer faces a different challenge. She\u2019s a 65-year-old healthcare worker with a respiratory problem and diabetes. And yet remote working is not an option.<br>\u201cI tick three of the boxes. So for me in my household this is serious,\u201d she said.<br>Greer has a face mask hanging around her neck ready to put on as she goes into the store. But her concern is not only for her own health. She helps care for a group of nuns in their 80s.</p> <p>\u201cI definitely do not want to take anything to them. We\u2019ve been keeping their place pretty much sanitised to the hilt. I told my kids I feel like their place is cleaner than mine so I\u2019m all right going to work,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Greer\u2019s dilemma is that she fears carrying the virus from the outside and infecting the nuns, and yet the elderly women cannot be left alone. \u201cIt\u2019s just us. It\u2019s not like we have people on reserve we can call. We\u2019re just to do the best we can about these ladies,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I get sick, who looks after them?\u201d</p>",

  "<p>We all have that one show we turn to when we have scrolled through all of Netflix and found nothing else, when we need a brief window of distraction from life\u2019s stresses, or if we want a nostalgic reminder of another, simpler time.</p> <p>Now, in lockdown and with bags of time on our hands, it seems like the perfect moment to revisit those box sets and indulge in hours of rewatching, away from the ever-present tyranny of choice.</p> <p>We asked 10 writers to take us through their rewatches of choice, from the gripping drama (and culinary delights) of The Sopranos, to the fast-paced political intrigue of The West Wing, the romantic trials of New Girl and Gossip Girl, as well as the niche fascinations of Law and Order: SVU. Or, if you would rather not live in the TV screen of the past, one writer argues to stick with the endless stream of the new.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d6659f31384bc634eb46250f425d6796089db2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d6659f31384bc634eb46250f425d6796089db2e/0_163_3258_1955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sopranos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taking care of business \u2026 The Sopranos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Sopranos</h2> <p>If the past is a foreign country, rewatching The Sopranos is like stepping into another universe entirely. The silken polo shirts and rattling gold bracelets, the flip-phones and leather-seated Sedans, the strippers and \u2013 above all \u2013 the sandwiches; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-chase\">David Chase</a>\u2019s late-90s epic on mobsters reckoning with their consciences is endlessly rewatchable. So much so that I am about to embark on my third viewing of the six-season, 86-episode odyssey of James Gandolfini\u2019s masterful Tony Soprano and the enduring chaos of his New Jersey family of mafiosos. While I might dip in and out of Friends for a comfort-rewatch, or turn to Bob\u2019s Burgers for an easy laugh, it is almost impossible to watch single episodes of The Sopranos; it is too granular and endlessly gripping. A tentative look back at a pivotal scene soon finds you four hours in, forgetting what happens next.</p> <p>And there are myriad narratives to follow: the evolution of Anthony Junior from chubby-cheeked tween to emotionally devastated young adult; Meadow\u2019s journey from daddy\u2019s girl to fierce independence; Uncle Junior\u2019s entire aesthetic; Livia\u2019s decrepitude; and Carmella\u2019s relationship rollercoaster, from loyalty to defiance to begrudging acceptance. Of course, holding it all together are the fantastic performances by Gandolfini \u2013 whose weight gain over the seasons starts to make his heavy breathing its own marker of dramatic foreboding \u2013 and Lorraine Bracco who plays his increasingly conflicted therapist Jennifer Melfi. Their therapy sessions are a masterclass in zippy dialogue and unspoken emotion, as close as we can get to riveting conversation in this time of social isolation.</p> <p>The show ultimately manages to strike that ineffable balance between escapism and emotional realism, lending it endless depth and rewatch potential. If nothing else, the food is worthy of a repeat view: pepper-stuffed sandwiches, cannelloni, heart-busting ice-cream sundaes; mouth-watering culinary inspiration for your quarantine. <strong>Ammar Kalia</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"269b5a5a1670064bed19061f883d6278fbae603f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/269b5a5a1670064bed19061f883d6278fbae603f/0_356_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gossip Girl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Made in Manhattan \u2026 Gossip Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Gossip Girl</h2> <p>Every few months, I like to imagine the decimal point of my bank account has shifted a few spots to the right and hang out with the hyper-privileged teens of New York City\u2019s Upper East Side. The Gossip Girl world is so spectacularly removed from mine \u2013 even were I not self-isolating \u2013 that watching it gives me the same rush I imagine sci-fi fans get from films about sentient spaceships and alien incubators. The show follows a group of beautiful, obscenely wealthy teenagers living in palatial penthouses and the \u201cpoor\u201d family that enters their orbit; ah yes, so poor are the Humphreys that they are confined to a loft in Brooklyn. <br><br>Their lives are so thrillingly interesting that an anonymous blogger, Gossip Girl, follows their every move by posting pap shots and salacious rumours. The plots sit somewhere between tabloid and high art: in one story arc, an 18-year-old billionaire trades his girlfriend for a hotel; in another, an incest storyline isn\u2019t even close to the weirdest thing in that series.</p> <p>Although things happen almost constantly, nothing ever really <em>changes,</em> which makes it perfect for unending rewatches. The script is overflowing with mixed metaphors and one character\u2019s entire personality is that they love to cook waffles. It should be terrible. It should be consigned to the forgotten annals of Netflix for ever. And yet, it is amazing. The melodrama of your teens magnified by about one million percent and sprinkled with limitless money? Who wouldn\u2019t want to watch that over and over again? <strong>Kate Solomon</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a48db734262047934ed0f259b107e82c17e58e22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a48db734262047934ed0f259b107e82c17e58e22/0_102_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zooey Deschanel in New Girl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zooey Deschanel in New Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>New Girl</h2> <p>I have had the phrase: \u201cGave me cookie, got you cookie\u201d swirling on a loop in my head for three days. Buried among every terrible coronavirus-related pun I have come up with to distract myself from the most bizarre and eerie global situation in my lifetime, is the grouchy voice of New Girl\u2019s Nick Miller delivering this line. Startlingly, it has become a sort of meditative balm. Inhale \u2026 <em>gave me cookie; </em>exhale \u2026 <em>got you cookie.</em></p> <p>To say<em> </em>New Girl is my favourite show would be an understatement. I mark my life through New Girl rewatches and sometimes I lay in bed and genuinely wonder if Nick, the recalcitrant bartender turned YA author with questionable hygiene habits (I would definitely have got the \u2019Rona from him) is my ideal man. The seven-season sitcom starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/apr/25/zooey-deschanel-interview\">Zooey Deschanel</a> as the titular character has its axis in friendship. Zooey\u2019s sweet, quirky Jess becomes a room-mate to three men with wildly different personalities (douchey Schmidt, grumpy Nick, unexplainable weirdo Winston), and along with her feisty best friend Cece, becomes enmeshed in ridiculous hijinks with them as they meld into a highly dysfunctional and incestuous family.</p> <p>The show is funny without losing its heart and sweet without becoming cloying. It has all the intimate tenderness of a dear friend roasting you before pulling you into a hug. I started watching New Girl while depressed in my final year in university and, eight years later, it remains a show I watch when I need laughter to alleviate the darkness of the world; to remind myself of joy and where it lies: within our connections.</p> <p>In season two, episode five, Schmidt buys Nick a cookie. He saw it and thought of him. The emotionally reticent Nick is uncomfortable with the display of tenderness and, throughout the episode, agonises over how to reciprocate. Eventually he settles on returning the favour, verbalising his affection the only way he knows how: like a Neanderthal. \u201cGave me cookie, got you cookie. You gave me cookie, got you cookie! Gave me cookie, got you cookie, man!\u201d In my language that means: \u201cI love you and I\u2019m here for you\u201d and I think that\u2019s beautiful. New Girl remains a reminder that hope and joy finds a home in love and its expression. <strong>Bolu Babalola</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"111b3dbd960ca81edb67b56cfbc44d5e1b8f93c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/111b3dbd960ca81edb67b56cfbc44d5e1b8f93c9/0_221_1992_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Sheen, Richard Schiff and Rob Lowe West Wing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All the president\u2019s men \u2026 Martin Sheen, Richard Schiff and Rob Lowe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Shapiro/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The West Wing</h2> <p>From the moment that cheesy theme tune kicks in, I feel at home. Perhaps it is because I mainlined the series while suffering from extreme exam-related anxiety at university, but The West Wing will always be my happy place. Its depiction of late-90s Clintonian politics may seem increasingly dated, yet in the creation of a group of well-meaning, if flawed, politicos, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/aaron-sorkin\">Aaron Sorkin</a> solidified for many the way politics <em>should</em> be done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/20/obama-west-wing-tv-drama-bartlet-aaron-sorkin-martin-sheen-allison-janney\">We got Obama elected! West Wing stars relive the parties, pranks and power games</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From Rob Lowe\u2019s puppyish Sam Seaborn, to the gruff but ultimately warm-hearted Toby Ziegler (a pitch-perfect role for Richard Schiff), every West Winger has something about them to love (except Mandy; nobody liked Mandy; she was swiftly disappeared at the end of season one). Watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7H_L5cYkg8\">Alison Janney\u2019s</a> bizarre performance of the Jackal never fails to bring a smile to my face \u2013 and there is a simple joy to those first four seasons of Sorkin dialogue at its best. The walk-and-talks are the stuff of legend, and the rapid-fire, flirty banter between Josh Lyman and his secretary Donna (this was of course pre-#MeToo) are reminiscent of the best black-and-white screwball comedies.</p> <p>There is even a quarantine lockdown episode \u2013 No Exit, in season five \u2013 but perhaps that\u2019s too close to home just now. Instead, I can revel in that opening episode as the word \u201cPotus\u201d rings around my head, or Martin Sheen\u2019s Latin excoriation of God in the season two finale, Two Cathedrals. I might be stuck inside, and Donald Trump might be terrorising the White House out there, but I can always depend on President Bartlet. <strong>Toby Moses</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de238ab4cf43254ddc4ba31f8efe4a74791392b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de238ab4cf43254ddc4ba31f8efe4a74791392b0/0_70_2097_1258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Capaldi Malcolm Tucker The Thick of It.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coming unspun \u2026 Peter Capaldi\u2019s Malcolm Tucker tries to save his career in The Thick of It.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The Thick of It</h2> <p>Comfort television suggests something warm and swaddling, but one of my go-to watches when I need a shot-in-the-arm is the extended, penultimate episode of the final series of The Thick of It. It is an episode that mirrored and coincided with the real-life Leveson inquiry and its themes, but also brings to mind Chilcot.</p> <p>Laughing obviously makes one feel better and The Thick of It is hilarious, but it is not just that. Seeing intelligence, creative competence, incredible art \u2013 if that does not sound too pretentious \u2013 is also immensely cheering. Whether it is the brilliant lines we came to expect \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m just a lad from Leeds with a lust for life\u201d; \u201cIf you make eye contact with Malcolm Tucker, you have spilled his pint\u201d; \u201cHe was only homeless in the sense that he didn\u2019t have a home\u201d \u2013 seeing the regulars at the very top of their game, or the sublimely handled mix of tone, it is an hour of perfect television.</p> <p>Some insist that the early New Labour focus of TTOI was superior, but this episode does not merely induce pleasure in its one liners but in its depth and resolve; the quiet, oblivious truth-telling by the much put-upon Robyn, and the exquisite Peter Capaldi with his Rachel Dolezal-esque facial expression when everything comes crashing down. But his final bravura speech is arrow-accurate by the writers. These days it is hard not to shove one\u2019s fist into one\u2019s mouth every time someone on Twitter grabs a clip of modern-day politics and makes the same joke: \u201cMissed this episode of The Thick of It!!!!\u201d But even that cannot stop the boost this hour gives me. <strong>Hannah Jane Parkinson</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e85b6697cff04b596d47bacdbd801f48c929646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e85b6697cff04b596d47bacdbd801f48c929646/0_0_3600_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tituss Burgess and Jane Krakowski in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tituss Burgess and Jane Krakowski in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Liebowitz/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</h2> <p>I very, very rarely rewatch drama; at least not without a very big gap in between. Comedy, however, I can and do watch and rewatch, virtually on a loop. It might be Silicon Valley, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Cheers, and for most of the 90s it was of course Friends (when it was not Will &amp; Grace); but most often these days it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt\">Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</a>, Tina Fey\u2019s first post-30 Rock venture and arguably her masterwork.</p> <p>It has everything that normally makes rewatching a comedy worthwhile, turned up to 11. The jokes are not just plentiful but fast and might be pulled from any genre at any moment. Daft puns, slapstick, callbacks, character jokes, topical gags, broadbrush generic or tiny little things that depend on a Spelunker-level knowledge of the nichest of niche pop-culture references. And then there\u2019s all of Tituss.</p> <p>The individual and ensemble playing is endlessly watchable, awe-inspiring and prompts an urge to dissect it, even as such a project will and should for ever elude you. Had you world enough (and time) could you ever teach anyone else to hit the beats like Jane Krakowski does so perfectly and seemingly effortlessly? And finally there is the sheer oddity of the thing. From the premise \u2013 30-year-old woman emerges into the world after 15 years held in a bunker by her kidnapper the Rev Richard Wayne Gary Wayne \u2013 to the collection of eclectic characters. But it does, harnessing a series of idiosyncrasies to a singular, ridiculous vision and going all in on it. Utter mastery. Utter joy. <strong>Lucy Mangan</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f2bbc6cb1c037054d543e0feb6848afcb489edf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f2bbc6cb1c037054d543e0feb6848afcb489edf/0_105_3150_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ice-T and Mariska Hargitay in Law & Order: SUV\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ice-T and Mariska Hargitay in Law &amp; Order: SUV.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks Photo/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Law and Order: SVU</h2> <p>You know you have watched a lot of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit when you can recite the opening narration (\u201cIn the criminal justice system, sexually based offences are considered especially heinous \u2026\u201d) with the same ease as an NYPD cop reading a perp his rights. And there is a lot of SVU to watch. There have been 21 seasons and nearly 500 episodes since 1999, when Law &amp; Order franchise supremo Dick Wolf first debuted this particularly moreish combo of police procedural and courtroom drama. The choicest rewatch cuts, however, are found between season two \u2013 when Munch (Homicide: Life on the Street transfer, Richard Belzer) was partnered with Tutuola (Ice-T) \u2013 and the season 12 departure of the lead detective, Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni).</p> <p>Dogged devotion to TV formula is what Law &amp; Order does best, but those \u201cripped from the headlines\u201d plots also keep things fresh over repeated viewings, while squad room chats on issues such as consent and gender identity provide fascinating snapshots of changing social attitudes. Like the man says, these offences are \u201cespecially heinous\u201d, but there is something both cathartic and comforting about watching Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and her team put away all manner of unsavoury individuals.</p> <p>The abundance of available reruns also makes it enjoyably easy to forget which you have seen and which you have not. Do I instinctively know that the friendly-seeming schoolteacher is lying about his whereabouts because I half-remember how this one ends? Or has Law &amp; Order: SVU transformed me into a damn fine detective at last? <strong>Ellen E Jones</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a5894eb9d21d9ad557d73c504957d418c5a8cc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a5894eb9d21d9ad557d73c504957d418c5a8cc4/0_136_1009_605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spaced Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Jessica Stevenson and Mark Heap\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spaced cadets \u2026 Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Jessica Stevenson and Mark Heap.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: E4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Spaced</h2> <p>If you really put your mind to it, you can get through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/11/the-stars-of-spaced-reunited-21st-anniversary-simon-pegg-jessica-hynes-edgar-wright-nick-frost\">Spaced</a> in a single day, horsing through its two short seasons on DVD or <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/spaced\">All 4</a> in under seven hours.

There is so much that is new and worthy of our attention that going back to old, familiar ground often feels like a waste of time. There are a couple of exceptions, however, the greatest of which is Buffy, which has taken on a therapeutic role in my life.</p> <p>Many, many years ago, after a breakup, I measured the duration of my sadness by how long it took me to rewatch all seven seasons in their entirety. By the time Buffy was over, so was the heartbreak. Now, I dip in and out of my favourite episodes, but some \u2013 Hush, The Wish, The Body, Once More With Feeling, Who Are You? and Restless, to be precise \u2013 are frequently revisited. The sound of the theme music alone is the equivalent of a hot bath in mood lighting.</p> <p>There is something particularly soothing about its ultimate moral simplicity. People are flawed (and flayed), they make mistakes, and they learn how to be better. Buffy is the Chosen One, and she has to face her toughest challenges alone, but the biggest, most world-threatening villains require collective action. They need a whole graduation class\u2019s worth of students to destroy a big snakey mayor, the support of one\u2019s friends to combat a secret military base filled with monsters, a whole army of new slayers to battle the First. Now, more than ever, that feels like a message to take comfort from, from the comfort of indoors. <strong>Rebecca Nicholson</strong></p> <h2>\u2018The thought of rewatching fills me with dread\u2019</h2> <p>Rewatching TV shows, especially at a time of massive global crisis, sounds like a genuinely lovely idea that will doubtless bring a warm feeling of comfort and joy to many people\u2019s lives. Except, I won\u2019t be one of them. The thought of a repeat viewing with shows I love and which have serious rewatch potential \u2013 Arrested Development or The Office \u2013 fills me with dread. That is even true of rewatching a casual, noncommittal episode (something I only ever allow myself to do \u201cfor work\u201d).</p> <p>But outside of that: absolutely not. Never. Ever. The feeling of shame, of drowning in 10,000 other, newer shows begins to set in within milliseconds. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you finished Cheer yet?\u201d my brain says. What about Schitt\u2019s Creek? Sure, you don\u2019t know anyone who actually watches it and you have no idea what it\u2019s about, but people are always talking about it on Twitter aren\u2019t they? What about the new series of This Country, or Shrill, or literally anything else that you\u2019ve not already seen? And that\u2019s before you even get to the classics. What about Breaking Bad, that show you watched one series of and never thought about ever again? Maybe now\u2019s the time to get really, really into that like everyone else did 10 years ago. Or Game of Thrones: that was a bit of a big deal, maybe you ought to finish that one?</p> <p>The whole thing is just another source of anxiety, to be honest, which is a shame because I would love to watch The Office Christmas specials guilt-free. Just once, ideally this summer, while all my other plans are off. <strong>Hannah J Davies</strong></p>",
  "<p>It might not be clear why a fish pond project should take root in a region surrounding the great Lake Victoria. After all, as the second largest freshwater lake in the world, it should be able to support the fish and the people that depend on its resources.</p> <p>But the fact that fish farming is fast expanding here highlights a worrying trend \u2013 that the fish population in Lake Victoria has been in steady decline and the quality of what is being caught has been going down too, jeopardising the livelihoods of millions.</p> <p>Overfishing, pollution and the invasive <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20191128-focus-kenya-lake-victoria-water-hyacinth-invasion-silver-lining-environment-fishing-1\">water hyacinth plant</a>, among other factors, are to blame for the decline. The situation is so bad that cheap tilapia imports from China are now sold in the lake city of Kisumu, edging out local fishmongers.</p> <p>The fishermen are finding it difficult to compete. These fish, from thousands of miles away, are cheaper than those caught just down the road in the lake.</p> <p>Now villagers are turning to farming to address the shortages, something which would have been inconceivable only a few years ago.</p> <p>\u201cWe are left with no choice but to farm fish in the ponds now,\u201d says John Obuom, from Kamulla village in the Store Pamba area of Kisumu county.</p> <p>With his wife Pauline Achieng, Obuom has successfully reared catfish since 2018 in five ponds on their three-acre plot. They started with 1,000 fingerlings and have since harvested twice.</p> <p>He has been trained by international development organisations including <a href=\"https://www.wn.org/how-fish-farming-is-combating-kenyas-sex-for-fish-trade/\">World Neighbo</a><a href=\"https://www.wn.org/how-fish-farming-is-combating-kenyas-sex-for-fish-trade/\">rs</a> and <a href=\"https://viagroforestry.org/where-we-work/kenya/\">Vi Agroforestry</a> on simple, sustainable agricultural practices as well as water-harvesting techniques.</p> <p>\u201cI am now able to harvest and store water from surface run-off, which has made a big difference in my farm,\u201d he says. And it is not so difficult to see why.</p> <p>Obuom is a successful farmer. He grows mangoes, tomatoes, citrus, bananas and cucumbers, in addition to popular Kenyan indigenous vegetables such as the black nightshade.</p> <p>He is held up as a model farmer in the region. High school and university students regularly visit his farm to learn about how sustainable agriculture works in practice.</p> <p>Obuom is now part of a year-long, ongoing study on agricultural finance, through what is known as the financial diary tool.</p> <p>\u201cThis tool will show how spending patterns influence climate-smart agricultural practices,\u201d says Anthony Musyimi, an agriculture masters student at the University of Nairobi.</p> <p>The financial diary tool is a joint effort between the University of Nairobi, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands and <a href=\"https://ccafs.cgiar.org/\">CCAFS \u2013 a research programme</a> on climate change, agriculture and food security.</p> <p>This study is looking at the financial data of 122 households in the Nyando Basin, including Kisumu county.</p> <p>Musyimi has been collecting data from Obuom for the past 48 weeks. He will conclude his findings this month, a year after he began.</p> <p>Obuom uses nutrient-rich waste water from his fish ponds to irrigate his crops. The water has also enabled him to put up 10 beehives, each of which yields between eight and 10 litres of honey every three to four months.</p> <p>\u201cBees cannot survive without water,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jan/30/miracle-method-sustainable-rice-scientists-dismissed\">The miracle method for sustainable rice \u2013 and bigger harvests  | John Vidal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And for women of the local Luo community, once banned from owning a boat or even entering the waters in the lake region, there are opportunities to get involved. They can now raise fish in a pond without breaking any cultural taboos, supplementing their household incomes.</p> <p>Chris Macoloo, the Africa regional director for World Neighbors, maintains that using fish ponds has advantages over open-water artisanal fishing, because the latter \u201cis more of a hunter-gatherer system, with no prior knowledge of the expected quantity of catch\u201d.</p> <p>The development organisation has trained farmers in modern integrated farming techniques. Up to 20 farmers now have fish ponds only 20km from the lake.</p> <p>\u201cThe fish ponds are very cheap to maintain, because you give the fish local feed,\u201d says catfish farmer Eddy Ouko.</p>",

They emailed their 250 invited guests on Friday to say they had postponed their wedding indefinitely, but weren\u2019t heartbroken, \u201cbecause this party does not mark the beginning of our commitment to each other, it celebrates the commitment that we have already made\u201d.</p> <p>The best man\u2019s father called to thank Clymer and Pablos for not compelling him to choose between possibly jeopardizing his health by attending the wedding and not supporting the couple.</p> <p>Pablos was brought to tears.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>According to the wedding planning and registry resource The Knot, the United States has 450,000 weddings slated for March through May alone.</p> <p>The Knot has launched a coronavirus hotline with its partner brand WeddingWire, and reports that many engaged couples calling in for guidance have said they\u2019re downsizing to a small gathering at their parents\u2019 house, or getting legally married in the short-term and planning a vow renewal ceremony on their first wedding anniversary.</p> <p>For the $78bn US wedding industry as a whole, the coronavirus-driven death knell came on 15 March when the CDC advised against gatherings of 50 people or more for the subsequent eight weeks.</p> <p>The chaotic fallout has included a mad scramble to postpone upcoming wedding dates, which in turn has fostered intense competition to secure the fast-dwindling slots available for late summer and fall bookings in particular.</p> <p>Such relatively near-term rescheduling is predicated on what may prove to have been magical thinking, given the current uncertainty of the US epidemic: that society will ultimately return to a significant shade of normal within the next three or four months.</p> <p>Pablos and Clymer, for their part, are already accustomed to virus-induced delays. Early last year, a flu she suffered stymied his cinematic vision for popping the question during a scheduled trip to Colorado that would have afforded a jaunt to a gorgeous snow-filled valley. So the film-maker scouted a new exterior location in New Mexico, near his parents\u2019 home in El Paso \u2013 the site of their next trip. This provided his ultimate, successful proposal with a sandy backdrop, plus snow-dusted mountains in the distance.</p> <p>The cinephiles remain determined to marry at their original venue, the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund retirement community for showbiz vets in Woodland Hills, California. Clymer works there and wants all the retirees she\u2019s bonded with to attend her reception in their own backyard. (The actress Connie Sawyer, who appeared in the relationship-recap vignette that opens When Harry Met Sally and who died at 105 in 2018, was a dear friend.)

  "<p>Always, on entering the endlessly reconfigured auditoria of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/young-vic\">Young Vic theatre</a>, on London\u2019s South Bank, the shiver of excitement at not knowing where the stage and the seats are going to be. Or perhaps there won\u2019t be a stage at all, but an arena of mud (Shakespeare); a conference room (Ibsen); beanbags laid under the starry heavens (Brecht); plywood pews either side of a conveyer belt (Kafka); a mound of rubble with a woman buried to her neck (guess who). Most shocking of all, perhaps, are the productions in which the audience sits in rows, with the stage behind a proscenium arch. The Young Vic is a theatre that turns things topsy-turvy. The conventional is made shocking. Classics seem like new plays; new plays are treated as classics.</p> <p>Its success is down, at least in part, to David Lan, who served as artistic director from 2000 to 2018, overseeing a major refurbishment and luring talent and audiences of all kinds to the small building, formerly a butcher\u2019s shop and a bombsite. He has travelled the world and brought its greatest directors and ensembles back to this country, from Iceland, Africa, Australia, as others would bring back duty-free cigarettes. As a young man he witnessed that happy and forgotten time when Peter Daubeny\u2019s world theatre season ran annually at the Aldwych, and when the National Theatre thought itself duty bound to host great foreign companies led by directors such as Peter Stein, Roger Planchon and Patrice Ch\u00e9reau. Ch\u00e9reau worked at the National in 1974, but did not return to this country until 2011 \u2013 at Lan\u2019s invitation. The Young Vic became one of the few theatres in Britain to have a global perspective.</p> <p>In 2015 it was widely reported that Lan had unsuccessfully applied to become co-director of the National, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/stephen-daldry\">Stephen Daldry</a>. <em>As If by Chance</em> makes no mention of this, but is firm proof, were it needed, that the theatre\u2019s board made a grave mistake. Lan\u2019s writing glows with his humanity and skill, with his literal worldliness, as he patches together into one narrative all the many lives he has led.</p> <p>Born in South Africa in 1952 to a family of eastern European Jews, he has been a student of JM Coetzee at the University of Cape Town, where he was caught up in anti-apartheid protests. He has worked at the Royal Court theatre, in a world of seedy 70s glamour, a life of freezing bedsits and Aldermaston marches. He has been a librettist for two operas, and the writer of some 20 plays and TV scripts. He has translated Chekhov. He has been playwright Nicholas Wright\u2019s partner for over half-a-century. He has been conscripted into, and escaped from, the South African army. He has conducted two years of field research in northern Zimbabwe, and his study of the interrelation of guerrilla warfare with the local mediums possessed by the spirit of dead ancestors, <em>Guns and Rain</em> (1985), is still a classic anthropological text.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lan tries to unravel the complexities of relationships, on stage and on paper, sparing nobody, least of all himself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lan constructs his memoir from short scenes that flick between these numerous existences, arranged in delightful disorder and written with the playwright\u2019s flair for dialogue. Memories are not narrated so much as displayed through reconstructed conversation, as if Ivy Compton-Burnett had written a memoir: everything is shown, nothing is told. Lan\u2019s ear for different modes of speech is brilliant, from his Jewish grandmother\u2019s \u201cbeetroot voice\u201d to his assistant in Zimbabwe, who starts every story with \u201clong back ago\u201d. He conjures portraits of directors from Luc Bondy to Ivo van Hove, of writers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/02/caryl-churchill-at-80-theatre-great-disruptor\">Caryl Churchill</a> and David Mamet. He watches, as a child and as an adult, his parents\u2019 marriage and health unravel; he crawls with his tape recorder near the flames and the drummers as a long-dead ancestor takes possession of a Zimbabwean spirit medium.</p> <p>To read the book is to swim in someone else\u2019s memory, unsure what is real, and what has been damaged or retinted by the passage of time, and by the memoirist\u2019s ability to dramatise. Lan writes in that risky tense, the historical present, but readers who think themselves allergic to it should take some form of literary antihistamine and jump in. The book\u2019s disarray of scenes and tenses, its slippery use of time, has a purpose. Lan is linking memory with theatre, and theatre with life. The narrative is constantly reconfiguring itself, like the auditorium of the Young Vic. He intercuts a drama on stage with a drama in his life, using dozens of quick-fire scene changes. Madame Ranevskaya, as she mourns her drowned son in Chekhov\u2019s <em>The Cherry Orchard</em>, is spliced with his own mother, grieving his brother\u2019s death from polio.

Official data seen by Guardian Australia indicates there were 115 cases in that category on Thursday, with a further 432 cases under investigation.</p> <p>As of Thursday night, it appeared unlikely that stage 3 lockdowns would be imposed in the most populous states before the weekend, and the Morrison government wants to stretch the time before that happens as long as possible. Data collected by the government through the Citymapper app points to a substantial drop off in movement around cities since the government closed the border, and restrictions on crowds were imposed in mid-March.</p> <p>As well as establishing the trigger points for the next sequence of lockdowns, Friday\u2019s meeting will also consider as yet uncompleted work on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/national-cabinet-to-consider-lockdowns-for-coronavirus-hotspots-and-help-for-renters\">financial assistance measures for renters</a> and landlords. The nuts and bolts of that package are being worked up by treasurers, with the states responsible for residential tenancies and the commonwealth dealing with commercial landlords and renters.</p> <p>The states are looking to ensure that residential tenants don\u2019t get evicted over the coming months if they cannot pay their rent and will propose options to ensure there are no rent increases during the crisis.</p> <p>The Morrison government wants the states to offer land tax relief for landlords, but is unlikely to get the states on board. The commonwealth is considering tax relief for landlords prepared to either cut rent or provide rent holidays for their tenants.</p> <p>The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is also prevailing on the banks to help carry the load of suspended rental income for the duration of the crisis. The insurance industry has also been in talks with the Morrison government over the rent package.</p> <p>It is believed insurers are concerned they may be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars in payments under landlord insurance policies. The insurance covers landlords for a variety of problems, including non-payment of rent. It is believed most policies do not exclude non-payment caused by a pandemic.<br><br>\u201cThe insurance industry is aware of discussions around the impact of Covid-19 on commercial and domestic rents and is talking to government about the issue,\u201d an Insurance Council of Australia spokesman said.</p> <p>Also on the agenda for Friday\u2019s national cabinet meeting is a conversation about reducing the amount of elective dental surgery to free up protective equipment. There will also be another conversation about schools in an effort to land on a national position.</p> <p>Morrison held talks with education unions this week and is attempting to broker arrangements where schools around the country move to provide distance learning by term two but campuses remain open for students who need to attend because their parents are essential services workers, or because they are in disadvantaged households.</p> <p>With the economy already profoundly disrupted by the pandemic, business and unions are attempting to recalibrate industrial arrangements.

The measure, which would cost $21bn for three months assuming 1.7m Australians are displaced from their jobs, was one proposal put to treasury officials at a meeting on Wednesday.</p> <p>The government is examining wage subsidies for the third round of stimulus but is reluctant to adopt income support that gives more assistance to higher income earners than workers on average incomes or minimum wages. It also wants to deliver support through the existing tax and transfer system.</p> <p>The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the government had not adopted a wage guarantee because \u201cthe advice in front of us was that that was not the best way in an Australian context\u201d to provide support, because \u201cthe existing jobseeker payment framework\u201d \u2013 unemployment benefits \u2013 would reach households faster.</p> <p>The government is yet to respond to Labor\u2019s call to change the income threshold and taper rates for unemployment benefits so more families are able to access jobseeker payments where one partner is jobless but the other earns more than $48,000.</p> <p>Options are still being developed by the social services minister, Anne Ruston, and the government characterises an agreement between the prime minister and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, as a commitment only to consider changes with a view to expanding eligibility.</p>",

So I think in the long term there is going to be a conflict between the competing demands of public health and the climate.\u201d</p> <p>Sennett believes that in the future there will be a renewed focus on finding design solutions for individual buildings and wider neighbourhoods that enable people to socialise without being packed \u201csardine-like\u201d into compressed restaurants, bars and clubs \u2013 although, given the incredibly high cost of land in big cities like New York and Hong Kong, success here may depend on significant economic reforms as well.</p> <p>In recent years, although cities in the global south are continuing to grow as a result of inward rural migration, northern cities are trending in the opposite direction, with more affluent residents taking advantage of remote working capabilities and moving to smaller towns and countryside settlements offering cheaper property and a higher quality of life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c24ab446e24c61d3dffc758490bcfb0dc1437d8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c24ab446e24c61d3dffc758490bcfb0dc1437d8d/0_0_5464_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial photograph of a housing estate in Hong Kong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial photograph of a housing estate in Hong Kong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dale de la Rey/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bain.com/insights/spatial-economics-the-declining-cost-of-distance/\">declining cost of distance</a>\u201d, as Karen Harris, the managing director of Bain consultancy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bain.com/insights/topics/macro-trends/\">Macro Trends Group</a>, calls it, is likely to accelerate as a result of the coronavirus crisis. More companies are establishing systems that enable staff to work from home, and more workers are getting accustomed to it. \u201cThese are habits that are likely to persist,\u201d Harris says.</p> <p>The implications for big cities are immense. If proximity to one\u2019s job is no longer a significant factor in deciding where to live, for example, then the appeal of the suburbs wanes; we could be heading towards a world in which existing city centres and far-flung \u201cnew villages\u201d rise in prominence, while traditional commuter belts fade away.</p> <p>Another potential impact of coronavirus may be an intensification of digital infrastructure in our cities. South Korea, one of the countries worst-affected by the disease, has also posted some of the lowest mortality rates, an achievement that can be traced in part to a series of <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korea-throws-up-innovative-tech-solutions-in-coronavirus-fight\">technological innovations</a> \u2013 including, controversially, the mapping and publication of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-south-korea-tracking-apps/2020/03/13/2bed568e-5fac-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html\">infected patients\u2019 movements</a>.</p> <p>In China, authorities have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-qr-code/china-seeks-help-of-national-tech-giants-to-track-coronavirus-with-qr-codes-idUSKBN20B10T\">enlisted the help of tech </a><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-qr-code/china-seeks-help-of-national-tech-giants-to-track-coronavirus-with-qr-codes-idUSKBN20B10T\">firms</a> such as Alibaba and Tencent to track the spread of Covid-19 and are using \u201cbig data\u201d analysis to anticipate where transmission clusters will emerge next.

Whether such groups survive beyond the end of coronavirus to have a meaningful impact on our urban future depends, in part, on what sort of political lessons we learn from the crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"74a04613f744b981622ad3ab66151b5129f8fe1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74a04613f744b981622ad3ab66151b5129f8fe1d/0_0_3446_2297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Residents select items on a community table filled with groceries for those in need, in Derry, New Hampshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Residents select items on a community table filled with groceries for those in need, in Derry, New Hampshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Krupa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The vulnerability of many fellow city dwellers \u2013 not just because of a temporary medical emergency but as an ongoing lived reality \u2013 has been thrown into sharp relief, from <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-news-social-care-elderly-councils-homes-a9390466.html\">elderly people lacking sufficient social care</a> to the low-paid and self-employed who have no financial buffer to fall back on, but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/15/business/economy/coronavirus-worker-risk.html\">upon whose work we all rely</a>.</p> <p>A stronger sense of society as a collective whole, rather than an agglomeration of fragmented individuals, could lead to a long-term increase in public demands for more interventionist measures to protect citizens \u2013 a development that governments may find harder to resist given their readiness in the midst of coronavirus to override the primacy of markets.</p> <p>Private hospitals are already <a href=\"https://www.gmb.org.uk/campaign/requisition-private-hospital-beds-help-nhs-coronavirus\">facing pressure</a> to open up their beds without extra charge for those in need; in Los Angeles, <a href=\"http://2020-03-18/homeless-occupy-more-vacant-homes-coronavirus-pandemic-los-angeles\">homeless citizens have seized vacant homes</a>, drawing support from some lawmakers.

  "<p>In the week that I speak to Amy Poehler, three different friends have told me that they are planning to rewatch Parks &amp; Recreation to distract them from what\u2019s happening in the world. \u201cI hear that a lot,\u201d says the star of the show, the woman who played the irrepressibly upbeat civil servant Leslie Knope, for 10 years and 125 episodes.</p> <p>Poehler is the kind of comedian, writer, actor and director who has plenty of \u201cbest known for\u201d roles to choose from. She joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in 2001 and her and Tina Fey, who played the Sarah Palin to her Hillary Clinton, became the first female duo to flank the famous Weekend Update of the show. Then came Parks &amp; Recreation, a workplace comedy that became so popular it was able to introduce a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/fashion/weddings/galentines-day-is-everywhere-heres-why.html\">whole new holiday, called Galentines\u2019 Day</a>, into the calendar on 14 February.</p> <p>Poehler is holed up at home in Los Angeles when I call. \u201cOne must try to be a good citizen at this time,\u201d she says, Knope-ishly.

This woman stood up in a town hall meeting and said: \u2018My children are getting out of school in two weeks. What am I supposed to do with them, keep them in my house where I live?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s an episode where everybody in town gets the flu and I was thinking: \u2018Oh boy, this is a little close to home.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Parks &amp; Rec ended in 2015, which left Poehler free to write, direct and produce, as well as act. She has several projects on the go: Moxie, the YA adaptation she directed for Netflix; the second season of the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/11/best-tv-shows-2019-no-7-russian-doll\">Russian Doll</a>, which she co-created but which is now on hold (\u201cSeason two is written and ready and we\u2019re so excited to get started shooting that\u201d). Should the ceremony go ahead, she and Fey will return to host the Golden Globes in January. We are here to talk about Duncanville, the new animated series Poehler created with The Simpsons\u2019 writers Mike Scully and Julie Thacker Scully, about the life of Duncan, a very average 15-year-old boy.</p> <p>\u201cThere is so much pressure on kids to be very special,\u201d Poehler explains. \u201cMike and I were always laughing about it. We are Gen X-ers; when we were growing up, no one told you you were special.\u201d How easy was it to get inside the head of a teenage boy? \u201cShockingly easy,\u201d she laughs. \u201cEverything is very exasperating at that age, because you have very little control, but there\u2019s a lot of people that are asking you what do you want to do with your life \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of pressure to do the right thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b40e30625dc20bc9b62e50c66b70a0e51857906\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b40e30625dc20bc9b62e50c66b70a0e51857906/0_0_3600_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duncanville.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"583\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Duncanville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is new territory for Poehler to be voicing a teenage boy. \u201cI am such a fan of the iconic female voices voicing young boys, whether it be Nancy Cartwright doing Bart, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jul/14/pamela-adlon-better-things-is-about-hope-and-love-amid-the-darkness\">Pamela Adlon in King of the Hill</a>,\u201d she says. The show is not only about Duncan \u2013 it also touches on his relationships with his dad (voiced by Modern Family\u2019s Ty Burrell), his sister, his cool-girl crush, Mia (played by Parks and Rec alumni Rashida Jones), and his mother, Annie.</p> <p>Poehler also plays Annie, which means she often has to deliver both sides of a disagreement. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun to play Duncan and his mom arguing with each other. [Although] maybe to people watching it, it\u2019s unsettling?\u201d she laughs. She feels like both characters in equal measure. \u201cI relate to the 15-year-old in me and and everyone who just wants to lie down in the mall while their parents go shopping for boring stuff, and I also really relate to Annie, because she\u2019s afraid of a lot of things, she\u2019s afraid for Duncan, she\u2019s trying to get him motivated.\u201d</p> <p>When it came to casting Mia, Poehler says she only wanted Jones. \u201cWith a lot of my friends, the only time I get to see them as I work with them.\u201d</p> <p>Poehler and Jones still celebrate Galentines\u2019 Day \u2013 the platonic celebration of female friendship made popular by their characters in Parks &amp; Rec. This year, they met up with Parks &amp; Rec castmates Aubrey Plaza and Kathryn Hahn. Poehler won\u2019t take credit for the term \u2013 Michael Schur wrote the episode it appears in \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s awesome to add another fake holiday to the fake holiday canon, and I personally think it\u2019s much more fun than Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d.</p> <p>Given that so many people seem to be turning to Parks &amp; Rec for comfort, is there anything that Poehler herself is finding solace in? </p> <p>Old British comedy, it turns out. \u201cYou know the old Julia Davis, Rob Brydon one, where they play all those couples?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/17/human-remains-comedy-rob-brydon\">Human Remains? \u201cOh my God, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/17/human-remains-comedy-rob-brydon\">so funny!</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/17/human-remains-comedy-rob-brydon\">\u201d</a> It can feel strange talking about television at a time like this, but, as Poehler says, comedy is \u201ca very wonderful connector and distractor \u2026 Let me just put it this way, these characters don\u2019t know that a pandemic is going on,\u201d she says. Our time is up, so she says goodbye, still laughing at the thought of Brydon and Davis. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go back and watch it again right now.\u201d</p> <p><em>Duncanville airs on Channel 4 from 27 March</em></p>",

The powerful wind shapes the weather and ocean currents in the southern hemisphere. It was sent off course \u2013 tracking southwards and disrupting weather patterns \u2013 by depletion of the ozone layer due to manmade chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons. The chemicals, found in fridges, aerosols and industrial processes, were phased out from 1987 under the UN Montreal protocol. The jet stream has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/global-efforts-on-ozone-help-reverse-southern-jet-stream-damage\">stopped moving south</a> and the \u201chole in the ozone layer\u201d has shrunk to its smallest size since 1982. Alexey Karpechko, a reviewer of the study, said: \u201cThis is good news, definitely. It shows our actions can stop climate change. We can see coordinated action works \u2026 we can manipulate the climate both ways: in a wrong way and by reversing the damage we have done.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Crisis in Kosovo politics \u2013 </strong>Kosovo\u2019s government has fallen after only 50 days in power after the prime minister, Albin Kurti, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/kosovo-government-falls-in-vote-of-no-confidence\">sacked a minister</a> who came from the junior party in the coalition.

  "<h2>Global cases rise to more than 470,000</h2> <p>Global infections rose to more than 470,000 and deaths passed 21,000, <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.</a> Mainland China and Hong Kong both reported an increase in new coronavirus cases involving travellers arriving from abroad. Health officials in China said it had 67 new cases but none of them were locally transmitted. The easing of travel restrictions has allowed 800 Beijing residents caught up in the Wuhan lockdown to go back home to the capital.</p> <h2>Japan and Hong Kong fight second wave of infections</h2> <p>A new wave of coronavirus cases in Tokyo has prompted the city\u2019s governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/tokyo-governor-tells-residents-to-stay-home-to-avoid-coronavirus-explosion\">to urge residents to stay at home this weekend</a>. Yuriko Koike described the situation as \u201csevere\u201d and asked people \u201cat all costs to refrain from going out this weekend if it\u2019s not urgent. Tokyo reported 41 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the largest daily number in the capital. There are also concerns of a resurgence in Hong Kong where a health expert called for a curfew to handle returning cases. Thailand closed its borders on Wednesday and researchers estimate Indonesia may have thousands more cases than currently recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/indonesia-could-have-thousands-of-hidden-coronavirus-cases-study-says\">as fears grow of an epidemic in the country of 260 million people.</a></p> <h2>Trump accuses media of wanting to keep economy shut</h2> <p>Donald Trump has accused the media of wanting to keep the US economy shut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/trump-accuses-media-of-wanting-to-keep-economy-shut-to-hurt-his-reelection\">in order to harm his chances of being reelected in November</a>. Repeating his wish to open up parts of the country by Easter, Trump used his daily press conference to blame reporters for trying to keep the economy weak. A sign of the problems facing the US economy came as California\u2019s governor said the state had received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/california-coronavirus-unemployment-newsom\">more than a million claims for unemployment this month</a> due to the coronavirus crisis. The Senate passed the $2tr dollar stimulus package on Wednesday night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/trump-family-stimulus-package-not-benefit-deal\">but Trump\u2019s family will not be able to benefit from it</a>, Democrats have insisted. The US now has almost 70,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths.</p> <h2>Police in England to be given powers to enforce stay-at-home rules</h2> <p>In England, police will have the power to disperse people suspected of breaching stay-at-home rules. Ministers are expected to give more details on Thursday of how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-lockdown-will-be-imposed-by-force-in-england\">police will be authorised</a> to first encourage people to go back indoors if they suspect them of being out of their home in breach of the ban. If that and the issuing of a fine fails, reasonable force could be used. Meanwhile, police report <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-crisis-leads-to-precipitous-drop-in-recorded\">a huge drop in crime since the outbreak began</a>.</p> <h2>Spain deaths overtake China</h2> <p>Spain is living through \u201cone of the darkest periods in its history\u201d as the coronavirus continues to sweep through the country. More people have now died in Spain \u2013 3,647 \u2013 than in China and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/spain-coronavirus-response-analysis\">the writer Giles Tremlett examines</a> how it managed to respond so badly to a crisis that it knew was coming several weeks ago. Factors being blamed include complacency, poorly equipped hospitals and mild winter weather.</p> <h2>Singapore slump signals global recession has started</h2> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/g20-hold-emergency-video-summit-discuss-coronavirus\">G20 leaders prepare for a teleconference meeting on Thursday</a>, the worsening state of the world economy will be very high on their agenda. Ratings agency Moody\u2019s said the G20 economies will experience an \u201cunprecedented shock\u201d in the first half of this year and will contract in 2020 as a whole. Singapore data suggests the city-state\u2019s economy will shrink 2% this quarter, which equates to a 10.6% slump over a full year, in figures that signal the onset of the global recession.</p> <h2>New Zealand lockdown</h2> <p>Kiwis began their first day under strict, stay-at-home conditions that will last four weeks, with the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/ardern-thanks-nation-as-new-zealand-adjusts-to-new-normal-of-covid-19-lockdown\">warning that Covid-19 numbers will rise </a>\u2013 possibly into the thousands \u2013 before they drop. The country has 283 confirmed cases and no deaths from the coronavirus.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus crisis has led to a drop in recorded crime, by as much as 20% in some areas.</p> \n<p>Offences such as burglary and violence were down last week compared with the previous seven days, after Boris Johnson made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">his first request for people to stay home</a> on the Monday.</p> \n<p>The fall this week could be even larger after the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">changed his pleas for social distancing into an order to stay inside</a>.</p> \n<p>In one force, Durham, rated by inspectors as one of the best in England, the drop in crime was 20%. Officers recorded an average of 130 crimes a day, as opposed to an average of 165 the previous week.</p> \n<p>Stephen White, acting police and crime commissioner for Durham, said: \u201cSome people rely on shoplifting to fund their drug habit. That\u2019s harder as the shops are closed.\u201d</p> \n<p>While there are some local variations, crime levels are believed to be down across the country, as are calls to police through 999 and 101, as people heed pleas to use online services, which consume less police time.</p> \n<p>Chief constable Andy Cooke, lead for the National Police Chiefs Council on crime, said the closure of pubs and clubs, which drive the night-time economy, and the fact that far more people were home for much more of the day were also cutting offences: \u201cThere is less violence from pub fights, less burglaries as everyone is at home.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, police believe crime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/24/uk-police-chiefs-coronavirus-could-bring-out-worst-in-humanity\">may start to increase</a> as the lockdown and restrictions continue. Cooke said: \u201cWhat you will see are increases in domestic violence, with people cooped up in the same home, and internet crime such as fraud and scams.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cooke, who is also chief constable of Merseyside, said 7% of his force were already off because they had the virus or were self-isolating.</p> \n<p>In Durham 6% of officers are absent, while Greater Manchester police have 10% absent.</p> \n<p>The Metropolitan police, responsible for the coronavirus hotspot of London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/24/police-leaders-say-enforcing-uk-lockdown-may-be-impossible\">already has an absence rate of 20%</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9a2c84f9-f1ee-4f03-b74e-1d90a218e61a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rt0yrMKAq7E?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He said he feared a 25-30% absence rate at the outbreak\u2019s peak, with the force prepared to enact crisis measures and respond to 999 emergency calls only.</p> \n<p>Cooke developed coronavirus symptoms himself two weeks ago and tested positive last week. \u201cThese are difficult and different times for policing, we are keeping a very close eye on it, we will move staff to different departments if we need to,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The Merseyside force has lost 1,100 officers over the past 10 years as part of the government\u2019s austerity cuts. It is currently training 500 new recruits \u2013 who may be plucked out of the classroom and put on the beat before they officially qualify \u201cas a last resort\u201d, in less demanding roles such as guarding crime scenes, said Cooke.</p> \n<p>The chief constable said he was worried about prisoners being released early from jail because of fears the virus could sweep through overcrowded prisons: \u201cIf they are coming out without tags, I would be very concerned. Even if they come out on tags, that leaves us - the police - to ensure they are where they should be, so puts an extra workload on the police. My preference would be that they aren\u2019t released early but it\u2019s not my decision.\u201d</p> \n<p>Regarding his own illness, he said it had \u201cknocked me sideways\u201d, having considered himself fit and with no underlying health issues. He insisted he had now largely recovered, barring \u201ca nasty cough\u201d which he had been assured was not infectious.</p> \n<p>The 56-year-old said: \u201cIt started with a really high temperature, aches and pains. really tight chest, a really dry cough, headaches. That was the first three or four days.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd then I thought I was getting through it and started to feel better for a day and a bit but it came back in the same way. Not so much the high temperature but the other symptoms were there. It was the first time I\u2019d been off sick for 20-odd years.\u201d</p> \n<p>It had been impossible to trace everyone he might have infected, he said, because he had met \u201ctoo many people all over the country\u201d.</p> \n<p>Cooke attended and spoke at the conference of police chiefs and police and crime commissioners in late February in central London.</p>",
  "<p>Protectionist measures by national governments during the coronavirus crisis could provoke food shortages around the world, the UN\u2019s food body has warned.</p> <p>Harvests have been good and the outlook for staple crops is promising, but a shortage of field workers brought on by the virus crisis and a move towards protectionism \u2013 tariffs and export bans \u2013 mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/tim-lang-interview-professor-of-food-policy-city-university-supply-chain-crisis\">problems could quickly appear</a> in the coming weeks, Maximo Torero, chief economist of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe worst that can happen is that governments restrict the flow of food,\u201d he said. \u201cAll measures against free trade will be counterproductive. Now is not the time for restrictions or putting in place trade barriers. Now is the time to protect the flow of food around the world.\u201d</p> <p>Governments must resist calls from some quarters to protect their own food supply by restricting exports, he said, as some have begun to do.</p> <p>Kazakhstan, for instance, according to a report from Bloomberg, has banned exports of wheat flour, of which it is one of the world\u2019s biggest sources, as well as restrictions on buckwheat and vegetables including onions, carrots and potatoes. Vietnam, the world\u2019s third biggest rice exporter, has temporarily suspended rice export contracts. Russia, the world\u2019s biggest wheat exporter, may also threaten to restrict exports, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/05/vladimir-putin-ban-grain-exports\">as it has done before</a>, and the position of the US is in doubt given Donald Trump\u2019s eagerness for a trade war in other commodities.</p> <p>\u201cTrade barriers will create extreme volatility,\u201d warned Torero. \u201c[They] will make the situation worse. That\u2019s what we observe in food crises.\u201d</p> <p>While the supply of food is functioning well in most countries at present, problems could start to be seen within weeks and intensify over the following two months as key fruit and vegetables come into season. These types of produce often have short ripening times and are highly perishable, and need skilled pickers to work quickly at the right time.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be careful not to break the food value chain and the logistics or we will be looking at problems with fresh vegetables and fruits soon,\u201d said Torero. \u201cFruit and vegetables are also very labour intensive, if the labour force is threatened because people can\u2019t move then you have a problem.\u201d</p> <p>As governments impose lockdowns in countries across the world, recruiting seasonal workers will become impossible unless measures are taken to ensure vital workers can still move around, while preventing the virus from spreading.</p> <p>\u201cCoronavirus is affecting the labour force and the logistical problems are becoming very important,\u201d said Torero. \u201cWe need to have policies in place so the labour force can keep doing their job. Protect people too, but we need the labour force. Major countries have yet to implement these sorts of policies to ensure that food can keep moving.\u201d</p> <p>Countries such as the UK, with a sinking currency and high level of imports, are also likely to see food price rises unless the government takes action or retailers absorb some of the costs, he said.</p> <p>The most important role governments can play is to keep the food supply chain operating, intervene to ensure there are enough workers, and keep the global food markets from panicking, according to Torero.</p> <p>\u201cIf traders start to become nervous, conditions will get difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just needs one big trader to make a decision [to disrupt the supply of staple crops] and that will affect everywhere. Governments must properly regulate, that is their biggest function in this situation. It\u2019s very important to keep alive the food value chain: intervene to protect the value chain [including the supply of workers] but not to distort the market.\u201d</p> <p>Individuals can also play an important role, by avoiding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/us-coronavirus-panic-buying-food\">panic buying</a> and hoarding of food, and cutting down on food waste. Buying too much fresh farm produce that then goes off before it can be eaten will just exacerbate food supply problems, he said. \u201cIndividuals should only buy what they need to avoid food waste.\u201d</p> <p>Animal welfare is also an issue as border delays caused by the Covid-19 lockdown measures are meaning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/meat-prices-could-rise-as-covid-19-adds-pressure-to-vulnerable-supply-chain-coronavirus\">livestock journeys are lengthened</a>.</p> <p>In the UK, some farming leaders have called for a \u201cland army\u201d of workers to replace a shortfall of workers that could reach 80,000, according to one estimate, if the 60,000 seasonal workers recruited from abroad in normal years are prevented from coming, and if some British workers fall ill.</p> <p>Organisations representing both wealthy landowners and agricultural workers have urged the government to intervene. The Landworkers\u2019 Alliance, representing more than 1,000 small and medium farmers and landworkers across the UK, wrote to the chancellor of the exchequer asking for a \u00a39.3m package of support to pay a \u201cland army\u201d of workers to increase domestic fruit and vegetable production as the Covid-19 crisis bites.</p> <p>The Country Land and Business Association (CLA), representing more than 30,000 UK landowners and rural firms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/20/farmers-call-for-land-army-to-sustain-uk-food-production-during-coronavirus-crisis\">made a similar call last week</a>, for the government to make it easier for people thrown out of work by the lockdown to find seasonal work on farms. Mark Bridgeman, president of the CLA, said: \u201cWe need urgent government assistance to help source workers and advertise positions. Time is of the essence as many farmers will soon begin, or have already begun, planting or harvesting.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has said its officials and ministers are in regular communication with representatives of the food industry to ensure the food supply chain remains resilient.</p> <p>Andre Laperriere, executive director of Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition, which provides data on food and agriculture, said the government must make plans to ensure the food supply chain functioned smoothly.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/21/food-banks-plead-with-uk-supermarkets-to-set-aside-supplies-amid-coronavirus-fallout\">Empty shelves in supermarkets</a> should not be much of a concern,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not a supply problem \u2013 it is a logistics problem. There is enough supply for all, as long as everyone stays calm and stops hoarding. We may tend to waste food if we hoard more than required, and hoarding would also artificially increase food prices because of the pressure on the supply chain.\u201d</p> <p>He called for borders between the UK and other countries to remain open for imports and exports, and for farm workers to be supplied with protective equipment to enable them to carry on with their jobs safely amid the coronavirus lockdown. \u201cThe food sector comes under the critical infrastructure sector, along with healthcare and emergency services,\u201d he said.</p>",

But I didn\u2019t expect us to figuratively shit the bed and literally shiv each other over toilet roll so quickly.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never wanted to get out of Sydney more, and I\u2019ve never been more cognisant of the hubris and selfishness of running away from one\u2019s problems \u2013 a thing I\u2019ve literally just written the book on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"42e253e7942131001a148f6e06301ba4e8b74bf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42e253e7942131001a148f6e06301ba4e8b74bf0/0_0_1807_2764/654.jpg\" alt=\"Sweetness and Light\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was my hope that this book would make people think about what they took for granted about their own travel habits \u2013 those foundational, opaque layers of privilege that so many of us abused for so long.

Now Covid-19 has made clear that none of us are insulated from what\u2019s coming.</p> <p>As a species we are careening into unprecedented territory, a viral epidemic that far outstrips our global capacity to treat it \u2013 and an extant global crisis in trust and empathy.</p> <p>The planes are grounded, and for the feckless and flighty like me, there\u2019s no running away from what\u2019s coming. It could be that those layers of privilege, comfort and safety we never think to appreciate are on their way out. Once again, the epiphany: we\u2019re all in this. And we\u2019re in it together.

  "<p>After weeks of inaction and division, the leaders of the G20 major economies will hold an emergency video-conference summit to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, but hopes of a coordinated global response remain low.</p> \n<p>The summit on Thursday, nominally hosted by Saudi Arabia as this year\u2019s G20 chair, is likely to agree to fresh practical measures aimed at preventing a repeat of the disjointed approach to Covid-19. But an expected call for a coordinated large-scale monetary and fiscal stimulus is unlikely to extend beyond general rhetoric.</p> \n<p>The 27 leaders of the EU, the outbreak\u2019s new centre, will also meet by video.</p> \n<p>The World Bank and International Monetary Fund want the G20 to agree <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/western-governments-told-to-suspend-debt-interest-amid-covid-19\">immediate bilateral debt relief</a> to any of the world\u2019s 76 poorest countries that make such a request. The UN has made a separate appeal for a \u00a32bn humanitarian response fund to help the world\u2019s poorest countries.</p> \n<p>But expectations about the practical impact of the summit, bringing together countries representing more than 80% of global GDP, are low. In a sign of the G20\u2019s defensive posture, the summit has been hastily assembled largely to prevent countries imposing barriers on exports of medical equipment, or launching competitive efforts to find a potentially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/g7-leaders-to-hold-emergency-coronavirus-video-summit\">hugely profitable vaccine</a>.</p> \n<p>Many world leaders are overwhelmed by the financial cost of responding to their individual national crises, and a few are even questioning how long they can tolerate the damage inflicted on their economies by lockdown measures.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/world\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/trump-vows-to-open-up-our-country-even-as-deaths-from-coronavirus-rise\">Donald Trump</a> and the Brazilian president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/bolsonaro-brazil-wouldnt-feel-anything-covid-19-attack-state-lockdowns\">Jair Bolsonaro</a>, have broken ranks from the global consensus to warn they will not allow their economies to be \u201cclosed down\u201d.</p> \n<p>The US president, his poll ratings suddenly soaring, has said he wants America\u2019s restrictions eased by Easter. His aides have briefed that a chief US goal from the summit is to end Saudi increases in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/oil-price-may-fall-to-10-a-barrel-as-world-runs-out-of-storage-space\">oil production</a>, which are hitting the US shale industry.</p> \n<p>Trump will hear a plethora of international institutions make sometimes competing calls for a global response. Few observers see the meeting as remotely matching the impact of the G20 summit in London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/apr/02/g20-summit-world-leaders-arrive\">in 2009</a>, which is regarded as having turned the tide in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe heart of this problem is not economic as in 2008 but a breakdown in public health,\u201d said Harry Broadman, a former senior World Bank official specialising in China. \u201cYou can put down all the money in the world, but the G20 needs to be talking about funding and distribution of ventilators and vaccines. You need public health officials as much as finance ministers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Agreement is nevertheless likely in principle that countries should share medical research on combating the virus, and that the World Health Organization should get a clearer role in preparing the world for future pandemics. Turkey has said it will promote an international fund to help measure demand for medical equipment and its distribution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jim O\u2019Neill, David Cameron\u2019s former adviser on pandemics, said a G20 investment of \u00a320bn could finance development of Covid-19 treatments. \u201cAs world leaders gather to formulate a response to the crisis, they must not lose sight of this simple cost-benefit calculus,\u201d Lord O\u2019Neill said.</p> \n<p>The G20 has no power to bind its members, and largely works by securing pledges for this kind of funding initiative.</p> \n<p>Preparation time for the summit has been minimal. Stewart Wood, one of Gordon Brown\u2019s senior advisers in 2009, said that in the run-up to that year\u2019s summit, the then prime minister put in hours pressuring other leaders to \u201cdo their bit\u201d. Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman, aged 80 and rarely seen in public, is hardly such a galvanising leader.</p> \n<p>Broadman warned that the backdrop for the summit was not propitious. \u201cCurrently there is a lot of finger pointing about the genesis of the crisis between China and the US, the two world\u2019s largest economies,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is also a tension about the Chinese role in supplying medical aid where historically the US would have played that role. There are also lower-order conflicts, [including] over the oil price between Russia and the Saudis.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added that normally such conflicts could be eased by personal chemistry between leaders at the summit. \u201cThere is a cost to having leaders not seeing other\u2019s body language and expressions across the table in real time,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Ahead of the meeting the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, again accused China of covering up the outbreak in Wuhan and then indulging in \u201ccrazy talk\u201d that the US sent the virus to China. It was reported that a virtual meeting of G7 foreign ministers on Wednesday could not agree a joint statement after the US demanded references were made to the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d in the communique.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The summit is also likely to reflect the fact decisions on demand stimulus are likely to be taken at national or possibly regional level. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">US fiscal stimulus</a>, worth $2tn (\u00a31.68tn) in relief to businesses and taxpayers, is the largest measure so far, but China, an export-led economy, is unlikely to make any matching proposal. Brown himself urged both China and the EU to match the scale of the US and UK fiscal stimuli.</p> \n<p>Within Europe, France, Italy and Spain and six other euro area governments have called for the issuance of joint European debt to finance the fight against coronavirus, but this is being resisted by Berlin as a premature step. Until the EU can agree its own steps it is hardly likely to make a major investment to help the wider world.</p> \n<p>In their conference call on Thursday, EU leaders are expected to sign off on \u201ca true European crisis management centre\u201d, according to a leaked document.</p> \n<p>The EU already has an emergency response coordination centre, which operates 24/7 and can organise help, if asked, when any country in the world suffers an earthquake, forest fire, floods or pandemic. But the text seen by the Guardian refers to \u201ca more ambitious and wide-ranging crisis management system within the EU\u201d.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Jennifer Rankin in Brussels</em></p>",

He said more than 1.2m of the 2.5m government employees would continue to be kept away from work.</p> \n  <p>Claiming the coronavirus pandemic was about to enter a second phase in Iran, he praised those Iranians that had abided by advice and not travelled to holiday resorts during Iran\u2019s new year break, but there is clearly a concern that the pandemic will spread again when millions return from their holidays. The ability of Iran to track those with the infection is limited, and promises by the army to clear the streets have been made before, only for little to happen.</p> \n  <p><strong>Rouhani also claimed the issue of US economic sanctions on Iran was set to be raised at the UN Security Council</strong>.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/china-to-lift-travel-restrictions-in-hubei-after-months-of-coronavirus-lockdown\"> relaxing of travel restrictions in Hubei province</a>, where the pandemic started.</p> \n  <p>Li\u2019s comments came as analysts questioned the veracity of China\u2019s claims that the nation has had several days with no new domestic cases.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to a meeting of the central leading group responding to the outbreak on Monday, Li urged officials to report honestly on the number of cases, and \u201cnot cover up reports for the sake of keeping new case numbers at zero\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-03-24/premier-orders-honest-reporting-of-coronavirus-cases-101533334.html\">according to Caixin Global</a>.</p> \n  <p>Li said worldwide analysis of the virus showed the virus was unlikely to dissipate like Sars.</p> \n  <p>He warned that while the epidemic in Hubei and Wuhan had essentially been stopped, there were still risks of sporadic outbreaks.</p> \n  <p>\u201c[We] Have to realise the prevention measure - \u2018early detection, reporting, isolation and treatment\u2019, to stop the epidemic in certain areas and prevent an even bigger outbreak.\u201d</p> \n  <p>For several days now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> has reported few or zero new domestic cases of Covid-19 infection, claiming success in controlling the outbreak which just one month ago saw thousands of confirmations a day.</p> \n  <p>However, residents and analysts have questioned the near-zero rate of community transmissions, expressing concern that the Chinese government is prioritising economic recovery over total virus containment. </p> \n  <p>The low figures have led Chinese authorities to lift stringent travel restrictions in Hubei, effectively freeing millions of people from two months of extraordinary lockdown.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a

  "<p>The future of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline has been thrown into question after a federal court on Wednesday struck down its permits and ordered a comprehensive environmental review.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock\">Our fight against the Dakota Access pipeline is far from over</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US army corps of engineers was ordered to conduct a full environmental impact statement (EIS), after the Washington DC <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/standing-rock-sj.pdf\">court ruled</a> that existing permits violated the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa).</p> <p>The ruling is a huge victory for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/north-dakota-standing-rock-protests-civil-rights\">the Standing Rock Sioux tribe of North Dakota</a>, which rallied support from across the world and sued the US government in a campaign to stop the environmentally risky pipeline being built on tribal lands.</p> <p>\u201cAfter years of commitment to defending our water and earth, we welcome this news of a significant legal win,\u201d said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/15/dakota-access-pipeline-standing-rock\">tribal chairman, Mike Faith</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling to see how actions we took to defend our ancestral homeland continue to inspire national conversations about how our choices ultimately affect this planet.\u201d</p> <p>In December 2016, the Obama administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/04/dakota-access-pipeline-permit-denied-standing-rock\">denied permits for the pipeline</a> to cross the Missouri river and ordered a full EIS to analyze alternative routes and the impact on the tribe\u2019s treaty rights.</p> <p>In his first week in office, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/24/keystone-xl-dakota-access-pipelines-revived-trump-administration\">signed an executive order</a> to expedite construction. Construction of the 1,200-mile pipeline was completed in June 2017.</p> <p>The tribe challenged the permits \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/14/dakota-access-pipeline-environmental-study-inadequate\">and won</a>. As a result, the corps was ordered to redo its environmental analysis, which it did without taking into <a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/news/press/2020/standing-rock-sioux-tribe-prevails-as-federal-judge-strikes-down-dapl-permits\">consideration tribal concerns or expert analysis.</a></p> <p>The pipeline continued to transport oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The tribe and EarthJustice, an environmental law not-for-profit group, sued again.</p> <p>In his ruling on Wednesday, the federal judge James Boasberg, an Obama appointee, said the environmental analysis by both the companies behind the pipeline and the corps was severely lacking.</p> <p>The abysmal safety record of the pipeline parent company, Sunoco, \u201cdoes not inspire confidence\u201d, he added.</p> <p>The court-mandated EIS will be more in depth than the assessment already completed by the corps \u2013 and could take years. The court will next decide if the pipeline should be shut down until the EIS is done.</p> <p>The corps did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>\u201cThis validates everything the tribe has been saying all along about the risk of oil spills to the people of Standing Rock,\u201d said Jan Hasselman, an EarthJustice attorney. \u201cThe Obama administration had it right when it moved to deny the permits in 2016.\u201d</p> <p>The setback for the pipeline comes as the Trump administration moves to severely curtail <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/nepa/downloads/national-environmental-policy-act-1969\">Nepa, the 1969 legislation</a> which is widely considered the cornerstone of US environmental protection. Trump has repeatedly blamed Nepa for blocking fossil fuel projects.</p>"
