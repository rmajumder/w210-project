Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic</strong>. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK reported 545 more deaths, taking its total to 35,341</strong>. The environment secretary, George Eustice, announced the latest figure at the government\u2019s daily briefing on the epidemic. The UK remains the world\u2019s second-worst affected country by deaths after the US.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d</strong>. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.</strong>There will be no \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said.

The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414.</li> \n   <li><strong>The border between Canada and the US will remain closed</strong> to non-essential travel until 21 June.

The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week</strong>, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday</strong>, as the local lockdown eases.

It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine.</p> \n  <h2><strong>What\u2019s the state of the current evidence?</strong><br></h2> \n  <p>In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients.</p> \n  <p>A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">French trial</a> also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group.</p> \n  <p>The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial.</p> \n  <h2>What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine?</h2> \n  <p>There are several side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss. Research published by the Mayo Clinic has suggested that \u201coff-label\u201d repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec443a08f0886ce4f5d6a4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T20:49:28.592Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the US, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has claimed that scientists carried out a study of the effects of hydroxychloroquine, the results of which suggested he is wrong to tout it, because they oppose him politically.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2\">The study</a> of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate.

Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population. </li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic</strong>. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK reported 545 more deaths, taking its total to 35,341</strong>. The environment secretary, George Eustice, announced the latest figure at the government\u2019s daily briefing on the epidemic. The UK remains the world\u2019s second-worst affected country by deaths after the US.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d</strong>. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections </strong>as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414.</li> \n   <li><strong>The border between Canada and the US will remain closed</strong> to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day</strong>, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week</strong>, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday</strong>, as the local lockdown eases. People will be able to make \u201crecreational use\u201d of the Catalan capital\u2019s beaches as long as they respect physical distancing. </li> \n   <li><strong>Half a dozen people from three English Premier League football clubs tested positive for Covid-19</strong> in the space of two days, dealing a blow to hopes of top-flight English football resuming next month.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me, <strong>Damien Gayle</strong>, until tomorrow. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec41d808f0864e579f13f24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/dan-collyns\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T18:00:42.966Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Covid-19 continues to sweep across the <strong>Peruvian Amazon</strong> with deadly ferocity. Pucallpa, on the country\u2019s eastern border with Brazil, follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/07/peru-jungle-iquitos-coronavirus-covid-19\">Iquitos</a> as the second Peruvian Amazon city to be ravaged by the deadly virus, writes <strong>Dan Collyns</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Social media images showed sick people lying in motorised rickshaws outside one hospital which had shut its doors and refused to take more patients. Other images showed doctors and nurses protesting about the lack of PPE, medicines and oxygen. </p> \n  <p>At least 45 members of the 30,000-strong Shipibo Konibo indigenous people have died from the coronavirus in Ucayali, the Amazon region of which Pucallpa is the capital, according to the local indigenous federation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/feconau1/status/1262055749380902914\">Feconau</a>. Many more are sick as Covid-19 has penetrated villages that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/south-america-indigenous-groups-coronavirus-brazil-colombia\">self-isolated</a> when the pandemic reached South America.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn Pucallpa there is a total collapse of the three public hospitals, the private clinics are shut, and people are dying here every day,\u201d said Miguel Hilario-Manenima, a local university professor with a PhD from Stanford university. </p> \n  <p>As desperate patients gasp for air, an oxygen plant lies inoperative in the city, part of newly built hospital that was never completed, an investigation by <a href=\"https://elcomercio.pe/peru/ucayali/hospital-de-pucallpa-tiene-una-planta-de-oxigeno-inoperativa-por-obra-inconclusa-noticia/\">El Comercio newspaper</a> revealed.</p> \n  <p>As in Iquitos, oxygen has become a precious and overpriced resource in the hands of private companies who have quintupled the cost of a typical 10m3 canister, all sources consulted by The Guardian concurred. </p> \n  <p>Aoife Bennett, an honorary research associate from Oxford University working in Pucallpa, said indigenous communities were clubbing together to try to buy oxygen which had reached \u201cextortionate\u201d prices. A cylinder which cost about 600 soles (\u00a3144) before the pandemic began now costs between 3,500 soles (\u00a3843) and 5,000 soles (\u00a31,205).</p> \n  <p>\u201cI put money towards buying a ridiculously expensive cylinder of oxygen because I\u2019m trying to save a friend\u2019s life,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cBut it\u2019s absolutely disgusting that this should happen.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Peru\u2019s state social security body EsSalud said last week it expected to build a 100-bed field hospital in Pucallpa for Covid-19 patients which would be ready in three weeks.</p> \n  <p>Official figures for Ucayali report <a href=\"https://covid19.minsa.gob.pe/sala_situacional.asp\">2,032 coronavirus cases and 91 deaths</a> but local accounts report hundreds of deaths. One local cemetery <a href=\"https://rpp.pe/peru/ucayali/ucayali-cementerios-colapsan-en-pucallpa-mas-de-500-fallecidos-en-un-mes-pero-minsa-reporta-63-por-covid-19-noticia-1265720\">reported 421 deaths above the average</a> number of deceased during the last month. </p> \n  <p>Coronavirus cases in Peru rose to more than 94,000 on Monday, with a death toll of 2,789 according to official figures.

<p>Donald Trump has threatened to cut funding to the World Health Organization permanently and even pull the US out of the global body altogether unless it makes \u201cmajor substantive improvements\u201d which the president did not explain.</p> \n  <p>On Monday night, the president published the letter, citing a timeline of the organisation\u2019s alleged failings, which was based on a selective version of the pandemic, highlighting where the WHO had publicised Chinese findings on the nature of the disease, but ignoring or glossing over clear warnings from the organisation about the dangers of the contagion.</p> \n  <p>The move came hours after the US president told reporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for a couple of weeks</a>, despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous. \u201cI think it\u2019s good, I heard a lot of good stories \u2026 I take a pill every day,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>The letter is the latest salvo in a war of words between Trump and the WHO that has unfolded in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The US president, who is under pressure at home over his response to the pandemic, temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">froze funding to the WHO</a> in April, accusing the global body of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the threat. At the time, critics were stunned at the move to cut money from a critical UN agency during a global pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Before Trump\u2019s letter, Tedros acknowledged there had been shortcomings and told the virtual assembly he welcomed calls for a review. \u201cI will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained and lessons learned, and to make recommendations to improve national and global pandemic preparedness and response,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one thing is abundantly clear.

The letter states that if the WHO \u201cdoes not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership of the organization.\u201d The letter states that the Trump administration\u2019s review into the WHO\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak \u201cconfirmed many of the serious concerns I raised...and identified others that the World Health Organization should have addressed, especially the World Health Organization\u2019s alarming lack of independence from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>US deaths pass 90,000. </strong>The coronavirus death told in the US passed 90,000 Monday, and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases overtake UK to become third-highest worldwide. </strong>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil stands at 255,368, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a> figures, making the country the third-worst affected in terms of cases.There are 16,792 officially confirmed deaths in Brazil, which is lower than the UK, Italy, Spain and France.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>IMF chief says full economic recovery unlikely in 2021. </strong>The global economy will take much longer to recover fully from the shock caused by the new coronavirus than initially expected, the head of the International Monetary Fund said, and she stressed the danger of protectionism.

That is why it is my duty, as President of the United States, to inform you that, <strong>if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permane</strong>nt and <strong>reconsider our membership in the organization</strong>.

But Rural Bank\u2019s chief operating officer, Will Rayner, told the Guardian the wool and barley industries were similar in their vulnerability to Chinese tariffs.</p> <p>Rayner said that because China purchased more raw wool than the rest of the world combined, any tariffs \u201cwould have an immediate effect on Australian wool exports\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis would continue until tariffs were removed or a new market was found.

  "<p>BBC Three could make a triumphant return as a broadcast TV channel after enjoying a run of hits \u2013 from Fleabag to lockdown obsession Normal People \u2013 that have rated with the youth audience the corporation is desperate to win over.</p> <p>The corporation is actively exploring reviving the broadcast channel, four years after it was taken online-only, according to the BBC\u2019s annual plan due to be published on Wednesday.</p> <p>Regardless of what is decided, the channel will have its programme budget more than double to \u00a380m over the next two years. This bulking up will mean it is able to commission enough programming for a linear TV schedule, but will entail cuts elsewhere in the corporation.</p> <p>The annual plan, which sets out the BBC\u2019s intentions for the next financial year, says the corporation has turned around the slide of youth audiences trickling away to other services such as Netflix.</p> <p>Two years ago the corporation said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/28/bbc-younger-viewers-now-watch-netflix-more-on-demand\">faced a crisis over reaching younger audiences</a>, revealing that 16- to 24-year-olds spent more time with Netflix in a week than with all of BBC TV including the BBC iPlayer.</p> <p>\u201cBBC Three has become home to some of our biggest shows,\u201d said a BBC source. \u201cWe need to back that success, so within an environment where we are making difficult cuts, this is one of a limited number of areas where we will seek to invest. Who wouldn\u2019t want more Fleabags, Killing Eves, This Country or Normal People?\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, Normal People, which the corporation says has now had more than 38m requests to view it on the iPlayer, helped deliver the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/05/normal-people-delivers-best-week-ever-for-bbc-three\">best week ever for BBC Three as TV viewing soar</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/05/normal-people-delivers-best-week-ever-for-bbc-three\">ed under lockdown conditions</a>.</p> <p>The annual plan will point to BBC research that shows there is still a big available audience on broadcast television. The huge success of digital channel ITV2\u2019s in attracting millions of younger viewers to Love Island is a case in point that has not gone unnoticed at the BBC.</p> <p>One executive at the corporation said BBC Three \u201chas been a real hit machine \u2026 but it\u2019s also reaching the wider population as well.\u201d</p> <p>The channel\u2019s new budget will be almost twice that of BBC Four\u2019s \u00a344m, as rumours circulate that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/14/bbc-four-presenters-rally-to-save-channel-amid-closure-rumours\">arts and culture channel could face the threat of closure.</a></p> <p>BBC Four attracts a small, niche audience of mostly older viewers to its schedule of shows, although it was responsible for creating the hit comedy The Thick of It. The corporation has made it clear that its goal is to pursue younger audiences.</p> <p>Speculation intensified earlier this month when it was announced that Cassian Harrison, BBC Four\u2019s long-serving controller, is to move to BBC Studios, the corporation\u2019s commercial arm, on a nine-month attachment.</p> <p>While the annual plan does not explicitly protect the future of BBC Four, sources say a closure is not on the cards.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not about playing off BBC Four against BBC Three,\u201d said a BBC source. \u201cContrary to reports, the BBC has no plans to close it or diminish our arts portfolio.\u201d</p> <p>The annual plan will also address the negative impact the pandemic is having on the corporation\u2019s finances. The BBC has predicted its income will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/29/bbc-likely-to-make-cuts-to-output-after-income-forecast-to-drop-125m\">fall by \u00a3125m this year</a> as people stop paying the licence fee during the coronavirus pandemic and as revenue from its commercial arm drops substantially.</p> <p>A source says the corporation will set out plans on how to \u201cbalance its books\u201d in the autumn as a result, once the full financial impact of the coronavirus is clear.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson has made much of being at the helm of a supposed \u201cwartime\u201d government during the coronavirus crisis. The enemy is deadly, he tells us, and we have all been enlisted in the fight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/19/unions-call-national-recovery-council-rebuild-uk-economy\">TUC boss calls for new council to build fairer economy after Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, has had enough of the bombast. \u201cBut if we\u2019re using war analogies,\u201d she says, \u201cthere have been times during this crisis which have had the feeling of the first world war, with the army generals camped hundreds of miles from the front line ordering troops over the top.\u201d</p> <p>In O\u2019Grady\u2019s view, it is the collaboration and progressive spirit of the post-1945 years that provides a better model. To that end, on Wednesday, alongside the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, she will call for a \u201cnational recovery council\u201d of unions, government and business. The next few years must see an increase in the minimum wage, a ban on zero-hours contracts and a job guarantee scheme \u2013 particularly for young people facing a bleak future, she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe big challenge is what happens next and it\u2019s important to have representatives of the workforce at the table to figure that out,\u201d says O\u2019Grady, speaking exclusively to the Guardian. \u201cWe can be architects, I think, of the next stage.\u201d</p> <p>This has been an extraordinary time for the TUC, which since the crisis struck has collaborated with the government to an extent unimaginable a few months ago. But with teaching unions in a deadlock with ministers over the proposed limited return to schools at the start of June and employees who can\u2019t work from home already told to return to their workplaces, does she worry unions could be used as a scapegoat for the UK\u2019s stilted exit from lockdown?</p> <p>\u201cI think the public trusts us and our members trust us,\u201d she says. \u201cOur first duty of care is to working people, and there is nothing more fundamental than people staying healthy and safe.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Grady is insistent that \u201cthere can be no going back to business as usual\u201d when the crisis passes and the fallout begins. Cuts to the welfare state and public services over a decade of austerity left the UK unable to deal with the seismic shock of a global pandemic, she argues. Black people in England and Wales are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">more than four times as likely to die</a> of coronavirus, with poverty and health inequality mooted as possible reasons.</p> <p>\u201cWe now know the real price of inequality,\u201d says O\u2019Grady. \u201cThis time working people can\u2019t pay the price for recovery. People will not put up with that. I think the big issue is how do we grow our way out of this and what kinds of industries and jobs will help us do that.\u201d</p> <p>Rebuilding will require investment, not cuts \u2013 and that will have to mean fairer taxes, she adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get that safety net strung again, we\u2019ve got to invest in our public services, which may have to build resilience for a long time to come,\u201d she says. \u201cUnions are back \u2026 but the state is back too.\u201d</p> <p>The need for \u201ca healthy, secure and green economy\u201d with quality skilled jobs is \u201cnot a pipe dream, it\u2019s a necessity,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have built hospitals in days, have had to radically transform the way we live and work within days. I think we\u2019ve run out of excuses about creating a carbon-free economy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ceec57ff66625a40518ab5d6e9bd051d53fb6467\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ceec57ff66625a40518ab5d6e9bd051d53fb6467/0_53_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frances O\u2019Grady, seen here at last year\u2019s TUC Congress in Brighton, is calling for a 'national recovery council' of unions, government and business.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frances O\u2019Grady at last year\u2019s TUC Congress in Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In practice that will mean building domestic supply chains, expanding renewable power, manufacturing batteries for electric cars, she says. If critical industries like aviation need bailing out, there must be strings attached. As firms <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/18/firms-slash-entry-level-jobs-by-almost-quarter-owing-to-coronavirus-pandemic-young-people\">slash entry level jobs by a quarter</a> , job guarantee schemes \u2013 \u201cproper ones, not Mickey Mouse schemes\u201d \u2013 particularly for young people, will have to be put in place. It should mean, she adds, an increase in the minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour, plus an end to zero-hours contracts and \u201cfalse\u201d self-employment where workers have no rights. </p> <p>TUC analysis shows women make up three-quarters of key workers, who are worse paid, on average, than those in other sectors (four in 10 key workers earn less than \u00a310 an hour, compared to three in 10 non key workers). In social care \u2013 where one in four workers are on zero-hours contracts \u2013 that figure rises to seven.</p> <p>\u201cThese are people doing some of the most valuable work in society for the least money, who are still even today wrapping themselves in bin bags because of a lack of PPE,\u201d says O\u2019Grady. \u201cWhat does that say about us?\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Grady is not a tub-thumper. But asked to rate the government\u2019s performance so far she is quietly damning. \u201cI think there have been a string of failures,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were late on lockdown, late on mass testing [and] PPE. We\u2019ve got the highest number of deaths in Europe. This was not a success and they\u2019ve got to learn lessons.\u201d</p> <p>There is still no plan for the mass provision of PPE for a workforce, a significant proportion of whom have already been sent back to work. \u201cIt is going to have to happen fast or it will slow the recovery down quite badly because safety must come first,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is possible to rebuild and to be safe. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask to protect livelihoods and lives.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Grady says the prime minister was \u201cclearly irresponsible\u201d to tell those who could not work from home to return to their workplaces without a clear plan in place. There was a worry among unions and business leaders in the week leading up to 10 May, that he might make a \u201ccavalier unilateral announcement,\u201d she says, but there was still shock when it appeared that people had been told to go back to work with 12-hours notice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"281bb9d72fd92e9ff0b8589659d3d88d2fc59f67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/281bb9d72fd92e9ff0b8589659d3d88d2fc59f67/0_50_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson addresses the nation on 10 May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson addresses the nation about the latest coronavirus plans on 10 May.

Britain is our home.\u201d</p> <p> Lilieta wants to join the army when she leaves school after hearing her father\u2019s descriptions of his time serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Falkland Islands, but she knows she will face difficulties because her visa status is unresolved.</p> <p>Ratucaucau\u2019s two older daughters were born in Germany, while he was based there with the army. His youngest daughter was born in the UK and has no visa problems. Immigration uncertainties have made everyone in the family very unhappy. \u201cI\u2019m angry and embarrassed,\u201d Lilieta said.</p> <p>Ratucaucau is one of a group of Commonwealth-born military veterans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/08/commonwealth-veterans-accuse-uk-immigration-limbo-home-office-mod\">who launched legal action against the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence</a> earlier this year over an alleged systemic failure to advise them of the need to apply for settlement in the UK on discharge and for failing to assist them with complex, expensive immigration rules, which has left them categorised as illegal immigrants, struggling to access free NHS treatment, facing unemployment and fearing forced removal.</p> <p>They are unable to regularise their status due to rising visa costs and the complexity of the immigration system.</p> <p>Foreign national soldiers have the right to remain in the UK after leaving the army if they have served for at least four years, but claimants say they were discharged without being given clear guidance about how to regularise their immigration status. Most assumed the process was automatic. Ratucaucau would need to pay \u00a32,389 for each applicant, a total of \u00a39,556 for the family. Since being discharged from the army he has not been able to afford the sum.</p> <p>Visa fees have risen dramatically over the past decade as part of a government policy to cut immigration. Hospitals have been under an increased obligation since 2017 to check the immigration status of patients and to charge anyone who cannot prove eligibility in line with a series of measures designed to create a hostile environment for illegal migration.</p> <p>Ratucaucau said he had had no contact from the government officials and had no reason to think that the Ministry of Defence had changed its position. \u201cI am just hoping that they look at my situation and try to sort this,\u201d he said</p> <p> Charles Byrne, director general of the Royal British Legion, said: \u201cAs a nation we rely on the bravery and courage of our Commonwealth personnel yet, despite their years of service to this country, they currently have to pay thousands of pounds in fees if they and their families wish to remain in the UK after service.

  "<p>Denis Summers-Smith, who has died aged 99, belonged to the pioneering pre-second world war generation of birdwatchers whose contributions to our understanding of bird behaviour helped transform the science of ornithology.</p> <p>In particular Summers-Smith wrote about, and made a lifelong study of, the house sparrow, a bird he chose partly because it was so abundant. Yet towards the end of the 20th century house sparrow numbers suddenly began to plummet, in urban and rural settings alike. Several theories were proposed to explain the decline, and in 2000 the Independent newspaper offered a prize of \u00a35,000 for the first peer-reviewed scientific paper to find a solution, with Summers-Smith acting as referee.</p> <p>Eight years later, the prize was finally awarded to scientists at De Montfort University, Leicester, who ascribed the decline to a fall in numbers of insects, on which sparrows feed their chicks during their first few days of life. The reason this affected sparrows more than other songbird species was connected with their sedentary nature \u2013 rarely travelling more than a mile from their birthplace in their brief lives.</p> <p>In his first book, a Collins New Naturalist monograph entitled The House Sparrow (1963), Summers-Smith had confidently predicted that the species would enjoy a bright future. After all, no other bird had adapted quite so well to living alongside humanity, having spread \u2013 with our help \u2013 to six of the world\u2019s seven continents. Despite experiencing an unprecedented fall in its numbers, in the final years of his life the species at last showed signs of recovery.</p> <p>Born in Glasgow, Denis was the son of Thomas, a lawyer, who died when he was just three years old, and his wife, Eleanor (nee Robinson). She brought Denis and his older brother, Robert, up in a strict Presbyterian household. On childhood holidays in County Donegal in Ireland, his uncle \u2013 a country parson and naturalist \u2013 ignited Denis\u2019s passion for birds.</p> <p>Educated at Glasgow Academy, Summers-Smith earned a scholarship to Glasgow University, where in 1937 he began studying metallurgy. In 1939, at the outbreak of the second world war, his university course came to an abrupt halt when he enlisted as an intelligence officer in the army.</p> <p>Commissioned in 1940, he rose to the rank of captain, serving with the ninth battalion of the Cameronians regiment on the east coast of England. Despite his duties, he managed to find occasional moments for birdwatching \u2013 notably when surveying likely spots for a German invasion on the Suffolk coast.</p> <p>In June 1944 he was involved in the second wave of the D-day landings in Normandy, for which, 75 years later in 2019, he was appointed Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur. While serving in France he was badly injured, spending 18 months in hospital; once discharged, he married his fiancee, Margaret (nee Mau) in 1947. </p> <p>Following the end of hostilities, Summers-Smith began work at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) as a mechanical engineer. Like many people whose education had been interrupted by the war, he resumed his studies, gaining degrees in engineering and, in 1953, a PhD in physics. He specialised in tribology: the study of friction, wear and lubrication.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60d10b2bd844f78dea21894f867da2d66e981b5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60d10b2bd844f78dea21894f867da2d66e981b5f/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"House sparrows on the Isles of Scilly, 2014.

With petrol rationing still in force he was unable to travel far, so the house sparrow\u2019s abundance and proximity to people was ideal. Having risen early to study the birds before he started work, he was twice reported to the police by neighbours, who wondered why a suspicious character was peering through binoculars into their gardens.</p> <p>After his son, Mike, was born in 1949, the family moved from Hampshire to County Durham; then, in 1961, to Guisborough in North Yorkshire, where he remained for the rest of his life. Two years later he published his first book, and during the next few decades he took advantage of the opportunities for global travel afforded by his job to study the entire sparrow family. His studies were published in several books: The Sparrows (1988), The Tree Sparrow (1995) and a memoir, In Search of Sparrows, published in 1992.</p> <p>His writings revealed a fascination not just with the behaviour of the house sparrow, but with its social and cultural history too. Biblical references were cited, there was a fascinating account of the \u201csparrow clubs\u201d of early 20th century Britain, which organised culls of a bird considered an agricultural pest, and, more recently, details of an incident in the Netherlands in which a rogue sparrow ruined a world record attempt at the \u201cdomino effect\u201d by inadvertently collapsing thousands of dominoes. His book On Sparrows and Man: A Love-Hate Relationship was published in 2006.</p> <p>He also penned numerous scientific papers, and served on the committees of organisations such as the British Ornithologists\u2019 Union and the British Trust for Ornithology. His honours included the Stamford Raffles award, given for distinguished contributions to zoology, which he received from the Zoological Society of London in 1992.</p> <p>In his public and private life he was, like the subject of his studies, a friendly, unassuming and humble man, always willing to share his knowledge with others.</p> <p>After Margaret\u2019s sudden death in 1972 he married another Margaret (nee Rebbeck), who died in 2004. He is survived by Mike.</p> <p>\u2022 James Denis Summers-Smith, ornithologist and mechanical engineer, born 25 October 1920; died 5 May 2020</p>",

Labour MP and her committee have produced what is <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/human-rights-committee/news-parliament-2017/covid-contact-tracing-app-draft-bill-19-21\">effectively a private member\u2019s bill</a> \u2013 a proposed law submitted by a backbencher \u2013 aimed at improving privacy standards and boosting public confidence in the novel system.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element

</figure> \n  <p>In a briefing on Wednesday, Harman said she had sent the digital contact tracing (data protection) bill to the health secretary, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Matt Hancock</strong>, and to <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, leader of the Commons.</p> \n  <p>Specific legislation, she urged, is required rather than the existing \u201cmishmash\u201d of standards involving the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), case law, the European convention on human rights and the Data Protection Act because the contact-tracing app is more ambitious than anything previously envisaged.</p> \n  <p>The JCHR bill would prevent data being used for other purposes, stop anybody not authorised gaining access to it, delete the data after the pandemic and establish a contact-tracing human rights commissioner.</p> \n  <p>Harman said she would personally download the app, which is already being piloted on the Isle of Wight, but her committee\u2019s view was that it should not go ahead without new privacy protections.</p> \n  <p>Those protections should apply whether or not the government continued with its existing centralised model or whether it eventually opted for the type of \u201cdecentralised\u201d app being used more widely on the continent.</p> \n  <p>Only Australia, she had acknowledged, has so far passed data protection legislation specifically applying to a contact-tracing app. \u201cI have asked Jacob Rees-Mogg to make time in parliament to bring [the bill] forward,\u201c Harman said. \u201cIf not they should allow parliament to say whether [should have a vote on it.]\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked whether safeguards should be relaxed during an emergency, Harman said it was a matter of balancing the right to life with privacy protections.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T15:06:06.395Z\">at 4.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec3f34b8f0886ce4f5d66d5\"

If we look at the UK as a whole, that is just under 55,000 excess deaths.</p> \n   <p>So the gap between Covid-related and excess is about 25% of excess deaths are not explained by Covid being on the death certificate. And that is now a key area of research for us to get underneath that, to understand that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Stripe said that within the next couple of weeks the ONS planned to publish more research looking at why the excess deaths figure was so high. But he said <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19englandandwales/deathsoccurringinapril2020\">a report published by the ONS on Friday</a>, on deaths in April, did shed some light on what was happening. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That showed that deaths from dementia and Alzheimer disease had gone up very, very significantly during April, as had deaths from something known as \u201cill-defined conditions\u201d. That is often where the certifying doctor puts things like frailty or old age on the death certificate. Usually in the very old, where there might not be a specific morbidity, but the patient has been unwell, you\u2019ll often get these ill-defined conditions. And they were up significantly as well in April.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Stripe said there could be two reasons for this increase. First \u201cnormal care pathways\u201d could be disrupted; ie, fewer patients were going to hospital, because the hospitals were concentrating on coronavirus. Second, coronavirus might be a factor in these deaths, without doctors being able to confirm that. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There may be some cases where Covid is present but it is not obvious to the certifying doctor that that is the case.</p> \n   <p>And it may be the case that this big jump in the number of dementia and Alzheimer deaths could explain part of that reason there. It could well be that in the very old, if the patient is not able to describe their symptoms very well, there may be many other co-morbidities, that perhaps the doctor has not felt able, in the absence of a positive test, to put Covid on the death certificate.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T09:24:35.231Z\">at 10.24am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec39a3c8f0864e579f1391f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T08:44:36.983Z\">9.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Excess deaths in England and Wales running at 3,081 in first week of May, ONS says</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Office for National Statistics</strong> has just published <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending8may2020\">the latest weekly death figures for England and Wales.</a> They cover the week up to Friday 8 May (or week 19, as the ONS calls it).</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Overall deaths in England and Wales in the week up to 8 May were down for the third week in a row, at 12,657. </strong>But they were still 3,081 above the five-year average for that week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Some 31.1% of the deaths in the week up to 8 May involved coronavirus being mentioned on the death certificate, down from 33.6% the previous week.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Overall deaths in care homes in the week up to 8 May were down, from 6,409 to 4,248.</strong> But the proportion involving coronavirus was up from 37.8% the previous week to 39.2%.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec399148f08a1782fa7d569\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T08:34:12.466Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Britain\u2019s farmers and carmakers will be protected under a new post-Brexit trade regime that will result in 60% of goods coming into the country tariff-free from the start of next year, the government has announced.

Health and care jobs generally require a high level of training, which means that workers who have been furloughed or made unemployed will struggle to fill these jobs. For those who remain employed, the collapse in job vacancies will severely limit their ability to move between jobs, which is an important channel for wage progression especially among younger workers.</p> \n   <p>The fact that there has been no recovery in vacancies in the most deprived local authorities is also worrying, especially because it will be risky to travel far for work on public transport.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec393018f0864e579f138e4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T08:11:42.842Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">There are 'substantial number' of job vacancies, says work and pensions secretary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The work and pensions secretary, <strong>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey</strong>, has been speaking to broadcasters this morning.

Patients or healthcare workers with symptoms are also tested.</p> \n<p>The team ran the model and examined what the situation would look like after 56 days, assuming a rising daily incidence in the community. The results reveal that over that time period 13% of admitted patients and 11% healthcare workers would have Covid-19, with 20% of cases among hospital inpatients and 89% of cases among healthcare workers down to hospital-acquired infections. The team adds that patients were the main driver of such infections, however healthcare workers also passed around the infection. However, the model has limitations including that it does not separate asymptomatic from pre-symptomatic cases.</p> \n<p>The team also looked at measures to reduce hospital-acquired infections, including testing healthcare workers on a regular basis. \u201cDaily testing was the most effective at reducing transmission with a reduction of 65% in [healthcare worker to healthcare worker transmission events], and 14% in [healthcare worker to] patient transmission events,\u201d the authors write.</p> \n<p>The team also looked at what would happen if suspected Covid-19 patients were allocated separate rooms or bays while awaiting test results, instead of being grouped together \u2013 a move the team assumed would cut transmission. The model suggests that if the approach cuts transmission by 50%, it could reduce hospital acquired infections by 40% over the 56 days, while a 100% cut in transmission would reduce such infections by 80%.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough in practice as the number of community cases increases or the criteria for those patients to be tested changes, it may not be possible to use single rooms or bays, adherence to best practice early in an epidemic can limit the development of further infections and their subsequent effects on community transmission,\u201d the team write. \u201cFurther, this result has important implications when considering the design of temporary facilities such as the newly developed Nightingale Hospitals.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-key-workers</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>A PHE spokesperson said: \u201cThe model findings suggest approximately 20% of patients with Covid-19 may have caught the virus in hospital. This equates to around 2% of all admitted patients acquiring a SARS-CoV-2 infection while in hospital.\u201d</p> \n<p>But they urged caution: \u201cThere remains a large degree of uncertainty around the estimates for many reasons and findings should be treated as preliminary.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health, University of Southampton, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201c[This] modelling paper suggests that most healthcare workers who have Covid-19 are infected by nosocomial transmission. This is unsurprising due to a few factors, including exposure within hospitals to patients with Covid-19, long hours spent working in healthcare settings and therefore also fewer hours spent in community settings.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the body count continues to rise and the government\u2019s failures become more and more obvious \u2013 just imagine how many more people might have died if Matt Hancock hadn\u2019t thrown his protective ring around care homes from the very start \u2013 you can sense ministers and scientists increasingly socially distancing themselves from any sense of responsibility.</p> <p>Head meet sand. What contact tracing app that was supposed to be the key to ending lockdown? Oh that one! We never meant to imply it was that important. Or that it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/phone-app-delay-raises-concerns-about-easing-lockdown-on-1-june\">necessarily be ready when we said it would</a>. Rather it was just an adjunct to some other measures that we haven\u2019t yet thought of. So we are in a game of musical chairs for the morally bankrupt. Which means that Michael Gove is in with a definite chance of winning.</p> <p>Gove is the ultimate shapeshifter. The politician who, more than any other, bends reality to suit his needs. Tonight, Matthew, he will be whoever he wants to be. All failures and shortcomings rewritten as outstanding successes. His two attempts to become party leader? Massive triumphs.</p> <p>Listening to the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster \u2013 there is no Brexit secretary any more \u2013 answer an urgent question on the third round of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/19/brexit-talks-eu-wants-us-to-obey-the-rules-of-their-club-says-gove\">Brexit talks</a> that had ended in deadlock you would have had no idea the UK was in the middle of the biggest public health crisis for a century. Or that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/what-will-coronavirus-mean-for-the-british-economy\">economy was contracting by the day </a>and that there were now 10 million people on the furlough scheme, many of whom could be out of a job within months.</p> <p>Rather it was as if the clock had been rewound six months to the Brexit culture wars of late 2019. There wasn\u2019t even a nod to the fact that it might be prudent to even consider the idea of extending transition by a short period, just to see what kind of state both the UK and the EU might be in come December. And whether we might cooperate with one another. Rather, we were fighting an ideological war in which everything Brussels did or said was bad and independence day couldn\u2019t come soon enough.</p> <p>How dare the EU insist on making the demands it had always said it would make and had been largely agreed in the political declaration of the withdrawal agreement? And how dare Brussels demand we keep a level playing field on standards, hygiene and workers\u2019 rights when ours were already far higher than the EU\u2019s? Apart from the ones we were were going to lower to get a free trade agreement with the US.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves did try to talk Mikey down. Though appealing to his reason is never the best tactic, as the Govester isn\u2019t strong on rationality. She rightly observed that seven months wasn\u2019t long to try to iron out all the remaining details \u2013 the cabinet can\u2019t even agree among itself whether customs and border checks will be needed between Great Britain and Northern Ireland \u2013 and that adding to the uncertainty in such uncertain times was potentially catastrophic.</p> <p>Gove had no answer other than to accuse Labour of having no clear plan and that he was sticking to his own regardless. Get Brexit Done. Which had been rather Reeves\u2019s point all along. That not having a clear Brexit plan and hedging your bets over the length of transition was the only sensible option under the circumstances.</p> <p>In the end the Speaker had to interrupt Mikey mid-rant but Gove continued in much the same vein for the rest of the half-hour session. Why were people so obsessed with the coronavirus? It was just an EU plot to thwart Brexit. The people had voted for Brexit and that was what they were going to get. Regardless of how many people had to die or lose their jobs in the process.</p> <p>As if to reinforce the idea that the government was fed up with everyone going on about the coronavirus \u2013 what was the big deal about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/almost-55000-excess-uk-deaths-during-covid-19-outbreak-says-ons\">50,000 deaths</a> and the disappearance from public view of Boris Johnson? \u2013 the environment minister, George Eustice, was sent out to take the Downing Street press conference. Because no one is more likely to make people reach for the off button than the most forgettable of cabinet ministers. More so even than Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, who at least has some unintended comedy value. Earlier in the day she had unwittingly told the BBC that there were plenty of unfilled jobs. I guess she had the Cabinet in mind.</p> <p>Eustice did the prime minister proud by giving a masterclass in banality. He had come with nothing to say and was determined to make sure he said it. So he raced through the same slides that have been shown at every other press conference, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/19/environment-secretary-george-eustice-calls-on-furloughed-brits-to-pick-fruit-video\">lamenting there were no foreigners to pick soft fruit</a> these days \u2013 who would have guessed? \u2013 and begging Brits on furlough to support the national effort. It still hasn\u2019t dawned on the government that EU workers were quite handy for doing the low-paid work Brits couldn\u2019t be bothered to do.</p> <p>Within minutes the minister had put almost his entire audience to sleep. That meant few heard him saying it had been a brilliant idea to stop testing and tracing in March because it made the current levels of testing look all the more impressive. And it had been absolutely right to fill care homes with residents who hadn\u2019t been tested because <em>zzzzzzzzz</em> take back control <em>zzzzzzz</em> making our own laws <em>zzzzzzzz</em> and they would have died sooner or later anyway <em>zzzzzzzz</em>. Come the end, I couldn\u2019t even be sure if Eustice was still awake. Another day had passed in which no one had taken responsibility for anything.</p>",

Her children were concerned about the encroaching pandemic, especially given her age. \u201cBut they need a nurse,\u201d she responded.

As her brother drove her to the hospital, her heart stopped. She was declared dead at the hospital.</p> <p>In tribute, hundreds turned out on Zoom to mark Nine-Night \u2013 a days-long wake traditional to the Caribbean \u2013 where loved ones shared photos, sang songs and recounted Marilyn\u2019s impact on their lives.</p> <p>The pandemic has since ripped through Marilyn\u2019s extended family, infecting at least a dozen relatives.

  "<p>Advisers advise, as the old saying goes, but politicians decide. What it doesn\u2019t add but should is that when those decisions go wrong, both sides are monumentally tempted to blame the other.</p> <p>And so it has proved with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a>. Ministers are increasingly openly attacking the scientific advice they were given, while experts both in and out of Sage are increasingly critical of the decisions subsequently made. Stand by for the fallout from the work and pensions secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey declaring, when pressed to admit that ministers have handled the outbreak in care homes badly, that if the scientific advice was wrong then it\u2019s unsurprising people think the resulting decisions were wrong. It\u2019s human nature to lash out when lined up, fairly or unfairly, as the fall guy, yet the sight of mutual recriminations breaking out is downright alarming for a general public still wondering whether it\u2019s safe to leave the house.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People worried about being turned into scapegoats have a dangerously strong incentive not to raise conflicting evidence or to rock the boat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So this week\u2019s intervention from the <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/91/uk-science-research-and-technology-capability-and-influence-in-global-disease-outbreaks/\">Commons science and technology committee</a>, which has spent weeks interrogating the key players by video link, is both timely and welcome in painting a more nuanced picture of what went wrong. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52716828\">Its letter to ministers</a> zeroes in on the decision back in March to stop testing for coronavirus in the community and focus on hospital patients, which it correctly describes as \u201cone of the most consequential made\u201d in the crisis. Without widespread testing, Britain not only lacked insights into how fast the virus was spreading, but also set itself up for further horrors down the line. The failure to test workers moving between care homes may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\">helped the virus spread rapidly</a> through some of the most vulnerable communities in the country. Without mass testing and tracking systems to detect signs of new outbreaks, it\u2019s hard to reopen schools or to lift the lockdown safely. So why, the committee wanted to know, didn\u2019t Britain follow other countries and throw everything at testing?</p> <p>So far, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has taken most of the flak for that failure. Yet the committee identifies Public Health England as the slipperiest customer here, pointing out that nearly two months after it promised to show MPs the evidence on which the decision to stop community testing was based, it still hasn\u2019t done so. Could it be, the MPs ask, that \u201cno rigorous assessment was in fact made\u201d of other countries\u2019 approaches to testing? Greg Clark, the mild-mannered former Tory minister who chairs the committee, has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-52719973/coronavirus-we-didn-t-get-ahead-of-testing-early-enough-greg-clark\">openly argued</a> that the decision was driven less by scientific considerations than by PHE\u2019s lack of in-house capacity to carry out anything like enough tests and reluctance to accept help from an untried network of outside labs. That fits with tales of university and commercial labs queueing up to offer help, only to be ignored until Hancock eventually stepped in. His much-mocked target of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal\">100,000 tests a day</a>, delivered by a mix of private and public providers, prompted some dubious gaming of the figures but also delivered a belated surge in testing capacity without which we\u2019d arguably be in even worse shape now. So why did all this seem to rely on what the committee calls a \u201cpersonal initiative\u201d by a rather lonely Hancock, in the teeth of hostile briefings from his own colleagues?</p> <p>\u201cJust follow the science\u201d has become a mantra for people who think that \u201cscience\u201d equals incontrovertible proof, free of ideological bias or grubby political considerations. But faced with a novel virus, creating dilemmas unprecedented in modern advanced democracies, sometimes science doesn\u2019t always offer a clear or correct conclusion. Political leaders following expert counsel will generally do better than ones who start experimentally<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\"> dosing themselves with malaria drugs</a> against medical advice, but sometimes even the best experts won\u2019t have enough facts to reach a definite verdict. Behind closed doors there will inevitably be narrow judgment calls, and the assumptions on which they are made won\u2019t always hold as more evidence emerges.</p> <p>In a crisis like this, the best decisions will be made by leaders flexible enough to change their minds when the facts change, rather than sticking grimly to a plan even as it\u2019s overtaken by events. But people worried about being turned into scapegoats have a dangerously strong incentive not to raise conflicting evidence or to rock the boat. Advisers can\u2019t advise freely if they think politicians are secretly gathering ammunition to use against them; ministers develop a bunker mentality when constantly watching their backs. It may be too late now to stop the public blame game. But both sides should remember it\u2019s a battle that ultimately nobody wins.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Just as we all finally get the hang of social distancing, Australia has started relaxing public and social restrictions born of Covid-19. To nobody\u2019s surprise more than mine, my pandemic experience so far has been fine. More than fine.</p> <p>As someone who has lived alone and worked from home for years, I expected that in some ways self-isolation would be easier for me than for others. However, as someone with major depression, the lack of human contact and a sharp decline in work also spelled potential disaster. But disaster never came. Or hasn\u2019t come (I shouldn\u2019t count my chickens).</p> <p> I mean, I\u2019m anxious about money, worried about the refugees I advocate for and terrified for all humankind, but that\u2019s all in a normal day for me. Compared with the utter trainwreck forecast by my mental health history, I\u2019m going well. Killing it, even.</p> <p>The question is: why?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Seeing my phone light up with an incoming FaceTime call no longer paralyses me with dread</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Part of the answer is that I\u2019ve continued seeing my sister and her family on limited, socially distanced occasions throughout lockdown. As boring and entitled as it sounds, daily yoga and exercise help too. But perhaps the biggest reason for my shockingly stable mood is increased contact with my friends, near and far.</p> <p>Before coronavirus (BC) I only saw a handful of friends with even semi-regularity. With jobs, kids, sea-changes and sheer laziness, phone calls are hard. One-on-one catch-ups harder, and group events near impossible. And though I\u2019m super close to my family, when I\u2019m not dating someone I can feel quite isolated. Even when I am dating someone. The virus has changed that. Even though I\u2019ve hardly seen a soul in-person for months, in a way I\u2019ve never felt less alone.</p> <p>Ever since this collective nightmare started, I\u2019ve barely gone a day without a video call or two. There\u2019s no way to say that without sounding like I\u2019m bragging about having friends \u2013 so just know, I know.</p> <p>In the past, self-consciousness has seen me decline all video calls, personal and professional. It\u2019s seen me decline a lot of things, actually \u2013 I barely let anyone take my photo. I\u2019d make excuses about my laptop camera being broken or the wifi being too unreliable, or I\u2019d just flat out say no. But, through self-administered immersion therapy, I faced my fears and it\u2019s opened up a whole new world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I felt a thousand times more helpful than I would have had we just texted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hanging out with mates without having to leave the house or wear pants is amazing. And it only took a global pandemic for me to realise this.</p> <p>Now seeing my phone light up with an incoming FaceTime call no longer paralyses me with dread. I\u2019m having regular Zooms with friends all over the world. I\u2019ve had cocktail parties, we\u2019ve done trivia and group yoga together and taken live dance classes. I\u2019ve advised on outfits, read bedtime stories and had Passover with my extended family.</p> <p>Embracing video-telephony has enabled me to be there for my friends in a more present and meaningful way. When a friend was having relationship problems, we had a video call. I felt a thousand times more helpful than I would have had we just texted, which is what we would have done before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/may/19/after-months-of-elasticated-waistbands-will-we-ever-give-up-comfortable-clothes\">After months of elasticated waistbands, will we ever give up comfortable clothes?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When another friend lost her job, an all-too-familiar tale right now, a group of us were able to cheer her up, at least briefly, by being silly on Zoom. It\u2019s a strange comfort to know that if I break \u2013 still a very real possibility \u2013 they\u2019ll watch me cry and do stupid dances in their underwear for me too.</p> <p>Of course, there\u2019s no substitute for spending time with your favourite people in the same place. And as the rules relax, I\u2019m excited to see my friends without the NBN causing their faces to freeze mid-sentence. I\u2019m excited about hugs. I\u2019m excited about patting dogs, playing with my godsons and sharing meals.</p> <p>If I could go back in time and reverse the decisions that got us into, worsened and prolonged this horrific mess, I would. Especially all the ones to do with cruise ships, the sick bays of the sea.</p> <p>But if I can pinpoint even the faintest of silver linings on this gigantic black dot, it\u2019s the lesson that I really do get by with a little help from my friends, and a lot of help from telecommunications technology.</p>",

And will Australia follow through on its threats to go to the trade umpire to challenge the decision?</p> <h2><strong>How important is China to Australia\u2019s barley industry?</strong></h2> <p>China is the largest export market for Australian barley, where it is used to make beer and feed livestock, so the tariffs are likely to bring significant pain to the industry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/19/chinese-embassy-says-australian-claims-of-vindication-on-coronavirus-investigation-are-a-joke\">Chinese embassy says Australian claims of 'vindication' on coronavirus investigation are 'a joke'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>China imported 2.5m tonnes of barley from Australia last financial year, which is down from a peak of 5.9m tonnes in 2016-17, but still very significant. Industry data show China made up more than half of Australian barley exports in 2018-19. The next biggest export market was Japan, with 746,000 tonnes, while other (much smaller) destinations were Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines.</p> <p>The Australian grain industry has warned the new tariffs will at the very least disrupt, but more likely completely halt, shipments of barley to China because the impost will drive the price up to prohibitive levels.</p> <p>\u201cIt is estimated this dispute could cost Australian grain industry and notably rural and regional economies at least $A500m per annum,\u201d a statement issued by Australian grain industry groups said.</p> <p>Pat O\u2019Shannassy, the chief executive of Grain Trade Australia, warned that the impact would be broad and \u201cthere will be additional reverberations through regional economies\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Why is China imposing tariffs on Australian barley?</strong></h2> <p>There has been a lot of speculation about the role of Australia\u2019s strong advocacy for an independent investigation into the origins and early handling of the coronavirus outbreak, a stance that has attracted strong pushback from China, which interpreted it as a political \u201cmanoeuvre\u201d against Beijing.</p> <p>But the official reasons for the tariffs are much more mundane, and stem from investigations China launched in late 2018.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s trading practices have \u201ccaused material injury\u201d to China\u2019s domestic barley industry, according to two determinations published by China\u2019s commerce ministry on Monday. The main issues cited are \u201cdumping\u201d \u2013 when a product is sold at a lower price overseas than it is in the country where it is produced \u2013 and government subsidies.</p> <h2><strong>Which companies are named?</strong></h2> <p>China\u2019s commerce ministry has specifically named four companies, including the Iluka Trust, a family farming business in the south coast of Western Australia whose crops include barley, canola and wheat. The named companies are Kalgan Nominees Pty Ltd, JW &amp; JI Mcdonald &amp; Sons, and Haycroft Enterprises.</p> <p>Industry sources have told Guardian Australia these are farming businesses that represent just a small subset of the country\u2019s barley growers. </p> <p>Even though those four farming businesses are named in the anti-dumping announcement, China\u2019s move also applies broadly to \u201call others\u201d \u2013 and is levied at the import stage of the process. Any companies importing barley from Australia will pay the same 73.6% duty from 19 May onwards. In addition, a tariff of 6.9% will be applied across the board based on claims the Australian industry gained an unfair advantage from government subsidies.</p> <h2><strong>How long will the exporters be affected?</strong></h2> <p>The new tariffs are to be imposed for a period of five years starting from 19 May 2020 \u2013 although there is a provision for affected parties to seek an interim review.</p> <h2><strong>How has the Australian government responded so far?</strong></h2> <p>The Australian government and the industry strongly reject the Chinese commerce ministry\u2019s recent findings on dumping and subsidies.</p> <p>The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said, for example, it was \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d for the Chinese government to consider measures such as Murray-Darling Basin infrastructure upgrades as a type of subsidy to barley exporters, when the bulk of the barley production was in Western Australia and South Australia and involved dry-land farming.</p> <h2><strong>But what are Australia\u2019s options?</strong></h2> <p>In the first instance, the Australian government will keep trying to lobby the Chinese government to cancel the tariffs. It plans to spend the next couple of days talking with the Australian farming sector and industry to work out the next steps.</p> <p>Birmingham said it was \u201cvery disappointing that China has, to date, refused to schedule minister-to-minister discussions\u201d as this would be the best way to resolve disagreements.</p> <p>But if there is no breakthrough, he has made clear that the government would \u201creserve our rights\u201d when it came to seeking to having the dispute resolved through the World Trade Organization.</p> <p>The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said the government was \u201cserious\u201d about the possibility of going to the WTO, noting it had previously taken Canada to the global trade umpire over wine and had taken India to the body over sugar.</p> <h2><strong>What are the downsides of a WTO referral?</strong></h2> <p>Taking action through the WTO is not a quick fix, because such disputes can drag on for years and the top appellate body\u2019s functioning has been under strain as the US has blocked appointments.</p> <p>The freeze had led Australia to work with China and the European Union in recent months to set up a temporary mechanism to rule on disputes, replicating the WTO\u2019s top umpire\u2019s functions.</p> <p>China has been the third most active member in the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system, having been involved in 65 disputes between 2002 and 2019. In two-thirds of those disputes, China was the respondent, according to <a href=\"https://chinapower.csis.org/china-world-trade-organization-wto/\">analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)</a>.</p> <p>China had a high-profile victory late last year when an WTO arbitrator ruled China could impose tariffs on up to $3.6bn of American goods over a US failure to abide by anti-dumping rules.</p> <p>But according to the CSIS ChinaPower Project, Beijing has a \u201cmixed record of compliance with WTO dispute rulings\u201d because in some cases it has found creative ways to demonstrate legal compliance \u201cwhile sidestepping the spirit of certain decisions\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>What other factors could be behind the move?</strong></h2> <p>The move comes amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/15/australia-china-ties-at-risk-of-slipping-into-permanent-hostility-former-senior-diplomat-warns\">broader tensions</a> over Covid-19, but the Australian government says it takes at face value the Chinese government\u2019s claims that there is no link.</p> <p>There is, however, increasing attention on China\u2019s announcement last week that it would immediately allow barley imports from the US, which was seen as a measure to meet commitments in the first phase of Beijing\u2019s trade deal with Donald Trump.</p> <p>In January, China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/17/australia-welcomes-us-china-trade-deal-despite-possible-costs\">pledged to buy an extra $US200bn of American farm products</a> and other goods and services over two years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/17/australian-trade-minister-says-risk-of-trade-with-china-may-drive-businesses-to-other-markets\">Australian trade minister says 'risk' of trade with China may drive businesses to other markets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, called on the government to seek clarity from the US about the arrangements \u201cand whether that has disadvantaged Australia\u201d.</p> <p>The move last week was framed by Chinese state media as a potential problem between Australia and the US, with the Global Times asking: \u201cIf US agricultural products take over Australia\u2019s share in the Chinese market, then who is the antagonist of Australian businesses, China or the US?\u201d</p> <p>However, the US produced just a third as much barley as Australia did in 2018, according to data compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. And China\u2019s own domestic barley output is small: 1.5m tonnes a year, compared with 9.3m tonnes in Australia in 2018.</p> <p>China imported a total of 8.9m tonnes of barley in 2017 \u2013 indicating it heavily relies on barley sourced from overseas rather than its small domestic market.</p>",

It is unclear whether they would be subjected to a Covid-19 blood test or be asked to adhere to other health protocols.</p> \n<p>Greek outlets reported that travellers would be obliged to maintain distancing rules at airports and to wear masks during flights. The news came as Ryanair announced that it would be resuming flights to destinations in Greece, including Corfu.</p> \n<p>In a country where tourism accounts for 25% of GDP, the government is hoping to capitalise on its successful handling of the pandemic to attract what Mitsotakis has called \u201ca larger piece of Europe\u2019s smaller tourism pie\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven the importance of tourism and the catering sector for the country\u2019s economy, particularly during the second half of the year, our plan will have a three-pronged strategy covering employment, taxation and liquidity,\u201d the government spokesman Stelios Petsas said. \u201cThis summer will not be like last year.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc3953b3d57e9e7e3a09e5fdfc8f63d4c912e366\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc3953b3d57e9e7e3a09e5fdfc8f63d4c912e366/0_0_5000_3345/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People play basketball in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People play basketball in Paris.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On Monday, Greece reopened 200 archaeological sites including the Acropolis in Athens.

  "<p>Business has warned Boris Johnson that he must clinch a free trade deal with the EU after the government released details of the tariffs Britain will impose from the start of next year.</p> <p>With talks between London and Brussels stalled, employers organisations said they welcomed arrangements that will provide protection for farmers and carmakers but stressed the need for progress in talks with the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner.</p> <p>Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said said: \u201cWhile the new tariff regime will provide the government with some leverage in future trade talks, it also demonstrates the importance of reaching a UK-EU agreement to avoid substantial increases in costs for businesses on both sides of the Channel.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for International Trade said the UK\u2019s new regime would result in 60% of goods coming into the country tariff-free and would result in a similar, bespoke system.</p> <p>Michael Gove, the cabinet minister responsible for the free trade talks with the EU, told MPs that a deal was possible but only if Brussels dropped its ideological approach to the talks. In a clear sign that there will be no extension to the transition period designed to smooth the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, the government said the global tariff would be introduced on 1 January.</p> <p>Under the new regime, the tariffs on more than 6,000 products will be streamlined or simplified, with the aim of cutting costs for businesses and consumers.</p> <p>The government said it was maintaining tariffs on agriculture \u2013 including beef, lamb and poultry farmers \u2013 and would maintain a 10% tariff on cars to protect domestic producers from overseas competitors. The UK automotive industry warned last year that operating on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/26/no-deal-brexit-would-cost-uk-car-industry-40bn-by-2024\">cost it \u00a340bn by 2024.</a></p> <p>Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement compounds the critical need for the UK to secure free trade agreements, starting with our biggest trading partner, the EU, but also with other key global markets, including the US, Japan and Turkey. The majority of components that help build British vehicles come from overseas, while nine out of every 10 cars bought in the UK are imported \u2013 seven of which being from the EU.\u201d</p> <p>The international trade secretary, Liz Truss, said: \u201cFor the first time in 50 years we are able to set our own tariff regime that is tailored to the UK economy.</p> <p>\u201cOur new global tariff will benefit UK consumers and households by cutting red tape and reducing the cost of thousands of everyday products.</p> <p>The DIT said the system would ensures that 60% of trade would come into the UK tariff free on WTO terms or through existing preferential access schemes with developing countries from January 2021.</p> <p>The DIT said the new regime would get rid of some of the complexities of the EU system, would involve rounding down tariffs and would get rid of all tariffs under 2%.</p> <p>It provided a list of goods that consumers would see come down in price as a result of zero tariffs, ranging from dishwashers to ground thyme.</p> <p>Stephen Phipson CEO of Make UK, the manufacturer\u2019s organisation said: \u201cToday\u2019s tariff announcement goes some way to providing clarity for business on what a post-Brexit trading environment will look like. At the top level, the announcement does represent a better balance between consumer and producer interests than earlier proposals \u2013to increase the percentage of tariff free products from 47% to 60% (rather than 87% previously).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tariffs will be cut on more than 100 products in an attempt to encourage the development of a more sustainable economy.

  "<p>My father, Tim Baynes, who has died aged 91 from Covid-19, was a retired vicar, furniture-maker, artist and campaigner for social justice.</p> <p>Born in Oxford, the eldest of three children of Colin and Mary (nee Phelps), he had a solitary childhood, and was sent to a residential nursery at nine months while his parents worked in Nigeria, his father being in the colonial education service. After their return to Britain, Colin became headteacher of New College school, Oxford, where Mary helped him with his work. Tim boarded at prep school from the age of seven and then went to Marlborough college, Wiltshire.</p> <p>After national service, he studied art and furniture design, and his first job was at the Newcastle College of Art and Design. Tim remembered these days as exciting but was troubled to find that some people thought him \u201ccold\u201d \u2013 his early life experiences showing through. A friend encouraged him to talk to a priest, and that experience of \u201cconfession and blessing\u201d changed his life, leading him to leave furniture-making and go to Ely Theological College, Cambridgeshire.</p> <p>His spells as a curate in the 1960s, in Bishop\u2019s Stortford, Hertfordshire and Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, gave him the view that the church needed to understand better the lives of working people, and following a visit to a working men\u2019s club in Manchester and a trip down a coal mine, he changed course and became an industrial chaplain. He moved to Manchester in 1967 to join the <a href=\"http://www.gmim.org.uk/\">Greater Manchester Industrial Mission</a> team, allocated to the city\u2019s transport sector; until 1972 he also held parish responsibilities as the vicar of the inner-city church of St John\u2019s, Miles Platting.</p> <p>For the rest of his life, Tim worked to bring about better support for workers, including bringing together unions, management and staff in the transport industry to improve conditions, and campaigning for a minimum wage in the 1980s, long before anyone believed it could work.</p> <p>On retiring to Kendal in 1994, he continued to campaign for equality and social justice. He will be missed by Global Justice Now, the World Development Movement, Forward in Europe, Kendal Ecumenical Group, South Lakes Extinction Rebellion, Kendal Quaker Meeting and many more.</p> <p>He also carried on working with his hands. My dining-room is full of the evidence of his wonderful furniture-making skills, including a cabinet for glasses, a music stand and some napkin rings, each carved in the shape of a Lakeland fell.</p> <p>Thoughtful, compassionate, wise, curious: these are words that came up time and again from those who knew my father. My brother Nick and I will also treasure our memories of him as a loving father and grandfather who overcame the major separations in his early life, reading Winnie the Pooh to us at bed time.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Monica (nee Johnson), a pyschiatric social worker whom he met on a skiing holiday and married in 1967, by Nick and me, and his grandchildren, Seb, Joss and Lucia.</p>",

With the virus attacking the respiratory systems of those infected, just 8,000 machines existed in hospitals throughout the UK. Bracing itself for the worst healthcare crisis in its history, the NHS estimated that 30,000 ventilators would be needed to cope with the rising number of intensive care patients.</p> <p>More than 20 companies \u2013 including Ford, Rolls-Royce, McLaren and Siemens UK \u2013 formed the Ventilator Challenge UK Consortium, set up with the aim of producing medical equipment by using existing technological designs from Smiths Medical and Penlon, with materials and parts in current use in their industries.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a massive challenge,\u201d says Spicer. \u201cWe\u2019d never done anything like it before.

We now know that <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-didn-t-boris-act-sooner-against-coronavirus-\">government ministers were told on 11 February</a> that the virus could be catastrophic, and decisive action was urgently required. Instead, Boris Johnson told us to wash our hands and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/revealed-the-inside-story-of-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-crisis\">\u201cgo about our normal daily lives\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Had the government acted in February, we can hazard a guess about what the result would have been, as the world has conducted a clear controlled experiment: weighing South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand against the UK, the US and Brazil. South Korea did everything the UK government could have done, but refused to implement. Its death toll so far: <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/\">263</a>. It still has an occasional cluster of infection, which it promptly contains. By contrast, the entire UK is now a cluster of infection.</p> <p>While other countries either closed their borders or quarantined all arrivals, in the three months between the emergence of the virus and the UK\u2019s lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/just-273-people-arriving-in-uk-in-run-up-to-lockdown-quarantined\">18 million people</a> arrived on these shores, of whom only 273 were quarantined. Even after the lockdown was announced, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/95000-have-entered-uk-from-abroad-during-coronavirus-lockdown\">95,000 people entered the UK</a> without additional restrictions. In fact, on 13 March, the UK stood down even its own guidance, which had gently requested travellers from Italy and China to self-isolate. This decision, taken as other nations were stepping up their controls, seems baffling.</p> <p>Similarly, on 12 March, Johnson abandoned both containment and nationwide testing and tracking. A week later, the status of the pandemic <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1932\">was lowered</a>, which meant that the government could reduce the standard of personal protective equipment required in hospitals, and could shift infectious patients into non-specialist care. Again, there was no medical or scientific justification for this decision.</p> <p>Exercise Cygnus, a pandemic simulation conducted in 2016, found that the impacts in care homes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\">would be catastrophic</a> unless new measures were put in place. The government insists that it heeded the findings of this exercise and changed its approach accordingly. If this is correct, by allowing untested patients to be shifted from hospitals to care homes, while failing to provide the extra support and equipment the homes needed and allowing agency workers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\">move freely within and between them</a>, it knowingly breached its own protocols. Tens of thousands of highly vulnerable people were exposed to infection.</p> <p>In other words, none of these are failures of knowledge or capacity. They are de-preparations, conscious decisions not to act. They start to become explicable only when we recognise what they have in common: a refusal to frontload the costs. This refusal is common in countries whose governments fetishise what we call \u201cthe market\u201d: the euphemism we use for the power of money.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s government, like that of Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, represents a particular kind of economic interest. For years politicians of their stripe have been in conflict with people who perform useful services: nurses, teachers, care workers and the other low-paid people who keep our lives ticking, whose attempts to organise and secure better pay and conditions are demonised by ministers and <a href=\"https://www.thepaperboy.com/uk/daily-mail/front-pages-today.cfm?frontpage=60060\">in the media</a>.</p> <p>This political conflict is always fought on behalf of the same group: those who extract wealth. The war against utility is necessary if you want to privatise public services, granting lucrative monopolies or fire sales of public assets to friends in the private sector. It\u2019s necessary if you want to hold down public sector pay and the minimum wage, cutting taxes and bills for the same funders and lobbyists. It is necessary if corporations are to be allowed to outsource and offshore their workforces, and wealthy people can <a href=\"https://longreads.tni.org/state-of-power-2019/offshore-finance/\">offshore their income and assets</a>.</p> <p>The interests of wealth extractors are, by definition, short term. They divert money that might otherwise have been used for investment into dividends and share buybacks. They dump costs that corporations should legitimately bear on to society in general, in the form of pollution (the car and road lobbies) or public health disasters (soft drinks and junk food producers). They siphon money out of an enterprise or a nation as quickly as possible, before the tax authorities, regulators or legislators catch up.</p> <p>Years of experience have shown that it is much cheaper to make political donations, employ lobbyists and invest in public relations than to change lucrative but harmful commercial policies. Working through the billionaire press and political systems that are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/25/democracy-broken-distrusted-trump-brexit-political-system\">highly vulnerable to capture by money</a>, in the UK, US and Brazil they have helped ensure that cavalier and reckless people are elected. Their chosen representatives have an almost instinctive aversion to investment, to carrying a cost today that could be deferred, delayed or dumped on someone else.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that any of these interests \u2013 whether the Daily Mail or the US oil companies \u2013 want coronavirus to spread. It\u2019s that the approach that has proved so disastrous in addressing the pandemic has been highly effective, from the lobbyists\u2019 point of view, when applied to other issues: delaying and frustrating action to prevent climate breakdown; pollution; the obesity crisis; inequality; unaffordable rent; and the many other plagues spread by corporate and billionaire power.</p> <p>Thanks in large part to their influence, we have governments that fail to protect the public interest, by design. This is the tunnel. This is why the exits are closed. This is why we will struggle to emerge.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>\u2022 The main image was changed on 20 May 2020 to better reflect the text of the article.</p>",
  "<p>The Premier League has been buoyed in its attempts to complete the season, after only six of 748 players and staff tested positive for Covid-19.

All the individuals will be expected to isolate for seven days. The 20th club completed testing on Tuesday and their figures will be included in the results from a second round of testing, due to be published on Saturday.</p> <p>The Bundesliga, which restarted last Saturday, announced 10 positive tests in early May from 1,724 tests on players and staff at clubs in the top two tiers, equating to 0.58% of tests being positive to the Premier League\u2019s 0.8%. On 10 May, La Liga said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/10/five-positive-coronavirus-tests-confirmed-among-la-liga-players\">five players in Spain\u2019s top two divisions</a> had tested positive, without naming how many had been tested.</p> <p>Focus now turns back to the process of creating medical protocols, with the next task a plan for the safe introduction of contact training. This is likely to prove the most controversial part of Project Restart, with Watford\u2019s Troy Deeney \u2013 who has said he will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/19/pfa-asks-premier-league-to-research-covid-19s-impact-on-bame-players\">refuse</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/19/pfa-asks-premier-league-to-research-covid-19s-impact-on-bame-players\"> to return to training</a> over safety concerns \u2013 having articulated the fears of many players over risks to their health and that of their families.</p> <p>The left-back Danny Rose, on loan at Newcastle from Tottenham, has aired similar concerns to Deeney. Newcastle went back to training on Tuesday but Rose was wary to return. \u201cPeople are suggesting we should go back to football, like we\u2019re guinea pigs or lab rats,\u201d he told the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTZb-5qiiaE\">Lockdown Tactics podcast</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve going to experiment this phase and see if it works or not.</p> <p>\u201cI can just imagine people at home saying: \u2018Well, they earn that amount of money, so they should be going back.\u2019 For stuff like that, I think: \u2018Is it worth the hassle?\u2019 I could be potentially risking my health for people\u2019s entertainment and that\u2019s not something I want to be involved in if I\u2019m honest.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday Chelsea\u2019s Callum Hudson-Odoi trained after he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/18/chelsea-callum-hudson-odoi-arrested-after-police-called-to-his-home-reports\">reportedly arrested</a> in the early hours of Sunday.</p> <p>The Premier League hopes to complete a return to contact training in short order. It is to meet representatives from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and public health officials this week to discuss the protocols needed to enable \u201cstage two\u201d of a return for elite sport, rules that will incorporate physical contact.</p> <p>Once government approves a rubric for guidelines, the league will consult with players, managers and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association before finalising bespoke rules. The league hopes to finish the protocol by the time the 20 shareholder clubs meet next Tuesday, when it would be put to a vote.</p> <p>The timeline will not get any less frantic should that vote pass, with further considerations needed on how to make matches safe behind closed doors, issues that include resolving discussions with police about the use of home venues. There is an acceptance in the league and within government that the end of June is looking more likely for a possible return, with Friday 26 a possible new date.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the process of discussion and debate continues, players and staff \u2013 up to 40 a time from each club \u2013 will be tested twice a week.

  "<p>Carbon dioxide emissions have fallen dramatically since lockdowns were imposed around the world due to the coronavirus crisis, research has shown.</p> <p>Daily emissions of the greenhouse gas plunged 17% by early April compared with 2019 levels, according to the first definitive study of global carbon output this year.</p> <p>The findings show the world has experienced the sharpest drop in carbon output since records began, with large sections of the global economy brought to a near standstill. When the lockdown was at its most stringent, in some countries emissions fell by just over a quarter (26%) on average. In the UK, the decline was about 31%, while in Australia emissions fell 28.3% for a period during April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/co2_emissions-zip/giv-3902wA2AhQW0LpCR\" data-alt=\"emissions drop graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/co2_emissions-zip/giv-3902wA2AhQW0LpCR\">emissions drop graphic</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is a really big fall, but at the same time, 83% of global emissions are left, which shows how difficult it is to reduce emissions with changes in behaviour,\u201d said Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, a professor of climate change at the University of East Anglia, and lead author of the study <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0797-x\">published </a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0797-x\">in the </a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0797-x\">journal Nature Climate Change</a>. \u201cAnd it is not desirable \u2013 this is not the way to tackle climate change.\u201d</p> <p>The unprecedented fall is likely to be only temporary. As countries slowly get back to normal activity, over the course of the year the annual decline is likely to be only about 7%, if some restrictions to halt the virus remain in place. However, if they are lifted in mid-June the fall for the year is likely to be only 4%.</p> <p>That would still represent the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/12/global-carbon-emisions-could-fall-by-record-25bn-tonnes-in-2020\">biggest annual drop in emissions</a> since the second world war, and a stark difference compared with recent trends, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/paris-climate-deal-world-not-on-track-to-meet-goal-amid-continuous-emissions\">emissions have been rising</a> by about 1% annually. But it would make \u201ca negligible impact on the Paris agreement\u201d goals, Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said.</p> <p>Emissions must fall to net zero by mid-century or soon after to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and keep global heating from reaching catastrophic levels, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The fall in carbon resulting from the Covid-19 crisis reveals how far the world still has to go, said Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The experience of the crisis so far has shown that changes in behaviour by individuals \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/03/how-is-the-coronavirus-affecting-global-air-traffic\">not flying</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/18/from-boardroom-to-spare-room-the-working-from-home-revolution-coronavirus\">working from home</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/uk-road-travel-falls-to-1955-levels-as-covid-19-lockdown-takes-hold-coronavirus-traffic\">driving less</a> \u2013 can only go part of the way needed to cut emissions, as even the lockdown measures left the bulk of emission sources intact, she said, adding that bigger shifts are needed to the way people produce and use energy.</p> <p>\u201cJust behavioural change is not enough,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need structural changes [to the economy and industry]. But if we take this opportunity to put structural changes in place, we have now seen what it is possible to achieve.\u201d</p> <p>Emissions from aviation showed a dramatic decline, of about 60%, as international flights between many countries were grounded. Emissions from surface transport fell less sharply, by about 36%. Power generation and industry accounted for about 86% of the total decline in emissions.</p> <p>Despite such an unprecedented fall, the impacts on the climate are likely to be small. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/04/latest-data-shows-steep-rises-in-co2-for-seventh-year\">Stocks of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere</a>, which reached 414.8 parts per million last year, will rise further towards the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/11/atmospheric-carbon-levels-are-leaping-we-cant-afford-many-more-years-like-this\">danger threshold of 450ppm</a> this year, though perhaps at a slightly slower pace.</p> <p>\u201cCarbon dioxide stays in the air a long time, so although emissions are smaller, they are still happening and so carbon dioxide is still building up, just a little more slowly,\u201d said Richard Betts, the head of climate impacts research at the Met Office Hadley Centre, who was not involved in the paper. \u201cIf we want to halt the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we need to stop putting it there altogether. It\u2019s like we\u2019re filling a bath and have turned down the tap slightly, but not turned it off.\u201d</p> <p>The lockdowns have caused steep falls in energy demand, but energy production has hardly been changed by the crisis, noted Mark Maslin, a professor of climatology at University College London, who was also not involved in the paper. </p> <p>\u201cThe real lesson of this pandemic is that we must globally shift our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">energy production away from fossil fuels</a> as quickly as possible if we are to ensure sustained year-on-year cuts to our global emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good news is that both of these will help to maintain the clean air and clear skies we have all rediscovered during lockdown, saving many lives.\u201d</p> <p>The comprehensive analysis was conducted by scientists from the University of East Anglia, Stanford University in the US, the Cicero Centre in Norway, as well as scientists in the Netherlands, Australia, France and Germany.</p> <p>The researchers used measurements of economic activity, energy generation, industrial production, transport and other proxies to estimate carbon dioxide output. They concentrated their analysis on six areas: power generation, surface transport, industry, public buildings and commerce, residential sources, and aviation. Estimates were taken from 69 countries, 50 US states and 30 Chinese provinces, representing 97% of global carbon emissions.</p> <p>Although the rising concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere are regularly measured, they are subject to large natural fluctuations so are unsuitable to the kind of snapshot analysis required to observe what is happening to global carbon output over a relatively short period.</p>",
  "<p>The sudden sharp fall in greenhouse gas emissions recorded in the early part of this year may seem like an environmental blessing, a breathing space as the world fights climate breakdown.

The causes of the steep fall, the economic convulsions and the possibility of lasting economic damage also mean urgent work must be done to repair the economy.</p> <p>\u201cThis decline in emissions, the biggest in history, is the result of economic trauma,\u201d said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/12/global-carbon-emisions-could-fall-by-record-25bn-tonnes-in-2020\">own analysis</a> backs up the Nature paper in showing this is the biggest drop in carbon in history. \u201cIt is nothing to celebrate. It is not the result of policy. This decline will be easily erased if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/covid-19-crisis-demand-fossil-fuels-iea-renewable-electricity\">right policy measures</a> are not put in place.\u201d</p> <p>Dave Reay, a professor of carbon management at Edinburgh University, called the paper \u201csobering stuff\u201d as it revealed the massive changes made to cope with the pandemic would have only a minor effect on emissions, and the climate. \u201cAll those billions of lockdown sacrifices and privations have made just a small and likely transient dent in global greenhouse gas emissions. Covid-19 is no help on climate change \u2013 it is a devastating scourge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone of this is good news for anyone,\u201d added Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer in climate change at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. \u201cIt is the symptom of a massive economic disruption caused by the pandemic and the measures to contain it. For the climate, this month-long wake in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/paris-climate-deal-world-not-on-track-to-meet-goal-amid-continuous-emissions\">otherwise record-high emissions</a> is entirely insignificant.\u201d</p> <p>What is to come might be worse still, he warned, if governments around the world seek to kickstart the global economy out of its pandemic recession by pouring public money into projects that prop up existing industries and increase our dependence on fossil fuels. For instance, sectors including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/is-covid-19-crisis-the-catalyst-for-the-greening-of-worlds-airlines\">aviation</a>, car manufacturing and fossil fuel production have been hard hit by the lockdowns, and many companies are hoping for bailouts using public money.</p> <p>\u201cMassive economic stimulus measures are now being announced and there is a high risk that short-sightedness will lead governments to lose track of the bigger picture by putting their money towards highly polluting sectors that have no place in a zero-pollution and zero-carbon society,\u201d said Rogelj.</p> <p>Campaigners said the world must make the right choices on how to rebuild after the pandemic. They have called, along with leading economists, for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">green recovery</a> that would concentrate any stimulus cash on projects that cut greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution, as well as generating jobs and increasing prosperity.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we move forward from this terrible situation, we have to make sure we hold on to the gains we\u2019ve made in better air quality, lower carbon emissions and simple things like hearing birdsong,\u201d said Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth. \u201cCouncils should start by permanently changing how road space is used, allocating more to encourage walking and cycling, and making public transport work for everyone. Now is the time to scrap plans to expand airports and introduce a levy on the most frequent flyers.\u201d</p> <p>Governments facing such choices have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/green-stimulus-can-repair-global-economy-and-climate-study-says?fbclid=IwAR3ALbARCbncWbEbdBLaxUK_m2YSQLic6a2KyCzpGjn77w0ROgcuPxm5QqU\">clear blueprint</a> on how to ensure the recovery is green and sustainable, said Paul Morozzo, a senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK. \u201cWe know how to do it.

  "<p>When the UK fully emerges from the coronavirus lockdown and shoppers are allowed out again for non-essential purchases, their local high street could be a very different place from the one they left in March. Since the pandemic gripped the nation, a string of big-name retailers have fallen into administration or announced store closures, and some of the shutters that were pulled down may not be lifted again.</p> <p>The failures of Laura Ashley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/oasis-and-warehouse-to-permanently-close-shops-with-loss-of-1800-jobs\">Warehouse, Oasis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/cath-kidston-to-close-all-60-uk-stores-with-loss-of-900-jobs\">Cath Kidston</a> did not go unnoticed, but the news stories were, of course, a footnote to other, more tragic, events. And, so far, to those who don\u2019t work for them, their loss has been invisible. But the job cuts at those retailers and other struggling brands, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/17/at-least-seven-debenhams-stores-close-loss-400-jobs\">Debenhams</a>, will be felt by thousands of families. And in the short term many high streets will be even more scarred than they were before lockdown.</p> <p>When I ask Mary Portas if it is the worst crisis ever to hit the high street, she points out that it goes far beyond that. She is on a video call from her home in Gloucestershire where, like many people, she is juggling work \u2013 for the consultancy that she founded \u2013 and home-schooling her young son. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst crisis to hit anybody in any kind of industry that relies on people having disposable income and actually being outside their homes,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Portas is keen to talk about what she calls \u201cthe kindness economy\u201d, a concept she has been considering for a while, but which she says is now going mainstream because of the coronavirus crisis. It\u2019s the subject of a newsletter she has launched, called the Reset, where she describes \u201ca new era of shopping and living\u201d, and she speaks passionately about it. But as someone who spent a year at the start of the last decade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/13/portas-high-streets-disapper\">looking at the problems of the high street</a>, and how to address them, she must be thinking about the state it is in now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b741de9952472f392015545119d2da5e95c7eccd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b741de9952472f392015545119d2da5e95c7eccd/0_156_4747_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A locked-down high street in Slough.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A locked-down high street in Slough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maureen McLean/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She says that what consumers are looking for has changed. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve gone through \u2013 certainly in the fashion industry \u2013 over the past 20 years is: \u2018How fast and how cheaply can we get this into the market?\u2019 And it was all about how quickly things were turned around. So you had businesses that were just fast fashion \u2013 it was about operations, it was about physics of the business,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>\u201cSome of those are crumbling, and we will see those falling. The same with some of the stores that were about more stuff, just stuff, stuff, stuff \u2013 your House of Frasers, your Debenhams, your Macy\u2019s in the US. It was just floor after floor of stuff, and that game is over.\u201d</p> <p>Since 2011, when Portas was tasked by the coalition government with fixing the problems of the high street, its decline has continued, and some of the problems will be exacerbated by the crisis. She notes councils will be strapped for cash, so things such as parking charges, which have perhaps deterred shoppers, are unlikely to be scrapped any time soon.</p> <p>The recession that followed the banking crisis led to the rise of Lidl and Aldi, while Poundland and Primark also prospered. She says that, this time around, that kind of retailer will be important again. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a real polarisation from those who have and those who have not,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a real deep discounting happening at one end, where people are having to buy from those institutions. At the other end, there is going to be a growth in people buying and wanting brands that reflect their values.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many local firms have woken up to: \u2018Actually I can do deliveries. I can get a digital presence'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For those who can afford to shop around, the companies that have proved heroes could find that the goodwill towards their brand lasts. \u201cWe keep a list in our agency of \u2018retail v corona\u2019 \u2013 who\u2019s doing well and who\u2019s not,\u201d she says. She doesn\u2019t divulge who has made it on to the list, but on social media it is clear that some companies have tarnished their reputations in the way they have reacted to the crisis, usually in their treatment of staff, while others have impressed people. In the early days, JD Wetherspoon and Waterstones both found their names preceded by #boycott on Twitter, after staff raised concerns about having to work. In contrast, the repair shop Timpson has won praise for its approach \u2013 topping up pay for furloughed staff so their income is not reduced.</p> <p>The idea that shoppers may be alert to how businesses treat them, their workers and the planet plays into something Portas was already talking about before all of this began. In<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/mary_portas_welcome_to_the_kindness_economy\"> a recent TEDx talk, </a>she outlined her vision of a \u201ckindness economy\u201d where businesses thrive because they respect people and the environment.</p> <p>Today, she points to discounts for care workers and NHS staff as examples of this. \u201cYou look at the Met Ball and think: \u2018All of that stuff has been given to you free,\u2019\u201d she says, almost in horror, adding that maybe, instead, \u201cbusinesses, like the supermarkets, those everyday businesses, will say: \u2018Actually, no. We\u2019re going to do acts of kindness and decency with integrity, and give those discounts not to the people who have all the money, but to those who don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When she put together the high street report in 2011, \u201cthey would say to me: \u2018Have you spoken to Sir Philip Green? Have you spoken to Sir Terry Leahy?\u2019\u201d And it was those at the top who had all of the power. Now, she says, we are what she calls more \u201csentient\u201d consumers, and businesses need to reflect our concerns to attract our money.</p> <p>She references Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, who recently suggested the shift in values that would be sparked by the crisis. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2020/04/16/mark-carney-on-how-the-economy-must-yield-to-human-values\">Writing in the Economist</a>, he said: \u201cFundamentally, the traditional drivers of value have been shaken, new ones will gain prominence, and there\u2019s a possibility that the gulf between what markets value and what people value will close.\u201d With this in mind, Portas says: \u201cEvery \u00a31 is a vote, a vote for how we want to live.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8491eb3628a1e946d948495f4784db8bcffe39d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8491eb3628a1e946d948495f4784db8bcffe39d2/0_177_5317_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Laura Ashley shop after it went into administration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Laura Ashley shop after it went into administration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although, during the lockdown, some spending has moved online, Portas says there is a \u201cpower\u201d to bricks-and-mortar shops: \u201cIf [people] do come into your store, they\u2019re two-and-a-half times more likely to buy.\u201d But some retailers are not delivering places that people want to go to.</p> <p>One thing she talked about in 2011 was support for small, local businesses. And it seems that the crisis has seen us turn to them in droves \u2013 according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/uk-retailers-warn-of-shop-closures-and-job-losses-amid-lockdown\">Barclaycard, spending at local off-licences, greengrocers and convenience stores rose</a> by almost 40% in April. While this may have been fuelled by the difficulty of getting a supermarket delivery slot without setting your alarm clock for 4am, it may also have changed our shopping habits. A separate survey by the card provider found that many were planning to increase their spending at local butchers, cafes and farmers\u2019 markets in the future.</p> <p>Portas says the crisis has changed the mindset of some of these businesses and talks enthusiastically about examples she has seen in her local community. \u201cMany of them have woken up to: \u2018Actually I can do deliveries. I can get a digital presence,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI was talking to [a bookshop owner] the other day, and they said: \u2018I\u2019d never had a website before and I\u2019ve set it up, and I\u2019ve already taken 25% of what I took last year. And I\u2019m able to deliver the next day in the way that Amazon can.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She sees these shops as key to innovation on the high street. \u201cI\u2019m calling them the local disruptors,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are the ones who have learned from this, and they won\u2019t go back.\u201d She describes the owner of an independent restaurant she knows is struggling because there is still rent to pay despite being closed, but has had a fantastic idea to help it survive. For \u00a350 a year, customers can join a club and get a range of benefits \u2013 priority booking, a 25% discount once a year for a birthday meal, a bottle of wine at cost price.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a real hyperlocal subscription service,\u201d she says. Neighbourhood grocers, wine shops and the like who are already delivering should consider offering a regular service for customers. \u201cYou may have people thinking: \u2018I don\u2019t want to go out and get my food. If I can get that straight from the grocer, picking it for me, there are fewer people who have handled that and that\u2019s going to be delivered to my door. Maybe that\u2019s going to cost me an extra five quid \u2013 but you know what? I\u2019m going to go for that because of the time I would spend otherwise.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For large and small businesses, what has happened over the past two months will yield a legacy. \u201cI do think that what will come out of this is memories of the businesses that helped us through it \u2026 and I think those memories will shape our decisions in the future,\u201d she says. \u201cThat support you have for businesses that were there when you needed them, and were behaving well \u2026 that emotion goes deep.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cAnd, you know, some big players have not been there, so it\u2019s going to be very interesting.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Mary Portas is the founder of Portas, a creative consultancy that explores the future of shopping and living.</em></p>",
  "<p>Now more than ever we could do with firm leadership, strong example-setting, and a nationwide feeling of unity that comes from knowing that We\u2019re All In This Together. Good of Prince Charles to put on his best rumpled gardening jacket and stand <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-charles-encourages-jobless-people-22050534\">port-faced in his own garden</a> telling us all to pick some fruit, then. I was just thinking, \u201cYou know what would really get me through the endless doom of this pandemic? Inexpertly grabbing potatoes out of the ground for absolute minimum wage.\u201d And just like that, Charlie came through.</p> <p>In case you have missed this because you have been indoors desperately trying to do your job through a series of janky video calls while also juggling childcare and shopping for food despite the constant restrictions and doing a bit of exercise without going within two metres of another person while doing it \u2013 lockdown resembling a complicated fox\u2013chicken\u2013grain river-crossing task rather than a genuine public health measure \u2013 then what you\u2019ve missed is this: Britain\u2019s crops are under threat of mouldering on the vine, and you need to do something about it. Normally this wouldn\u2019t be a problem because our agriculture industry has relied<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/28/fruit-and-veg-will-run-out-unless-britain-charters-planes-to-fly-in-farm-workers-from-eastern-europe\"> on seasonal migrant workers</a>, but a combination of pandemic flight restrictions and years of government-sanctioned xenophobia have painted us into a bit of a corner, potato-and-pear wise. Hence, Prince Charles.</p> <p>The solution to this mooted at the start of lockdown was the <a href=\"https://pickforbritain.org.uk/\">Pick For Britain</a><a href=\"https://pickforbritain.org.uk/\"> campaign</a> \u2013 a flimsily rebranded version of world war two\u2019s Women\u2019s Land Army \u2013 for which British workers at a loose end are recruited en masse to get the strawberries in. Or that\u2019s the theory, anyway: even with long-term furloughs and job losses, the number of people signing up to spend two entire seasons living in farm-provided accommodation (with the rent often deducted from your minimum wage pay) and waking up at 5am for some reason just to go face-to-face with some asparagus has been low. It\u2019s estimated we need 80,000 extra workers tilling the fields. As <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-charles-mobilises-a-new-land-army-0sgp9ztgm\">reported</a> in the Times, the work placement charity Concordia said of 50,000 people initially interested, 6,000 made it to interview, 1,000 rejected jobs that they were offered, and only 150 took up offers of work. Farming is no longer the Enid Blyton-esque jolly-good-day\u2019s-work-and-a-pint-of-ale-for-your-trouble! it used to be. It\u2019s just hard graft for very little money, possibly Britain\u2019s most sacred tradition.</p> <p>That\u2019s why Pick For Britain got the big guns involved: Waitrose\u2019s very own in-house royal. \u201cIf we are to harvest British fruit and vegetables this year, we need an army of people to help,\u201d the Prince said, one hand in his pocket. \u201cIn the coming months, many thousands of people will be needed to bring in the crops. It will be hard graft but it is hugely important \u2026 People are needed who are genuinely going to commit. The phrase I have often heard is, \u2018pickers who are stickers\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>There are some very loaded terms in there, aren\u2019t there? Prince Charles saying \u201chard graft\u201d alone should be enough to get the Robespierres among us fired up. The idea that he is parroting cool farming lingo that he has heard but never had to learn through work does rather put the (British-grown!) cherry on the sundae, too. Pick literally one brussels sprout out the ground, Prince Charles.

  "<p>Clap for them, then charge them. This is the how the Conservatives treat migrant key workers. For all the admiration and thanks heaped upon these workers during the coronavirus pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">the government</a> has refused to scrap the NHS immigration surcharge. The majority of non-EU migrants, including those who work in the NHS, will have to pay the surcharge on top of taxes, national insurance contributions and extortionate immigration fees.</p> <p>And so it has to be said plainly: the government praises NHS workers for providing life-saving care, then makes them pay through the nose to access that same care themselves. Migrant staff have to pay twice for the very healthcare system they work for. Just because they are immigrants.</p> <p>When confronted with this contradiction at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/government-reviewing-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-medics\">the end of April</a>, Priti Patel suggested the surcharge was \u201cunder review\u201d. This has been the home secretary\u2019s standard response of late: whenever Patel has been presented with evidence showing the deleterious impact of the government\u2019s immigration policies, she\u2019ll say they\u2019re being looked at.</p> <p>In an attempt to wriggle out of this claim, Patel\u2019s department then said she had never promised any formal review of the NHS surcharge. Instead, this was just Patel referring to the fact that \u201call government policies are continuously kept under review\u201d. Used again yesterday by foreign secretary Dominic Raab, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1262425636855074818?s=20\">without a hint of irony</a>, this is a handy catchphrase the government uses to avoid scrutiny.</p> <p>Stopping short of doing nothing, the Conservatives have done the absolute bare minimum to change the policy. Until October, doctors, nurses and paramedics will be exempt from paying the surcharge for a year as part of an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-frontline-workers-visas-extended-so-they-can-focus-on-fighting-coronavirus\">automatic visa extension</a>. The concession amounts to crumbs from the master\u2019s table: pause it for a year and then, once the clapping has stopped, continue as if nothing has happened.</p> <p>This one-year exemption is a scrap that\u2019s not even considered for other migrant key workers: the care workers, supermarket staff, porters and cleaners who have put their lives on the line during this pandemic are only a few of those not given a temporary pass. They will still have to pay up. \u201cI wanted to do nursing but I couldn\u2019t afford overseas student fees, so I decided to be a care worker and I\u2019m working hard,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-nhs-visa-extensions-uk-doctors-nurses-a9444056.html\">Shantel Murray told </a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-nhs-visa-extensions-uk-doctors-nurses-a9444056.html\">the Independent</a>. \u201cRight now I\u2019m doing all I can to help the community. But I just feel so undervalued.\u201d</p> <p>Kimesha is a care worker who is paid only \u00a39 an hour. She can barely afford the surcharge and visa costs for herself and her three children, so has had to take a second job. \u201cIt is very stressful because it keeps going up. It is a struggle for people like me who aren\u2019t earning enough to pay rent, council tax and bills. It should be abolished for everyone,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/03/calls-grow-scrap-nhs-surcharge-migrant-healthcare-workers-coronavirus\">she told the Guardian</a>. Care-worker badges and platitudes are no substitute for policy change.</p> <p>The surcharge has tripled in price in less than two years. At the end of 2018 it was \u00a3200 for an adult; now it\u2019s \u00a3400 and is set to rise again, to \u00a3624, on 1 October this year. For anyone under the age of 18 it will be \u00a3470, meaning for a family of two adults and two children, it will cost \u00a32,188 to use the NHS each year.</p> <p>Matt Hancock <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1195997609942560768?s=20\">defended the increase</a> during the general election campaign, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s the national health service not the international health service.\u201d Here is the myth of British exceptionalism. In 1971, <a href=\"http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/immigration-and-the-national-health-service-putting-history-to-the-forefron\">around 30% of doctors working in NHS</a> were born overseas. That figure is still roughly the same. The government wants an exclusively \u201cnational\u201d health service, just one that is staffed by \u201cinternational\u201d workers \u2013 who then have to pay to access the health service themselves.</p> <p>The government justifies the surcharge, saying it \u201censures that migrants make a proper financial contribution to the cost of their NHS care\u201d. Except they already do \u2013 it\u2019s called taxes.</p> <p>The duplicity of the surcharge is painfully obvious. If any lesson is learned from this pandemic, it should be that healthcare is a universal, basic right, whether you\u2019re a key worker or not. The \u201cgood migrant\u201d/\u201cbad migrant\u201d binary is a dead end. Nobody should have to pay twice to access it just because they weren\u2019t born in this country.</p> <p>This one policy, callous though it is, is emblematic of a much bigger problem: how the government treats all migrants. Though not officially part of the \u201chostile environment\u201d, the NHS surcharge was introduced at the same time as many of the policies that fall under this infamous title. Most remain in operation \u2013 despite the Windrush scandal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">court rulings</a>, endless cases that show the damage they\u2019ve done and a global pandemic.

It\u2019s precisely the classification of certain people as \u201clow skilled\u201d that allows the government to exclude from the surcharge exemption care workers and other key workers who have played a crucial role during this pandemic.

The US wished to include language on incentivising innovation that would give companies guarantees about profits from vaccines.</p> \n<p>The medical journal the Lancet, which was incorrectly mentioned in Trump\u2019s letter as having published a report on the virus in late 2019, issued a statement setting the record straight on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis statement is factually incorrect,\u201d the Lancet said. \u201cThe Lancet published no report in December 2019, referring to a virus or outbreak in Wuhan or anywhere else in China \u2026 The allegations levelled against the WHO in President Trump\u2019s letter are serious and damaging to efforts to strengthen international cooperation to control this pandemic. It is essential that any review of the global response is based on a factually accurate account of what took place in December and January.\u201d</p> \n<p>EU diplomats, aware that the WHO has become a stage prop in Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, have been focusing on trying to minimise the US-China clash at the assembly, and still hope the compromise resolution can minimise the damage, and possibly pave the way for Trump to delay a final break from the WHO.</p> \n<p>In Brussels, the EU threw its weight behind the WHO, urging all countries to support it in the wake of Trump\u2019s continued attacks. \u201cThis is the time for solidarity,\u201d said the European commission\u2019s spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson. \u201cIt is not the time for finger-pointing or undermining multilateral cooperation.</p> \n<p>Welcoming what had been a victory for EU diplomacy, the bloc\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, pointedly distanced himself from Trump\u2019s criticisms, saying: \u201cThe resolution underlines the importance of responding to this crisis through solidarity and multilateral cooperation under the umbrella of the United Nations. We commend the WHO for its leading role in guiding the response to this crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>He reiterated the EU\u2019s call for vaccine research to be shared and said the WHO would hold a lessons learned inquiry.</p> \n<p>The WHO regularly conducts reviews into its handling of major epidemics, so the real battle if the US stays in the UN body would be over issues such as the precise terms of reference and the identity of the inquiry chair.</p> \n<p>The loss of US funding to the WHO would be a severe blow since the US contributed more than $400m to the WHO in 2019, or about 15% of its budget. WHO funding is in need of reform since the overstretched body is heavily dependent on one-off voluntary contributions from nations and philanthropists such as the Gates Foundation. Many European states share the desire to reform the WHO, but find Trump\u2019s threats counterproductive since they only entrench Chinese influence with Africa, and make the reform cause harder.</p> \n<p>Overall, China seemed content with the WHA\u2019s direction, sensing that the US tactics had left Trump increasingly isolated. </p> \n<p>China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, described Trump\u2019s letter as slanderous. \u201cThe US leadership\u2019s open letter is \u2026 trying to mislead the public \u2026 to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China\u2019s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,\u201d Zhao said. </p> \n<p>The US decided not to resist the resolution, but put out a statement disassociating itself from a section in the resolution that favoured equal access to the intellectual property of any coronavirus medicines, such as a vaccine. </p> \n<p>At the White House Trump refused to back down, insisting the WHO will \u201chave to clean up their act, they have to do a better job.

For one thing, the 2020 emoji updates are still on their way: those designs \u2013 including representations of bubble tea, people hugging and the transgender flag \u2013 are making their way through the development process now, and should hit most phones this autumn.</p> <p>And there\u2019s a technical quirk that provides even more hope, says Jeremy Burge, the chief emoji officer of <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org\">Emojipedia</a>. The lack of a new version of the unicode standard means there won\u2019t be any new emojis, but there could still be new emoji <em>sequences</em>.</p> <p>The distinction is that some are technically made up of a combination of others. Take \ud83d\udc77, for instance \u2013 \u201cconstruction worker\u201d. That\u2019s a basic emoji, the type that requires a new version of the Unicode Standard to create. But \ud83d\udc77\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, a light-skinned male construction worker, is a sequence: even though it looks like one emoji, it\u2019s actually represented by three in a row.</p> <p>Most diversity in human representations is carried out with this technical quirk, but other emojis use the same trick. Add white flag, \ud83c\udff3 and rainbow, \ud83c\udf08 , and you get the rainbow flag: \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08. Add a dog \ud83d\udc15 and a worker\u2019s vest \ud83e\uddba and you get a service dog: \ud83d\udc15\u200d\ud83e\uddba.</p> <p>\u201cPeople might not be interested in the technical difference between an emoji like \ud83d\udc6e (police officer) and an emoji sequence like \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\ude92 (firefighter), as they both look like normal emojis on an emoji keyboard,\u201d Burge says. \u201cBut Unicode can still approve new sequences to roll out next year, and have said they might do this.\u201d</p> <p>That means we definitely won\u2019t be seeing the all-new candidates \u2013 proposals including Vulture, Bubbles, Hand With Index Finger and Thumb Crossed \u2013 before 2022, but could see a limited release with remixes of existing emojis.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to roll your eyes at the endless march of new emojis, but the system is meaningful for many \u2013 and has been democratised in recent years. The turning point was the introduction of the dumpling emoji in 2017, following a campaign by journalist Jennifer 8 Lee and her friend Yiying Lu.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact there was no dumpling emoji told me whatever system was in place had failed,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90136118/how-the-dumpling-democratized-emoji\">Lee told Forbes magazine</a>, citing the universality of the food, which has its own native equivalents in countries from Italy to Japan. She began a campaign to join the Unicode Consortium, and crowdfunded the entry fee, becoming the first member of the group to have joined with the express intention of creating emoji for the people.</p> <p>In the meantime, we can at least be glad that the slowdown means we won\u2019t have to deal with emoji added specifically in relation to what\u2019s happening in the world right now. We\u2019re already seeing unprecedented use of the microbe emoji \ud83e\udda0 and the face with medical mask \ud83d\ude37, according to an analysis Burge carried out in the first week of the crisis; that should do for the time being. It\u2019s not like you can use emoji on a Zoom call anyway.</p>",
  "<p>The European commission will launch a sweeping effort to tackle the global biodiversity crisis on Wednesday, including a call for 3bn trees to be planted in the EU by 2030 and a plan to better protect the continent\u2019s last primeval forests.</p> \n<p>The draft policy document, <a href=\"https://www.arc2020.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Biodiversity-Strategy_draft_200423_ARC2020.pdf\">published online</a> by an environmental NGO, admits that to date in the EU, \u201cprotection has been incomplete, restoration has been small-scale, and the implementation and enforcement of legislation has been insufficient\u201d.</p> \n<p>Scientists and environmental groups, commenting on the leaked draft of the strategy, say that while the new goals are welcome and impressive, there is a still distinct lack of tools with which to implement them.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good and ambitious document, but what is also obvious is the lack of strategy of how to implement it, and a lack of discussion of why previous documents of this type failed,\u201d said Przemys\u0142aw Chylarecki of the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p> \n<p>The new strategy calls for nearly one-third of EU land and sea to become protected zones. Currently, 26% of land and 11% of seas are classed as protected areas, but the European commission acknowledges this has not been enough to tackle the degradation of the natural world and threat of extinction to some birds and animals. Environmentalists say even these previous targets for protection have not been met in practice.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe proposed strategy lacks game-changing ideas and instruments for reaching the targets. We already know today that existing frameworks are not delivering, so why should we wait,\u201d said Robert Cyglicki, programme director of Greenpeace in central and eastern Europe. </p> \n<p>He welcomed the new strategy but said it would be 2024 before it became clear if new binding measures would be adopted, and called for immediate discussions over funding and enforcement mechanisms.</p> \n<p>Some elements of the programme, such as protecting migratory bird populations, are hard to implement without a global approach, and the paper calls on the EU to intensify efforts to make biodiversity a central part of its diplomacy. </p> \n<p>It concludes that global efforts to tackle the biodiversity crisis under the auspices of the UN have been \u201cinsufficient to halt the loss of the world\u2019s biodiversity\u201d.</p> \n<p>It will also turn the spotlight on the EU\u2019s \u20ac60bn-a-year common agricultural policy, which has been<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/europe-must-act-on-intensive-farming-to-save-wildlife-scientists-say\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/europe-must-act-on-intensive-farming-to-save-wildlife-scientists-say\">criticised for fuelling a steep decline in nature</a>, with a call for a quarter of the EU\u2019s agricultural land to be organically farmed by 2030.</p> \n<p>Environmentalists warned the plan\u2019s headline target to plant at least 3bn trees by 2030, \u201cin full respect of ecological principles\u201d, should only be a small part of the solution.</p> \n<p>\u201cPlanting 3bn trees is a really spectacular and visual goal, but it <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6491/580\">has been shown</a> that planting new trees is not a panacea and doesn\u2019t always help,\u201d said Chylarecki.</p> \n<p>More important will be the goal to map, monitor and \u201cstrictly protect\u201d the EU\u2019s last remaining primeval forests, which have survived in almost every member state, but remain threatened by human activity, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/violence-escalates-as-romania-cracks-down-on-illegal-timber-trade\">illegal logging.</a></p> \n<p>These older forests provide a natural shield against climate change, but in many countries have been preyed on by logging companies, with national governments either ignoring the situation or lacking the resources to properly police logging.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4eb2f7a2-6a6a-48dc-bdba-225172592cd7\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There are about <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14967\">three trillion trees on the planet</a> and they play a major role in producing the oxygen we all breathe. But twice as many existed before the start of human civilisation.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Today, 10 billion more trees are cut down than are planted every year. This destruction is a significant contributor to the carbon emissions that are driving the climate crisis. However, trees draw carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere as they grow, and planting trees will need to play an important part in ending the climate emergency.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Forests are also a vital and rich habitat for wildlife. Earth is at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-event-already-underway-scientists-warn\">start of a sixth mass extinction</a> of species and the razing of forests and other ecosystems is the biggest contributor to the losses. Tropical rainforests are especially important, hosting 50% of known terrestrial species on only 6% of the world\u2019s land.

He said the strategy \u201cseems more ambitious than the previous one but there are still areas for improvement\u201d.</p> \n<p>Luena said EU member states needed to comply with existing laws, noting that in the last week alone, the European commission launched legal action against 19 governments over failures on EU environmental law \u2013 a tally of charges far from unusual in the commission\u2019s monthly round up of infringement proceedings.</p> \n<p>Sweden and Latvia have been accused of not implementing parts of the EU\u2019s birds and habitats directives, Malta is faulted for not conserving endangered bluefin tuna, while France, Cyprus and Lithuania are said to have neglected to write EU air pollution standards into national law.</p> \n<p>The EU should also offer funding benefits for those governments serious about hitting targets, said campaigners.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt the EU level we need some sort of financial stimulus that would make it attractive for countries to focus on biodiversity,\u201d said Marta Grundland, a campaigner with Greenpeace Poland. </p> \n<p>\u201cRight now, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a EU priority or a national priority. After climate this is the second biggest threat we are facing, and it\u2019s all connected. If we want to help with the climate crisis we should also tackle the biodiversity crisis.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the lockdown restrictions begin to be eased across the UK, more workers are being asked to return to the workplace.</p> <p>The government has said that employees should only be asked to go back if they cannot do their job from home, so if you can, your employer should not be asking you to travel in to work.</p> <p>If you do need to go to your workplace, your employer is obliged to make sure you will be safe there. Employment lawyer <a href=\"https://www.mattgingell.com/\">Matt Gingell</a> says: \u201cEmployers have a general duty to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of all of their employees.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s a guide to your rights if your employer wants you back in the workplace.</p> <h2>How much notice should I be given that I have to return?</h2> <p>\u201cIf employees are unable to work from home, employers can ask employees to return to work and, technically, no notice is required,\u201d says Gingell.</p> <p>Solicitor and consumer law expert <a href=\"https://www.jajsolicitors.co.uk/people/\">Gary Rycroft</a> says there is no notice period written into law \u201cbut giving at least 48 hours\u2019 notice should allow either side to have discussions and air any concerns or even official \u2018grievances\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>The advisory group Acas says employers need to check if there are any arrangements in place with unions or similar about notice. It advises: \u201cEmployees and workers should be ready to return to work at short notice, but employers should be flexible where possible.\u201d</p> <p>So while your employer could ask you to return straight away, a good employer would understand if there were things you needed to put in place first, and give you chance to do so.</p> <h2>What if I was furloughed?</h2> <p>When you were furloughed your employer should have outlined what would happen when it wanted you to go back to work, and this may have a clause saying that you have to return as soon as you are asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe termination of the furlough agreement and when an employee will be expected to return to work will depend on the provisions of the agreement,\u201d says Gingell. Again, though, even if there is no notice period, a good employer should realise that you may need some time to prepare.</p> <p>If you have been furloughed under the government\u2019s job retention scheme, your employer can\u2019t ask you to go in and do ad hoc days, or work part-time. They would need to take you off furlough and renegotiate your contract with you.</p> <h2>Can they ask me to go back in part-time?</h2> <p>Not, currently, if you have been furloughed and they are using the government scheme to pay you. It only allows companies to furlough people for all of their normal hours, and bans them from asking you to do any work while you are off.</p> <p>But if your company has not claimed government money to cover your wages, it can ask you to resume work part-time. Make sure you understand the terms of the request \u2013 your employer cannot adjust your contract without your permission, so if it is asking you to change your hours you should get advice.</p> <h2>Can they ask me to take a pay cut?</h2> <p>\u201cThe law here is the same as it would be if an employer made the same request in the normal course of an employee\u2019s employment. Reducing hours and/or pay are deemed to be such fundamental changes to an employee\u2019s terms and conditions that the employee concerned should be consulted and then agree in writing,\u201d says Rycroft.</p> <p>He points out that for some employers \u201cthis may be the only economically viable option\u201d, and the alternative, if people refuse, could be redundancies. To make more than 20 people redundant there will need to be collective consultation.</p> <h2>What if I am in a vulnerable group or live with someone who is?</h2> <p>No special rules have been put in place to protect people in these groups who are asked to go into work but some already exist \u2013 if you are disabled or pregnant, for example, your employer has extra obligations.</p> <p>Rycroft says some employees may be able to argue that it will be discriminatory to force them to attend work outside the home. \u201cIt is all a question of degrees, in terms of how the employer can show that they have listened to legitimate concerns and made reasonable adjustments,\u201d he says.</p> <p>If you are pregnant your employer is obliged to make sure you can do your job safely. This can mean allowing you to do your job from home, or giving you a new role which can be done remotely. If your employer refuses either of these options, and you do not feel safe going into work you should take advice. <a href=\"https://www.employmentsolicitor.com/pregnancy-work-covid19/\">Employmentsolicitor.com says that you could be able to argue for a medical suspension</a> on full pay, which will allow you to stay at home.</p> <p>Living with someone who is vulnerable or especially at risk is not necessarily a reason an employee can refuse to return to work, says Rycroft. \u201cHowever, you can, as an employee raise a grievance and ask to be listened to and hopefully a compromise may be agreed, such as unpaid leave or using up annual holiday. But if an employer can show that a workplace is safe, the employer may insist on an employee attending.\u201d</p> <h2>What if I have childcare to worry about?</h2> <p>Legally, you can take time off to look after any dependants \u2013 these could be children, or older relatives. This time is typically unpaid. If you are currently furloughed and your employer does not have enough work for everyone to go back full-time, they may agree to leave you on furlough so you can continue to earn 80% of your normal pay.</p> <h2>What information should they give me in advance?</h2> <p>Rycroft says there is no law saying that employers should provide information before you return, but the government guidance to employers recommends that they do. He says this information \u2013 written or verbal \u2013 should cover how they are making your workplace safe in light of the pandemic. So you should be told what is happening to ensure social distancing and hygiene. \u201cThis will allow employees to understand how their health and safety at work is being addressed.</p> <h2>Can I refuse to go back?</h2> <p>Yes, if you believe there is a real danger to going to work. \u201cIf an employee refuses to return to the workplace due to the employee reasonably believing imminent and serious danger and is then dismissed for that reason the employee could, depending on the circumstances, have a claim for unfair dismissal,\u201d Gingell says.</p> <p>\u201cThe requirement that the employee has to believe that there is imminent and serious danger, does limit the right.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, you cannot refuse. \u201cIf someone refuses to attend work without a valid reason, it could result in disciplinary action,\u201d says Acas. But you may be able to make other arrangements with your employer \u2013 perhaps you can use holiday or take unpaid leave, or if you have concerns about something like travelling at peak time, they may be willing to accommodate different shifts. Your employer does not have to agree to this, but it is worth asking.</p> <p>Acas has more details on your rights around <a href=\"https://www.acas.org.uk/absence-from-work\">absence from work</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What if I am worried when I see my workplace?</h2> <p>Rycroft says that under section 100 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 employees may leave a place of work where there is an imminent health and safety danger. So if, for example, you return to find social distancing is impossible, you could argue that this is a reason to leave your workplace.</p> <p>But in the first instance you should try to resolve the issue with your boss. Gingell says: \u201cEmployers ought to to listen to the concerns of individuals and be sympathetic and understanding.\u201d</p> <p>If you do not get anywhere with this, you should take advice. If you are in a union, it should have a helpline you can call if there is no rep to speak to on site. <a href=\"https://www.acas.org.uk/\">Acas</a> is another port of call, as is <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/\">Citizens Advice</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIf the employer has breached the implied obligation to provide a safe working environment and/or trust and confidence an employee could, again, depending on the circumstances, resign swiftly as a result and claim constructive unfair dismissal,\u201d says Gingell. But he says you should get advice before taking this action.</p> <p>\u201cAnother option for employees to consider is contactIng the Health and Safety Executive, which enforces health and safety legislation,\u201d he says.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump has threatened to cut funding to the World Health Organization permanently and even pull the US out of the global body altogether unless it makes \u201cmajor substantive improvements\u201d which the president did not explain.</p> <p>In a four-page letter to the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Trump claimed the organisation had shown an \u201calarming lack of independence\u201d from China and accused Tedros of presiding over \u201crepeated missteps \u2026 that have been extremely costly for the world\u201d. The letter, he said, followed a US investigation into the WHO\u2019s \u201cfailed response to the Covid-19 outbreak\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s threat came on the day the WHO member states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/who-to-agree-deal-over-future-coronavirus-inquiry\">met for the first day of a two-day virtual assembly</a>. Tedros had invited both Trump and Xi Jinping to speak, in the hope of resolving differences between the two leaders on handling the outbreak, but Trump did not take part.</p> <p>On Tuesday the WHO members states are set to agree to an independent investigation \u2013 put forward in a resolution by the EU \u2013 into how the coronavirus was handled.</p> <p>On Monday night, the president published the letter, citing a timeline of the organisation\u2019s alleged failings, which was based on a selective version of the pandemic, highlighting where the WHO had publicised Chinese findings on the nature of the disease, but ignoring or glossing over clear warnings from the organisation about the dangers of the contagion.</p> <p>The move came hours after the US president told reporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for a couple of weeks</a>, despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous. \u201cI think it\u2019s good, I heard a lot of good stories \u2026 I take a pill every day,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Some claims in Trump\u2019s letter were false, for example that Taiwan had warned about human-to-human transmission of the disease on 31 December. On that date Taiwan sent a letter to the WHO noting the reported spate of unexplained pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, and that the patients were in isolation, and asking for further details.</p> <p>As the pandemic worsens in the US, and other countries begin a tentative recovery, Trump has sought to blame China and the WHO. He has suspended US funding to the organisation, pointing to the disparity between US and much smaller Chinese contributions and accusing Tedros and his team of being \u201cChina-centric\u201d.</p> <p>Trump ended the letter with an ultimatum.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not have time to waste,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is why it is my duty as president of the United States to inform you that if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of the United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider membership in the organization. I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to finance an organization that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America\u2019s interests.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did not make clear what \u201csubstantive improvements\u201d the US wanted to see. The US health and human services department has circulated a discussion document with other member states that was largely seen as moderate, calling for the WHO\u2019s powers of inspection to be strengthened, for example. Similar proposals were included in a resolution that appeared to have majority support at Monday\u2019s World Health Assembly.</p> <p>However, some US officials have suggested more drastic measures, such as making the WHO emergency programme semi-autonomous from the main organisation. That would be seen as unpalatable by many member states.</p> <p>\ufeffChina hit back on Tuesday, describing the letter as slanderous. \u201cThe US leadership\u2019s open letter is \u2026 trying to mislead the public \u2026 to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China\u2019s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,\u201d Zhao Lijian, a foreign ministry spokesman, told a regular briefing.</p> <p>A WHO spokeswoman in Geneva said the agency had no immediate comment but expected to have \u201cmore clarity\u201d and a reaction to it later in the day.</p> <p>The letter is the latest salvo in a war of words between Trump and the WHO that has unfolded in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The US president, who is under pressure at home over his response to the pandemic, temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">froze funding to the WHO</a> in April, accusing the global body of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the threat. At the time, critics were stunned at the move to cut money from a critical UN agency during a global pandemic.</p> <p>Before Trump\u2019s letter, Tedros acknowledged there had been shortcomings and told the virtual assembly he welcomed calls for a review. \u201cI will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained and lessons learned, and to make recommendations to improve national and global pandemic preparedness and response,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one thing is abundantly clear. The world must never be the same.\u201d</p> <p>The letter came as deaths from coronavirus in the US passed 90,000. The US also has the most cases of Covid-19 in the world (1,508,168), followed by <strong>Russia</strong> and <strong>Brazil.</strong></p> <p>On Monday Brazil jumped into third place \u2013 overtaking Britain \u2013 after the health ministry announced 13,140 new cases. Russia now has a total of 255,368 cases and 674 new deaths.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s economic policy secretary, Adolfo Sachsida, said April, May, June and July would be the worst months of the coronavirus crisis, and from August the economy would be able to pick up again.</p> <p>Deaths across Latin America have passed 30,000, representing just under 10% of global fatalities</p> <p> The global economy will take much longer to recover fully from the shock caused by the new coronavirus than initially expected, the head of the International Monetary Fund said, and she stressed the danger of protectionism.</p> <p>The IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said the fund was likely to revise downward its forecast for a 3% contraction in GDP in 2020, but gave no details.

But the pandemic \u2013 and the city\u2019s homeless policies during the pandemic \u2013 helped create a perfect storm within the neighborhood\u2019s 35 blocks. In order to be able to enforce social distancing guidelines, San Francisco\u2019s overcrowded homeless shelters drastically reduced their capacity. The city made hotel rooms available to homeless people, but only those who had tested positive for the virus or ranked among the most vulnerable.<strong> </strong>Many unhoused people suddenly had no other choice but to take to the streets, some fortunate enough with tents and others making do with what they could find. Amid a lack of testing, it\u2019s unclear how widespread the virus is in the neighborhood, among the housed and unhoused.</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Roger Moussa, 51, who has been sleeping on the streets since his shelter bed reservation ran out a month ago. \u201cI feel completely helpless. I have nowhere to go, and every other night I get robbed.\u201d</p> <p>Tents have sprung up throughout San Francisco\u2019s 49 sq miles since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, but in the Tenderloin, the number of tents had exploded by 285% \u2013 268 tents total. Neighborhood residents believe this to be an undercount, with some tallying 432 tents as of last week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f5eb10a0de73c94342de4d1ea0a2db225069ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f5eb10a0de73c94342de4d1ea0a2db225069ae3/0_0_3996_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This is not a way for people to live, especially now,\u201d said Kathy Looper, owner of the Cadillac Hotel in the Tenderloin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is not a way for people to live, especially now,\u201d said Kathy Looper, owner of the Cadillac Hotel in the Tenderloin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Chiu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is not a way for people to live, especially now, and the city is not providing any solution,\u201d Looper said. \u201cThey herded everyone into this one neighborhood and said it\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s not OK. They created their own Warsaw ghetto.\u201d</p> <p>Several unhoused people said they weren\u2019t trying to make life difficult for the housed Tenderloin residents. Many have community ties, with some living in the supportive housing offered there before becoming homeless again. Given the option, most of them wouldn\u2019t be sleeping on the sidewalk; they didn\u2019t have a choice.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to go into the men\u2019s shelter but they said the corona had came out,\u201d said Abdull Best, 25. \u201cYou can\u2019t get into a new shelter while it\u2019s quarantined. No new residents during the quarantine.\u201d</p> <p>The city has responded with a Tenderloin Neighborhood Plan that includes more public restrooms and hand-washing stations. It <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/14/855588754/san-francisco-shifts-from-trashing-homeless-camps-to-sanctioning-them-amid-covid\">launched</a> several \u201csafe-sleeping sites,\u201d city-sanctioned encampments with access to some amenities and services and identified 13 of the hardest hit blocks for cleaning and clearing. \u201cI want to really recognize that this is going to be a targeted plan, a challenging one, and we are set to be as aggressive as we can in implementing it so that the people in the community can see a difference,\u201d said Mayor London Breed.</p> <p>For many in the neighborhood, it\u2019s yet another empty gesture in a long history of empty gestures. Residents have grown accustomed to being overlooked by the powers that be. Located just three blocks from the towering beaux-arts majesty of city hall, the neighborhood has long been written off as an open-air drug market and homeless hub. Tourists are warned to avoid it. Fox News and conservative media relish in attacking it, splashing live shots of feces and syringes on the pavement as proof of the city\u2019s failings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bacb72688175383a37a2c6c4326329509b07122d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bacb72688175383a37a2c6c4326329509b07122d/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco\u2019s first sanctioned tent encampment is in a fenced-off space near city hall with spaces marked for social distancing and some amenities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Francisco\u2019s first sanctioned tent encampment is in a fenced-off space near city hall with spaces marked for social distancing and some amenities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s also one of the <a href=\"https://default.sfplanning.org/publications_reports/SF_NGBD_SocioEconomic_Profiles/2012-2016_ACS_Profile_Neighborhoods_Final.pdf\">most diverse</a> and densely populated communities in the city: 31% of the neighborhood is Asian, 23% is Latino and 10% is black. In San Francisco, a city with the most <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/9/18537122/billionaire-study-wealthx-san-francisco\">billionaires per capita</a> in the world, the median household income is $104,552. In the Tenderloin, where 30% of the neighborhood is in poverty, the median household income is $23,513.</p> <p>A term frequently used with the Tenderloin is \u201ccontainment zone\u201d. For years, residents have viewed this as the city\u2019s tactic in dealing with the neighborhood. \u201cThere\u2019s inherent pressure in urban life, with homelessness and drug dealing and mental illness \u2013 just urban realities,\u201d explained David Faigman, dean and chancellor of the UC Hastings Law School, which is located in the neighborhood. \u201cAnd if we can keep it in the Tenderloin, we\u2019re not going to see it in the Marina. We\u2019re not going to see it in Pacific Heights.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, UC Hastings filed a federal lawsuit against the city, joined by the merchants and property association and some other residents. The lawsuit seeks to compel the city to clear the sidewalks and clean the streets by providing healthy and safe options for the unhoused population in the encampments.</p> <p>\u201cWe could have brought a lawsuit 10, 15, 20, 25 years ago and we probably could have had standing,\u201d Faigman said. \u201cWe would have had neighbors who were fed up with what they were dealing with. But what they\u2019re dealing with now is at such a much more profound level. We have a virus that could possibly be deadly, and we don\u2019t know how prevalent the pandemic is out on the streets. You have people in wheelchairs, children and the elderly who need to maneuver around a population that may have a very high rate of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThere has always been an underlying health crisis,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut now it\u2019s a true exigent emergency.\u201d</p> <p>To many in the neighborhood, the city\u2019s homelessness policies amid the pandemic have continued to institutionalize homelessness within the neighborhood borders, rather than try to solve the issue with housing. \u201cThe time they spent writing the plan they could have spent moving people into hotels or sanctioned encampments,\u201d said Randy Shaw, executive director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic.</p> <p>And many recognize that nothing will change until those without shelter can safely get off the streets. \u201cThere is a literal plague sweeping the country and our city and we are only as safe and as protected as our most vulnerable residents,\u201d said local lawmaker Matt Haney, who represents the Tenderloin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d55662f67cc24f9a87aee9ceafb1e617cc0e0d21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d55662f67cc24f9a87aee9ceafb1e617cc0e0d21/0_0_5045_3027/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An activist protests from her vehicle outside Moscone Center in San Francisco, asking Mayor London Breed to house homeless people using vacant hotels.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An activist protests from her vehicle outside Moscone Center in San Francisco, asking Mayor London Breed to house homeless people using vacant hotels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Margot/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The crisis unfolding in the Tenderloin has created light tension in the world of homeless outreach. Residents\u2019 demands for clearing tents and sweeping encampments can come across as anti-homeless, but many of those advocating for the measures work in homeless outreach. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re against homeless people \u2013 it\u2019s that \u201cno one should be in those tents\u201d, Shaw said. \u201cEveryone should agree they should either be in hotels or in supervised encampments. They shouldn\u2019t be on sidewalks in the Tenderloin.\u201d</p> <p>There needs to be concern for the housed residents of the Tenderloin as well, Shaw said, many of whom do not have the luxury to work from home and have to make their way through the crowded streets every day.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a level of despair in the Tenderloin that I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWhat does it say to these families that the city government will allow these conditions to proliferate right on the sidewalks? It sends a message that they\u2019re not valued at all.\u201d</p> <p>One week after the city announced its Tenderloin Neighborhood Plan, tents and makeshift structures still crammed the sidewalks, their occupants never too far away. The few public restrooms available had lines down the street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2dc75a6d154d6b20bf711f0a5d6a744b0696bd61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2dc75a6d154d6b20bf711f0a5d6a744b0696bd61/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrians walk by homeless encampments in the Tenderloin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedestrians walk by homeless encampments in the Tenderloin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The city has recommended establishing a testing site as part of its Tenderloin assessment report and has begun setting up the sanctioned encampments. Homeless outreach advocates worry that it won\u2019t be enough. The camps must still adhere to social distancing, so they will only accept a limited number of people. Priority is going to the medically vulnerable and those who are already in the city system.</p> <p>Haney, the local lawmaker who represents the Tenderloin, believes that what happens in this neighborhood will determine how long the city\u2019s stay-at-home order will last. \u201cCan San Francisco meet the metrics the governor has put forth if we have so many people who cannot shelter in place?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Because what Haney and homeless outreach advocates have been saying since the mayor declared a state of emergency is that viruses don\u2019t stay within income brackets or sociological boundaries. The impact on the Tenderloin already demonstrates the direct effect that the unhoused population in a pandemic can have on a housed population.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t even about doing the right thing for disenfranchised people, or charity,\u201d Haney said. \u201cWhen they get sick, you and your families will get sick as well.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Mark Acasio says he and his gorilla suit are joining the Las Vegas Raiders this fall. Acasio, a long-time fan from Brentwood, California, known far and wide as Gorilla Rilla, has shelled out $3,500 for home-game tickets and $8,500 for a <a href=\"https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/aug/24/faq-psls-personal-seat-licenses-raiders-stadium/\">personal-seat license</a> (PSL) for a front-row seat at Allegiant Stadium, the Raiders\u2019 posh new home.</p> <p>Acasio has not missed a Raiders\u2019 home game in 25 years. Just because the Raiders will now be a one-hour flight from his home instead of a one-hour drive, he is determined to stay loyal to the team and to his comrades moving to Vegas from the Black Hole, the NFL\u2019s most infamous cheering section, at dingy Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, many other friends of mine have not, and will not, step foot in Las Vegas,\u201d Acasio tells The Guardian.</p> <p>They won\u2019t because Las Vegas is not exactly around the corner from the Bay Area, and because tickets in the sections at Allegiant Stadium envisioned as a New Black Hole are about double what they were in Oakland \u2013 $218.75 in Vegas, up to $110 in Oakland. There was a PSL in Oakland, but as far as anyone can remember, it was not much more than $500.</p> <p>But that is only half of the issue. Oakland had the Raiders twice: from 1960 until 1982, when they moved to Los Angeles for 13 years, and then again from 1995 through last season. The Raiders won two Super Bowls in their first stint in Oakland and another in Los Angeles, but the second stay was pretty bleak, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Las_Vegas_Raiders_seasons\">with only one winning season since 2002</a>.</p> <p>Although they knew that Mark Davis, the Raiders\u2019 owner and son of Al Davis, the legendary former Raiders\u2019 coach and owner, had tried in vain for years to replace the obsolete Coliseum, many of the team\u2019s long-suffering fans were enraged that the team abandoned the Bay Area again \u2013 and that Davis was hardly nostalgic about Oakland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/11/oakland-raiders-move-las-vegas-nfl-fans-city-impact\">The Raiders helped unite the divisions in Oakland.

The Black Hole is also a global fan club with thousands of members. </p> <p>But the Black Hole is, well, <a href=\"https://theblackhole.com/\">let the club\u2019s website explain it</a>:</p> <p><em>We are a STATE OF MIND. Our state of mind has united the entire Raiders Nation over the years. We have grown from a few friends to a worldwide family made up of generations of fans young and old, from all ethnicities, races, and sexes. If you bleed SILVER and BLACK, then we are connected and you are spiritually part of us.</em></p> <p>Rob Rivera, a resident of Hayward, California, who is the president and co-founder of the Black Hole, tells the Guardian, \u201cThe move has broken our hearts, pissed us off. They proved loyalty is a one-way street in the NFL.\u201d</p> <p>Deboe was not a Black Hole denizen: \u201cThey stand up too long for me,\u201d says Deboe, who is retired and lives in Castro Valley, California. But he feels burned, too. Like Rivera, Deboe figures he will go to one or two Raiders\u2019 home games per season in Las Vegas, probably using tickets purchased by a season-ticket holder (with a PSL).</p> <p>Deboe is sure he won\u2019t become a San Francisco 49ers\u2019 fan. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely out of the question,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cNobody will do that.\u201d</p> <p>The Raiders did not return several emails from the Guardian about duplicating the Black Hole in Vegas. Marc Badain, the team president, <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/stadium/fear-not-raiders-fans-black-hole-will-live-on-in-las-vegas-1939654/\">told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in January</a>: \u201cA lot of the folks that sit in the Black Hole in Oakland bought tickets in the south end zone at Allegiant. Whether that happens organically, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>Deboe, for one, is not optimistic that will happen. He says that is \u201cbecause Las Vegas is a destination city. A lot of people take trips there from all over the country. Fans of other teams will see a road game in Vegas and will want to make a weekend of it. Oakland was a sold-out stadium of locals.\u201d</p> <p>There is a Black Hole chapter in Las Vegas, a good start. The chapter president is Cisco \u201cKid\u201d Ortega, whose job was relocated from the Bay Area to Vegas before the Raiders made their move. Ortega says the team has not been in touch with him, but when asked about a Black Hole II, he says \u201cWe are going to do our best to duplicate that.\u201d</p> <p>The chapter threw a Super Bowl party at the Westgate Hotel in Las Vegas just to get the ball rolling, although the coronavirus pandemic scuttled plans for the NFL to host its draft in Las Vegas in April, denying the Black Hole club some inevitable TV screen time and valuable publicity. Ortega is still optimistic for success in Vegas, though he understands the challenges.</p> <p>\u201cI know I can speak for many of us Oakland fans when I say this second relocation will always hurt,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of us, including myself, will not wear any Raider gear that says \u2018Las Vegas\u2019. However, what\u2019s done is done, and we, The Black Hole, have to continue on with what we\u2019ve built in the past 25 years.\u201d</p> <p>When plans for Allegiant Stadium were revealed, Raiders fans were horrified to note that an area in the stadium outside the north end zone that would be ideal for another Black Hole was taken up by club seating. But the Raiders said there could be a Black Hole at the other end. About 15% of the season tickets in Vegas were sold to fans from northern California.</p> <p>But will the Black Hole, or can the Black Hole, really ever be the same?

  "<p>Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) are set to transform our lives. Batteries are improving, bolstering their performance and range, while charging points are becoming an increasingly common part of the roadside. Many of us are excited by the potential for low or emission-free transport, plus the prospect of connectivity and, in time, driverless vehicles. Certainly, electric vehicles (EVs) could theoretically transform transportation. But the actual numbers of EVs and PHEVs on our roads is still very low, so when exactly will this revolution begin?</p> <p>Of all of the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/383023/new-car-units-registered-in-the-united-kingdom-uk-by-fuel-type/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cars purchased in 2019, just 7.3% used \u201calternative fuels\u201d</a>. But figures show their numbers have been rising year on year for the past decade.</p> <p>Electric cars, in one form or another, have been around since the 19th century, but these were very much supplanted by their diesel and petrol counterparts in the century that followed. However, since the turn of the 21st century, major automakers have been ramping up their efforts. For instance, BMW launched concept versions of its all-electric BMW i3 series and a plug-in hybrid, called BMW i8, at the 2009 International Motor Show; it now has a range of 10 PHEVs, from the 2 Series Active Tourer to the X5. EVs and PHEVs are now a major part of carmakers\u2019 ranges. By 2023, BMW plans to have 25 electrified vehicles in production, with 12 of those being fully electric.</p> <p>Governments, too, are planning and investing in an electric future for transportation. The UK government will ban the sale of petrol and diesel in 2035 and other European countries are acting similarly.</p> <p><strong>Tipping point<br></strong>Michael Woodward, UK automotive lead at Deloitte, says EVs will rise in popularity during the 2020s. \u201cThe inclusion of hybrids in the UK\u2019s incoming ban on new petrol and diesel car sales from 2035 could slow demand in the longer term but, for now, hybrids continue to be seen as a stepping stone to going fully electric.\u201d</p> <p>Furthermore, Woodward predicts the market is now ready for EVs. \u201cWhile the uptake of EVs is unlikely to overtake demand for traditional petrol or diesel cars any time soon, a tipping point is likely to be reached in 2021.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Charge points<br></strong>There are well-known practical issues with EVs that have led the public to be nervous about purchasing one. The biggest issue is probably the fear of getting a flat battery and being unable to charge up, a problem known in the industry as \u201crange anxiety\u201d. An immediate solution for anyone nervous about range anxiety would be to look to a PHEV, which switches to conventional fuels on longer journeys but remains fully electric for shorter trips. For instance, all of BMW\u2019s plug-in hybrid vehicles have an electric range that can cover the average commute, which is 26 miles a day.</p> <p>Alexander Lewis-Jones, senior analyst at energy consultancy Delta-EE, believes a lot has been done in terms of improving the UK\u2019s charging infrastructure to also combat this issue. He says: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about range anxiety being a barrier to uptake, but our research shows this shouldn\u2019t be the case, as the UK has more than 31,450 charge points accessible to the public. While this is a strong number, we can\u2019t get complacent and should be urging local authorities to install charge points in their area.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9a8e313504bc7e5a372104b879fc9813065ef4a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a8e313504bc7e5a372104b879fc9813065ef4a8/0_219_2632_3289/800.jpg\" alt=\"Supporting P90243367 highRes bmw-i-wallbox-for-ch\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most UK EV drivers charge their vehicle at home</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Delta-EE\u2019s research suggests the UK government has invested in the region of \u00a3300-400m in public charging infrastructure. There has also been the development of \u201crapid charging\u201d points for travellers in a hurry. A new industry is emerging, designed to keep EV users moving. However, in the UK, the majority of EV drivers charge up at home.</p> <p><strong>Efficiency</strong><br>Richard Seale, lead automotive designer at Seymourpowell says that, from an energy efficiency point of view, EVs come out on top. \u201cEVs are more efficient at turning energy into motion,\u201d says Seale. \u201cElectric motors turn between 85-90% of stored energy into movement, while ICEs (internal combustion engines) are down to around 15-25%.\u201d</p> <p>For Seale, the arguments for EVs are clear. However, the public has tended to associate EVs with lower performance and charging issues, and these factors, combined with a higher price, make them a hard purchase to justify.<br><br>\u201cActually buying one hasn\u2019t always been an easy choice to make,\u201d says Seale. \u201cEven though consumer attitudes are changing, ultra-low emission vehicles still only represent a tiny percentage of cars on the road in the UK. That aside, if you look at the accelerating growth rate: 1,732% between 2010 and 2018, it is clear that we are seeing a fundamental change in the automotive industry. I firmly believe that, eventually, EVs will be by far in the majority on British roads.\u201d<br><br>Analysts and industry expect the 2020s to see both transport and energy infrastructures become far more reliant on batteries. But some are sceptical that EVs are great for the environment. Yet Seale says EVs and PHEVs do mark progress.</p> <p>\u201cOne key point that is often argued is: \u2018The energy has to come from somewhere.\u2019 The issue with this argument is that, while it is still true that the majority of energy in the UK grid comes from fossil fuels, using an ICE solution as the end user will never improve this. However, opting for an EV means you make up part of a developing infrastructure of clean energy, an infrastructure that is only getting better.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/plug-into-hybrid/2020/may/19/how-much-did-the-first-mobile-phone-weigh-take-our-electrifying-quiz\">How much did the first mobile phone weigh? Take our electrifying quiz</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The future is electric</strong><br>Another big headline grabber is the emergence of autonomous, driverless vehicles. The energy in a battery can power both the car\u2019s motion and all of the other smart computing devices that come with it. There is a merging of the industries of automotive, telecoms and IT.</p> <p>Cars are going to become increasingly intelligent. For instance BMW\u2019s 330e model can already make predictions using route data to create the most efficient drive possible. Smart vehicles can make data-based decisions that humans would be unable to perform when at the wheel, such as choosing better routes, slowing down or sleeping the engine to reduce energy consumption, without unduly affecting journey times.</p> <p>Moreover, new business models for driverless vehicles are being devised including car clubs, shared ownership and rental models, as well as taxi services, and are attracting investors and entrepreneurs. The smart money looks to be on smart vehicles, and those vehicles are going to be electric.</p> <p><em>Technology drives the world, and is the beating heart of every BMW.

The majority will have been smothered by a water-based foam, similar to fire-fighting foam, a method that animal welfare groups are calling \u201cinhumane\u201d.</p> <p>The pork industry has warned that more than 10 million pigs could be culled by September for the same reason. The techniques used to cull pigs include gassing, shooting, anaesthetic overdose, or \u201cblunt force trauma\u201d.</p> <p>In \u201cconstrained circumstances\u201d, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/resources/AVMA-Guidelines-for-the-Depopulation-of-Animals.pdf\">techniques</a> [pdf] might also include a combination of shutting down pig barn ventilator systems with the addition of CO2 so the animals suffocate.</p> <p>The \u2018depopulation\u2019 comes despite food banks across the US reporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/us-food-banks-over-budget-demand-coronavirus\">unprecedented demand and widespread hunger</a> during the pandemic, with six-mile-long queues for aid forming at some newly set up distribution centres.</p> <p>The American meat supply chain has been hit hard by the closure of slaughterhouses, due to Covid-19 infection rates among workers. 30 to 40 plants have closed, which means that in the highly consolidated US system beef and pork slaughtering capacity has been cut by 25% and 40% respectively, <a href=\"http://www.ufcw.org/press/\">according</a> to the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW).</p> <p>The closures have meant that animals cannot be killed for food and many must instead be culled, or \u201cdepopulated\u201d at home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8927bab351915cc520f8d498d9afb27b38cad4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8927bab351915cc520f8d498d9afb27b38cad4a6/0_0_3162_2108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A truck loaded with chickens drives on the highway to deliver fowl to a meatpacking plant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10 million hens have already been culled due to slaughterhouse shutdowns.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>More pigs to be \u2018depopulated\u2019</h2> <p>As it is comparatively easier to keep cattle on farms, cow culls do not appear to be an issue as yet, and the chicken cull may have peaked, said Adam Speck, an agribusiness analyst with IHS Markit.</p> <p>\u201c[Cattle] could stay on ranches another six months if necessary. The peak of the chicken cull has passed for now. North of about 10 million chickens were depopulated, either at the chick or egg stage,\u201d Speck said.</p> <p>At the hen stage, Leah Garc\u00e9s, president of US welfare organisation <a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/\">Mercy for Animals</a>, said it is hard to be sure of the numbers. But, \u201cwhat we know with certainty is that <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-poultry-producers-coronavirus-20200424-hufdfzs24zhqpeptx4w6yngztm-story.html\">2 million meat chickens</a> [and] <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/egg-demand-shifted-and-61-000-minnesota-chickens-were-euthanized/569817312/?refresh=true\">61,000 laying hens</a>\u201d, have been killed on farms.</p> <p>Compared with poultry, said Garc\u00e9s, stopping or slowing the production cycle of pigs is harder, mainly because pig growing periods are about six months compared to six weeks for hens. \u201cPregnancies had already been set in motion when the slaughterhouse closures occurred,\u201d she said, and pigs were already in the system.</p> <p>The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) has <a href=\"https://nppc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/euthanasia-fact-sheet-FINAL-5-8-20.pdf?ftag=MSF0951a18\">estimated</a> that: \u201cup to 10,069,000 market hogs will need to be euthanised between the weeks ending on 25 April and 19 September 2020, resulting in a severe emotional and financial toll on hog farmers\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"609941f267b588228f22d90270a01a00570d2f2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/609941f267b588228f22d90270a01a00570d2f2e/0_0_5564_3709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"chicken on supermarket shelf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The peak of the chicken cull has passed, experts said, but pigs may now need to be \u2018depopulated\u2019 in large numbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For pig culls, AVMA \u201cpreferred methods\u201d include injectable anaesthetic overdose, gassing, shooting with guns or bolts, electrocution and manual blunt force trauma. AVMA methods \u201cpermitted in constrained circumstances\u201d include ventilator shutdown (VSD), potentially combined with carbon dioxide gassing, and sodium nitrite which would be ingested by pigs.</p> <p>Speaking more graphically, Garc\u00e9s said manual blunt force trauma can mean slamming piglets against the ground while VSD would \u201cessentially cook the pigs alive\u201d.</p> <p>Asked to estimate numbers of pigs that have already been culled, Speck said producers are very reluctant to depopulate. \u201cAbout two million might have been culled so far due to the Covid-19 pandemic, over the last six or so weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Speck added that with slaughterhouses likely to return to 85% capacity by the end of May, the NPPC\u2019s depopulation estimate of 10 million pigs could be significantly reduced.</p> <p>Speck said breeders are thinning herds and slowing growth to reduce pig supply. \u201cThey are sending breeding sows to slaughter, aborting pregnant sows on a small scale and [keeping market-bound pigs] on maintenance style rations with less protein. Coming into the summer months the pigs will also gain weight more slowly as the weather heats up.\u201d</p> <h2>Methods are \u2018inhumane\u2019</h2> <p>Asked about growth slowdown, Garc\u00e9s said it posed other welfare risks. \u201cOne method to slow down growth is to turn the heat up inside of the warehouses beyond the pigs \u2018comfort zone\u2019 because pigs eat less when they are too hot,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The combination of feed restrictions and higher barn temperatures, she said, mean pigs are \u201chungry and hot, increasing their overall discomfort, which is already high in a factory farm setting\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad0d7dea0d6e74838a7337efccb3d1db910e4b06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad0d7dea0d6e74838a7337efccb3d1db910e4b06/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hogs at a farm in Illinois, US\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many farmers now face having to cull market-ready pigs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In what appears to be an attempt by the industry to reduce any negative depopulation impact, a <a href=\"https://www.porkcares.org/about-we-care/we-care-organizations/\">blog managed</a> by the National Pork Board called Real Pig Farming offers social media sharing tips for farmers. The blog suggests farmers: \u201cThink twice before engaging with posts that show what may be happening on farms right now.\u201d<br><br>It said: \u201cMost people do not understand the complexity of raising pigs and getting pork from the farm to their table. That means, \u201c[a] good rule of thumb is to speak to a level a third grader [eight to 10 years old] would understand to ensure that things are not taken out of context.\u201d<br><br>NPPC spokesperson Jim Monroe said that as of the week ending on 15 May, less than 25% of overall slaughter capacity was idled and the situation was improving. Monroe, added that the \u201ctragic need to euthanise animals is to prevent animal suffering.\u201d<br><br>For poultry, culling options are no easier. Filling sheds with carbon dioxide gas is one method, said Kim Sturla, director of welfare organisation <a href=\"http://animalplace.org/\">Animal Place</a>. Another cull method, she said, is to smother hens with water-based foam, similar to firefighting foam. Water-based foaming is <a href=\"https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/resources/AVMA-Guidelines-for-the-Depopulation-of-Animals.pdf\">categorised</a> as the \u201cpreferred\u201d method by the AVMA.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/29/millions-of-farm-animals-culled-as-us-food-supply-chain-chokes-up-coronavirus\">Millions of farm animals culled as US food supply chain chokes up</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Previously asked about water-based foaming and other cull methods such VSD, an AVMA spokesperson said depopulation decisions were difficult and \u201cand contingent upon several factors, such as the species and number of animals involved, available means of animal restraint, safety of personnel, and other considerations such as availability of equipment, agents and personnel\u201d.</p> <p>European campaigners said firefighting foam causes prolonged suffering. Although risks of similar livestock culls appear low in Europe so far, welfare group, Compassion in World Farming advised using foam that contains nitrogen gas because death is faster.<br><br>A 2019 European Food Safety Authority journal <a href=\"https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2019.5850\">report</a> said it did not find water-based or firefighting foam acceptable because \u201cdeath due to drowning in fluids or suffocation by occlusion of the airways\u201d is not seen as \u201ca humane method for killing animals, including poultry\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>China\u2019s authoritarian rulers are presenting themselves as a viable rival to democracy and have played the UK economically, Stephen Kinnock, Labour\u2019s foreign policy spokesman on China, has said.</p> <p>In a significant hardening of the party\u2019s stance towards China, he also described David Cameron\u2019s golden era of engagement with China as \u201can abject failure\u201d, adding the UK has been naive about China\u2019s intentions.

He pointed out that the UK is running a \u00a322bn annual trade deficit with China.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like it has been one-way traffic on the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have a debate about trade figures but I think to a large extent we have been played \u2026 by a narrative that there was going to be an alignment of the international rules-based order, that there was going to be a slow but steady alignment with democratic norms.

He revealed he had recently met China\u2019s \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomats at the Chinese embassy in London and found them to show very little respect and instead be largely aggressive.</p> <p>Kinnock has recently been appointed to the opposition frontbench by Keir Starmer, and his remarks are understood to be part of a Labour review of its stance on China and mirrors a similar shift in thinking on the Conservative benches.</p> <p>Speaking to the <a href=\"https://radixuk.org/\">Radix UK</a> thinktank on Monday night, he said that \u201cmanaging the rise of China is the number one geopolitical challenge the world is facing\u201d and added there was no single global challenge that can be handled without engagement with China. \u201cAll roads lead to China,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But he said there was very little evidence that the west was exacting influence over China\u2019s political trajectory. \u201cIf you look at the increasingly hard line they take on human rights issues, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/uighurs\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/uighurs\">Uighurs</a>, what has been happening <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong\">in Hong Kong</a> or the position on Taiwan, there is very little evidence of any kind of success in terms of exerting or projecting our influence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He warned China was increasingly a systemic rival, seeing \u201cits model of responsive authoritarian government becoming something that it sees as a viable alternative to democracy.</p> <p>\u201cThat is a message that is being consistently pumped out.

  "<p>The number of people claiming unemployment benefits increased by the most since records began in April to reach almost 2.1 million, according to official figures capturing the onset of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>In a reflection of mounting job losses across the country, the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/employmentintheuk/may2020\">Office for National Statistics</a> said about 856,500 people signed up for universal credit and jobseeker\u2019s allowance benefits in April, driving up the overall UK claimant count by 69% in a single month.</p> <p>The surge marked the biggest monthly increase since comparable records began in the early 1970s, while the overall number of people claiming for benefits due to unemployment has risen above 2 million for the first time since 1996.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-19T08:08:42/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK unemployment claims\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-19T08:08:42/embed.html\">UK unemployment claims</a> </figure>  <p>Economists said the dramatic increase in unemployment would have been much higher without the government\u2019s emergency wage subsidy scheme. About 8m jobs have been protected at about 1m companies in the opening weeks of the programme, in which the government pays 80% of workers wages up to \u00a32,500 per month. The ONS does not count furloughed workers as unemployed.</p> <p>Unemployment is expected to steadily climb in the coming months as Britain grapples with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\">deepest recession in more than three centuries</a>, while the Treasury has also been warned the gradual winding down of its emergency support from August could trigger a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/vulnerable-not-exempt-from-coronavirus-furlough-winding-down-employers-told\">fresh wave of job losses</a>.</p> <p>Tej Parikh, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cWhile furloughing is holding off some job losses for now, it\u2019s not yet clear how firms will react as the scheme changes in August and as social distancing continues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMany companies will still be in the middle of a cashflow crisis, and will struggle with any cost increases. Government faces an onerous task in winding down the scheme without causing too much pain.\u201d</p> <p>The ONS cautioned that the increased number of people claiming benefits may not be as a direct consequence of unemployment, as the government had expanded eligibility for universal credit in response to Covid-19. </p> <p>However, the first official attempts to gauge the economic fallout showed the number of employees on company payrolls plunged by 450,000 at the start of April as staff were let go and hiring ceased. The number of vacancies posted by companies looking for new staff also halved.</p> <p>The Institute for Employment Studies warned unemployment was rising fastest in parts of Britain that were already worst off. It said one in nine residents in Blackpool (11%) are claiming unemployment benefits, up from 7% in March. The number of claims increased most in the north of England and Northern Ireland, and rose the least in the South-east and the east of England.</p> <p>Tony Wilson, director of the thinktank, said the snapshot probably understated the severity of the crisis as it counted claims up until 9 April. \u201cIn reality, unemployment today is likely to already be close to 3 million,\u201d he added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-19T08:07:20/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK unemployment regions\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-19T08:07:20/embed.html\">UK unemployment regions</a> </figure>  <p>Government statisticians said the official jobs market figures were yet to catch up with the economy effectively grinding to a halt, after the launch of the nationwide lockdown on 23 March.</p> <p>Providing a snapshot of the jobs market before Covid-19 struck, the ONS headline unemployment metric fell slightly to 3.9% in the three months to March, marking the lowest level of unemployment since the mid 1970s. The percentage of people in work also reached a joint-record high.</p> <p>However, early estimates suggested the number of hours worked in Britain fell sharply in the last two weeks of March after restrictions came in, with the amount of time spent working plunging to about 25% below normal levels.</p> <p>Jonathan Athow, the deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: \u201cThis is a huge fall, and evidence of employers either putting staff on furlough and/or cutting the hours of those still working.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-19T08:08:03/embed.html\" data-alt=\"UK unemployment age\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-19T08:08:03/embed.html\">UK unemployment age</a> </figure>  <p>He said the sectors with the biggest fall in hours worked were hotels, restaurants and construction, which had recorded the biggest declines in economic activity.

  "<p>As we struggle to stop Covid-19, we\u2019re being hit with a fresh pandemic of unemployment. In April, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits increased by the most since records began to reach <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/uk-jobless-april-coronavirus-crisis-unemployment-benefits\">almost 2.1 million</a>, probably taking us to well over 10% unemployment. It\u2019s now obvious that the UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">coronavirus </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">job </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">retention </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">scheme</a> (CJRS), which subsidises 80% of people\u2019s wages but did not put the necessary duties on employers to prevent them from firing employees, is failing in the one thing it\u2019s meant to do: retain jobs.</p> <p>Job numbers haven\u2019t collapsed in other countries such as Denmark or Germany because they have security and democracy at work, not just wage subsidies. Unemployment in Denmark has <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20180116-focus-denmark-low-unemployment-rate-strict-controls-job-seekers-benefits\">risen to just 4.2%</a>. Unemployment in Germany has risen to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b6ba29e-c90a-4b68-a149-4847415d75ac\">5.8%</a>. It might get worse, but it\u2019s a fraction of the UK\u2019s problem.</p> <p>Unemployment isn\u2019t natural. It\u2019s a legal and social choice. In Germany, workers in companies with more than 20 staff can elect a work council that may veto or delay dismissals and get compensation to internalise the social costs. In companies with more than 2,000 workers, staff can elect half of the supervisory board of directors. The system was restored post-second world war, after Hitler abolished all labour rights. It restarted with a law that the <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Control_Council_Law_No_22_(10_April_1946)_Works_Councils#Articles_IV\">UK and US helped to draft</a>, but we\u2019ve failed to follow it ourselves. In Denmark, workers in companies with more than 35 staff have the right to organise <a href=\"http://www.worker-participation.eu/www.worker-participation.eu/index.php/National-Industrial-Relations/Countries/Denmark/Workplace-Representation\">cooperation committees</a> and workers elect up to one third of the board of directors.</p> <p>Democracy and security at work make enterprise more rational. Directors elected by staff ensure managers think in the long term. In this crisis, short-term thinking isn\u2019t even creating so-called shareholder value, just a sinking spiral of dole queues and shuttered shops.</p> <p>The unemployment pandemic is by far the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-coronavirus-us-unemployment-could-hit-25-warns-fed-chairman-as-japan-enters-recession\">worst in the US</a>, because it has the worst labour rights in the free world. Despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">$2.2</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">tn bailout</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/unemployment-us-data-coronavirus\">36 million people</a> have been fired. This probably means more than 25% unemployment, a crisis worse than the Great Depression. Americans have no self-standing job security rights, except to get 60 days\u2019 warning before mass layoffs. An arbitrary, incompetent or venal boss can say \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all. This is the Donald Trump system of job security. It\u2019s creating a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d depression.</p> <p>But the UK can\u2019t be content with its laws. Yes, employers must give reasonable notice before dismissal. At no time can an employer dismiss an employee in a way that breaches the \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wnx7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=\">duty of mutual respect</a>\u201d, or the contract. After two years of work, employees can only be dismissed for a fair reason, as assessed by an employment tribunal, and have a right to a redundancy payment if the dismissal is for economic reasons.</p> <p>That\u2019s fine, but British workers have no votes at work (outside universities such as Cambridge or Edinburgh), and no voice or veto over dismissals. Many employers evade employment rights by drafting sham contracts, pretending their staff are self-employed. The CJRS, with a <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/launching-an-economic-lifeboat/\">\u00a330-40</a><a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/launching-an-economic-lifeboat/\">bn expected cost</a>, pays 80% of wages to any employee who is furloughed, and it also covers the self-employed. But the scheme came without job security and workplace democracy conditions, <a href=\"https://www.ier.org.uk/comments/ten-things-the-government-can-do-right-now-to-prevent-a-corona-depression/\">as labour law experts called for</a>. So, employers fire staff despite subsidies.</p> <p>A dwindling minority of economic theorists argue we need \u201clabour market flexibility\u201d, saying that rights kill jobs. But there\u2019s no credible evidence for this claim. For instance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \u2013 whose research has influenced the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 thinks employment protection legislation hampers job creation, productivity and investment. But the <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/fmdu9/\">OECD\u2019s analysis</a> is based on breathtaking misunderstandings of employment law. By contrast, the latest credible research shows that job security and workplace democracy decrease unemployment, while <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ilr.12128\">improving productivity</a> and innovation.</p> <p>How can we stop the unemployment pandemic? First, we must change what got us here, and boost workplace security and democracy. In the UK, the secretary of state could amend the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) code that employers must follow before making dismissals. Such amendments could give all staff a voice on dismissals through elected work councils, if unions collectively bargain for them, or if five or more staff request it.</p> <p>We must strengthen our pension laws so that staff representatives, not short-term asset managers, control shareholder votes in companies. Then, to stop irrational layoff decisions being made to begin with, workers need the right to vote for representatives on their board of directors, like they do at Oxford University, BMW or H&amp;M. We already have a <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">democratic </a><a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">society </a><a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">act</a> drafted for the UK, and any US state can pass the workplace democracy and security laws they need without the federal government. States can adapt models such as those that have been proposed by senators Elizabeth Warren, <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/\">Bernie Sanders</a> or Tammy Baldwin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/normal-life-failed-coronavirus-rethink-economy-labour-party\">'Normal' life failed us. The coronavirus crisis gives us the chance to rethink a new economy | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, because so many have already lost their jobs, we need an immediate freeze on dismissals, as France, Italy and Spain have done, and to cancel the dismissals that have taken place since March. The crisis of confidence afflicting business, forcing them to plan for a future of mass unemployment, comes from their fear of collapsing demand. Fear will dissolve with a credible recovery plan.</p> <p>Third, and ultimately, the government has to provide everyone with a job guarantee and a fair income by filling the gaps of our social security system. This is what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/from-the-archive-blog/2018/nov/28/un-adopts-universal-declaration-human-rights-paris-1948\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> requires: universal social security and the right to work for fair pay. From 1944, the UK government, with agreement among Conservatives, Labour and Liberals, maintained full employment for three decades. If we act, we can make the pandemic of unemployment history, and become a stronger, more caring, compassionate society again.</p> <p>\u2022 Ewan McGaughey is a senior lecturer in law at King\u2019s College London</p> <p><br></p>",

Delftware gave way to ordinary earthenwares, in particular those made by the firm of Pountney, which survived in the city until 1969. There were two porcelain factories. The factory owned by Benjamin Lund made imitation or \"soft-paste\" porcelains around 1750; the other, operating in the 1770s on Castle Green, made true \"hard-paste\" porcelain as produced in China.

  "<p>A photograph of a migrant labourer, his face contorted with anguish as he sits on the roadside in Delhi speaking to his wife about their sick baby boy, has come to symbolise the ordeal of India\u2019s daily wage workers; penniless, and unable to get home to their families because of the lockdown.</p> \n<p>Rampukar Pandit, a construction worker in the Indian capital, had heard that his 11-month-old son was seriously unwell. With no public transport to reach his home in Begusarai in Bihar, 1,200 km (745 miles) away, he started walking. He reached Nizamuddin Bridge where, exhausted and hungry, he could go no further.</p> \n<p> Atul Yadav, a photographer with the Press Trust of India, was heading home from work on 11 May when he saw Pandit, 38, sobbing his heart out. Pandit refused his offer of biscuits and water, saying food would \u201cchoke\u201d him because he couldn\u2019t eat while his son was unwell. \u201cHe was so emotional I had to stop shooting. He had been sitting on the road for three days,\u201d said Yadav.</p> \n<p>\u2018We labourers don\u2019t belong to any country,\u201d Pandit told Yadav. \u201cAll I want is to go home and see my son.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later that evening, he reached a nearby police station. He was still waiting for the police to help when a group of well-wishers, having seen Yadav\u2019s tweet about Pandit, arrived in the area and managed to find him at the station.</p> \n<p>By now, he was full of grief. His wife, Bimal Devi, had just called to say their son had died. One of the well-wishers, a woman, paid for and arranged for his train ticket home. \u201cHe wept with gratitude at strangers helping him,\u201d said Yadav.</p> \n<p>Yadav\u2019s photograph illustrates the anguish of millions of migrant labourers in India who are desperate to get home to their families. After waiting in vain for the government to provide them with transport (belatedly some trains are now being laid on for them) they have embarked on astonishing odysseys, from cities all over the country, journeys that have left Indians transfixed and distressed.</p> \n<p>Whether by truck, bicycle, auto-rickshaw or on foot, they have been heading out under their own steam, some making journeys of nearly 1,000 km to reach home. Hunger, thirst, and the scorching heat of the Indian summer are slowing them down. Some have died of exhaustion and sunstroke. Last week a group of 16 who fell asleep on a railway line they had believed was not being used were <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/14-migrant-labourers-crushed-to-death-goods-train-chhattisgarh-aurangabad-maharashtra-1675571-2020-05-08\">killed by a goods train</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf I am to die, I want to die with my parents,\u201d said one young daily wage labourer leaving Indore, a city in Madhya Pradesh.</p> \n<p>An auto-rickshaw driver fleeing Mumbai said: \u201cEven if I starve in the village, I will never come back.

The remarks follow a series of statements in recent weeks minimising the threat of coronavirus.</p> <p>In a video the Tanzanian president once again touted natural remedies for coronavirus, saying these had helped his son.</p> <p>\u201cMy own son, after contracting the virus, closed himself in his room, took a lemon and ginger solution before getting well and is even able to do push-ups,\u201d he said in a video that went viral.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had a number of viral diseases, including Aids and measles.

Charities and social enterprise employers have been told by the government that its plan to close the scheme this autumn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/vulnerable-not-exempt-from-coronavirus-furlough-winding-down-employers-told\">does not exempt vulnerable workers</a>. </p> \n<p>Temporary care workers transmitted Covid-19 between care homes as cases surged, according to an unpublished study by Public Health England. Agency workers \u2013 often employed on zero-hours contracts \u2013 unwittingly spread the infection after being drafted in to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\">replace existing staff who were self-isolating</a> to protect care home residents.

Voice messages obtained by the Guardian confirm the Maltese government\u2019s strategy to use private vessels, directed by its armed forces, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/19/exclusive-12-die-as-malta-uses-private-ships-to-push-migrants-back-to-libya\">return refugees to Libyan detention centres</a>. The woman said her boat was intercepted and those on board taken back to Tripoli where they have been imprisoned. Two migrants died during the interception, three en route to Libya, and seven while they were all adrift in a dinghy. Lawyers and the Alarm Phone hotline for migrants in distress at sea say Malta is breaching international law.

Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the bill\u2019s salary threshold of \u00a325,600 tells people that anyone earning less is unwelcome. \u201cThose who clapped [for carers] on Thursday are only too happy to vote through a bill today that will send a powerful message to those same people \u2013 that they are not considered by this government to be skilled workers.\u201d If it comes into force the bill would repeal EU freedom of movement and introduce a new framework setting out who can come to Britain.

A New York arbitration court ruled the business was worth no more than \u20ac157m and ordered Schulz to make up the difference of \u20ac643m. \u201cThe evidence strongly points to fraud, and there is little in the record to suggest otherwise,\u201d the panel said.

  "<p>Greece may be one of the most written-about countries, so while choosing this list has been a pleasure, there has been agony involved as well. I first went there more than 30 years ago, and it was books that inspired me \u2013 not always novels, and I have cheated a couple of times in my choices here. There is a great deal of excellent non-fiction about Greece \u2013 I would pick out Patrick Leigh Fermor and Henry Miller, though I also wish I could have made more choices by Greek authors, particularly as the past few years have inspired some brilliant writing (check out <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Austerity-Measures-New-Greek-Poetry/dp/0241250625/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DTFLXYRN7SR8&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=austerity+measures+the+new+greek+poetry&amp;qid=1589248729&amp;sprefix=austerity+m%2Caps%2C386&amp;sr=8-1\">Austerity Measures</a> if you like poetry, and there are several novels). However, this is a selection for the English reader \u2013 \u201ca transport to Greece\u201d in troubled times.

I have never stood on the deck of a Greek ferry, watching the islands slip by, without thinking of the magnificent, mercurial character of Odysseus. And the descriptions of Greece! \u201cRosy-fingered dawn\u201d is undeniable. Some people have problems with the \u201cwine-dark sea\u201d, but really, take a good look at the right time. The only problem is picking the best translation. I\u2019m a fan of Lattimore, Fagles and Fitzgerald. I am also very excited to read a new one by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/08/the-odyssey-translated-emily-wilson-review\">Emily Wilson</a>. In fact, I\u2019ve read the same book in several different versions, which must count for something, including a bad attempt at the original Greek.

I read her in my early teens and her \u201chistorical\u201d takes on myth are still a firm favourite. This, and its sequel The Bull from the Sea, are a retelling of the life of Theseus, and the first book has action in the Peloponnese, Crete and Athens \u2013 all places that have played an important part in my life. Renault does not shy away from the difficult aspects residing in these tales. There is dark stuff here, and no real heroes, either.

I\u2019m not 100% behind it, but agree in general. It\u2019s similar to the movie, which looks gorgeous but has off-putting aspects (the lead actor, for example); in the case of the book, it is some of the politically based caricatures of the communist resistance during the second world war. It caused a lot of controversy when it came out and some of my Greek friends won\u2019t go near it. But its evocation of a lost Kefalonia, the still-beautiful island it\u2019s set on, is perfect. Above all, Pelagia is a character that many who know Greece will recognise \u2013 feisty and passionate.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/little-infamies-9780099433521.html\">Little Infamies by Panos Karnezis</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a95c6df3d85fd814fb0e41cf5be6ea8c5de1bce4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a95c6df3d85fd814fb0e41cf5be6ea8c5de1bce4/0_0_416_640/325.jpg\" alt=\"cover of Little Infamies, by Panos Karnezis\" width=\"325\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The location of the unnamed village in Little Infamies is not given, and Karnezis has said it is not necessarily even Greek, although all the names and details point in that direction. I like to imagine it in the Peloponnese, but perhaps only because that\u2019s the region whose villages I know best. A series of interconnecting short stories lays bare the local life, and anyone familiar with this environment will find it <em>deeply</em> familiar. Even the mythological touches make sense \u2013 you\u2019re always half-expecting a centaur to pop up in Greece and engage you in conversation. There are dark secrets beneath the surface of the village, but Karnezis always treats his characters with deep affection.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/10/meg-rossoff-my-family-other-animals-gerald-durrells\">My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecaa6c6a85df1991678f3f5f7f36029757a40893\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecaa6c6a85df1991678f3f5f7f36029757a40893/0_313_5809_3486/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Milo Parker as \u2018Gerry\u2019 Durrell, with Keeley Hawes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milo Parker as \u2018Gerry\u2019 Durrell, with Keeley Hawes in the ITV production of The Durrells.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joss Barratt/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My second cheat, I\u2019m afraid, as this is clearly more of an autobiography, but it does read like a comic novel and much of it contains an element of fiction \u2013 for instance, Larry, or Lawrence (see below), didn\u2019t live in the same house as the others. He also called the book \u201cvery wicked [but] very funny\u201d. As a description of an eccentric, dysfunctional family the book is a blast, making you half grateful and half sorry that your family is not similar; but it\u2019s on this list for its descriptions of Corfu, and specifically the landscape and nature. A friend of mine, who has not read it since childhood, recently summed it up perfectly, \u201cI can still hear the cicadas and see the lizards scuttling over sun-drenched rocks.\u201d</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/03/scienceandnature.nicholaslezard\">Uncle Petros and Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture by Apostolos Doxiadis</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7b0cc4820a4c748e9b4cc38f74583d3ab2a27bfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b0cc4820a4c748e9b4cc38f74583d3ab2a27bfb/0_0_345_538/321.jpg\" alt=\"cover of Uncle Petros and Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture\" width=\"321\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With all this myth and nature roiling around it is good to remind ourselves that the Greeks are also famous for science, maths and logic. Not that this book is without emotion. Uncle Petros is a mathematician laid low by an unsolvable problem, and generally considered a failure. Only his unnamed nephew still thinks he may be redeemable. Don\u2019t be scared off by the maths: this is essentially a study of a human relationship. In between all this we get a superb rendering of a certain facet of Athens, with its old houses and apartments, courtyard gardens and elegant decay.</p> <h2><strong>Freedom and Death by Nikos Kazantzakis</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2235d636287fa227e0771792663a10cf5ded7506\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2235d636287fa227e0771792663a10cf5ded7506/0_0_5256_3154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hills and olive groves in south-west Crete.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hills and olive groves in south-west Crete.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terry Williams/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Crete, particularly its mountains and southern coast, was one of my first loves in Greece, so I have to include a couple of books about the island. I must also include some Kazantzakis. Zorba is too obvious, although I do recommend it, and it (secretly) took its inspiration from the Peloponnese, despite being set in Crete. This brooding tale of Captain Michalis (the original title of the book) takes place during the Turkish occupation, and the fact that the local Turkish bey is his blood brother shows the complications of the time. It all boils up into a properly Shakespearean tragedy while showing the characters\u2019, and the author\u2019s, deep love of their island.</p> <h2><strong>The Dark Labyrinth by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/lawrence-durrell\">Lawrence Durrell</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"129f6558779efb342c1ef25ef505a7a50ae8da06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/129f6558779efb342c1ef25ef505a7a50ae8da06/8_15_585_954/307.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Lawrence Durrell\u2019s The Dark Labyrinth\" width=\"307\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Caves are important in Greece, providing a connection between our world and the hidden one. Herakles and Orpheus both descended to Hades through one, and Theseus\u2019s labyrinth is surely another. I once climbed down a steel ladder into a deep cave in the Cretan mountains. At the bottom was a rather macabre shrine to a local saint, lit only by my feeble torch. I had an absolute panic attack, and blame much of it on this book, an intriguing mix of adventure story, mythology and horror.

It is partly set in the Mani, a rocky and often barren part of the southern mainland where my family lived for several years. It is a starkly beautiful area, dotted with tower house fortifications and small Byzantine chapels, but there is always something lurking in the landscape. Imagine a breeze through olive trees for a moment, and then see what DeLillo does with it: \u201cWind blew across the olive groves, causing a wild tremor, a kind of panic, treetops going silver.\u201d Anyone who has visited this part of the world outside of the somnambulant summer will instantly know this.</p> <h2><strong>Atticus the Storyteller\u2019s 100 Greek Myths by Lucy Coats and Anthony Lewis</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"244e6ea0e59c538b9663df971124675f2beb3472\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/244e6ea0e59c538b9663df971124675f2beb3472/0_0_305_400/305.jpg\" alt=\"cover of atticus the storyteller\u2019s 100 Greek myths\" width=\"305\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is possibly my favourite book on this list, mainly because I have spent many an evening reading it to my kids. The Greek myths can be deeply weird and confusing \u2013 check out the Robert Graves version if you don\u2019t believe me \u2013 but children seem to cope with them much more intuitively than adults. The premise behind this collection is genius. Atticus, a tale teller, sets off from his home in Crete to a festival of stories near Troy, travelling through much of Greece. On the way, in exchange for food, lodging and transportation, he relates the myths that are appropriate to the area, starting with the birth of Zeus and ending with the Trojan war. It\u2019s ostensibly a kids\u2019 book, but I would happily read this to myself, and much of my knowledge of Greek mythology rests on it.</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global cases pass 4.8 million</strong></h2> <p>There are 4,805,005 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a> data. The death toll stands at 318,534. US deaths, the highest worldwide, passed 90,000,<strong> </strong>and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.</p> <h2><strong>Trump threatens to make WHO funding freeze \u2018permanent\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Late on Monday evening, Donald Trump tweeted a letter addressed to World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying that if the WHO \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/global-report-trump-threatens-to-pull-out-of-who-over-failed-response-to-pandemic\">does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days</a>, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership of the organization.\u201d The letter does not detail what the improvements are.</p> <h2><strong>WHO chief promises review of coronavirus response</strong></h2> <p>Before Trump\u2019s letter was released, the World Health Organization said on Monday that an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible . A resolution drafted by the European Union calling for an independent evaluation of the WHO\u2019s performance appeared to have won consensus backing among the WHO\u2019s 194 states. The motion is expected to be voted on on Tuesday.</p> <h2><strong>Trump says he is taking hydroxychloroquine</strong></h2> <p>After US president told reporters at the White House that he has been<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\"> taking hydroxychloroquine</a>, his doctor released a letter confirming that they had discussed the use of the drug and \u201cconcluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.\u201d A White House spokesperson told the New York Times that Trump was prescribed the drug and is taking it. The US Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil cases overtake UK to become third-highest worldwide</strong></h2> <p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil stands at 255,368, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a> figures, making the country the third-worst affected in terms of cases.There are 16,792 officially confirmed deaths in Brazil, which is lower than the UK, Italy, Spain and France.</p> <h2><strong>IMF chief says full economic recovery unlikely in 2021</strong></h2> <p>The global economy will take much longer to recover fully from the shock caused by the new coronavirus than initially expected, the head of the International Monetary Fund said, and she stressed the danger of protectionism. Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the Fund was likely to revise downward its forecast for a 3% contraction in GDP in 2020, but gave no details. That would likely also trigger changes in the Fund\u2019s forecast of a partial recovery of 5.8% in 2021.</p> <h2><strong>Deaths in Australia reach 100</strong></h2> <p>The death toll in Australia has reached 100, following the death of a 93-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with Covid-19.The woman had been a resident at Newmarch House, the aged care home in western Sydney which has been the site of a cluster of cases.</p> <h2><strong>India cases pass 100,000</strong></h2> <p>The number of confirmed cases in India has passed 100,000, currently standing at 100,328 according to Johns Hopkins University figures.The country has recorded 3,156 deaths. The government this week extended a nationwide lockdown to the end of May, but with significantly reduced restrictions, including allowing markets and standalone shops can reopen from Monday, with social distancing measures. Inter and intra-state road travel resumed with the agreement of states, but air travel, both domestic and international is still banned.</p>",

Revenues have doubled at Wayfair, the US furnishings giant.

But there is a payoff. While online retailers have stayed open, the means of disposing of old furniture have all but disappeared. Public waste centres and charity shops have closed their doors, while many \u201cfreecycling\u201d websites and for-sale pages of community forums have suspended trading.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big concern when you think about how much we normally receive,\u201d says Allison Swaine-Hughes, the retail director of the British Heart Foundation (BHF), which took in more than 185,000 sofas alone last year.</p> <p>Across Britain, councils have reported a spike in flytipping, including furniture.

A familiar paradox lies at the heart of a business model that produces \u00a315 bookcases and \u00a32 T-shirts: how can you be sustainable while selling keenly priced products, largely made of natural resources and plastic while at the same time inviting your customers constantly to upgrade them?</p> <p>***</p> <p>Furniture used not to be cheap \u2013 or fast. Old dressers and chests of drawers were heirlooms that we took with us as we moved and grew families. A clash of styles in our living rooms mattered less than it did in our wardrobes.</p> <p>Much of what followed can be traced to a precocious Swedish entrepreneur. Ingvar Kamprad was only 17 when he founded Ikea on his uncle\u2019s kitchen table in 1943. Fountain pens and udder balm were among his first products, but furniture soon came to dominate. Ikea opened its first showroom in a small Swedish village in 1953.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/28/ingvar-kamprad-obituary\">Kamprad, who died in 2018</a>, became a marketing genius, a democratising influence on design and a flatpack billionaire. His business model relied on volume, which kept prices down, and inexorable growth, as well as a safe, contemporary aesthetic that became known as \u201cglobal functional minimalism\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e9e19f7c667cdbf0cbe0ef92f86452ce9b4977f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e9e19f7c667cdbf0cbe0ef92f86452ce9b4977f/0_0_4928_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ikea warehouse experience.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ikea warehouse experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Segre/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet that growth remained steady, for a while. Ikea did not reach Britain until 1987, when its local rivals included MFI. \u201cEven by 1998, when I started working for the company, we had stores in a few countries and most of the production was still in Scandinavia,\u201d says Johan Stenebo, who held senior positions at Ikea for 20 years, including a stint as its environmental director.</p> <p>But Ikea began to look to eastern Europe and Asia for cheap resources and labour. \u201cWe did that to get the prices down and earn profit,\u201d Stenebo says. It worked. Take, as one example, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/29/ingvar-kamprad-top-10-ikea-meatballs-products-rated\">Billy bookcase</a>, an Ikea stalwart now made by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38747485\">robots</a> at a rate of one every three seconds. Since its launch in 1978, its price has come down by about a third.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"284984748f3cb81c173efcb0b51ea30204ceca99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/284984748f3cb81c173efcb0b51ea30204ceca99/671_0_2658_3989/666.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea\u2019s Billy bookcase.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ikea\u2019s Billy bookcase.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ikea</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGet the prices down and you increase sales \u2013 we created that demand, not the consumer,\u201d says Stenebo, who quit Ikea in 2008. Disillusioned with corporate mores, he wrote Ikea: How to Become the World\u2019s Richest Man. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have a problem now with discussions about climate change,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s corporate-driven but we always talk about consumer behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The family dresser, passed down through generations, was a vanishing commodity in this new market, which promoted modern design. We did not need quality furniture like it anyway; the shrinking, transitory flats of generation rent could be furnished at an unthinkably low cost. Today you can buy an Ikea sofa, coffee table, TV bench, double bed and mattress, dining table with four chairs, wardrobe, bookcase and chest of drawers for \u00a3401. How much of it would you take to your next place or bother to sell?</p> <p>The cost to the environment is greater. Cheap furniture is typically made of chipboard \u2013 glue-bound wood chips \u2013 and laminated with plastic. Recycling centres do accept it, <a href=\"https://www.communitywoodrecycling.org.uk/learn-more/waste-wood/\">but </a><a href=\"https://www.communitywoodrecycling.org.uk/learn-more/waste-wood/\">it is complicated and costly to process</a>. Incineration or landfill is often the easier route. A BHF survey of 2,000 first-time buyers and renters last October revealed that one-third of people had thrown away furniture that could have been sold or donated.</p> <p>And that is just the end of the cycle. It might begin with unsustainable or illegal logging, followed by energy-intensive milling and production in giant factories, the use of chemical treatments and plastics, as well as foam stuffing and yards of upholstery with its own supply chain. Then there are the emissions of global shipping.</p> <p>The conservation charity WWF focused on trees in its 2016 report on furniture sold in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/are-you-sitting-comfortably-sustainable-timber-sourcing-and-uk-furniture-industry\">Are </a><a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/are-you-sitting-comfortably-sustainable-timber-sourcing-and-uk-furniture-industry\">You </a><a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/are-you-sitting-comfortably-sustainable-timber-sourcing-and-uk-furniture-industry\">Sitting </a><a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/updates/are-you-sitting-comfortably-sustainable-timber-sourcing-and-uk-furniture-industry\">Comfortably?</a>. It found that 68% of the dozens of retailers it assessed were failing to put in place robust policies for timber sourcing or communicate them to customers.

And that\u2019s probably in a sofa that might sell for \u00a3450.\u201d But when you are selling sofas by the container load, the small additional costs of sustainability add up.</p> <p>***</p> <p>As the world\u2019s top furnisher, Ikea feels the pressure to act. \u201cSustainability is not new for us,\u201d says Malin Nordin, the head of circular development at the chain\u2019s parent company, Inter Ikea Group, which had retail sales of \u20ac41.3bn (\u00a336.6bn) <a href=\"https://preview.thenewsmarket.com/Previews/IKEA/DocumentAssets/551191_v2.pdf\">last year</a>.

At WWF, Young praises Ikea\u2019s commitment in the face of the greatest scrutiny, but not all retailers have the scale or pressure to invest in change. \u201cFor most companies, it\u2019s just not part of their pitch to the customer,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Since 2015, WWF has produced a <a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/timberscorecard\">Timber Scorecard</a>, on which it rates major retailers for their sourcing policies and commitment to achieving sustainable supply chains. Ikea scores highly. Many other brands do not. They include Made. \u201cThey\u2019re under the radar,\u201d Young says of the company. \u201cIt all looks lovely, but they\u2019re failing to take responsibility for their impact on the environment.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson is not familiar with the scorecard. Made\u2019s PR team later point out that the ratings are about the display of information, but they do not provide details of Made\u2019s sourcing policy. \u201cMade is absolutely focused on doing the right thing for its customers, suppliers and partners, and sustainability is a huge focus for our business,\u201d a statement reads.</p> <p>Jackson accepts that Made\u2019s website and marketing lack prominent information about sustainability, not least given the brand\u2019s younger target market. But she says much is happening behind the scenes. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be quick to put out a potentially greenwashing-sounding statement,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want to take our time to do this well.\u201d</p> <p>Made is planning to launch a service for taking away old furniture when new items are delivered, either to be disposed of responsibly or passed to a charity retailer. \u201cOr, in some cases, if it\u2019s our own product, we\u2019ll take it back to reuse or repair it,\u201d Jackson says. Made is also working on a rental scheme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/04/kitchen-for-rent-ikea-to-trial-leasing-of-furniture\">an alternative business model that Ikea has already tested in some markets</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <p>An industry belatedly facing up to its environmental footprint is in experimentation mode. Demand for change is growing. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing a shift in spending towards recycled, sustainable and long-lasting furniture,\u201d says Hamish Mansbridge, the CEO of Heal\u2019s, which has sold furniture from the same London store for more than 200 years. It now sells garden furniture made from recycled ocean plastic and a sofa upholstered in fabric made from yarns salvaged from the fashion industry.</p> <p>Joni Steiner, an architect based in London, is trying to transform office furniture. Rather than relying on a vast factory in China, he co-founded Opendesk in 2012, which largely exists as a library of original designs of minimalist furniture, made in sustainable plywood. Customers, which have included Nike, Google and Greenpeace, pick a design and then get quotes from the platform of workshops, which includes one man in his San Diego garage and a team of eight on a Yorkshire farm. Makers get 71% of the sale price, while Opendesk, which needs to employ only four people, gets 22% (Steiner says this split would traditionally be reversed).</p> <p>Small workshops with their own direct customers are also noticing shifting demands. \u201cThey\u2019re more interested in how things are done, rather than just something that arrives on the doorstep from a factory somewhere,\u201d says Tim Smith, who runs Create Furniture in Tottenham, north London. His customers increasingly request work-in-progress photos and have become more willing to invest in bespoke, handmade cabinetry.</p> <p>Yet Smith acknowledges the seductive economy of faster furniture. It is easy to sell the advantage of a fitted wardrobe (starting price: \u00a31,500). But cabinetry is relatively simple \u2013 it is boxes with doors. To hand-make a family dining table in solid wood, Smith would have to charge upwards of \u00a34,000. \u201cBut then you might as well buy something in a shop that isn\u2019t going to be that different for \u00a3400,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople\u2019s desire to get nicely made stuff that is sustainable only goes so far.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee6a677f7614f704a6c887382bed5cff3b1ec539\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee6a677f7614f704a6c887382bed5cff3b1ec539/0_0_707_473/500.jpg\" alt=\"The 1970s Ikea Impala armchair\" width=\"500\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 70s Impala armchair from Ikea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ikea</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Growing demand for vintage furniture is part of the solution. Sites such as Vinterior and Pamono are matching abandoned heirlooms with new, grateful custodians. Where they have survived, some of Ikea\u2019s older pieces have become desirable. Last year, a Swedish auction house sold a 1972 yellow Ikea Impala armchair that had cost about \u00a330 when new. <a href=\"https://howtospendit.ft.com/house-garden/208287-collecting-how-vintage-ikea-became-hit-for-fans-flat-pack-chic\">It fetched almost \u00a32,000</a>.</p> <p>But, at the same time, big furniture is racing to furnish homes in major emerging markets. In Stockholm, Stenebo cannot see an easy way back for flatpack chipboard, whatever happens in the post-pandemic version of normal. After he wrote his book about Ikea, he decided to swap global retail for local education. He now teaches economics and business at a high school in Stockholm. \u201cWe\u2019ve just done five weeks on corporate pollution and global warming,\u201d he adds. \u201cI used to be part of the problem, but making a mistake is one thing. Correcting it is more important.\u201d</p>",

According to a <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6262/809\">2015 Science magazine study</a>, the Gulf of Maine is heating up faster than 99% of the world\u2019s oceans. This, in addition to proactive conservation efforts implemented over the years, has accounted for the flourishing of the lobster population; lobster are thriving in the slightly warmer waters. But lobstermen know better than to celebrate. All they need to do is look at what happened in the early 2000s in places like Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the Long Island Sound, where once-robust lobster fisheries have become commercially extinct due to the continually warming waters.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have a long time before that happens in Maine,\u201d says Susie Arnold, a marine scientist at Maine\u2019s Island Institute, who works with fishermen to diversify their businesses by including aquaculture, like kelp farming. \u201cBut the changes that are occurring are undeniable.\u201d</p> <p>Those changes aren\u2019t good, but kelp farming has the potential for environmental good. \u201cThe ocean is a sponge for carbon dioxide,\u201d says Nichole Price, senior research scientist and director of the Center for Seafood Solutions at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine. Carbon dioxide is the cause of ocean acidification, one of the myriad stressors responsible for destroying coral reefs and preventing mollusks from building their shells. Price has found evidence that sugar kelp has an especially high capacity for absorbing CO2 and thus lowering the acidity of the surrounding water. Investing in kelp farming now could potentially benefit marine life in the future.</p> <p>\u201cThe Maine coast is almost all lobster now, and it didn\u2019t used to be that way,\u201d says Baines, who has a close-cropped white beard, chiseled cheekbones and hazel eyes so deep-set that it often looks like he\u2019s squinting. \u201cWhen I was a teenager, in summertimes I worked in a lobster boat that went long-lining for ground fish \u2013 cod, haddock, hake \u2013 that were dominant in the Gulf of Maine.\u201d The way Baines says \u201ccod\u201d sounds more like \u201ccaught\u201d, as one might expect of a New Jersey native who spent his childhood summers in Maine and has lived his adult life here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F11e4b618d05331595ee6c5ed874dbe48fcf3c932%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff577b8f212acaac031b433c970e949793253cf55%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Bob Baines details\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F11e4b618d05331595ee6c5ed874dbe48fcf3c932%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff577b8f212acaac031b433c970e949793253cf55%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Bob Baines details</a> <figcaption><strong>Left:</strong> Bob Baines at the helm of the FV Thrasher. <strong>Right:</strong> Heading back to harbor after checking progress of his kelp farm off Spruce Head, Maine.

He is one of the 24 \u201cpartner farmers\u201d working with Atlantic Sea Farms, which was founded in 2009 under the name Ocean Approved as the first commercial seaweed farm and nursery in North America. (Baines\u2019s daughter, Jesse, works for the company.) Atlantic cultivates seeds and gives them to partner farmers, assists with the design and layout of the kelp farms, and coaches farmers throughout the season \u2013 from setting up the farm in the winter to the harvest in spring, complementary to lobster\u2019s summer to fall season. Because Atlantic Sea Farms seeks experienced lobstermen who already have equipment and know-how, start-up costs tend to be lower than those who are beginning from scratch.</p> <p>The farmers grow two types of kelp \u2013 ripply sugar kelp and ribbon-like skinny kelp \u2013 which Atlantic then processes into a line of goods they sell online, to grocery stores, fast-casual chains, meal kit companies such as Daily Harvest, and national restaurants. Kelp grows 3-8lbs per foot of line, which means a farm with 13,000ft, the average size of Atlantic Sea Farms\u2019 partner farmers\u2019 lines, can potentially generate around $20,000 to $57,000 at harvest time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"951a0524dedf0585eb8cf37b40da87f46bfa3f26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/951a0524dedf0585eb8cf37b40da87f46bfa3f26/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baines is among 19 veteran lobstermen along the Maine coast who are applying their hard-earned expertise to kelp farming.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baines is among 19 veteran lobstermen along the Maine coast who are applying their hard-earned expertise to kelp farming.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greta Rybus/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Southport, Maine, an hour down the coast from Baines\u2019 kelp farm, husband and wife Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer are coming up on the end of their latest season growing kelp for Atlantic Sea Farms. This will be their third harvest \u2013 though last year an errant dock tore through their lines, sweeping their entire farm away. \u201cWe were getting ready to harvest,\u201d says Hutchins, 35, wearing a weathered baseball cap, wisps of sandy brown hair poking out from underneath. \u201cThere were 18,000 feet of line, 3 \u00bd to 4lbs of kelp a foot, about 5 to 8ft long \u2013 we would have had 90,000lbs of kelp. We spent three days cleaning it up.\u201d</p> <p>After last year\u2019s debacle, Hutchins babysits the plots regularly to see that the lines haven\u2019t crossed, which would rub the kelp right off, and otherwise make sure that everything is looking right. If all goes well, he is projecting a 48,000lb harvest.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not much of a quitter,\u201d says Hutchins. \u201cWhen Jodi and I met, the price of lobster went down and I was washing windows for $10 an hour.\u201d Hutchins, who comes from a long line of lobstermen, is no stranger to the turbulence of the trade. His family started fishing in Maine in the 1600s; he himself has been lobstering since he was eight, and started in earnest as a 20-year-old, with his father as his sternman. Until a few years ago, Hutchins fished for shrimp during the lobster off-season. He had invested in hundreds of shrimp traps right before the state closed the shrimp fishery in 2014, due to the warming waters. That is when he and Brewer turned to kelp.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to fill the void where we had lost shrimping,\u201d says Brewer, who wears a fleece pullover embroidered with her name, and punctuates her speech with nervous giggles. \u201cThe price of lobster is so volatile anyways,\u201d adds Hutchins. \u201cWhat we have going on right now with the coronavirus and the prices dropping. Normally this is the highest price time of year. I got $10.50 to $11 per lb this time last year. And now we\u2019re at $4, $4.50. So it\u2019s nice for me to have something else to fall back on besides lobstering.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F36c0a461d35debc5cf13104dd34d55cde1ae28c2%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F9a5e8ad02222f6b9bd479ece576f6632df5ab745%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Left: Alex Hutchins, left and Jodi Brewer.

It appears straightforward enough, but creating a three-dimensional rope structure in the ocean is as challenging as you\u2019d think.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re seeding the farm, you\u2019re working out of a skiff, not out of a big lobster boat,\u201d says Baines. \u201cIn a 14ft skiff in choppy waters, you\u2019re bouncing all over the place. When I got home that first day of seeding, I hadn\u2019t been that tired in I don\u2019t know how many years of fishing.\u201d</p> <p>But the effort seems to be paying off. Baines lifts a line out of the water, from where kelp the color of a Budweiser bottle dangles like streamers and offers a sample. The flavor is fresh and vegetal, like underripe peas, and, surprisingly, not salty. No wonder it has gastronomic appeal. Atlantic Sea Farms\u2019 kelp has been championed by the likes of Alice Waters, renowned chef, and made an appearance last March in a salad created by chef David Chang for the fast-casual chain Sweetgreen. At Chaval, a French and Spanish-influenced restaurant in Portland, kelp has found its way into the glass \u2013 dried and powdered, in a salted cocktail rim that tasted like the beach \u2013 and onto the plate \u2013 in an ethereally crisp churro stuffed with lemon cream, where kelp is integrated into the dough and blended into the sugar mixture that is sprinkled on top.</p> <p>Despite the multifold promise of kelp, not everyone is on board with seaweed aquaculture. \u201cKelp farming is so new that for many fishermen, the initial reaction is \u2018I don\u2019t want that around here, that\u2019s where I go lobstering\u2019,\u201d says Baines.</p> <p>At a community hearing last year to review the lease for Baine\u2019s kelp farm, other lobstermen <a href=\"https://knox.villagesoup.com/p/courier-gazette-letters-to-the-editor-oct-10/1835778\">complained</a> that the aquaculture lease would somehow hamper their ability to catch lobster, even though kelp farming occurs from winter to the spring, during lobster\u2019s off-season. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reasonable argument,\u201d says Baines. \u201cOnce they see that my lease didn\u2019t bother anyone or take anything away from them, it will all settle right down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fa6c8c9e8d30a6c900317dd88a25e727599cbe996%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F202b4bc6805818a8aefdff656b50727ec7b8c301%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Lobstering details\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Fa6c8c9e8d30a6c900317dd88a25e727599cbe996%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F202b4bc6805818a8aefdff656b50727ec7b8c301%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Lobstering details</a> <figcaption><strong>Left: </strong>The lobster fishing industry has been impacted by climate change and Covid-19, prompting fishers to consider diversifying their practices include aquaculture. <strong>Right: </strong>Lobster ropes and buoys on the docks at Spruce Head Harbor.

They have plans to move into a larger facility and there is a waitlist of fishermen who want to farm with them. They want to expand their network of partner farmers, which currently numbers 24. But due to the coronavirus outbreak, the waters have become choppy. In late March, Atlantic Sea Farms lost most of their food service clients, which made up about 50% of their accounts. Simultaneously, they saw increased retail and meal kit demand, and a surge in online sales. In the short term, they hope to shift the ratio of their contracts toward retail, with a Wegmans rollout and an expansion into Whole Foods in New England and other regions scheduled for the summer.</p> <p>Bob Baines, Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer, and the rest of the partner farmers received an email in late March from Briana Warner, the chief executive of Atlantic Sea Farms, assuring them that the company is still committed to buying their kelp. \u201cLobster prices dropped dramatically and we are heading into the lobster season very soon, so this kelp income matters more than before,\u201d says Warner. \u201cIt could be a very hard season.\u201d To meet the CDC standards for social distancing, Atlantic Sea Farms will not be bringing in their usual seasonal workers who commute from Massachusetts each day during harvest to process the kelp. Instead, it will be done with a local skeleton crew made up mostly of the company\u2019s management team. \u201cIt hurts but we\u2019ll get through it,\u201d says Warner.</p> <p>As for the farmers, they are happy to have work they can rely on. \u201cThis is the hardest time of year for commercial fishermen,\u201d says Hutchins of the winter-spring season. \u201cAnd this year, not knowing what will happen with the lobster market as a whole, it\u2019s nice to know I have something coming in.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a98ba18be1221c0c09994fbac1d77e979d4d9612\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a98ba18be1221c0c09994fbac1d77e979d4d9612/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fish shack with lobster traps in Cozy Harbor, on Southport Island, Maine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fish shack with lobster traps in Cozy Harbor, on Southport Island, Maine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greta Rybus/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>At the time of writing, it is 77 days since Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, mentioned climate change in his official transcripts. The last mention came at the tail end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2020/feb/11/counting-the-cost-of-australias-summer-of-dread\">Australia\u2019s disastrous Black Summer bushfires</a> when Morrison declared that his government will not be adopting a \u201cnet zero by 2050\u201d target, in favour of a \u201ctechnology roadmap\u201d.</p> <p>Since that moment, the world has changed. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives to a frighteningly infectious new virus. And as countries around the world begin to toy with the thought of recovery, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/the-green-recovery\">there are increasing efforts</a> to ensure our climb out of the hole comes paired with a permanent shift towards a deeper decoupling from our current heavy reliance on fossil fuels.</p> <p>The pandemic is changing us, but not all of us. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/explainer-what-are-the-underlying-causes-of-australias-shocking-bushfire-season\">climate-intensified bushfires tore through Australia</a>, the government\u2019s position on climate remained utterly unchanged, as did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/19/anthony-albanese-backs-adani-coalmine-but-criticises-proposed-collinsville-power-plant\">the opposition party\u2019s support </a>for the large-scale extraction and sale of fossil fuels. The pandemic, and the opportunity that recovery brings for wholesale reimagination of our relationship with energy has landed with a dull, unceremonious thud. It is a stark reminder of what we need to do to bring about true change within one of the planet\u2019s most carbon-intensive countries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/coalition-reveals-new-emissions-reduction-measures-including-paying-polluters-to-stay-under-cap\">Coalition reveals new emissions reduction measures, including paying polluters to stay under cap</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The gold-plated baby spoon</strong></h2> <p>For several months now, Australia\u2019s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, has been insisting on a \u201ctech, not taxes\u201d approach to climate policy. This shuns concepts like net zero targets, and opts instead for the incentivisation of technological advancements (using money acquired through taxation, strangely enough).</p> <p>To help develop this philosophy, Taylor opted to hold a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/coalition-scrambles-for-carbon-cutting-solutions-as-paris-targets-move-further-out-of-reach\">secretive review</a> of the government\u2019s emissions reduction fund (ERF) policy, in which public money is handed to projects that suck carbon out of the air, alongside the establishment of \u201cbaselines\u201d for high emitters. It was helmed by former head of Origin Energy Grant King, who is also former director of Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association Ltd (Appea) and BHP Billiton.</p> <p>The King review puts forward a range of tweaks to the ERF that seem likely to create far more problems than they solve. Historically, baselines have been weak and flexible, meaning<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/25/the-emissions-reduction-fund-was-deeply-flawed-and-no-rebranding-will-change-this\"> large emitters simply chug along as normal without consequence</a>. The new policy proposals include the prospect of tradable rewards for those that have emissions well underneath their baselines. But if those baselines are set ludicrously high already, this might simply become a conduit for taxpayer funding for high emitters.</p> <p>The prioritisation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which stores emissions before they are released into the atmosphere, is where things go from potentially problematic to verifiably disastrous. The review suggests two major agencies \u2013 the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena, a former employer of mine) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) \u2013 change their remit so they can fund CCS (normally excluded due to the fact it is not zero emissions). This is in addition to opening up the ERF for potentially funding CCS projects too.</p> <p>\u201cTechnology neutral\u201d is the plea here, but this phrase has always been an infuriating euphemism for \u201ccan we just ignore emissions, please?\u201d The King review and Taylor\u2019s response to it are not neutral: these are active efforts to shift focus away from cheap, effective emissions reductions and towards expensive, ineffective emissions reductions.</p> <p>Carbon capture and storage is the preferred vehicle for perpetual climate delay. It is an<a href=\"https://www.tai.org.au/content/money-nothing\"> eternal</a><a href=\"https://www.tai.org.au/content/sunk-costs-carbon-capture-and-storage-will-miss-every-target-set-it\"> gravity well</a> for public money with nearly nothing to show for it. To invest heavily in this instead of working towards fully decarbonising electricity and transport is like eating a crab with a gold-plated baby spoon, and then shrugging with feigned surprise as you stab pointlessly at the shell.</p> <p><a href=\"https://energy.utexas.edu/news/nuclear-and-wind-power-estimated-have-lowest-levelized-co2-emissions\">CCS is not \u201clow emissions\u201d</a>. Those insufficient emissions reductions <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1259034213166338049\">come at an incredible cost</a>, even when emissions reductions from wind and solar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1262319352386400261\">are becoming ludicrously cheap</a>. \u201cThe only way CCS on coal will ever be built at scale is with a carbon price so high it\u2019d kill the rest of the coal sector,\u201d<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/16/itd-be-wonderful-if-the-claims-made-about-carbon-capture-were-true\"> wrote energy expert Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court</a>.<strong> </strong></p> <p>The prospects for CCS are so dire that Australia\u2019s coal lobby, the Minerals Council of Australia, ended up taking the funds it set aside for CCS research (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/08/bhp-faces-fresh-calls-to-quit-minerals-council-ahead-of-pro-coal-ad-blitz\">Coal21</a>\u201d) and redirected them to an advertising campaign for coal.</p> <p>CCS may have some niche applications, but to be put forward as the main show for climate action is a clear plan for intentional failure. To be funding it instead of integrating new wind and solar and leaving fossil fuel fuels in the ground is to loudly declare an intent to delay climate action as long as possible.</p> <h2><strong>This has been happening for a long time</strong></h2> <p>As I wrote<a href=\"https://ketanjoshi.co/2020/03/01/the-tech-not-taxes-song-has-been-playing-for-decades/\"> here</a>, this has been happening for a while. Leaked notes from a 2004 government meeting with the fossil fuel industry declare that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[The prime minister] advised that he had interest in government and companies addressing the issues together in the establishment of a low emissions energy fund. This would be focused on accelerating Super Dooper (his words) technology progress aimed at significantly reducing emissions.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/coalition-scrambles-for-carbon-cutting-solutions-as-paris-targets-move-further-out-of-reach\">Coalition quietly appoints expert panel to salvage emissions policy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fossil fuels industry was wringing its hands about the effectiveness of wind and solar and urging the blocking of any policy supporting them, while pleading for cash injections for CCS. In fact, John Howard\u2019s original clean energy target scheme, put forward in 2007, included CCS <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KetanJ0/status/1234234205527101440\">in its subsidy remit</a>.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to be writing this article again in 2034. As this debate about technology and recovery plays out, the government will no doubt reactivate its dog-eared, well-worn lines about strong climate action being toxic for the economy and jobs. There is a simple way to break this infinite loop of industry sabotage and government malfeasance, and to shatter the tactic of using ineffective technology as a conduit for eternal inaction.</p> <p>Climate action that brings both immediate benefits and long-term benefits is the key, here. We know, with confidence, which technologies are duds, and which are likely to serve as the workhorses of climate action. But the pandemic is highlighting that broader factors like justice, equity and fairness are on our minds, at a time of stress and economic pressure.</p> <p>We know that <a href=\"https://ketanjoshi.co/2020/02/20/good-news-you-get-to-say-the-word-costings-eight-thousand-times-for-an-entire-years/\">climate action is beneficial for human life</a> even when you exclude the impacts of reduced emissions on the Earth\u2019s atmospheric and ocean systems. The air is cleaner, the power is cheaper and more democratised, the transport is more accessible, and business and investment work better.</p> <p>Good climate action won\u2019t happen until the infinite loop is broken. We know that we can\u2019t wait for the next crisis \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/19/victoria-should-expect-one-or-two-more-megafires-before-end-of-decade-study-finds\">and there will be many</a>, in the coming years \u2013 to snap those locked into inaction out of their stupor.

The commerce ministry said the dumping and subsidies \u201ccaused material injury\u201d to China\u2019s domestic barley industry.</p> <p>But Birmingham said it was \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d for the Chinese government to list measures such as Murray-Darling Basin infrastructure upgrades as a type of subsidy to barley exporters, when the bulk of the barley production involved dry-land farming.</p> <p>Birmingham said it was \u201cvery disappointing that China has, to date, refused to schedule minister-to-minister discussions\u201d as this would be the best way to resolve disagreements.</p> <p>He said Australia would \u201creserve our rights\u201d when it came to having the dispute resolved through the WTO, although he noted \u201cthere may be other paths that we choose to pursue first\u201d.</p> <p>Littleproud said \u201cwild speculation\u201d that the push for a Covid-19 inquiry could have been behind China\u2019s decision on barley tariffs was \u201cdangerous\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no trade war,\u201d Littleproud said.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone needs to take a deep breath, take a cold shower and understand that we produce the best food and fibre in the world and that we\u2019ll be able to send our barley and other produce into other markets if our producers wish to do so.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/17/australian-trade-minister-says-risk-of-trade-with-china-may-drive-businesses-to-other-markets\">Australian trade minister says 'risk' of trade with China may drive businesses to other markets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, </p> <p>called on the government to seek clarity from the US about the American agriculture sector\u2019s increased access to China \u201cand whether that has disadvantaged Australia\u201d.</p> <p>China announced last week it would immediately allow barley imports from the US, which was seen as a measure to meet commitments in the first phase of a trade deal with Donald Trump.</p> <p>The National Farmers\u2019 Federation said it was \u201cfrustrated and deeply concerned\u201d with Beijing\u2019s decision on tariffs and called on the government to pursue the issue through the WTO \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d.</p> <p>The federation\u2019s chief executive, Tony Mahar, said China was Australia\u2019s largest barley market, taking almost half of its crop \u2013 worth about $917m \u2013 each year.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a massive blow to Australian grain growers, who are right now nearing the end of their winter planting,\u201d he said.</p>",

Earlier this month the Ai Group called for the two biggest economic challenges in memory \u2013 recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/australian-businesses-call-for-climate-crisis-and-virus-economic-recovery-to-be-tackled-together\">to be addressed together</a>, saying it would boost growth and put the country on a firm long-term footing.</p> <p>Every Australian state has signed up to net zero emissions by 2050, and these commitments are expressed either as targets or aspirational goals.</p> <p>But asked on Tuesday whether net zero by 2050 was the federal government\u2019s policy, Taylor said: \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur approach is not to have a target without a plan,\u201d Taylor told the ABC. He said technology improvements would drive significant reductions in emissions \u201cand we\u2019d love to be able to achieve net zero by 2050, but ultimately that will depend on the pathways of technology to deliver that without damaging the economy\u201d.</p> <p>The King review has recommended new approaches to reducing pollution including paying big emitters to keep their emissions below an agreed limit, and allowing businesses to bid for funding from the government\u2019s climate policy \u2013 the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund \u2013 for projects that capture emissions and either use them or store them underground.</p> <p>The King review proposal to pay emitters to remain below their baseline looks like a voluntary carbon trading mechanism.

  "<p>The World Health Organization will establish an independent and impartial inquiry into the source and handling of the coronavirus outbreak, once the pandemic is brought under control, a virtual meeting of its annual governing body was set to agree on Tuesday.</p> <p>The proposed inquiry, mirroring previous WHO-led inquiries such as the one following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola outbreak</a> in west Africa, arguably stops short of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">fully independent inquiry</a> sought by Australia and the US, but represents a compromise brokered by a powerful alliance led by the European Union and India.</p> <p>The WHO-led inquiry set out in a resolution being put to the UN World Health Assembly on Monday, and negotiated over the past week, is probably less independent and less directed at China\u2019s role in informing the WHO than some critics of China wanted.</p> <p>But the likely terms of reference will give scope to examine China\u2019s cooperation with the WHO and the powers the organisation possesses to demand greater cooperation from member states.</p> <p>The compromise came after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the assembly he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/china-facing-pressure-over-covid-19-and-taiwan-at-world-health-assembly\">supported a comprehensive evaluation</a>, including into the sources and transmission routes of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cChina supports a comprehensive evaluation of the global response to the epidemic after the global epidemic is under control, to sum up experiences and remedy deficiencies,\u201d said Xi. \u201cThis work needs a scientific and professional attitude, and needs to be led by the WHO, and the principles of objectivity and fairness need to be upheld.\u201d</p> <p>He insisted that China had been transparent and open throughout, acting quickly to share information about the disease with the WHO, but said the world needed to be able to respond more quickly in future.</p> <p>Xi also pledged $2bn in financial support over the next two years to help deal with Covid-19, especially in developing countries. China will also make any self-developed Covid-19 vaccines a \u201cpublic good\u201d to help with the efforts to curb the pandemic, he said.</p> <p>Calling the pandemic \u201cthe most serious global public health emergency since the end of the second world war\u201d, Xi said: \u201cAll along we have acted with openness and transparency and responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>He repeatedly directed his remarks to Africa, highlighting how much his country was doing to help the continent develop its health systems and break the shackles of debt.</p> <p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he would set up the independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment, adding that it would look into the responsibility of all actors in good faith. The greatest failing, he said, would be not to seek to learn lessons. Short-term amnesia plagued the world\u2019s approach to global health, he said.</p> <p>Previous WHO inquiries into past pandemics have been hard-hitting, but have tended to shy away from criticising individual countries\u2019 performances, preferring instead to propose structural reforms. The WHO has for years debated the degree of autonomy nation states are allowed in terms of cooperating with WHO advice or recommendations. There is, however, a clear duty to keep the WHO promptly informed of potential pandemics.</p> <p>Any inquiry is unlikely to report before the US presidential election in November, so giving Donald Trump and China latitude to continue to publicise conspiracy theories about the source of the virus.</p> <p>Tedros had invited both Xi and Trump to take part in a virtual summit, but Trump did not respond.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea was to bring the two superpower leaders together in solidarity to fight the pandemic, and to do so at this historic world health assembly, as well as to try to create a sort of rapprochement in the increasing \u2018cold war\u2019 between China and America,\u201d said a source familiar with the invitation.</p> <p>Asked about his lack of response, Trump said at a White House event: \u201cI chose not to make a statement today. I\u2019ll be giving them a statement, sometime in the near future, but ... I think they [the WHO] have done a very sad job in the last period of time.\u201d</p> <p>The US was isolated in its hostility to the WHO, with even its closest ally, Australia, joining the chorus of support for the organisation\u2019s central role in overseeing the global response to the pandemic and calls to end the \u201chit and miss\u201d funding of the UN body. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/world-health-organization-why-has-trump-suspended-funding\">suspended all payments</a> to the WHO pending a review into its alleged \u201cChina-centric leadership\u201d and ineffectiveness. His aides have been discussing continuing to make a minimal payment so in part to retain influence over any inquiry. Trump said on Monday he would make a decision about WHO funding soon.</p> <p>The US health secretary, Alex Azar, told the assembly that the virus had spun out of control due to the WHO failings.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a failure by this organization to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives,\u201d he claimed.</p> <p>Without naming China, Azar added: \u201cIn an apparent attempt to conceal this outbreak, at least one member state made a mockery of their transparency obligations, with tremendous costs for the entire world.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw that WHO failed at its core mission of information sharing and transparency when member states do not act in good faith. This cannot ever happen again.\u201d</p> <p>In a hard-hitting speech, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said recent weeks had seen many expressions of international solidarity, but very little practical action. \u201cWe are all paying the price for implementing contradictory strategies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He warned the disease had spread across the world, and was now heading for developing countries where he predicted it would be even more devastating.</p> <p>He said the WHO was irreplaceable and needed enhanced support, arguing: \u201cWe are as strong as the weakest health system.\u201d</p> <p>An inquiry to look back fully into how everyone reacted, he said, should wait until we have turned the page. \u201cNow is not the time,\u201d he insisted, arguing: \u201cNow is the time for unity. We stand together, or we fail.\u201d</p> <p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the only priority worth talking about was ending the disease. The time demanded \u201cfreedom from complacency and unfounded accusations\u201d, a remark that could be directed at Washington\u2019s repeated claim that China may have deliberately spread the virus in the west.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, threw her support behind the WHO, saying everyone needed to look at the sustainability of its financing.</p>",

Now, under the modified criteria announced Monday, in which counties have to show a rate of 8% positive tests over seven days and a hospitalization rate below 5%, Newsom believes that 53 of the state\u2019s 58 counties could move deeper into phase two if their public health officials so desired. </p> \n  <p>He reiterated again that the decision was up to each individual county. \u201cJust because we are creating the capacity and the availability to move into phase two doesn\u2019t mean every county is ready,\u201d he said. \u201cLA county, as an example, I imagine, will be cautious in that respect.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In California, there have been a total of 78,839 positive cases and 3,261 deaths.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T23:32:03.474Z\">at 12.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec304d68f0886ce4f5d6046\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T22:06:20.864Z\">11.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>During the event with restaurant executives, Trump also addressed the investigation into the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. </strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cHere\u2019s a man that is supposed to be negotiating war and peace with major, major countries with weaponry like the world has never seen before,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cAnd the Democrats and the fake news media, they are interested in a man who is walking their dog.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump fired the state department\u2019s inspector general, Steve Linick, on Friday.
