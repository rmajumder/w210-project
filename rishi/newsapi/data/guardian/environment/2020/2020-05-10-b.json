  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> is culpable in the deaths of thousands of Americans by using the coronavirus pandemic to boost his electoral prospects and line the pockets of big business, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/noamchomsky\">Prof Noam Chomsky</a> has said.</p> \n<p>In an interview with the Guardian, the radical intellectual argued the US president was stabbing average Americans in the back while pretending to be the country\u2019s saviour during the worst health crisis in at least a century.</p> \n<p>He said Trump, who will seek re-election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">later this year</a>, had cut government funding for healthcare and research into infectious disease for the benefit of wealthy corporations.</p> \n<p>Chomsky said: \u201cThat\u2019s something that Trump has been doing every year of his term, cutting it back more. So [his plan is] let\u2019s continue to cut it back, let\u2019s continue to make sure that the population is as vulnerable as we can make it, that it can suffer as much as possible, but will of course increase profits for his primary constituents in wealth and corporate power.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chomsky also said the president had abandoned his duties by forcing individual state governors to take <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/trump-versus-the-governors\">responsibility for combating the virus</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s a great strategy for killing a lot of people and improving his electoral politics.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked to clarify if he viewed Trump as culpable in the deaths of Americans, he said: \u201cYes but it\u2019s much worse than that, because the same is true internationally. To try and cover up his criminal attacks against the American people, which have been going on all of this time, he\u2019s flailing about to try and find scapegoats.\u201d</p> \n<p>The professor said Trump\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">freeze payments to the World Health Organization</a>, would lead to deaths in Yemen and across the African continent. </p> \n<p>Chomsky was speaking in an interview to mark the launch of the <a href=\"https://progressive.international/\">Progressive International</a>, a global initiative to unite, organise and mobilise progressive forces around the world.</p> \n<p>First convened by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a>, the Vermont senator, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/yanis-varoufakis\">Yanis Varoufakis</a>, the former Greek finance minister, it aims to mount a fightback against the increasing rise of rightwing populist movements around the globe.</p> \n<p>Other members include Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, the Icelandic prime minister, former Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the authors Naomi Klein and Arundhati Roy, and Rafael Correa, the former president of Ecuador. In September, pandemic permitting, the council will convene for an inaugural summit in Reykjavik.</p> \n<p>Also speaking in an interview to mark the launch, Varoufakis said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/future-of-the-international-left\">articles he and Sanders wrote in the Guardian</a> two years ago were among catalysts for launching the Progressive International.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cIt\u2019s been urgent for quite a while now. If anything I\u2019m worried that we\u2019re coming to the party too late. I hope not..\u201d</p> \n<p>Expressing anger at the EU response to the pandemic as a \u201cvery sad dereliction of duty\u201d, he said the crisis could tear apart the euro single currency bloc. \u201cI don\u2019t think the eurozone can survive it. But it can survive long enough to deplete huge amounts of wealth and social capital. Europe is rich enough, it can pretend and extend.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>EU leaders have agreed to draw up a \u20ac540bn (\u00a3480bn) package of emergency measures.

That\u2019s one way. The other way is to try to dismantle the structures, the institutional structures that have been created; that have led to very ugly consequences for much of the population of much of the world, [and] are the source of this pandemic. To dismantle them and move on to a better world.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy. There are forces fighting back. The International is going to be facing similar attacks. To overcome them, it depends on the peasants with the pitchforks.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A Malaysian company that won a permit to clear tropical rainforest on Manus Island has been accused of failing to deliver on its promises to the local community, while reaping millions of dollars in profits from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/30/bulk-of-timber-exports-from-papua-new-guinea-wont-pass-legal-test\">logging of valuable hardwood timber</a>.</p> <p>According to licensing documents, the company, Maxland Ltd, secured a permit to clear land in the south of Papua New Guinea\u2019s Manus Island in order to plant between three and five million rubber trees as part of the Pohowa Project. The project\u2019s stated aim in documents was to \u201cbenefit smallholder rubber farmers [and] the surrounding communities\u201d.</p> <p>However, according to a new report produced by Global Witness, two years into the five-year contract, not a single rubber tree had been planted, but there was evidence that valuable hardwood timber had been felled by the company and was being exported.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/30/bulk-of-timber-exports-from-papua-new-guinea-wont-pass-legal-test\">Bulk of timber exports from Papua New Guinea won\u2019t pass legal test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Global Witness visited the project site in October 2019 they found that no rubber seedlings had been planted. However, Global Witness did observe a few thousand rubber seedlings on the far side of Manus Island.</p> <p>The report cites emails from Josephine Kenni, the head of Papua New Guinea\u2019s National Rubber Board, who said that since Global Witness\u2019s visit some of the few thousand seedlings had been planted and 60,000 more were expected to arrive from Malaysia by late May 2020.</p> <p>But a local villager, Eddie Kalai, contacted by Global Witness after Kenni\u2019s email was received, reported that no rubber had yet been planted at the project site.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact none have been planted is a pretty serious failing on the company\u2019s part,\u201d said Lela Stanley, forest investigator for Global Witness. \u201cThey are more than a million seedlings behind at this point and there\u2019s no indication that they\u2019re catching up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat we see instead is very significant logging,\u201d said Stanley.</p> <p>The Global Witness report cited \u201cextensive infrastructure [that] has arisen to support Maxland\u2019s logging operations\u201d, including a wharf so barges can transport logs to cargo vessels, a large logging camp \u201cwith housing for staff and its own garage and petrol station to serve the company\u2019s fleet of trucks\u201d, as well as evidence of logging, including \u201cskidding tracks \u2026 left by logs hauled from the forest\u201d.</p> <p>The report estimated that more than 18,000 cubic metres of timber had been cleared, valued at 6.36m kina (AU$2.8m).

  "<p>The immediate future of British horse racing remained murky after Boris Johnson\u2019s address to the nation on Sunday evening, when hopes that the Prime Minister might offer an encouraging word or two proved unfounded. Professional sport went unmentioned, leaving racing insiders and enthusiasts to cross their fingers that Monday will bring clarity.</p> \n<p>Oddly, the speech was seen in a positive light by at least one person betting on when horse racing will resume. The Betfair market, which asks whether there will be racing in the UK on or before 1 June, saw a lot of interest in \u201cYes\u201d in the moments after Johnson spoke, its odds dropping to 4-5 after being 5-2 earlier on Sunday.</p> \n<p>The trainers Fergal O\u2019Brien and Richard Hughes, tweeting in light-hearted mode, suggested there might be some good news for racing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FOBRacing/status/1259547779191406597\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s definitely fair to say that jockeys can\u2019t work from home <br><br>Should allow for progression of the plan to get racing behind closed doors back on</p>\u2014 Fergal O\u2019Brien Racing (@FOBRacing) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FOBRacing/status/1259547779191406597?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 10, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RHughesracing/status/1259556686001561607\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019m sure racing is outdoor and if people are in a safe environment I can\u2019t see why we can\u2019t start racing .

The wearing of masks will be compulsory for all those present including the jockeys, who must keep their masks in place during races, a measure that has not been insisted upon for recent racing in Hong Kong and Australia.</p> \n<p>Racing professionals have been told there will be only one point of entry and exit at each track, and they must sign in on arrival, at which point their temperature will be checked. Owners and breeders will not be allowed to be present. Trainers can attend along with one member of staff per runner to attend to the horse, and the names of those stable staff must be notified to the course the previous day.

The grandstand steps can be used for viewing but can be accessed only from the front.</p> \n<p>Jockeys will not be permitted to take showers or use the sauna and, like all other attendees, will be told to maintain a distance of 1.5m from each other, though obviously that will not apply during the races when the riders will inevitably be more closely bunched at times.</p> \n<h2>Monday\u2019s best bets</h2> \n<p>An astonishing 70mm of rain fell on Paris on Saturday, leaving the Longchamp ground described as very soft, with a penetrometer reading of 4.1, the same as for Arc day.

If Social Security and Medicare taxes aren\u2019t taken out of paychecks, workers and businesses would take home a little more money with each paycheck. The idea is that workers benefiting from the cut would spend more money, which could help curb a recession.

Instead of a road map, Johnson gave the nation a \u201csketch of a roadmap\u201d. Instead of a way ahead, he provided only a \u201csense of a way ahead\u201d. Instead of strong government leadership, the onus was on individuals to do the right thing and experts to provide the necessary data and technology.</p> \n  <p>The UK will be changed by this experience, the prime minister told us, but he provided no vision of the future, merely a list of comparative adjectives \u2013 stronger, better, more resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, more generous, more sharing.</p> \n  <p>Many of these ambitions could imply action on the longer-term problems facing the country and the world, such as the climate crisis. Or they could mean nothing at all. There were no details of anything new and positive that could emerge from the colossal suffering of the pandemic as the NHS and United Nations emerged from the ruins of the second world war. There was no mention either of a green new deal, which other nations plan to use as a vehicle for economic recovery. Nor were there details of how air quality improvements could be maintained, though many city mayors in the UK are already working on this.</p> \n  <p>Johnson encouraged more cycling, walking and a continuation of working from home, but when that was not possible, he urged people to drive rather than to use public transport. This is sensible given the need for physical distancing on trains and buses, but it added to the overall impression of a prime minister reacting to necessity rather than getting ahead of problems, pre-empting risks and forging a path illuminated by the \u201clight of science\u201d.</p> \n  <p>There should be more details about the future direction of the economy in the coming days, when Johnson addresses parliament, or when the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unveils stimulus plans. If the prime minister is serious about the nation returning to \u201crobust health\u201d, the science is clear that climate, nature and air quality must be part of the recovery.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T20:28:01.620Z\">at 9.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb860498f08c0a2409bb384\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T20:17:02.565Z\">9.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">PM's message telling workers to return to factories is 'recipe for chaos', says TUC</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Frances O\u2019Grady,</strong> the TUC general secretary, has described Boris Johnson\u2019s speech as \u201ca recipe for chaos\u201d because safety measures for a return to work are not in place.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FrancesOGrady/status/1259551752443002880\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lots of working people will feel confused and anxious after listening to Boris Johnson.<br> <br>Govt still hasn\u2019t published guidance on how workers will be kept safe.

This was the second time he\u2019s done it during this crisis. But tonight\u2019s event had an unhappy prequel, with No 10 having to damp down expectations created by newspaper headlines suggesting he would be promising lockdown \u201cfreedom\u201d, and he was further constrained tonight by the fact that much of the detail of what he is planning won\u2019t come until he presents his document to parliament tomorrow.</p> \n  <p>Still, it was a major speech. Here is a five-point analysis.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson offered a highly-conditional timetable for moving out of the most stringent aspects of lockdown while also stressing that most current restrictions need to remain in place</strong>. In terms of announcements that were genuinely new (in the sense that they had not been widely pre-briefed), what was most significant was what he said about what might happen in June and July. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In step two \u2013 at the earliest by June 1 \u2013 after half term \u2013 we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6.</p> \n   <p>Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.</p> \n   <p>And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Johnson also stressed that these dates were \u201cdependent on a series of big ifs\u201d and, compared to other lockdown plans, this timetable was remarkably cursory. The Irish government, for example, has published a<a href=\"https://www.gov.ie/en/news/58bc8b-taoiseach-announces-roadmap-for-reopening-society-and-business-and-u/\"> \u201croadmap for reopening society and business\u201d</a> that proposes a five-phase easing of restrictions, with specific measures planned of five specific dates going up to 10 August. According to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-lockdown-to-last-three-more-weeks-62z2brv36\">a report in the Times last week (paywall)</a>, Johnson was under pressure from \u201cdatists\u201d in cabinet to give dates for when certain measures would be relaxed. On the basis of this speech, the \u201cdatists\u201d secured only to the bare minimum.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has actually toughened the lockdown much more than he has eased it.</strong> The most significant change to the status quo came when he confirmed reports that people arriving in the UK by air will be subject to quarantine. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb844428f0858b1a81077d5#block-5eb844428f0858b1a81077d5\"> 7.14pm.)</a> That is a remarkable shift, particularly for someone who gave a speech earlier this year saying he wanted to resist pressure for barriers to go up. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb825b88f08c0a2409bb1ed#block-5eb825b88f08c0a2409bb1ed\">6.30pm.) </a>Johnson also said that he would increase the fines for the small number of people who break social distancing rules. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb843788f08c0a2409bb2c4#block-5eb843788f08c0a2409bb2c4\">7.11pm.)</a> This will be an England-only measure, and it appears to go against the advice of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. As was revealed this afternoon (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb81fc28f0858b1a81076e3#block-5eb81fc28f0858b1a81076e3\">4.56pm)</a>, in response to a proposal in April for greater penalties on lockdown offenders, Sage said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The \u201ccareful\u201d steps to ease the lockdown this week announced as new measures in practice amounted to little more than saying that sunbathing is allowed, in England. </strong>Johnson said two things would be happening this week. First, people would be encouraged to go to work if they cannot work from home. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But for most of the last seven weeks the government\u2019s line has been that people should go to work if they can\u2019t work from home. When the government first announced the lockdown it put out guidance saying \u201call non-essential premises must now close\u201d, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-pmqs-boris-johnson-parliament-to-close-early-for-easter-recess?page=with:block-5e7b2d368f0878a2a48a9c24#block-5e7b2d368f0878a2a48a9c24\">this line was swiftly removed from the document</a> because it was not the message the government wanted to give out. And ministers infuriated Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, by refusing to back his call for all construction work to halt.</p> \n  <p>Second, Johnson said that from Wednesday people would be able to take more exercise. Referring to England, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.</p> \n   <p>You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, unlike in Scotland and Wales, in England the lockdown restrictions never said that people could only go out once a day for exercise (even though ministers sometimes said people should exercise just once a day). And<a href=\"https://www.college.police.uk/What-we-do/COVID-19/Documents/What-constitutes-a-reasonable-excuse.pdf\"> official police guidance (pdf)</a> said people could drive to another destination to exercise. All that really seems to be new is that people can sunbath (not something that previously seemed to count as a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to be out under the regulations).</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson announce a new five-step covid alert system that will be used to help decide when lockdown measures can be lifted.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb8428b8f08c0a2409bb2bf#block-5eb8428b8f08c0a2409bb2bf\">7.07pm.)</a> This seems very similar to an approach announced by Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, <a href=\"https://sacoronavirus.co.za/2020/04/23/statement-by-president-cyril-ramaphosa-on-south-africas-response-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-union-buildings-tshwane/\">in a speech last month.</a> Here is the South African system.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34859ebafb21d0757953e05469b99aa5b649e1db\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34859ebafb21d0757953e05469b99aa5b649e1db/0_0_1498_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Africa\u2019s coronavirus alert system - similar to the one announced by Boris Johnson tonight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"821\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa\u2019s coronavirus alert system - similar to the one announced by Boris Johnson tonight</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South African government</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But Johnson did not explain which lockdown measures will apply for which alert level.

Over the last three months (like most politicians, and even many scientists), he has had to drastically revise his assessment of the threat it poses and what needs to be done. </p> \n  <p>Here are nine quotes that show how much his stance has changed.</p> \n  <p><strong>1 Johnson says he won\u2019t let coronavirus push him towards protectionism.</strong> One of his first public references to coronavirus came in a speech devoted to Britain\u2019s post-Brexit future <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">at Greenwich on 3 February</a>, when he said he would not let coronavirus push him towards protectionism.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And in that context, we are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric, when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage, then at that moment humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion, of the right of the populations of the earth to buy and sell freely among each other.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is somewhat hard to square with the news that Johnson is now planning to impose quarantine on new arrivals to the UK, although this is a public health policy, not a trade policy.</p> \n  <p><strong>2 Johnson avoids being alarmist as he publishes the government\u2019s first coronavirus action plan.</strong> The document was published on 3 March, when Johnson attended a press conference with Sir Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/03/labour-facing-one-of-worst-local-election-performances-in-recent-history-leaked-party-report-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5e5e51bc8f086a28115b6b7b#block-5e5e51bc8f086a28115b6b7b\">Johnson stressed that most people had no need to fear the illness.</a> He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we have already seen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>3 Johnson calls for a balanced approach.</strong> Two days later, on 5 March, Johnson told ITV\u2019s This Morning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/05/chief-medical-officer-chris-whitty-questioned-by-mps-live-news?page=with:block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17#block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17\">at that point it should be \u201cbusiness as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d.</a> He also said the government was going for a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the theories is perhaps you could take it in on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease to move through the population without really taking as many draconian measures. I think we need to strike a balance.</p> \n   <p>I think it would be better if we take all the measures that we can now just to stop the peak of the disease being as difficult for the NHS as it might. I think there are things we may be able to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In fact no one in the UK was saying the government should just \u201ctake it on the chin\u201d, but at that point government advisers were telling ministers that if they tried to suppress coronavirus completely, they would just risk a worse second peak later in the herd. A more balanced approach would allow \u201cherd immunity\u201d to develop, they argued.</p> \n  <p><strong>4 Johnson changes tone, and warns that \u201cmany more\u201d people will die.</strong><em> </em>At another Downing Street press conference, on 12 March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630#block-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630\">he said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This was also the moment when Johnson said<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a75358f087df56e4c7796#block-5e6a75358f087df56e4c7796\"> the government was no longer trying to \u201ccontain\u201d coronavirus</a> and had instead moved to the stage where it was focusing on \u201cdelay\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>5 Johnson tells people to stay at home if possible.</strong> With the crisis intensifying, at the first of what No 10 said would be daily press conferences, Johnson announced on 16 March what amounted to a soft lockdown. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/16/boris-johnson-press-conference-coronavirus-live-firms-could-soon-be-allowed-to-run-reduced-services-because-of-coronavirus-shapps-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1#block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1\">He said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need people to start working from home where they possibly can.

It is a meeting note, dated 1 April, prepared for a Sage meeting on 2 April.</p> \n  <p>The newly released material is everything from point 3, starting with the headline: \u201cSpecific comments about new suggestions for improving adherence within the Framework (27 March)\u201d. It shows Sage rejected three proposals to toughen the lockdown.</p> \n  <p>Here is the key extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The framework proposes four new suggestions for increasing adherence, numbered as options 17 to 20 that SPI-B have not commented on before. These focus on: 17) increasing the financial penalties imposed; 18) introducing self-validation for movements; 19) reducing exercise and/or shopping; 20) reducing non-home working. We have reservations about options 17 to 19. </p> \n   <p>First, we are unclear what the evidence base is that the targeted behaviours are a substantial contribution to disease transmission, particularly given the high adherence rates currently observed in the community. Is there evidence, for example, that exercise conducted more than 1km away from the house leads to higher rates of transmission than exercise conducted within 1km of the house? Indeed, for this option, there is a risk that reducing the ability of people to apply some flexibility in choosing where to exercise will increase risk by preventing people from spreading out in nearby open space. Tightening restrictions without clear epidemiological need may lose support among people who have been attempting to adhere.</p> \n   <p>Second, the implicit assumption underlying options 17 to 19 is that people lack motivation to adhere to current guidance. This may apply to some specific subgroups (the example of young men has been given), but broadly the current levels of adherence we are witnessing suggest this is not the issue. </p> \n   <p>Third, there are equity issues within options 17 to 19. Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households, while the assumption that printing and completing paperwork is straightforward for all households can also be challenged. The assumption underlying restrictions on shopping frequency is that people can afford to buy in larger quantities. The risk of tension arising as the police are required to start penalising those who are not adhering should also be factored into considerations. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T16:39:16.216Z\">at 5.39pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb81d178f08c0a2409bb1ac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T15:31:22.583Z\">4.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Earlier <strong>Arlene Foster,</strong> the first minister of Northern Ireland, said that, along with the Scottish and Welsh governments, the Northern Ireland executives would be keeping the \u201cstay at home\u201d message.

The previous message to \u2018stay home\u2019 was at least clear. What does \u2018stay alert\u2019 mean? It will just be confusing, be open to misinterpretation and likely to increase risky behaviour. That means taking risks that will affect everyone and increase infections.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University, said: \u201cFor these revisions [to government strategy] to be successful, we need consistent communications from the government, and the new \u2018stay alert\u2019 messaging is ambiguous and lacks clarity.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Sir Simon Wessely, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the problem with \u201cstay alert\u201d was that \u201cit\u2019s hard to be clear what that means, as opposed to \u2018stay inside\u2019\u201d.</p> \n<p>Having seen photos and video showing a lack of physical distancing at VE Day street parties on Friday \u2013 including a conga line \u2013 and in parks over the weekend, intensive care doctors shared concerns on social media that more people would end up in hospital with coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Dr David Hepburn, an intensive care consultant in Wales, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/apnoeaboy/status/1259147225688571905\">tweeted</a>: \u201cJust watched the conga lines/street parties on the news.

It will be difficult to police anything other than large groups if freedom of movement is increased. What does that mean to people? It will be ignored. 90% ish doing the right thing at present. That will reduce dramatically over the coming weeks.\u201d</p> \n<p>Senior police sources believe significant parts of their role in enforcing the lockdown are effectively over, other than policing large groups. \u201cImpossible,\u201d said one senior source. </p>",
  "<p>It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom \u2013 your freedom \u2013 of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war. And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly. You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing. Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it\u2019s the only way to defeat the coronavirus \u2013 the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime.</p> \n<p>And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense, and though we grieve for all those we have lost, it is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst-case scenario was half a million fatalities. And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down. And thanks to you we have protected our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> and saved many thousands of lives.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And so I know \u2013 you know \u2013 that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike.</p> \n<p>We must stay alert. We must continue to control the virus and save lives. And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life. We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants.</p> \n<p>And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. To their futures and the futures of their children.</p> \n<p>So I want to provide tonight \u2013 for you \u2013 the shape of a plan to address both fears. Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society. A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed. I will be setting out more details in parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening.</p> \n<p>I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK. And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates, and though it is right to be flexible in our response, I believe that as prime minister of the United Kingdom \u2013 Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland \u2013 there is a strong resolve to defeat this together. And today a general consensus on what we could do. And I stress \u201ccould\u201d. Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan. And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>We must protect our NHS.</p></li> \n <li><p>We must see sustained falls in the death rate.</p></li> \n <li><p>We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection.</p></li> \n <li><p>We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people<br>who need it, and yes, it is a global problem, but we must fix it.</p></li> \n <li><p>And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease \u2013 the R \u2013 back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid alert system run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.</p> \n<p>And that Covid alert level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that Covid alert level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures \u2013 the lower the level, the fewer the measures; the higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.</p> \n<p>There will be five alert levels. Level one means the disease is no longer present in the UK and level five is the most critical \u2013 the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>Over the period of the lockdown, we have been in level four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to level three.</p> \n<p>And as we go, everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down. By staying alert and following the rules. And to keep pushing the number of infections down, there are two more things we must do.</p> \n<p>We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done.</p> \n<p>And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts. So that \u2013 all told \u2013 we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day.</p> \n<p>We have made fast progress on testing, but there is so much more to do now, and we can.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>When this began, we hadn\u2019t seen this disease before, and we didn\u2019t fully understand its effects. With every day we are getting more and more data. We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes, because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups \u2013 in your area \u2013 as well as giving us a national picture.</p> \n<p>And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below one. And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given, we have by no means fulfilled all of them.</p> \n<p>And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures.</p> \n<p>And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week.</p> \n<p>We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.</p> \n<p>And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible \u2013 because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited. So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can\u2019t work from home. And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces Covid-secure. And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following Covid-secure standards.</p> \n<p>And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports, but only with members of your own household.</p> \n<p>You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them.</p> \n<p>And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further.</p> \n<p>In step two \u2013 at the earliest by June 1 \u2013 after half term \u2013 we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, year 1 and year 6. Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.</p> \n<p>And step three \u2013 at the earliest by July \u2013 and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice: if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to reopen at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.</p> \n<p>Throughout this period of the next two months, we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity. We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health.</p> \n<p>And I must stress again that all of this is conditional \u2013 it all depends on a series of big ifs. It depends on all of us \u2013 the entire country \u2013 to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.</p> \n<p>And to prevent reinfection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time \u2013 with transmission significantly lower \u2013 to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air. And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/calendar-zip/giv-39022o1EibiZSseO\" data-alt=\"Calendar\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/calendar-zip/giv-39022o1EibiZSseO\">Calendar</a> \n</figure> \n<p><br>And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally, and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes.</p> \n<p>We have been through the initial peak, but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous. We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need. But in the end this is a plan that everyone must make work. And when I look at what you have done already \u2013 the patience and common sense you have shown; the fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can; the incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS staff, our care workers; the devotion and self-sacrifice of all those in every walk of life who are helping us to beat this disease \u2013 police, bus drivers, train drivers, pharmacists, supermarket workers, road hauliers, bin collectors, cleaners, security guards, postal workers, our teachers and a thousand more; the scientists who are working round the clock to find a vaccine; when I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country, and that have helped to get us through this first phase, I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next. </p> \n<p>And if we can\u2019t do it by those dates, and if the alert level won\u2019t allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right.</p> \n<p>We will come back from this devilish illness. We will come back to health, and robust health. And though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before.

Much more needs to be done \u2013 not simply when it comes to investment and infrastructure but attitudes, too. Dr Rachel Aldred has calculated that per hour spent cycling, cyclists in England are around four times more likely to be killed than in the Netherlands. No wonder many potential converts feel afraid. It doesn\u2019t help when many bike journeys involve at least one close encounter of the four-wheeled kind. Or when influential groups, such as the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, attack cycling campaigners wanting safer roads as the \u201cIsis of London\u201d.</p> <p>However <a href=\"https://adamtranter.com/\">Coventry\u2019s bicycle mayor, Adam Tranter</a>, is cautiously optimistic. \u201cIt is clear that it has come from the top, with Johnson and his transport adviser Andrew Gilligan leading it,\u201d he says. \u201cThat said, the government\u2019s own analysis shows that to meet their goals of doubling cycling and walking they will need \u00a36bn.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f80bc21234b0e336bffc49d005a17f7a0d768061\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f80bc21234b0e336bffc49d005a17f7a0d768061/0_169_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The government is to give \u00a3250m for extra cycle lanes as the UK prepares for the lifting of lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The government is to give \u00a3250m for extra cycle lanes as the UK prepares for the lifting of lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tranter says the long-term goal must be for bikes to be seen as just another normal form of transport \u2013 so the quarter of journeys made by cars in Britain that are under one mile comes down significantly. \u201cBritain\u2019s cycling revolution will be created by people of all backgrounds and sizes, in jeans and a T-shirt, and at about 9mph.

Not only does it enhance mental and physical health but, as the US surgeon general made clear in a 278-page report published in the 1990s, exercise is also a vital component in preventive medicine \u2013 especially when it comes to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and colon cancer.</p> <p>Perhaps a new academic paper, Covid-19: A tocsin to our ageing, unfit, corpulent, and immunodeficient society, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254620300600?dgcid=raven_sd_aip_email\">by the scientist David C Nieman</a>, might focus minds. Nieman, who helped to establish that regular moderate exercise lowers upper respiratory tract infection rates while improving immunosurveillance, makes the point that reducing the risk for Covid-19 for communities and individuals shouldn\u2019t only involve what we know already \u2013 physical distancing, washing hands and covering faces \u2013 but \u201cregular moderate-intensity physical activity\u201d, too.</p> <p>In his article, published in the Journal of Sport and Health Science, Nieman points out that regular aerobic exercise \u201csimilar to 30\u201360min of near-daily brisk walking improves overall surveillance against pathogens by stimulating the ongoing exchange of important types of white blood cells between the circulation and tissues\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile epidemiological and randomised clinical trials \u201csupport a 40%\u201345% reduction in illness days stemming from acute respiratory infections in younger and older adults who engage in near-daily aerobic activity compared to sedentary behavior\u201d.</p> <p>Regular exercise also guards against obesity, which as Nieman makes clear \u201cmarkedly increases the risk for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three of the most important underlying conditions for Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>In the past decade governments of all stripes have been reluctant to talk about the dangers of inactivity. Those on the left are perhaps worried they could be accused of fat shaming; those on the right of nanny-statism. There is no hiding from the truth \u2013 a few years ago a study in the Lancet put the global death toll from inactive lifestyles at around 5.3 million people a year, about the same as from tobacco.</p> <p>Yet the science is crystal clear: exercising for 30 minutes every day is a far better way to help the NHS than clapping for two minutes every Thursday.</p> <p>Meanwhile last week Johnson suggested this \u201cshould be a new golden age for cycling\u201d.

ignored.\u201d</p> <p>Reinforcing the warning about the plight of jobseekers, Labor\u2019s spokesperson for families and social services, Linda Burney, said on Sunday the government should release any modelling on the potential economic shock generated from allowing <a

the next.</p> <p>The report argues rapid budget repair would be \u201cmisguided\u201d and there is a need to accept a further period of higher deficits, in part to fund more infrastructure spending.</p> <p>It is understood the government sees the next federal budget \u2013 delayed until October \u2013 as a chance to unveil a raft of \u201cpro-investment policies\u201d to grow the economy, amid calls from some business groups for corporate tax cuts and a more flexible workplace relations system.</p> <p>But Albanese will call for a focus on inclusive economic growth where the benefits are shared, together with an industrial relations system that promotes co-operation, productivity improvements and shared benefits.</p> <p>He will also say policy makers need to look at increasing opportunities for people to gain secure employment, \u201cespecially for the next generation of younger workers who nowadays have little idea of the meaning of reliable income or holiday pay\u201d.</p> <p>More generally, Albanese describes the post-Covid-19 debate as a \u201conce-in-a-century opportunity to renew and revitalise the federation\u201d and a \u201conce-in-a-generation chance to reshape our economy so it works for people and deepens the meaning of a fair go\u201d.</p> <p>He will tentatively weigh into the emerging debate over the balance between free trade and building up domestic capacities.</p> <p>He says Australia must continue to trade, but the pandemic is a reminder of the need to secure critical supply chains in the face of global shocks.</p> <p>While the downturn was triggered by a disease, he argues, it could just as easily have been sparked by a trade war, cyber attack or military standoff, adding that the \u201cmad scramble for items as simple as personal protective equipment for our frontline medical staff\u201d should be a wakeup call.</p> <p>Albanese says the death of the Australian car manufacturing industry on the Coalition\u2019s watch had led to a withdrawal of private capital from research and development, the depletion of critical skills, and the destruction of the viability of smaller manufacturers further down the supply chain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

During a normal season, with matches coming thick and fast, Redmond feels that footballers are implicitly forbidden from showing themselves in such a light. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to post a TikTok video if you\u2019ve lost 1-0 at the weekend,\u201d Redmond says. \u201cThat whole week, you have to be silent, show the outside world you are knuckling down.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7bd5078494b7749931040a6ba5c151810bd58f85\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bd5078494b7749931040a6ba5c151810bd58f85/0_63_3771_2263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Redmond: \u2018It\u2019s a good thing that footballers are getting to show their personality in whatever form on social media.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Redmond: \u2018It\u2019s a good thing that footballers are getting to show their personality in whatever form on social media.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A feature of lockdown has been that footballers have let people in a little more.

People liked the Rush Hour one so the next one I stick out might be along those same lines.\u201d</p> \n<p>Redmond is engaging company, his energy and empathy transmitting via Zoom from his house in Winchester. He is back there now, thinking about a potential return to training, having spent six weeks at the family home in Birmingham with his mum, Michelle, 18-year-old brother Niall, and Tiah.</p> \n<p>It has been an abnormal time and not only because Redmond has spent some of it rehabbing remotely with the Southampton physios after the thigh muscle tear sustained in early February. It was the same rare injury \u2013 a problem with the rectus femoris in his thigh\u2013 that his teammate Moussa Djenepo sustained last September. Djenepo was out for seven weeks and Redmond was looking at a similar period.</p> \n<p>But the time in Birmingham was also beautiful, one to appreciate the simpler things, particularly the importance of his family, with whom he is extremely tight.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7f6afd9a-197a-4e4e-8684-f2579a62813d\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first time in ages I\u2019ve been able to spend a long time in my house with them and just enjoy the laughs.

He is a thinker who gives detailed, considered answers and is keenly aware of his social responsibility, how he can use his status as a footballer to help others. That much is clear when he talks about the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/356600769\">trip he made to Ghana</a> this time last year, an experience that moved him profoundly.</p> \n<p>Redmond has been a Right To Play ambassador since 2017, a staunch supporter of the international charity that seeks to protect and educate children in the most vulnerable of situations. He wanted to meet some, to learn how the charity is improving their lives.

It is time to acknowledge our collective failure to respond to climate change, identify its consequences and accept the massive personal, local, national and global adaptation that awaits us all.<br><strong>Dr Wolfgang Knorr</strong> <em>Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science, Lund University,</em> <strong>Prof Eric Rignot</strong> <em>University of California, Irvine,</em> <strong>Prof Rik Leemans</strong> <em>Wageningen University and Research,</em> <strong>Prof Andy Morse</strong> <em>School of Environmental Sciences, University of Liverpool,</em> <strong>Prof Dennis Baldocchi</strong> <em>Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, University of California, Berkeley,</em> <strong>Prof Thomas Hickler</strong> <em>Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre,</em> <strong>Prof Francis E Putz</strong> <em>Department of Biology, University of Florida,</em> <strong>Prof Maarten Krol</strong> <em>Wageningen University,</em> <strong>Dr Alberte Bondeau</strong> <em>Institut M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en de Biodiversit\u00e9 et d\u2019Ecologie, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9</em>, <em>CNRS,</em> <strong>Prof Wolfgang Cramer</strong> <em>Institut M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en de Biodiversit\u00e9 et d\u2019Ecologie, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, CNRS,</em> <strong>Prof Paul Palmer</strong> <em>University of Edinburgh,</em> <strong>Dr James G Dyke</strong> <em>Global Systems Institute, University of Exeter</em></p> <p>\u2022 Oxford University\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/green-stimulus-can-repair-global-economy-and-climate-study-says\" title=\"\">call for a green stimulus</a> for the economy and Polly Toynbee\u2019s demand for a dramatically fairer reversal of the impact of \u201cwealth on health\u201d could both be addressed by a nationwide Green New Deal programme (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/poverty-kills-people-coronavirus-life-expectancy-britain\" title=\"\">Poverty kills people: after coronavirus we can no longer ignore it</a>, 5 May).</p> <p>This would allow a way out of the economic collapse caused by coronavirus, while rebuilding our social infrastructure and tackling the climate emergency.

  "<p>Of all of the strange side effects of the pandemic, I suppose the craft boom was inevitable.

During a particularly potent spell of unemployment in my early 20s, I took to making little people out of tampons. It started when, unable to sleep one night, I gathered up all the \u201ccrafting\u201d materials I could find in my room (some felt tips and a box of Tampax) and turned five tampons into the Velvet Underground &amp; Nico. This was, it should be said, in the wake of the twee-core explosion of the late 2000s, when doing this sort of thing was considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/16/why-the-manic-pixie-dream-girl-must-never-return\">Zooey Deschanel-esque</a>, and therefore good.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My 'painting' looks like something a nursery school teacher would think twice about before sticking up on the classroom wall</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Until now, this was my last memorable episode of adult crafting. As a mild dyspraxic, I\u2019ve never been particularly good at anything involving fine motor skills. My movements are both frantic and indecisive, like a ham descending a staircase. The idea of me sitting down to embroider is about as reasonable as the idea of Donald Trump sitting down to read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/15/infinite-jest-at-20-still-a-challenge-still-brilliant-emma-lee-moss\">Infinite Jest</a>. But here I am holding something called an embroidery hoop. Having watched the same YouTube instructional video three times, I\u2019ve managed to fit said hoop with a piece of fabric bearing an intricate floral template.</p> <p>On opening up my embroidery kit (which, by the way, had a photo of a child on the packaging) I was nearly overcome by panic. The different coloured threads hung next to one another, on the same piece of card. There was a weird clippy tool I\u2019d never seen before. And one brief look at the instructions told me they\u2019d been run (possibly from Mandarin, going by some Chinese characters on the packaging) through Google translate, which only served to exacerbate my confusion. If it weren\u2019t for the glut of calming \u201chow to\u201d videos on embroidery (many of which have been uploaded over the past few weeks) I would\u2019ve been tempted to dump the entire kit in the bin and put the ordeal behind me before it had even started.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90ded4d022c433d7da4503e6d6631bd67e8129f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90ded4d022c433d7da4503e6d6631bd67e8129f6/15_0_5337_3204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eleanor Margolis not enjoying crafts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018After 10 minutes I\u2019m desperate to scroll Twitter, check the news and go back to my usual routine of watching back-to-back Simpsons episodes\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonore Schick/Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Admittedly, the first stitch I sew is quite satisfying. I use some of the green thread to make a start on a flower stem, and am frankly awed by my own ability. But before long, it dawns on me just how slow this process is: it has taken me about 15 minutes to do an inch of stem and one tiny leaf. My mind wanders. I\u2019m bored. Had I been born hundreds of years ago, I think to myself, this is probably what I would\u2019ve done (as a lesbian) to avoid contact with my rank, toothless, clap-infested husband. I would\u2019ve sat embroidering poorly by candlelight, thinking impure thoughts about wenches. Maybe this is why lesbians are so into crafting: it\u2019s a throwback to the days when they channelled all the sadness of forbidden desire into quietly subversive needlework.</p> <p>But having decided embroidery is emphatically not for me, I move onto modelling clay. Dyspraxic or not, I loved this stuff as a kid, and have warm memories of making animals, vegetables and minerals<strong> </strong>that inevitably fell apart in the oven. I roll out some balls and make colourful, abstract models. The polymer clay is satisfying to mould and play with, especially for someone given to nervous fidgeting. But after about 10 minutes, my hands feel dried out and achy, and I\u2019m desperate to scroll Twitter, check the news and go back to my usual soothing activity of watching back-to-back Simpsons episodes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/04/a-good-yarn-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-spawns-arts-and-craft-renaissance\">A good yarn: UK coronavirus lockdown spawns arts and craft renaissance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But I will myself to try one last craft.

I stand up and look at my war zone of a table, strewn with paint, loose pieces of thread and multicoloured clay crumbs. I can\u2019t deal with this right now, I think to myself. I\u2019m too stressed.

According to the report the PM has been warned of having \u201cvery little room to manoeuvre\u201d by his top scientific advisors and told Britain could suffer more than 100,000 deaths by the end of the year if ministers relax the lockdown too far and too fast, the paper reports a scientific adviser telling the government last night.</p> <h2><strong>New infections on rise in Germany</strong></h2> <p>New coronavirus infections are accelerating again in Germany just days after its leaders loosened social restrictions, raising concerns that the pandemic could once again slip out of control. The Robert Koch Institute for disease control said in a daily bulletin the number of people each sick person now infects \u2013 known as the reproduction rate, or R \u2013 had risen to 1.1. \u200b</p> <h2>France reports new cluster hours before lockdown ends</h2> <p>Hours before France ends its strict seven-week coronavirus lockdown on Monday, a worrying new Covid-19 cluster has been reported in the Dordogne. The outbreak has been traced back to the funeral of a 51-year-old man in the small village of L\u2019Eglise-Neuve-de-Vergt \u2013 population 500 \u2013 south of P\u00e9rigueux. The man did not die of Covid-19.</p> <h2><strong>Bars closed in South Korean capital</strong></h2> <p>Seoul, the South Korean capital, has closed bars and clubs over fears of a second virus wave, after more than two dozen cases were linked to a 29-year-old man who tested positive after spending time at five clubs and bars in Itaewon last weekend.</p> <h2><strong>Three White House taskforce members self-quarantine</strong></h2> <p>Three members of the White House coronavirus taskforce, including Dr Anthony Fauci, placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19.</p> <h2><strong>Sweden apologises for failing to protect older people</strong></h2> <p>\u201cWe failed to protect our elderly. That\u2019s really serious, and a failure for society as a whole.\u201d Sweden\u2019s government has apologised for not protecting older people, with 90% of the country\u2019s Covid-19 deaths occurring in the over-70s.</p> <h2><strong>Japan sees rise in bullying of sick people</strong></h2> <p>There has been an onslaught of bullying and discrimination against the sick, their families and health workers in Japan, with the PM labelling such behaviour \u201cshameful\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Musk says he may quit California</strong></h2> <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has threatened to pull his factory and headquarters out of California, saying health authorities have gone overboard in their corona protection measures, which do not allow Tesla to open.</p>",
  "<p>The number of jobless people in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">rose by more than 20 million in April</a>, something deemed worthy of a mention in the \u201cand in other news\u201d slot on the BBC\u2019s evening TV bulletin.</p> <p>Sure, it was the 75th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ve-day\">VE day</a> and there were socially distanced street parties to cover and archive footage of crowds gathered in front of Buckingham Palace to treasure.</p> <p>But hang on a minute. In the past, literary careers have been built on the sort of employment catastrophe that has just befallen the world\u2019s biggest economy. It is worth recalling that the war commemorated last week had its roots in Germany\u2019s 6-million long dole queues in the early 1930s.</p> <p>It matters a lot that the official US unemployment rate rose by more than 10 percentage points to 14.7% in a single month, that the real level of joblessness is actually around 25% and is likely to reach 30% before it peaks.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The April rise in unemployment was bigger than anything seen during the collapse of the US economy during the Great Depression, an economic tragedy that took several years to unfold. Inevitable once the decision was taken to shut down businesses in order to stop the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-\">Covid-19</a> virus from spreading, layoffs are hitting the poorest workers hardest. An employee in the bottom 20% of earners was four times as likely to lose their job last month as someone in the highest earning 20%.</p> <p>As in the UK, shuttering businesses across the country is proving easier to do than reopening them. The number of airline passengers currently stands at 7% of last year\u2019s level; in the states where restaurants have reopened for business the number of customers is around 10% of its pre-pandemic levels. The number of weekly jobless claims has come down from its peak but is still running at more than 3 million.</p> <p>All of which suggests that unemployment is going to stay high for some time. The chances of the jobless rate being below 10% by the time Donald Trump stands for re-election in November look remote.</p> <p>Unemployment \u2013 and the risk of being made unemployed \u2013 makes people miserable. There has been plenty of speculation in the past couple of months about whether the lockdown has been good for levels of wellbeing, but the survey evidence and the economic literature suggests it has not.</p> <p>Here in the UK, the Office for National Statistics said the levels of people reporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/04/half-of-british-adults-felt-anxious-about-covid-19-lockdown\">high levels of anxiety</a> more than doubled when the economy went into hibernation at the end of March. More than half the adult population \u2013 25 million people \u2013 said they were worried about their health, the security of their job or having enough money to get by.</p> <p>A separate coronavirus study from the Mental Health Foundation found that 34% of UK adults surveyed and in full-time work were concerned about losing their jobs; 20% of unemployed people surveyed said they had suicidal thoughts and feelings within the last two weeks; and 11% of unemployed people who have experienced stress during the pandemic said nothing had helped them to cope with the worry and anxiety.</p> <p>There may well be people who are sailing through the lockdown untroubled, but they probably don\u2019t include those who have lost their jobs, think they might be laid off once the government\u2019s furlough scheme comes to an end, or feel responsible as the owner of a small business for the livelihoods of others. Not for them the luxury of working from home on full pay or retirement on an indexed-linked final salary pension.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, it is reasonable to expect similar levels of stress and despair to be prevalent on the other side of the Atlantic, where the welfare state is not known for its generosity. Indeed, the work of economists such as <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w14318.pdf\">Danny Blanchflower</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2234639?seq=1\">Andrew Oswald</a> has highlighted how higher unemployment is the economic variable most strikingly linked to rising unhappiness, and the longer the spell of unemployment the greater the cost to personal wellbeing.</p> <p>Academic interest in the impact of unemployment on physical and mental health picked up in the 1980s, when deep scars were left by workers enduring long spells of joblessness and in some cases losing touch with the labour market altogether.</p> <p>A priority, therefore, is to prevent temporary layoffs becoming permanent, because that is the path to more poverty, more ill-health, more crime, more relationship breakups and more social alienation. Hence the current heightened interest in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/risk-dole-queue-future-young-people-after-covid-19-crisis\">job guarantee schemes for the young</a> and universal basic income for all to supplement strong doses of economic stimulus.</p> <p>The textbook free-market solution to unemployment is that workers can always price themselves back into a job by being willing to take a pay cut. Fortunately, no government in the world believes this nonsense, and the story of the past couple of months has been frantic attempts to prevent a health emergency from morphing into an employment emergency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain\u2019s furlough scheme has been one response to this incipient crisis, but there has also been a response in the US, where Trump, keen not to become the new Herbert Hoover, has adopted a three-pronged approach. Firstly, the administration has provided an extra $600 (\u00a3474) a week in unemployment benefits until the end of July. Secondly, the president has pushed for a reopening of the economy on the grounds that the cure for Covid-19 should not be worse than the disease itself. Finally, he has sought to blame China for America\u2019s problems, because this a lot easier than blaming himself.</p> <p>What does that mean? It means the US has mass unemployment, an explosion of unhappiness, and a sabre-rattling populist leader willing to do anything to hold on to his job. Now, in other news \u2026</p>",
  "<p>In 1933, the year of the Nazi takeover, the French writer Julien Benda wrote his Discourse to the European Nation,<em> </em>urging Europeans to come together around their shared universalist values and against the rising monsters of nationalism. As Europe marched towards the murder of its soul and its people, many dared to dream the impossible.</p> <p>Benda was not alone. The Ventotene manifesto, one of the founding texts of European federalism, was drafted in 1941. And it was against the background of a continent in ruins that Churchill spoke of a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d in 1946. The rebirth of Europe would have been unthinkable if the flame of European unity had not been kept alive throughout the continent\u2019s darkest hour.</p> <p>While the challenge posed by Covid-19 has been compared to a war, we are thankfully very far from the murderous scenario of those years. And yet, the current crisis is drawing Europeans further apart and not closer together. Animosities and divisions grow \u2013 whether that is between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/24/western-liberalism-failed-post-communist-eastern-europe\">east and the west</a> on democracy and the rule of law, or between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-could-be-final-straw-for-eu-european-experts-warn\">north and the south</a> on economic solidarity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Spaniards must not look at the threat of unemployment with any greater fear than the Dutch</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Europe was thought to advance through crises. Emergencies, so the argument went, would allow visionary politicians to overcome national resistance and bring the continent towards the \u201cever closer union\u201d dreamed by its founders. But Europe has now been enmeshed in more than a decade of financial, political and humanitarian crises, and the result is constant and ever more worrisome disintegration.</p> <p>The collapse of the European Union has been predicted for years. But Europe does not need to collapse to die. Europe dies when it just shrugs its shoulders at nation-first politics. Disintegration is not a single event, but rather a process marked by diminishing bonds, gradual loss of faith, and renationalisation of politics. Europe may end not with a bang but a whimper.</p> <p>Fellow citizens: our national elites have failed us, and we must rescue the ideal of a united Europe from them. On 9 May, Europe Day, the European Union was planning on launching its Conference on the Future of Europe and opening a new chapter in the history of integration, following Brexit. These plans have now been <a href=\"https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/future-europe-conference-limbo\">delayed</a>. And this may be just as well. The conference was structured to be yet another spectacle of top-down chatter without vision or ambition.</p> <p>We call on you, on us all, to take the lead and keep the flame alive in these times of crisis. In place of another insignificant institutional conference, we call for the establishment of a European Citizens\u2019 Congress on the Future of Europe, forming the basis of a modern constituent assembly. Such a congress would be a hybrid structure: falling somewhere between a social movement, a political actor and a deliberative platform, providing a rallying point for all those wishing to resist the path of disintegration.</p> <p>It was similar congresses that decreed the enfranchisement of millions in South Africa and India over the last century. We, disenfranchised citizens of Europe, must now dare to demand and organise for the impossible: a European republic where all citizens are equal, independent of national affiliation. Where there is no question of some receiving generous aid and having access to exceptional healthcare, and others being left in misery and with overflowing hospitals.</p> <p>Can there be such a thing as a European republic of equals, in such a diverse continent? Indeed, what defines a nation? A nation is neither ethnicity nor language, neither culture nor identity. A nation is a law that establishes a group of equals boasting common rights. It is, as the French sociologist Marcel Mauss wrote a century ago, a group that is collectively aware of its economic and social interdependence and that decides to transform this interdependence into collective control over the state and the economic system.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t this exactly the juncture where Europe stands today? Are we prepared, as citizens of Europe, to take the necessary step towards such institutionalisation of solidarity, so that a Bulgarian and a Finn, a German and an Italian enjoy the same social protections, benefit from the same economic support and pay the same taxes? Are we willing to create, for the first time in history, a new democracy on a par with the global challenges banging on our doors? Are we ready to do so despite, and when necessary against, our own national governments?</p> <p>We need one European social security number, a common European welfare that guarantees human dignity and security independent of nationality. Spaniards must not look at the threat of unemployment with any greater fear than the Dutch. Greeks must not look at the prospect of hospitalisation with any greater worry than a German. Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9 and fraternit\u00e9, not security, was the motto of the French revolution, which is the cultural and political heritage of all Europeans!</p> <p>We need an impressive programme of ecological and economic transformation. We cannot let some countries drown in debt and let our union be mistaken for a committee of loan sharks while our environment collapses. Just as Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal allowed for the creation of modern federal institutions in the United States, a real <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">European Green Deal</a> boasting significant federal resources would at once address the economic slump caused by Covid-19, alter our toxic production model and create the institutions for a genuine economic union.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/06/coronavirus-threatens-future-eurozone-brussels-economic-social-divisions-pandemic\">Coronavirus threatens future of eurozone, Brussels warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We need a modernised common tax system for our companies as well as for us as European citizens. Modern European nations were built by centralising the power of taxation from the feudal regime. The opposite process is under way today, with European states played against each other by multinational corporations dodging paying their fair share. A common European tax on large assets, a redistribution of the profits of automation, and a common tax on the profits of multinationals would build a new, broad-based taxation from scratch, recovering resources that are currently unattainable.</p> <p>Don\u2019t let anyone convince you that any of this is inconceivable. For ours is a continent that time and again has shown that citizens\u2019 power can make the impossible possible. On 20 June, 1789 in France the representatives of the third estate called themselves the National Assembly and swore not to separate until a constitution was established. The result was revolution and the birth of the modern French republic. Europe today needs its own Tennis Court Oath, a second peaceful revolution after the one of 1989, and the birth of its own republic.</p> <p>As Julien Benda was fond of saying, emperors cannot produce Europe \u2013 only citizens can.</p> <p>\u2022 Lorenzo Marsili is a founder of <a href=\"https://euroalter.com/?s=Marsili\">European Alternatives</a> and Ulrike Gu\u00e9rot is founder and director of the <a href=\"https://europeandemocracylab.org/en/\">European Democracy Lab</a></p>",

Will Harris, a cattleman at White Oak Pastures in southern Georgia, said he always knew a \u201ctrainwreck\u201d would hit the factory farming industry.</p> <p>Harris knows intimately how fragile factory farms and their supply chains can be, because for two decades, he raised cattle for the industrial beef production system. </p> <p>\u201cFor the past 70 years, big multinational corporations have moved our food system further and further down the road of focusing only on efficiency, only on taking costs out of production,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd in doing that they created a very fragile food system where a lot of things can go wrong.\u201d</p> <p>But Harris said there is an alternative: his style of farming.</p> <p>Harris moved towards sustainability in the 1990s because of concerns about the environment and animal welfare. White Oak Pastures, which has $20m in annual sales to Tyson\u2019s $42bn, has not sent panicked missives warning about meat shortages and is not being forced to kill its animals, as farmers who rely on corporate processing plants are.</p> <p>Instead, online sales have jumped fivefold; it has hired 16 more full-time employees; and any slowdown in processing will simply mean cows have more time to munch and meander in the grass.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not bulletproof. I could have a lot of people get this sickness and have to close the plant. I hope not, but it could happen,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut we are doing all we can to prevent it, not just because of the economics of closing the plant but because we don\u2019t want our people sick.\u201d</p> <p>In a country where people consume on average more meat each day than <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-availability-and-consumption/\">the government recommends</a>, the Covid-19 outbreak is far from catalysing a meat-free America.</p> <p>Instead, it\u2019s exposing how fragile big meat\u2019s supply chain is and making a case for smaller, more resilient models.</p> <p>\u201cThis virus is a warning shot, and it provides us with an opportunity to change our food system in ways that are less susceptible to disruption,\u201d said Bob Martin, food system policy director at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future.</p> <p>Issues with factory farming are well-documented.

  "<p>They say you never forget your first time, and Paul Jordan is no exception. It was a Saturday night, 15 May 1993, to be precise. Downstairs at his family home in Peterborough, his mum and dad were holding a dinner party. Their son, meanwhile, had sneaked into his parents\u2019 bedroom, desperate not to attract the attention of the grown-ups.</p> <p>A few hours later, emotions overwhelmed him. His dad came up to check on his son and when the bedroom door burst open, their eyes met as the credits rolled on the small television set. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eurovision\" title=\"\">Eurovision Song Contest</a> was over, and after a nail-biting finish to voting, the United Kingdom\u2019s contestant had missed out on first place in the final round.</p> <p>What started as a childhood obsession for Jordan later became all-consuming. It was the subject of his undergraduate dissertation, closely followed by a PhD on how different countries attribute their own meaning to the contest. He joined the competition\u2019s comms team for a while, earning the nickname \u201cDr Eurovision\u201d for turning the pop culture phenomenon into an intellectual pursuit.</p> <p>Twenty-seven years later, clutching a glass of prosecco in his Northampton living room, the 36-year-old laughs as he retells the story via Zoom to a group of fellow Eurovision fanatics. \u201cWhen he heard me cheering,\u201d says Jordan, \u201cDad just assumed I was watching <em>Match of </em><em>the Day</em>.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a memory that resonates with his friends who have logged in from across Europe for their regular lockdown catch-up: Simon in Brussels, Elaine in Dunfermline and Dan in rural south Wales. Each has their own similar tale to tell of watching for the first time.</p> <p>But this digital get-together isn\u2019t just for reminiscing. It\u2019s 7.45pm and in a few minutes the opening titles of their beloved Eurovision will appear on their screens once again. Except this year\u2019s contest in Rotterdam has been cancelled due to Covid-19; the 2020 instalment was due to take place on 16 May. For superfans across Europe and beyond, this is simply a minor detail that they refuse to let stand in their way. It\u2019s why Jordan and his friends have instead turned to collective viewings of reruns.</p> <p>For a week, I\u2019ve been joining the online viewing parties and Eurovision quiz nights that the competition\u2019s fans have been hosting. I\u2019ve listened to specially curated Spotify playlists; attempted to keep up with the hundreds of messages \u2013 \u201cUgh my ovaries\u201d; \u201cQUEEEEN\u201d; \u201cI\u2019ve got literal goose bumps\u201d \u2013 appearing on WhatsApp group chats that have welcomed me in.

Back then, seven countries played two songs each accompanied by a live orchestra: a joint venture to harness the power of newly perfected long distance broadcasting technology while attempting to unite a fractured Europe still recovering from the wounds of war.</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes Eurovision so special is its legacy,\u201d explains Jon Ola Sand, the contest\u2019s executive supervisor. \u201cIt would be impossible to pitch the show to broadcasters now.\u201d But, he says, its heritage and history make it work. \u201cAnd because it travels from Moscow to Dublin, Athens to Helsinki, it has established itself as a true European project, every year a different country adds a new tone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1322c5a578309160fd76950796a9108371f2c50f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1322c5a578309160fd76950796a9108371f2c50f/456_312_2856_1714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans from the UK dressed in jackets with British symbols arrive in Stockholm for 2016\u2019s show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The biggest shame is that it\u2019s the one time we get to see our family from across Europe.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the 1950s it has grown in every conceivable way. Last year, more than 180 million people tuned in to watch 26 countries battle it out in the glitzy grand final. With Brexit now under way, Eurovision has taken on a new significance for many British viewers \u2013 our participation is one of the few public examples of pan-European co-operation in which we will still partake.</p> <p>From low-key beginnings, it has become a huge event; planning for the next contest starts the moment the last one finishes. The rules dictate that the winning country plays host the following May. Hotels need booking before prices are hiked up the next morning; once that\u2019s decided, fans can start plotting out which other events might complement this final destination.</p> <p>There\u2019s the summer party in Berlin; the Eurovision cruise that sets sail every September. January to March is national selection season \u2013 fans pick which events they\u2019ll be attending to watch the qualifiers progress. April and May are for preview parties: Amsterdam\u2019s <a href=\"https://eurovisioninconcert.nl/en/eurovision-in-concert-6-april-2019-in-afas-live/\" title=\"\">Eurovision In Concert</a> is the biggest, plus Moscow and Madrid, Tel Aviv and London are ones not to miss.</p> <p>\u201cFor half the year, fans are crisscrossing through Europe,\u201d says Simon Bennett from his home in London. \u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, it can consume your whole calendar.\u201d It\u2019s probably a little late for the 56-year-old to be worrying about that now. A tour guide by trade, for the past five years, he has been the president of the Eurovision fan club, <a href=\"https://ogaeinternational.org/\" title=\"\">OGAE International</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re the umbrella organisation for the 45 national Eurovision fan clubs around the world, made up of more than 13,000 members,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>For the people Bennett represents, news that Eurovision had been called off was devastating. There\u2019s the financial hit: ticket packages through OGAE cost a hefty \u20ac799 (\u00a3698); whether refunds will be forthcoming for flights, hotels and local events remains to be seen. And then there\u2019s the personal cost. \u201cThe biggest shame is that it\u2019s the one time a year that we see our family from across Europe and beyond.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to cancel the show wasn\u2019t taken lightly. The competition is organised by the European Broadcasting Union, and it\u2019s their biggest event of the year. For Jon Ola Sand, this was to be his 10th and final year at the helm. The production team spent a month, says Sand, monitoring the international situation carefully. At first they considered hosting a slimmed-down event. Could it work with no audience? How about remotely?</p> <p>\u201cIn the end with the advice from the health authorities in the Netherlands,\u201d he says, \u201cand travel restrictions in several participating countries, we realised it would be impossible to go ahead.\u201d</p> <p>While many cultural institutions are adapting to these unexpected circumstances with innovative, online alternatives, Sand and his team saw no feasible way the show could continue fairly. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t want was an uneven playing field with a different type of competition,\u201d he tells me from his base in Norway. \u201cSongs and acts were specially created for that stage \u2013 so we decided it would be unfair to change any variables so late on.\u201d</p> <p>Delaying the event until later in the year was also a non-starter. Eurovision is more than the final television show: there\u2019s a full week of rehearsals, heats and run-throughs, plus a nonstop schedule of other events. For seven days, a host city is overrun with Eurovision fever: infrastructure, outdoor screens, hotels and transport all need to be arranged. Instead, on what was meant to be the finale night, there\u2019ll be an alternative live broadcast. Eurovision<em><a href=\"https://eurovision.tv/eurovision-europe-shine-a-light\" title=\"\">: Europe Shine a Light</a></em><em><a href=\"https://eurovision.tv/eurovision-europe-shine-a-light\" title=\"\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://eurovision.tv/eurovision-europe-shine-a-light\" title=\"\">will see</a> videos of this year\u2019s songs played out non-competitively, with a few sing-alongs and iconic faces from the past appearing, too. The BBC, meanwhile, has also put together its own replacement, <em><a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-03-31/eurovision-come-togerther-bbc-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">Eurovision: Come Together</a></em>. \u201cIn the end we had no other option but to pull it,\u201d says Sand. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m finding it\u2019s harder to close down a contest than to put one on.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>It may take a year</strong></em> of hard graft for organisers to produce a Eurovision show and all that goes with it, but for Samanta T\u012bna the road to Rotterdam 2020 took a little longer to travel. Eight years, in fact. It wasn\u2019t a financial pull \u2013 not even the winning act gets any prize money \u2013 but a career-long ambition she craved to see through.</p> <p>The 31-year-old singer\u2019s first attempt to represent Latvia was back in 2012. She came second in the televised qualifier and the following year was also runner-up. After a further two failed submissions, she gave it a final shot last year and placed seventh. At home in Riga, with only her dog for company, Tina says she had decided not to bother trying for 2020 when applications opened. But then she changed her mind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Despite the fact there are judges, the show isn\u2019t at all judgmental</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen I started performing my new song \u2013 Still Breathing \u2013 on stage,\u201d Tina says, \u201cI realised I had to enter. There\u2019d been other years when I\u2019d attempted to make it, but had known deep down I didn\u2019t have a track that would make me proud to represent my country. But with this song, I did.\u201d This time, she made it through. The ticket was hers. \u201cI just wish I could have clung on to that feeling a little longer,\u201d she says. \u201cFinally, the candy is in your hands but\u2026 when you\u2019re allowed to unwrap it, there\u2019s nothing there. I know that candy is mine.\u201d</p> <p>Cheryl Baker remembers that sweet taste perfectly. It was 1981, and she and her fellow Bucks Fizz band members were in Dublin as the votes from across Europe slowly rolled in. Performing Making Your Mind Up on the Eurovision stage might have been nerve-racking (\u201cBloody terrifying,\u201d she says), but it earned the group a steady stream of points from every country: the catchy lyrics and kitsch outfits had gone down a treat.</p> <p>\u201cIt came down to the final vote,\u201d Baker recalls, nearly four decades later, \u201cand all the cameras were pointing at the German girl who looked happy. I just assumed that she had pipped us to the post. Then I realised: \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019ve won.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the airport arrivals lounge back in England the following evening, their song was pumped out through the PA \u2013 their lives had changed forever. Their single hit number one across Europe and they played Christmas <em>Top of the Pops</em>.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, winning Eurovision wasn\u2019t just fulfilling a childhood dream,\u201d Baker says. \u201cWithout it I wouldn\u2019t have my house, I\u2019d never have met my husband or had our kids. We still tour. Everything I have is because of Making Your Mind Up, a silly song with no meaning. Actually, I\u2019m pretty sure we can credit the four points we won by to the Velcro skirts we wore.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>My virtual journey </strong></em>through Eurovision fandom takes me to every corner of Europe. There\u2019s Vladyslav with a Eurovision photo-collage pinned to his sitting-room wall in the Ukrainian town of Vinnytsia; Paulo in Barcelona, Paul in Manchester and California native Liz Guterbock, too. I make every effort to be indiscriminate, speaking to teenagers and pensioners, men and women, fans old and new. And yet, nearly every punter has one thing in common: they\u2019re almost all lesbian, bisexual or gay.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=bsnglton\" title=\"\">Professor Brian Singleton</a> of Trinity College Dublin has considered why this might be the case more than most others: Eurovision \u2013 and the communities which adore it \u2013 has made up a fair chunk of his university research. His academic papers include: <em>From Dana to Dustin: The Reputation of Old/New Ireland and the Eurovision Song Contest</em>, and <em>Part of the Show: The Global Networking of Irish Eurovision Song Contest Fans</em>. A fan himself, Singleton was hesitant at first to study Eurovision too closely, worried that it might turn the thing he loved into something that felt more like work. But, he\u2019s relieved to say, that didn\u2019t happen, instead his academic research has deepened his appreciation and enjoyment.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Singleton says, \u201cthere\u2019s the campness and the glamour\u201d that helps attract a gay audience. But he believes there\u2019s something in both the music and the spectacle that is a little more profound. The narrative of many songs in the contest is of overcoming adversity, he suggests, and with a production on Eurovision\u2019s scale things do inevitably go wrong from time to time. Regardless, the show goes on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b958c914e334a386bd7ccaaebcae9c94e3fba891\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b958c914e334a386bd7ccaaebcae9c94e3fba891/481_271_3272_1964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four fans from France with foreheads or faces painted with the French flag\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flag waving: fans from France arrive at the 2016 show in Stockholm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Campanella/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are just so many moments of triumph in Eurovision,\u201d he continues, \u201cand that speaks to many LGBTQ+ people, certainly of my generation, who came of age in societies where homosexuality was criminalised.\u201d Singleton grew up just outside Omagh, Northern Ireland, during the Troubles when homosexuality was still illegal \u2013 tuning in through his teenage years offered a window into another, more hopeful and accepting world.</p> <p>Today, LGBTQ+ people in many competitor nations \u2013 Russia, Ukraine and Armenia, among others \u2013 continue to face discrimination or state-sanctioned persecution. At Eurovision 2009 in Moscow, local LGBTQ+ people organised a gay pride parade. \u201cThe police were chasing the few thousand people who turned up,\u201d Singleton recalls, \u201cwhile in the arena the state broadcaster was beaming out gay fans dancing to the world\u2019s LGBT community.\u201d Eurovision\u2019s message of possibility still brings hope to people in places where it\u2019s hard to be out and proud.</p> <p>Most fans I speak to have been hooked on Eurovision since early childhood, long before many of them had come to explore their sexuality and all it means. After a week of embracing all things Eurovision, I\u2019ve come to understand why people who are a little different are attracted to the competition\u2019s bright lights. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/22/sunday-with-rylan-clark-neal-we-get-a-takeaway-roast-from-the-pub-dont-judge-me\" title=\"\">Rylan Clark-Neal</a> \u2013 superfan turned BBC Eurovision presenter \u2013 puts it, inclusivity is woven into the contest\u2019s fabric. However much we Brits might take the piss, the show has a huge heart.</p> <p>\u201cI remember watching it through the years as a kid and being in awe of how, despite the fact there are literally judges, the show isn\u2019t at all judgmental,\u201d Clark-Neal says. \u201cYou can be transgender and win like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/10/viva-la-diva-how-eurovisions-dana-international-made-trans-identity-mainstream\" title=\"\">Dana International</a>; a group that\u2019s camp as Christmas like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/mar/19/flyingtheflagscoochwillcr\" title=\"\">Scooch</a> can take off.\u201d All languages, dances and styles of music are celebrated and welcomed, no questions asked. \u201cIt feels like a bubble \u2013 whether you\u2019re there in person, or watching on your sofa. And once you\u2019re inside, everything is safe and anything goes.\u201d</p>",

A couple of years on and writer Peter Bowker\u2019s creation of Joe, the marvellous young Max Vento, continues to cause tumults of heart-sorry love, bite-the-walls frustration, wry laughter and wry sobs amid his family, amid those stunning northern fells, and now amid a backdrop of splintered parents living apart. And every parent, never mind every parent of an A-word (autistic) child, can surely grasp the import of the word \u201cchange\u201d on the young, even the apparently invulnerable.</p> <p>Joe is 10 now, and coping with change by dumping his headphones, and his dad\u2019s beloved MP3d punk, which the two of them used to share, when he thinks he\u2019s not \u201chome\u201d. As indeed he\u2019s not, any more. Paul and Alison live 100 miles apart, in new places: a squat, lakeside, stone cottage for Paul (Lee Ingleby); a cheap-swish, Manc dockside mezzanine for Alison (Morven Christie). Christopher Eccleston, still managing to keep his performance <em>just</em> the right side of comedic, cliched \u201cfit northern granda\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s quite a skill, and finely borne \u2013 is still portrayed as the galumphing, tactless one, but now I\u2019m less sure: his boots-on approach to Joe seems to bear more fruit than Paul\u2019s wriggling, passive empathy and Alison\u2019s controlling righteousness, which after all led to that split.</p> <p>As often with this series, the lens that shines on the differently abled \u2013 Joe, and Ralph, the son with Down\u2019s syndrome (a phenomenal Leon Harrop) of granda Maurice\u2019s love interest \u2013 only serves to refract the limitations of the word \u201cnormal\u201d when applied to adults. Expect also some standout work from (of course) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/27/i-do-my-best-wholeheartedly-julie-hesmondhalgh-on-corrie-corbyn-and-trans-rights\">Julie Hesmondhalgh</a>, who very soon comes into her own as Joe\u2019s teacher, and Molly Wright as sister Rebecca, the only person Joe fully \u201cgets\u201d, now threatening more change via an accidental uni pregnancy, the ramifications of which Joe will cope with by obsessing about car-seat rights. As, actually, one well might.</p> <p>Hardly to be outdone, ITV shone with <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/isolation-stories/10a0115\">Isolation Stories</a></strong>, the first serious TV dramas to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/23/isolation-stories-itv-lockdown-drama-interview-makers\">made under lockdown</a>. Jeff Pope and his writers (Gaby Chiappe, William Ivory, Neil McKay), under strictures that meant everything had to be filmed by partners or co-quarantined similars, and overseen remotely by Zoom or some such, managed to give us almost a full week of edgy and delightful drama that will surely be referred back to by chroniclers of these times.</p> <p>A handful of intriguing 15-minute scripts, a handful of fine actors, filmed at home, with occasional split-screens to reflect the ongoing frustrations of lockdown \u2013 co-workers here, a therapist there \u2013 and who needs ritzy, pricey locations any more? One might ask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3cb9aaa35045b8d36c37f90ec818dbb77353888\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3cb9aaa35045b8d36c37f90ec818dbb77353888/64_213_1926_2766/696.jpg\" alt=\"Sheridan Smith in Isolation Stories.\" width=\"696\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A great venture\u2019: Sheridan Smith in Isolation Stories.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What struck about the entire week was the difference in needs. Some \u2013 and what <em>happened</em> to them in childhood to make them so needy? \u2013 sobbed on phone-camera, or wheedled, or boasted. Some, er, simply coped. All British life was here. And one or two of those who were proudest of the coping were, simply, found wanting. As I might have mentioned, life is messy. This was a great venture, helped immensely by Sheridan Smith and young Tom Glenister.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80197844\">The Eddy</a></strong>, parlayed in a kind of mongrel Franglais-Arabic on the backstreets of Paris \u2013 the shonky suburbs beyond the tracks of the Petite Ceinture that also formed so many settings for <em>Spiral</em> \u2013 is something of a labour of love, all about a dingy, tottering jazz club kept alive through force of personality and sweet, soulful music. The actors either are musicians, or have learned so to become, and it has behind it director Damien Chazelle (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/18/whiplash-review-drummer-miles-teller-mark-kermode\">Whiplash</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/15/la-la-land-review-emma-stone-ryan-gosling-damien-chazelle\">La La Land</a></em>) and, as writer, our own Jack Thorne.</p> <p>It\u2019s not short on style. The sax player, for instance, has one of those make-your-mind-up beards only ever encountered in one of two manifestations: a hot, young, black sax player dishing it out in a dirty, basement jazz club in Paris or a Belgian mime artist. The three-generation jazz lovers in the immigration squats of Paris, grandmother beside grandson, have mastered the Arabic art of singing with a smouldering fag between the lips. It feels stylish yet true, and so it\u2019s a welcome universe away from last week\u2019s Netflix <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/03/the-week-in-tv-normal-people-blood-code-404-hollywood-museums-in-quarantine\">Hollywood</a></em> thing, with its rip-off credo that \u201cstyle\u201d can be had for a cheap, raffia trilby and a poster of a trumpet.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUPp_hNMlM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BMUPp_hNMlM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUPp_hNMlM\">Watch a trailer for The Eddy</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Not short on style, but that\u2019s part of the problem. The moody shots, the endless rehearsals, the fiddly, stop-start tuning\u2026 I loved it, but even I accept it could have done with a plot. So far, Chazelle seems to be showrunning by draping good jazz on top of a trepanned basic story, about an exiled African American and his stroppy daughter and some Serbian money-goons. It remains to be seen whether Thorne will in future weeks flex his undoubted writing muscles, or bow and take the back seat to his weighty, garlanded director\u2019s singular (if plot-thin) vision.</p> <p>That all said, if Chazelle\u2019s <em>La La Land</em> was bubblegum jazz (which it avowedly was, quite unlike <em>Whiplash</em>, which approached the music like a grown-up), then this is the stuff of cheroots and switchblades. And jazz bounces a little higher once more on its newly healthy tendril, which is the hope of rescue from cliched irrelevance and wilful misunderstanding.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/trying/umc.cmc.6muy4la7lj1omu5nci4bt2m66\">Trying</a></strong> is Apple TV+\u2019s first dedicated comedy, apparently, and rather good for what it is. What it is is something about a north London couple trying to adopt, and a refreshingly non-Richard Curtis London couple, for what\u2019s sure to be a global viewership, or as much as Apple TV+ can depend on a global viewership, which is frankly not yet much.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, genuinely, with some very good lines. Rafe Spall as Jason excels as one half of the trying couple, lugubrious and staunchly anti-intellectual, yet half-wise. Where it falls down, and certainly not with the actor, Esther Smith (Nikki), is in the tweeness of characterisation. In 2005 film critic Nathan Rabin coined, not entirely unkindly, the phrase \u201cmanic pixie dream girl\u201d for a certain type of heroine, and Nikki\u2019s certainly that \u2013 dungarees, breezy kookiness, squirrels and rainbows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40fdcf01dc2e6ccf3e0ea67d55951931c13e28d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40fdcf01dc2e6ccf3e0ea67d55951931c13e28d7/200_0_3277_1781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rafe Spall and \u2018manic pixie dream girl\u2019 Esther Smith in Trying.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"543\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rafe Spall and \u2018manic pixie dream girl\u2019 Esther Smith in Trying.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple TV+</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately, this all spills over into the adoption process, with Nikki constantly trying to better herself (reading Dostoevsky, attending lectures with three highlighter pens) rather than Just Being Herself. Which will win in the long run. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s rather good, but it irritated, with its cliched (bad) books versus (good) carefree-beach vibe, when there\u2019s no quandary. It\u2019s not a zero-sum game.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/05/claire-danes-on-the-end-of-homeland-it-was-so-nice-to-play-such-a-badass\">Claire Danes on the end of Homeland: 'It was so nice to play such a badass'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/homeland\">Homeland</a></strong>, which ended its long and breathless run last week, allegedly for ever, was \u2013 for those who stuck the distance \u2013 a gift-yielding, immense reward, not least in its uncanny ability to spot some tendencies early: troll farms, fake news, presidents sacking wholesale their intelligence departments, unintelligently.

If at the end point, people aren\u2019t going to do that and think that they\u2019ve only got a niggle in the throat and maybe they should go to work, it\u2019s not simply a sick leave issue.

  "<p>Temperature tests, taped-off lifts and potential spikes in harassment complaints are all being examined by British businesses as they prepare for a slow and staggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/uk-plan-for-returning-to-work-puts-peoples-health-at-risk-warns-tuc-coronavirus\">return to work</a>.</p> <p>Companies have already been scrambling for legal and practical advice as they prepare for the realities of managing workplaces during the Covid-19 crisis. However, there are already major concerns that workers are unclear about what to do if they are being put at risk, while industry figures also warn that the mental health impacts of returning to a new \u201calien environment\u201d are not being prioritised.</p> <p>Taped squares in lifts, protective screens between workstations and repurposed meeting rooms are among the basic measures being prepared. A wide range of businesses are said to be considering more drastic action, such as the introduction of temperature tests for staff on arrival, according to employment lawyers. Such testing is fraught with potential issues. The enforcement of testing \u2013 and recording whether or not a staff member has contracted coronavirus \u2013 are areas that could be tested in the courts.</p> <p>An increase in whistleblowing complaints is also likely, as workers see different employers taking varying approaches to the loosening of lockdown \u2013 a tension created by differing interpretations of government guidance.</p> <p>Kevin Rowan, the TUC\u2019s head of health and safety, warned that a huge public awareness campaign was needed to ensure workers know their rights.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is the public information message so that people know what employers are required to do, and that there is somewhere they can go to complain?\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make that more transparent, as well as boosting enforcement.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2254c37837d5b76b1b8b70b423c9eb7e99cb6e57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2254c37837d5b76b1b8b70b423c9eb7e99cb6e57/0_185_4377_2627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Companies could face a rash of sexual harassment claims.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Companies could face a rash of sexual harassment claims.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barbara Gindl/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are also warnings of a spike in sexual harassment and other harassment allegations as employees readjust to life in the workplace, with some social distancing rules likely to remain in place.</p> <p>A memo composed by a London-based team at the law firm Morgan Lewis warns: \u201cEmployers may face a spike in employee misconduct, grievances and litigation as employees adapt to their new workplaces following the long period of isolation. For example, employers may see an increase in sexual harassment issues as employees return to the workplace, and other harassment complaints where employees fail to respect personal space or comply with safety guidelines.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, business groups warn any significant return to work is entirely reliant on the reopening of schools and childcare. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cTo say to an employer that schools are going to be open for a couple of year groups on alternate days for a few hours at a time does not solve the problem of getting people back to work.\u201d</p> <p>The government is also being warned that it has to take the psychological impacts of lifting the lockdown as seriously as the logistical difficulties.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think what we\u2019ve seen so far recognises the emotional impact and anxiety that people will have of what is essentially an alien environment that some people will be returning to,\u201d said David D\u2019Souza, a director at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.</p> <h2><strong>Travel</strong></h2> <p>Both unions and employer groups have told the <em>Observer</em> that the main concern cropping up over the potential return to work is the commute. Employers will be urged to stagger shifts and start times far more to help ease the pressure on traditional peak-time services.</p> <p>\u201cAt the start of the pandemic, we were seeing pictures of congested trains,\u201d says Rowan. \u201cWhile that has eased a lot, there are still pretty regular concerns.\u201d</p> <p>Public transport bosses have warned that current social distancing rules would see them operating at 20% capacity or less, causing obvious concerns about those rules being breached or cars clogging up cities.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/what-kind-of-face-mask-will-best-protect-you-against-coronavirus-covid-19\">Face masks</a> could allow public transport to be used in greater numbers. In Berlin, wearing masks on public transport is compulsory and social distancing is not required. However, the effectiveness of masks remains disputed. Measures have been taken overseas to reduce congestion in bus and train stations, but they are crude \u2013 usually in the form of painted lines denoting the correct social distancing space.</p> <p>Walking and cycling are being advised for some workers and there has been a major increase in bike-purchasing schemes. Temporary bike lanes are being considered in the UK.</p> <h2><strong>Arriving</strong></h2> <p>Testing upon arrival at work is being considered, with temperature tests the most practical and least invasive. \u201cInterest is wider than you would think,\u201d says Matthew Howse, who runs Morgan Lewis\u2019s employment practice team in London. Taping-off lifts to ensure safe social distancing is also being used, while companies have already thought about one-way systems in and out of buildings, as well as hand sanitiser stations at entrances.</p> <p>A major change in shift patterns may be needed to prevent the morning bottleneck. \u201cIt would be helpful if your workforce actually phased the shift rota so they arrive over a two or three-hour period,\u201d says Duncan Spencer, the former head of safety and health at John Lewis and now head of advice and practice at the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. \u201cYou could have an A and B shift, with some working from home.\u201d</p> <p>Many industry figures said the only realistic way to ensure social distancing was keeping high numbers of workers at home or continuing with a state job retention scheme, paying employees not to work. \u201cThere are things that employers can do, but you can\u2019t just turn the tap off on the job retention scheme because it may be that only a third of workers can go back to work and be safe,\u201d says Rowan.</p> <h2><strong>Workstations</strong></h2> <p>Advice on protecting workers has already been issued to companies that were allowed to stay open during the pandemic, such as the introduction of physical screens between workers. In offices, communal spaces such as meeting rooms will be repurposed, to spread out desks. Having workers face in opposite directions has already been advised.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you think there is that level of risk, should you be asking people to return at all?</p> <footer> <cite>David D\u2019Souza, Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Extra cleaning of frequently touched surfaces, from hand rails to photocopier buttons, is another simple measure \u2013 with many companies updating their contracts with cleaning staff.</p> <p>Once the easier measures have been completed, companies are left with what occupational health experts describe as the last resort in the \u201chierarchy of risk\u201d \u2013 personal protective equipment (PPE).

Some of the buildings may make it near impossible to adhere to social distancing within the kitchens or customer areas.\u201d</p> <p>Companies allowing food to be delivered will need to consider the extra hygiene and contamination precautions. Ministers are already encouraging takeaway outlets to reopen, but social distancing rules will leave many workers wondering if they should spend their lunch break in a queue or bring something with them.</p> <p>Laurie wonders if it will lead to an increase in the quality of the homemade lunch. \u201cWe may see a flourish of creativity in people\u2019s lunch boxes if homecooking has taken off during lockdown.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Meetings</strong></h2> <p>Existing guidance already tells businesses to limit the length of face-to-face meetings, if they have to happen at all \u2013 15 minutes or less has been the advice to some sectors.</p> <p>Videoconferencing has already allowed businesses to continue during the lockdown and that enforced technological take-up is likely to be relied upon for months. \u201cThings are working well with staff at home,\u201d says Marshall. \u201cBusinesses have experienced what in normal times would be a five- to 10-year shift to new ways of working in five weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Others are warning that it is that interaction with colleagues that many workers are craving \u2013 and the realities of the return to work could have a significant psychological impact. \u201cFor some people there is almost the comfort blanket of thinking about the return to the traditional working environment, with the buzz of being around colleagues, the camaraderie and the social benefits that come with being in work,\u201d says D\u2019Souza.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really unlikely in the short term that any workplace is going to feel anything other than unsettling and very sterile.

  "<p>Britain is in a lonely place right now. It resembles the scene of a bad traffic accident where shocked passers-by look away with pity and horror in their eyes. Alarmed by what they see, governments around the world practise their own form of social distancing. Once again, Britain is the sick man of Europe.</p> <p>Lethal mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic is not the sole reason for this un-splendid isolation. The disease\u2019s sudden onslaught is the third national disaster in almost as many years. The first was the decision to walk away from Europe. The second was the advent of Donald Trump and his anarchic America First agenda.</p> <p>However the virus\u2019s death toll is calculated, the perception is taking hold, abroad as at home, that the Johnson government\u2019s performance is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">one of the world\u2019s worst</a>, second possibly only to the US. Sympathy for Britain\u2019s plight has not forestalled scathing international criticism.</p> <p>Italians may surely be forgiven a sense of relief that their country is no longer Europe\u2019s biggest blackspot. With this unwanted title came the unspoken inference that Italy was uniquely unprepared. Some in the UK certainly saw it that way. They thought they were immune. They were betting, as usual, on a bogus British exceptionalism.</p> <p>Britain \u201cdid not pay enough attention to what was happening here\u201d, commented Beppe Severgnini in <em>Corriere della Sera</em>, referring to the two- to three-week period when Italy was ahead of the corona curve. The UK \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/complacent-uk-draws-global-criticism-for-covid-19-response-boris-johnson\">lost the advantage</a> that fate and Italy gave it... when it was obvious the virus was spreading\u201d.</p> <p>The view of Britain as Europe\u2019s \u201cproblem child\u201d predates the pandemic but has been greatly reinforced by it. Foreign perceptions of the UK as a badly governed, disorderly, embittered and chronically divided country took deep root in the politically chaotic years that followed the 2016 Brexit referendum.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible that outside observers who were surprised by the anger and passion aroused by Brexit simply did not understand Britain. But the stunning levels of incompetence, jingoism and arrogance displayed by the British side during the withdrawal talks dismayed many Europeans. It was genuinely unexpected.</p> <p>This altered view of Britain, or at least of Britain\u2019s government, as a not entirely serious, capable or trustworthy partner is not confined to Europe. Given that Brexit is premised on \u201cglobal Britain\u201d forging a web of dynamic new trade relationships, such reputational damage is potentially calamitous. Unpropitious, too, is the current plunge towards a world recession.

Beijing\u2019s \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomats will see the lack of substance at the heart of a remarkably low-calibre cabinet, and spot a chance for knockdown bargains.

Lowered food safety standards may be among many enforced compromises.<br><br>Yet the Trump presidency\u2019s negative impact on British interests and values far surpasses disputes about chlorinated chicken.

His re-election would extend and intensify the nightmare.</p> <p>Trump, the greatest of all coronavirus failures, is dangerous to know. And yet still they hug him close, risking infection, petitioning for a deal at almost any cost, mimicking his anti-Europe, populist posturing, rejecting pandemic cooperation with the EU and insisting, even now, that Brexit will be sewn up by December. A stitch-up is more likely. It will end in tears.</p> <p>One disaster has swiftly followed another. Rarely in modern times has Britain\u2019s place in the world looked so precarious. Rarely has its global reputation for competence, pragmatism and good sense been so battered and disrespected. Rarely have its people and economy faced such challenges and such crippling levels of debt.</p> <p>Perhaps the last time the country stood alone like this, frightened, sickened, beleaguered, lacking funds and resources and separated from friends, was when it faced a deadly invasion of a different type, 80 years ago next month. As it remembers the victory in Europe that eventually followed in 1945, Britain needs another miracle, a fresh strategy \u2013 and much better leaders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>Good evening and here is our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the main stories on Sunday 10 May.</p> \n<h2>Ten arrested at protest against Covid-19 lockdown laws</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/10/ten-arrested-and-police-officer-injured-at-protest-against-victorias-covid-19-lockdown-laws\">Ten people were arrested at a protest outside Melbourne\u2019s Parliament House</a> on Sunday. About 200 people gathered to protest against Victoria\u2019s continued lockdown laws and against the concept of vaccination, chanted for the arrest of Bill Gates, and pushed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/01/why-the-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-is-false-video-explainer\">conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was linked to the rollout of 5G.</a></p> \n<p>Two of the 10 arrested were the organisers of the protest, police said. The charges for the 10 included breaching Victoria\u2019s state of emergency orders, which expire on Monday and carry a $1,600 on-the-spot fine or potential jail time. Three people were also charged with assaulting a police officer, and one police officer was taken to hospital for a rib injury.</p> \n<h2>NSW to ease restrictions from Friday</h2> \n<p>From Friday, people in New South Wales will be allowed to have five visitors in their home and gather in groups of up to 10 outside. Places of worship will also be open to up to 10 people. Restaurants and cafes will be open to up to 10 dine-in patrons, although premier Gladys Berejiklian conceded that may not be a viable business decision.</p> \n<p>Weddings will be allowed to have 10 guests, funerals 20 attendees if held indoors and 30 if outdoors. However Berejiklian said she was not yet ready to lift the restrictions on regional travel within NSW, and cautioned that the \u201cbiggest threat to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales\">New South Wales</a> community is complacency\u201d. She said if infection rates increased significantly, the state would be locked down again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>WA announces four-step plan to ease restrictions</h2> \n<p>Western Australia has announced a four-stage plan to ease lockdown restrictions. The state is currently in phase one and will move to phase two, which will allow for indoor gatherings of up to 20 people, and allow restaurants, cafes, and pubs to reopen for up to 20 patrons, from Monday 18 May. Phase three will happen about four weeks after that, details to be confirmed, and then phase four will happen at a date to be fixed.</p> \n<p>Phase two will also allow groups of up to 20 to engage in non-contact sport, swimming in outdoor pools, and indoor and outdoor fitness classes. Weddings and funerals can have up to 20 participants if indoors and 30 if outdoors.</p> \n<p>The 13 regional borders in WA will be replaced with four, allowing for travel between neighbouring regions. The hard border with the eastern states will remain in place. Premier Mark McGowan said it \u201chas been our strongest weapon in the fight against this virus\u201d and \u201cwill likely be the final restriction that we lift\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Australia records 14 new cases</h2> \n<p>Australia recorded just 14 new cases of coronavirus overnight. Ten of those cases were in Victoria, including one connected to the Cedar Meats cluster, bringing the total number of cases in that cluster to 79. Queensland and NSW both recorded two new cases each.</p> \n<h2>China threatens barley tariffs</h2> \n<p>The Australian government is trying to convince China not to go ahead with proposed tariffs against Australian-grown barley, which could devastate the $1.5bn trade. Beijing has indicated it may impose the tariffs because it claims an 18-month long anti-dumping investigation, which Australia participated in, has found evidence of dumping and anti-competitive behaviour. Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham says there is no evidence to show Australia engaged in dumping, and that Australian barley farmers \u201coperate on an entirely commercial basis\u201d. It follows weeks of escalating tension between Canberra and Beijing over Australia\u2019s support for an independent investigation into the origin of Covid-19.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

  "<p>Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, is only a few months into the job and already his reputation for sound management of the economy is in danger. Last week he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\" title=\"\">published a scenario for the next two years</a> that amounted to his best guess on the depth of the recession in front of us, and the prospects for a recovery.</p> <p>The recession would be deep, he said. Most likely the deepest in more than 300 years. It would last for much of the year and cause severe hardship to many, with increases in unemployment not seen since the 1980s.</p> <p>Had the nation\u2019s economists been connected via Zoom to assess Bailey\u2019s outlook, most would have been seen nodding in agreement.</p> <p>Then the governor entered more controversial territory, telling a largely disbelieving audience that his scenario <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/bank-of-england-offers-hope-amid-covid-19s-grim-economic-spectacle\" title=\"\">shows the economy enjoying a quick, V-shaped recovery</a> in 2021.</p> <p>Not many economists believe this is realistic. Former chancellor Alistair Darling was one of the first to say it was likely to be wrong and that recovery would be a \u201clong haul\u201d.</p> <p>Bailey cannot afford too many missteps. One thing we have learned over the past 10 years is that for the central bank, it\u2019s not so much what it does with its financial resources as the messages it sends.</p> <p>When Bailey talked about himself as a diligent central banker, sleeves rolled up, ready to print billions of pounds to support lending by the high street banks, and by that action help the entire economy during the Covid-19 crisis, the public was reassured.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Carney was expert at conveying the sense of being one of a few wise heads able to comprehend the magnitude of a crisis</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Bailey was speaking after the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee</a> (MPC), which he chairs, said it would keep interest rates at a historic low of 0.1%. The committee hinted at a further injection of funds into the system \u2013 \u00a3100bn to be precise \u2013 though it voted by seven to two against making a move just yet.</p> <p>The money is important. A boost of this magnitude, which could come as early as next month when the MPC votes again, would take the Bank\u2019s stimulus programme, known as quantitative easing, to \u00a3745bn, or almost double the amount it considered necessary to keep the economy afloat after the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>The money though, is secondary to the sense of confidence that the Bank brings to dealing with a crisis. </p> <p>Bailey, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/14/mark-carneys-key-moments-at-the-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">his predecessor Mark Carney</a>, knows the public needs to believe that experienced officials are weighing up the options, independent of government, and choosing only those that are effective and at the same time prudent. Markets must also believe.</p> <p>Carney was an expert at conveying this sense of being one of only a handful of wise heads able to comprehend the magnitude of a crisis that was at once local \u2013 about factory and office closures \u2013 and global, with developed and emerging economies suffering the same plight.</p> <p>As boss of the Financial Stability Board, Carney played a key role in the G20 group of nations as an adviser and quasi-global regulator. The globe-trotting position gave him an influence that outshone the bank\u2019s financial means. If he said the economy was improving to such an extent that he would need to increase interest rates within a few years, he was believed. It didn\u2019t matter that, over the seven years he was in charge, the economy never improved enough for him to raise interest rates more than a symbolic half a percentage point.</p> <p>He was accused of being an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/24/bank-of-england-unreliable-boyfriend-interest-rates\" title=\"\">unreliable boyfriend by one MP</a>, and the phrase niggled. But Carney\u2019s bravado won out, with both the public and the markets.</p> <p>Bailey is a more parochial figure, and the weaker for it. It would be a shame if his first look ahead undermined the Bank\u2019s and his own reputation \u2013 especially when the influence of its messaging can be weighed alongside its money.</p> <h2>Government could save jobs at Rolls \u2013 if it reacts quickly</h2> <p>The \u201cdarkest hour for our whole company since the 1970s\u201d is a big claim to make if, like Warren East, chief executive of Rolls-Royce, you are running a business that was nationalised back then.</p> <p>Renationalisation isn\u2019t on the cards, though. East went on to say that the aircraft engine maker of today is much stronger financially than the imploding 1971 version, which is undoubtedly correct. But there\u2019s no disguising the looming job losses. Cuts at Rolls are inevitable as the entire civil aviation industry braces for a major fall in output. Boeing says it could take two to three years to return to 2019 levels; Airbus thinks it will be up to five.</p> <p>If, as rumoured, Rolls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/rolls-royce-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs-say-sources\" title=\"\">plans to cut 8,000 jobs</a> from its global workforce of 52,000, several thousand of those losses will be in the UK. The huge Derby plant, which majors on making engines for the Airbus A350, is in the eye of the storm. A forward-thinking government would be planning to intervene \u2013 not by nationalisation but by creating new employment opportunities</p> <p>At Rolls-Royce, one candidate for this is blindingly obvious \u2013 or should be, if ministers could look beyond the day-to-day crisis. This is its small modular reactors (SMR) programme, the technology most likely to fill the hole in the UK\u2019s nuclear energy ambitions.</p> <p>Rolls, with its submarine expertise, has led development and the missing ingredient is only government\u2019s willingness to provide funding. SMRs can be manufactured and assembled on a single site. The necessary skilled engineering workforce could soon be available.</p> <p>The Unite union has, rightly, called for the SMR programme to be ramped up. It fits with the government\u2019s industrial strategy and its ambition to de-carbonise the economy. Ministers need to move quickly: they have a chance to protect thousands of jobs.</p> <h2>Ocado has arrived just in time for a struggling Marks &amp; Spencer</h2> <p>There\u2019s not much for Marks &amp; Spencer shareholders to cheer as they contemplate a share price that has fallen below 100p for the first time in decades, but here\u2019s a modest consolation: the big adventure into online food delivery, in partnership with Ocado, starts in September. The timing looks superb.</p> <p>Archie Norman, the M&amp;S chairman, received a lot of flak in February last year when he agreed the deal to pay Ocado \u00a3750m for a 50% share of the new Ocado.com joint venture. Too risky, too expensive and too late to the party, said the deal\u2019s critics. The fact that M&amp;S had to tap shareholders for \u00a3600m didn\u2019t improve the mood much either.</p> <p>Some 15 months later, the vibe should be more positive. Covid-19 has advertised the advantages of home delivery and some households\u2019 food shopping habits will have shifted permanently. Online should be the booming part of the food retailing market even when the pandemic passes.</p> <p>M&amp;S will still have to demonstrate that Ocado punters are happy to buy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/12/ocado-product-range-will-be-bigger-and-better-under-marks-and-spencer-deal\" title=\"\">its food ranges</a> rather than those of Waitrose, which will be battling to persuade customers to switch to its own platform. But the current momentum behind Ocado\u2019s retail business in the UK was demonstrated last week in the 40% increase in sales since 1 March. Even if some of the extra volume evaporates by September, M&amp;S should enjoy a better online start than it could have imagined.</p> <p>In turn, the \u00a3750m buy-in price looks less of a gamble. M&amp;S would surely have to pay more if the deal was being negotiated today. Norman and chief executive Steve Rowe got lucky.</p> <p>The Ocado partnership is very far from being a panacea for M&amp;S. The main story remains locked-down stores, cancelled dividends and long-term woes in clothing. But the ailing retailer would be in an even deeper hole without a food delivery service.</p>",
  "<p>On 18 March, Emma Corfield-Walters received the news that for the second year running, her shop, Book-ish, in Crickhowell in the Brecon Beacons, had landed the title for Wales in the regional round of the independent bookshop of the year award. Corfield-Walters has run <a href=\"https://www.book-ish.co.uk/online_shop/\">Book-ish</a> for 10 years. It has 16 staff and a cafe, is the base for a literary festival that she also organises, and is credited with having played a major part in the regeneration of Crickhowell\u2019s award-winning high street. Above all, it is a highly successful business: 2019 was a record year. The fact that it would now again be a contender for the overall prize \u2013 to be announced in June at the British book awards \u2013 was for Corfield-Walters a hard-earned affirmation of a decade\u2019s passion and work.</p> <p>But she was hardly celebrating. Britain was then five days from lockdown. \u201cIt was surreal,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d won best bookshop in Wales, yet I wasn\u2019t sure for how much longer I\u2019d have a shop that people could visit. It was like that scene in <em>Star Wars</em> when the walls are moving in, and the room\u2019s getting smaller and smaller. The goalposts were shifting every day. At first, we thought: OK, we\u2019ll buy hand sanitiser! But by the weekend, it was clear the shop would have to close.\u201d Her first thought was for her staff, who are \u201clike family\u201d to her; the government\u2019s subsequent announcement of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/03/furloughed-from-work-it-pays-to-know-your-rights\">furlough scheme</a> came as a huge relief. But there was also the question of her stock, and how she might keep selling it. Suddenly, the Book-ish website, hitherto used only to sell event tickets and signed copies, came into its own: \u201cOn the Saturday before lockdown began, we managed to get all 6,000 titles from the shop on to our website.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s life like now? Luckily, her wholesaler has remained open, and can help with the delivery of titles not in the shop. But mostly, she spends her days operating as a frantic one-woman postal machine: \u201cI\u2019m on my own here, fielding calls, tweets, Facebook, managing the website, and picking and packing, picking and packing.\u201d Her customers have been supportive. Some days, she sends out up to 50 parcels. However, this cannot make up for the shortfall in income that is the result of a closed shop and cafe. \u201cWe\u2019re about 50% down,\u201d she says. \u201cThough across the trade, that\u2019s relatively good. I\u2019m on the council of the Booksellers Association, and on average, those shops that are still able to send out books are making only about 18% of their normal sales.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36ef55e6eb8ee683b924f3fec73c65b9d1054539\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36ef55e6eb8ee683b924f3fec73c65b9d1054539/155_607_3596_2157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Corfield-Walters, owner of Book-ish in Crickhowell, Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Corfield-Walters, owner of Book-ish in Crickhowell, Wales. \u2018I\u2019ve been too scared to do cashflow projections.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Nguyen/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What about reopening? Will this happen soon? She agrees there are good reasons for bookshops to be included in the first wave of non-essential businesses to reopen in any loosening of the lockdown; reading, as the World Health Organization notes, can boost mental health. But logistically, it\u2019s going to be difficult: \u201cI\u2019m not sure how we\u2019d open for browsing. Most independent shops are small. We\u2019re not chains; we don\u2019t have the infrastructure to make major changes in the way we operate. We\u2019re also community hubs. We had a very emotional conversation on Zoom yesterday at the Booksellers Network coffee morning. People were worrying about their vulnerable customers: the ones who come in for a glass of water, the older person who just wants a chat. How will this work with social distancing? Realistically, I can\u2019t see us opening before September.\u201d</p> <p>How long can she keep going financially? For the first time in our conversation, she is briefly silent. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, at last. \u201cI\u2019ve been too scared to do cashflow projections. My landlord has been great, and reduced my rent. But I\u2019ve still got utilities bills and insurance to think about. If this level of sales carries on, I\u2019ll be able to pay my overheads. But if government support for the furlough scheme stops, there will be, across the trade, redundancies. That terrifies me.\u201d Does she expect some shops to close? \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I have friends at indies that have done so well in the past three years. They\u2019re so forward-thinking and creative. But if you\u2019ve rent to pay, and no website\u2026 \u201d What about her? Will Book-ish get out of this alive? She is determined that it will: \u201cWe\u2019re all in flight or fight mode at the moment \u2013 and I\u2019m fighting.\u201d</p> <p>When the lockdown began on 23 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish\">March</a>, the ramifications for the book industry were extremely grave. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/waterstones-staff-say-their-health-is-at-risk-as-stores-stay-open\">Waterstones closed</a> all 280 of its branches, its chief executive, James Daunt, having previously insisted the chain was no different to a pharmacy or a supermarket and would therefore stay open (the U-turn came after some staff complained they felt at risk, and had been given no protection or hand sanitiser). Britain\u2019s independent book stores also shut their doors (at the end of 2019, there were <a href=\"https://www.booksellers.org.uk/industryinfo/industryinfo/latestnews/Independent-Bookshop-Numbers-Grow-in-2019\">890</a> such shops in the UK and Ireland). Supermarkets, which sell popular books in large quantities, focused their efforts on food and ceased ordering from publishers. Meanwhile, Amazon suddenly and dramatically \u201cde-prioritised\u201d book sales in favour of what it deemed to be essential goods (food, yes, but also, it would seem, hair dye and DIY equipment).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a5b29774e4443d23080b22b33c8f826961ff0fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a5b29774e4443d23080b22b33c8f826961ff0fd/0_146_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Daunt, chief executive of Waterstones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Daunt, chief executive of Waterstones. \u2018Hopefully, customers can now see that online is not a monopoly.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People were shocked. \u201cIt was a precipice at first,\u201d says Jeremy Trevathan, the publisher of Macmillan\u2019s adult division (he oversees Macmillan, Pan and Picador). \u201cWe thought: this is so grim.\u201d Jo Prior, managing director at Penguin General, felt the same way. \u201cIt was alarming and strange when the shops closed; very shocking and dramatic.\u201d Sales plummeted. \u201cSome publishers are saying they went down up to 60%,\u201d says Philip Jones, editor of the<em> Bookseller</em>. </p> <p>For some it was even worse than that. The small presses, which have no marketing budget, depend on booksellers to press their titles into the hands of readers. \u201cBookshop sales are down by 90%,\u201d says Kevin Duffy, who runs Blue Moose, a publisher based in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific. We need the high street to open tomorrow. If it doesn\u2019t happen by September, we\u2019re going to be in dire straits.\u201d</p> <p>Approaches to the emergency varied. At Macmillan, executives took voluntary pay cuts on a sliding scale from 20% rising to 50% (its managing director, Anthony Forbes Watson, took a 50% cut). Only three staff were furloughed. At Faber, on the other hand, the sales team has been furloughed almost in its entirety; the publishing schedule having been radically reduced, the work wasn\u2019t there for people to do, while its international sales team cannot currently travel, which makes their jobs difficult. At Penguin, some employees have been furloughed, but \u201cpatchily\u201d, across the business. \u201cI\u2019ve furloughed members of my communications team,\u201d says Prior. \u201cWe\u2019re resting them because they were working on books that are now delayed.\u201d</p> <p>How many books have been delayed? Again, the picture isn\u2019t consistent (though spooked newspaper literary editors will testify to the scale of the shift; at one point about a month ago, the volume of books coming in for review was noticeably dwindling). While some have pushed the publication of new titles into the autumn, others have moved them into 2021. \u201cWe did take the decision to move off a huge amount into July and the autumn,\u201d says Prior. \u201cNot everything: the new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/lee-child\">Lee Child</a> has just come out. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/08/mrs-hinch-cleans-up-with-book-sales-as-britons-tidy-homes-in-lockdown\">Mrs Hinch</a> [the Instagram cleaning expert] is doing well. But most things \u2013 things that are dependent on physical retail for support \u2013 will be published when we expect shops to be open.\u201d At Faber, most of its list has been moved on. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned the dial, pushing everything on three or four months,\u201d says Stephen Page, its chief executive. \u201cBut we\u2019ve put most literary debuts, which need the oxygen of booksellers, into 2021, because the autumn is going to be so crowded.\u201d All this isn\u2019t without risk. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what the autumn is going look like,\u201d says Philip Jones. \u201cThere are no guarantees. But even if things are close to normal, the danger is that many of these books may get lost in the trample.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A recent survey suggested that 40% of people say that books have helped them get through the lockdown</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How soon will the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/03/after-covid-19-how-will-a-socially-distanced-high-street-actually-work\">high street</a> reopen? \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of chatter,\u201d says Daunt. \u201cBut we need to be told when we can reopen, and no one from government has been in touch.\u201d Is he making preparations? \u201cYes. It requires a lot of operational thought: a lot of training and investment. It\u2019s a far from trivial exercise. How do you ensure your staff are protected and customers properly informed?\u201d Unlike the independents, Waterstones branches are relatively big. \u201cThere\u2019s never a great intensity to book shopping outside of December, and we have tables, which can act as a means of ensuring social distance. Still, it\u2019s extremely challenging. Every part of retail will be different. Bookselling is our profession and our vocation; we want to be open. But we don\u2019t want to do it prematurely, or to be out of sync with our customers. Some places are not going to be busy for a while: out-of-town shopping centres, our big metropolitan city-centre shops; people aren\u2019t going to want to get on the underground to go to Piccadilly to buy a book.\u201d Nevertheless, he is upbeat. \u201cWe are profitable and well run; we have been through hard times before. But also, we have something people really want to buy.\u201d</p> <p>This much is certainly true. In the days before the lockdown began, Waterstones reported a 17% uplift in sales, a rise that has only grown in the weeks since; a central irony, for publishers, has been that in the moment when books have been suddenly more difficult to get hold of, demand for them has never been higher. A recent survey suggested that 40% of people say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/23/britons-are-reading-more-in-lockdown-says-survey-for-world-book-night\">books have helped them get through the lockdown</a>. All publishers report a dramatic increase in traffic on their websites, and in ebook and audio sales. Online sales at Waterstones are growing 30% each day; as I write they are up some 1,500%, a long line of Royal Mail trucks queuing outside its warehouse every night, where there used only to be one. \u201cIt\u2019s still a relatively small proportion of the sales that were coming out of our shops,\u201d says Daunt. \u201cBut hopefully, customers can now see that online is not a monopoly.\u201d Publishers are unsurprisingly thrilled by this. Can Amazon\u2019s monopoly be broken? \u201cOne thing that must come out of this is a model where online selling is more plural,\u201d says Stephen Page.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edb7a81a164288a646e7873aebd86afe29d2e7e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edb7a81a164288a646e7873aebd86afe29d2e7e0/0_58_1732_1039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Literary agent Jonny Geller\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Literary agent Jonny Geller. \u2018I\u2019ve been saying this for 20 years: why not go into direct selling?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Curtis Brown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Publishers are cagey about the idea of getting into selling themselves. Some dismiss the idea out of hand: it\u2019s too complex and too expensive; they don\u2019t want to anger Amazon. Others, off the record, agree that the industry is having this conversation. It has been forcefully brought home to them, Amazon having, as Philip Jones puts it, \u201cturned off the tap\u201d of supply so suddenly, that they have grown too dependent on it; that the supply chain is too fragile. \u201cThis is the moment,\u201d says Jonny Geller, a literary agent who represents, among others, John le Carr\u00e9, Howard Jacobson and Elif Shafak. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying this to them [publishers] for 20 years: why do you not go into direct selling? You have the data, the bookclubs, the websites. Previously, they just preferred to pump money into ailing chains, but I think they\u2019re now being forced to consider it \u2013 and if this situation goes on much longer, they will have to.\u201d He sounds frustrated. \u201cTelevision, which is much more expensive to make, has worked out how to deliver content to people. Publishing is just clinging to the same model it had in 1920. When Tony Parsons\u2019s new novel came out [Parsons is another of Geller\u2019s clients], you couldn\u2019t get hold of his book \u2013 but on the same day, I ordered a badminton kit from Amazon that arrived the following morning.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Writers are well equipped. They\u2019re experiencing what they always experience: self-isolation</p> <footer> <cite>Jonny Geller, literary agent</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Geller is also critical of the decision of publishers to push back their schedules. \u201cThey\u2019re concentrating too much on furloughing and saving and hunkering down. It\u2019s such a narrow approach, everything in the deep freeze. Another of my clients, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alastaircampbell\">Alastair Campbell</a> [Tony Blair\u2019s former press secretary], has written a very powerful book about depression. It was planned for spring, now it will come out in August or September. I\u2019m troubled by this. If there was ever a time for a book of this kind, it\u2019s now. I think this is where morale is low for authors \u2013 and if publishers had invested better in distribution, we wouldn\u2019t be having these debates. They\u2019d just be publishing as usual.\u201d How are writers responding to the changes and uncertainty? \u201cThey\u2019re well equipped. They\u2019re experiencing what they always experience: self-isolation. But it\u2019s also hard to know what to write, what\u2019s relevant. That\u2019s the deeper question. And I do feel desperately sorry for some of those being published now. For many of them, publication has just gone by.\u201d Authors whose books have been published during this time have mixed feelings about it. \u201cI\u2019m publishing into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/02/lionel-shriver-some-people-think-im-evil-incarnate\">big, black hole</a>,\u201d Lionel Shriver tells me, though she adds that her sense of \u201cpersonal loss\u201d is valuable in writerly terms: she better understands what so many others are going through. But for some, it is, if they\u2019re honest, a boon in terms of coverage, if not in sales: with fewer books being published, less obvious titles are more likely to be reviewed.</p> <p>This said, writers cannot look forward, this year, to going out into the world to talk about their books. Literary festivals are a major victim of the virus. Hay and Edinburgh fell early, and others followed. Cheltenham, held in October, is still booking writers. But it\u2019s hard to see, realistically, how it can go ahead; social distancing will not allow for crowds in muggy tents. \u201cA few weeks ago, we were still planning to deliver a physical festival this autumn,\u201d says Sarah-Jane Roberts, the co-director of the <a href=\"https://www.manchesterliteraturefestival.co.uk/\">Manchester </a><a href=\"https://www.manchesterliteraturefestival.co.uk/\">literature </a><a href=\"https://www.manchesterliteraturefestival.co.uk/\">festival</a>. \u201cBut the ongoing uncertainties and concerns around the pandemic has made this more unlikely. We\u2019re deeply disappointed, and though we\u2019re resilient as a festival, and have a wonderful team of trustees and partnership organisations, we do worry about the next few years, and the long-term effects of losing a year\u2019s box office.\u201d</p> <p>The next 12 months are, she believes, going be highly challenging for the festival community. Lots of action around events has moved online. Emma Corfield-Walters has got together with three other independents \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.forumbooksshop.com/\">Forum Books</a> in Corbridge, <a href=\"https://www.bookabookshop.co.uk/\">Booka Books</a> of Oswestry and <a href=\"https://www.linghams.co.uk/\">Linghams, Heswall</a> \u2013 to produce a series of events on Facebook Live (authors who have appeared so far include <a href=\"https://www.bigissue.com/culture/robert-webb-marian-keyes-bookstores-lockdown/\">Robert Webb and Marian Keyes</a>). Today sees the conclusion of <a href=\"https://bigbookweekend.com/\">The Big Book Weekend</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/04/the-big-book-weekend-a-literary-festival-in-your-own-home\">virtual festival</a> organised by writer Kit de Waal and Molly Flatt of the <em>Bookseller</em><em>, </em>produced in association with BBC Arts, which featured 27 author events, each of which should have taken place at a cancelled festival. But while these initiatives are spirited, popular and may sell books, there\u2019s no ticket revenue in online. They are no substitute, either, for a shared experience; for the sound of applause and the prospect of a drink, a bun or a deckchair later.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s light at the end of that tunnel, and the indies have been incredible, delivering books by skateboard and so on</p> <footer> <cite>Jeremy Travathan, Macmillan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Philip Jones has edited <em>The Bookseller</em> since 2012. \u201cI\u2019m often accused of being a Pollyanna when it comes to the trade,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this period has challenged even me. Wherever you turn, something\u2019s damaged.\u201d What\u2019s striking, however, is the positivity to be found almost everywhere. Sales have begun to recover. \u201cThe supermarkets and Amazon are getting back to normal,\u201d says Jeremy Travathan. \u201cThere\u2019s light at the end of that tunnel, and the indies have been incredible, delivering books by skateboard and so on. We kept on our sales reps, the better to support them. A great thing that has come out of this has to do with the ecosystem. In normal times, you\u2019re negotiating to get the best deal you can. It can be tense and difficult. But now we\u2019re working with retailers and printers to make sure they\u2019re OK, while authors and agents are being incredibly thoughtful about things like cashflow. As a company, I don\u2019t think we are nervous about the future. Commercial fiction is doing very well, but even in literary fiction, we don\u2019t feel things are dire. We assume, like the government, that the market will be down 70% this quarter, and 50% in the third. But we predict that the fourth will be close to normal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f48d5c3b32665e172711fd9ab89f5258d275ab60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f48d5c3b32665e172711fd9ab89f5258d275ab60/0_177_2658_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Prior of Penguin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo Prior of Penguin. \u2018We want our website to be more of a destination.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin Books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Funding for prizes is going to be a worry in the future, and literacy charities are going to find the landscape much more severe. \u201cThe arts are going to have to fight so hard,\u201d says Jo Prior, who is chair of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction and a trustee of the <a href=\"https://literacytrust.org.uk/\">National Literacy Trust</a>. \u201cCorporate funding is going to be difficult to come by, and we haven\u2019t even begun to see the impact on organisations like the NLT, which do so much brilliant work.\u201d But \u2013 and this is surely the most significant point \u2013 there is a sense that this period has given many in the industry new perspectives (and, perhaps, a kick up the backside). For Stephen Page of Faber, for instance, working from home, about which he used to be sceptical, has caused him to think about how publishing might be more inclusive. \u201cTown hall stuff is difficult [when people are at home],\u201d he says. \u201cBut one thing that has occurred to us has to do with regionality. The vast majority of people who work at Faber now have to be able to get into the office [in Bloomsbury], but this experience shows people <em>can</em> work from anywhere \u2013 and a more distributed workforce means a more inclusive workforce. That\u2019s an interesting thought.\u201d The lockdown has also accelerated companies\u2019 thinking about online. \u201cWe\u2019re learning better to connect with readers,\u201d says Prior. \u201cWe want our website to be more of a destination. People are loving our <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/penguin-perspectives/\">Penguin Perspectives</a> series [in which the likes of <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2020/april/nick-hornby-coronavirus-essay-bbc.html\">Nick Hornby</a> and <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2020/april/philip-pullman-coronavirus-essay-change.html\">Philip Pullman</a> write about the issues of the day]. Publishers can introduce writers to people in an unmediated way: that has become real in this period, and I think it will be lasting.\u201d</p> <p>Above all, this time of seclusion has put the book centre stage once again; it has not seemed so alive, or so vital, in many years. \u201cPeople need stories,\u201d says Kevin Duffy. \u201cThey take comfort in them.\u201d He points to the success of Blue Moose\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/29/leonard-and-hungry-paul-ronan-hession-review\">Leonard and Hungry Paul</a> </em>by R\u00f3n\u00e1n Hession, a novel about two ordinary men, and kindness. \u201cPeople have told me that in lockdown this has been a balm for their souls. I get emails on a daily basis thanking me for it.\u201d Beyond their anxiety, I sense in those I talk to a certain excitement; a recalibration of sorts. \u201cThe last four or five years in publishing have been great,\u201d says Stephen Page. \u201cWe\u2019re in mourning for them. But you can only dwell on that for a few moments before you say: the reading and the writing are still there. Original work will come out of this lockdown, just as it did out of austerity; it has shone a light on globalisation, and the inconveniences that we have, to a degree forgotten, like mortality.\u201d He and I are talking via the screens of our laptops, and though his face keeps freezing, I can see how strongly he feels. \u201cWe <em>are </em>going to have change,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel sure this is a [permanently] changed environment. But my vocation as a publisher feels very central and important. Reading has had an exciting six weeks. It\u2019s breathing for some people. Now we just have to figure out the next bit.\u201d</p>",

Ever since the pandemic broke out in Wuhan, Chinese wet markets have been denounced as despicable and vile. Yet when <a href=\"https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/coronavirus-is-nature-sending-us-a-message/\">Alan Levinovitz lived in China</a>, \u201cwandering through the open-air stalls felt liberating and authentic, a welcome change from sterile supermarkets where the chicken lies behind glass, plastic-wrapped by faceless corporations\u201d. Here was \u201cmeat in its natural state: unrefrigerated, unprocessed, unpackaged, uncooked and sometimes unslaughtered\u201d.</p> <p>Levinovitz, associate professor of religion at James Madison University, had already finished writing his new book, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/natural-9781788161985.html\">Natural</a>,</em> before the pandemic was unleashed. It is, nevertheless, an indispensable read, not least for all the \u201chumans are the virus\u201d memers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Societies are structured in ways that ensure that innovation and development remain the privilege of the few</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Concepts of \u201cnature\u201d and of the \u201cnatural\u201d have, Levinovitz shows, become synonyms for \u201cGod\u201d and the \u201choly\u201d. Humans are sinners not because we have disobeyed God but because we have violated nature, our teacher, in whose wisdom we must discover the moral rules by which we ought to live.</p> <p>Such a moral appeal to nature has long been the means of justifying particular human laws and structures. From interracial relationships to homosexuality, certain activities are deemed as transgressing natural boundaries and so to be forbidden. A ban on interracial marriage, as a Pennsylvania judge observed in 1865, was necessary to prevent the \u201ccorruption of races\u201d.</p> <p>Many supporters of interracial and same-sex marriage ironically also appeal to nature. Racial mixing, 19th-century campaigners argued, is found throughout history. Non-human species, contemporary LBGTQ activists insist, also exhibit same-sex attraction. \u201cNatural goodness,\u201d Levinovitz observes, is \u201ca mercenary ethic that anyone can hire to fight for their cause.\u201d It\u2019s one of the qualities of both God and nature that he or she is always on our side.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just supposedly aberrant lifestyles that are condemned as unnatural. From IVF to genetically modified food, from vaccines to cloning, critics view many scientific and technological advances as the desecration of nature. How nature <em>is</em> becomes seen as a template for what humans <em>ought</em> to do. And yet so much of human life \u2013 from the aspirin we take to alleviate pain to the fridge that helps prevent milk from souring \u2013 is a recognition that natural processes often work to our disadvantage, and the moral stance would be to keep them at bay.</p> <p>The romanticisation of the \u201cnatural\u201d is, Levinovitz notes, rooted in privilege. Only those who enjoy a lifestyle sufficiently protected from the ravages of nature have the licence to romanticise it. In countries with robust health systems, people have the dispensation to opt for natural childbirth, or alternative medicines, or reject vaccines. In much of the world in which \u201cnatural\u201d childbirth is an imposition on women, not a choice, both maternal and infant mortality rates are staggeringly high. It is poverty that condemns so many in the global south to rely on traditional medicine or to live without vaccines.</p> <p>After reading in the <em>New Yorker</em> about how much better was the \u201cnatural\u201d parenting style of the Matsigenka, a Peruvian Amazonian tribe, Levinovitz travelled to Peru to see for himself. He was disappointed that they lived not in a \u201cstate of nature\u201d but with solar panels and mobile phones. He asked a local whether he was \u201chappy about having electricity\u201d. \u201cHe looked at me with confusion,\u201d Levinovitz recalls: \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said flatly, as if explaining something to a child. \u2018Now we can see at night.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Of course, those who are most desperate for the unnatural wonders that people in rich nations take for granted \u2013 electricity, clean water, transport, refrigeration, medicines \u2013 are also most at risk from the depredations brought about by industrial society.

Half a million people were exposed to the toxin, and up to 16,000 may have died. Almost 40 years on, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/the-worlds-worst-industrial-disaster-is-still-unfolding/560726/\">the site is still not detoxified</a>.</p> <p>It is the poor, whether in rich countries or in the global south, who most suffer from industrial pollution, are most imperilled by climate change and most threatened by the consequences of the coronavirus. This is not because humans are violating nature, but because societies are structured in ways that ensure that innovation and development remain the privilege of the few, while depredation and ill health are the lot of the many.</p> <p>Challenging both the lack of development and environmental devastation requires not fatuous claims that \u201chumans are the virus\u201d but confronting policies that limit innovation, impose inequality and put profits before people. It is the \u201cbad\u201d of the social, not the \u201cgood\u201d of the natural, that we need to address.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

People are not talking about lifting lockdown to ease inequalities or reduce the economic impact but about the direct risk to themselves and their families.

The scheme was revived again in 2010, and Tuesday marks its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary. Anyone can participate, and all contributions are stored in the archive for posterity.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s human nature to want to record our own feelings,\u201d says MO\u2019s curator Fiona Courage. \u201cSome people in Wuhan have said: \u2018I wrote every day.

This is about the democratisation of all the channels of information, not just those that are instant or official.\u201d</p> <p>So, what are the diaries revealing? How big a gap exists between government action and what the public expects? Whether newfound community solidarity can continue beyond the immediate crisis?</p> <p>On 29 April, Professor Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England, during the government\u2019s daily briefing, called for more of what she termed, \u201clocal intelligence\u201d. Adams says \u201clocal intelligence\u201d ought to include these contributions from everyday life, in all its diversity and variations. Experts need to read the pulse of the public. \u201cThe government briefings are drowning in data but what makes the data meaningful is the connection between it and the stories that the public have to tell.

Can the latter, at least, last? Or will that become fractured by easing the lockdown?</p> <p>\u201cPeople are writing to tell us that while they have bent the rules responsibly, others are doing so blatantly,\u201d says Goulden. \u201cA relaxation in rules may become increasingly contested, confused and personally interpreted, possibly leading to sharper exchanges between people and more stark inequalities at a national level.\u201d</p> <p>However, when events are changing so fast during the pandemic, can the diaries and questionnaires have any permanent value? Goulden agrees that they can only provide a snapshot, and contributors are, of course, self selecting. Over time, though, they may provide an invaluable picture of what we have lived through and what may have permanently changed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ampltd.co.uk/digital_guides/mass_observation_archive_parts_1_to_3/Publishers-Note.aspx\">MO diaries during the war</a> years reflected patriotism and admiration of Churchill but they also revealed the regard some had for Hitler, and a far less gung-ho spirit than the government portrayed. There was also a strong expression of the growing expectation that whatever came after the war had to be better.</p> <p>So, will our contemporary diaries begin to record the limits on neighbourliness, respect for key workers and the NHS and mutual aid as we venture out of our homes? Or will they underline that health, wellbeing, fairness in society and all that has been lost to communities during austerity \u2013 parks, libraries, children\u2019s centres, youth clubs, community centres \u2013 have a newfound alue that no government can afford to ignore post-Covid?</p> <h2><strong>Diary extracts</strong></h2> <h2><br></h2> <p><strong>Woman, aged 30-44<br></strong>We live in a fifth-floor flat in London, so we have been finding things a bit cramped and I had trouble getting my medications, but when the council support kicked in, this helped.

  "<p>From Eliza Hittman, the remarkable writer-director of <em>It Felt Like Love</em><em> </em>and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/26/beach-rats-review\">Beach Rats</a></em>, comes another drama that manages to blend the gritty authenticity of a documentary with the poetic sensibility of pure cinema. In her impressively measured and beautifully understated third feature, Hittman tells an oft-hidden story of reproductive rights \u2013 an age-old issue that has urgent contemporary relevance. Yet <em>Never Rarely Sometimes Always</em> never feels polemical. On the contrary, it is perhaps best described as a perfectly observed portrait of female friendship; a coming-of-age story with road-movie inflections, piercingly honest and deeply affecting.</p> <p>Feature first-timer (and accomplished musician) Sidney Flanigan is superb as Autumn, a 17-year-old from Pennsylvania who discovers that she cannot get an abortion in her home town without parental consent. Quietly desperate, Autumn reluctantly confides in her more outgoing cousin Skylar (rising star Talia Ryder, soon to be seen in Spielberg\u2019s <em>West Side Story</em>), who agrees to accompany her across state lines to New York. The pair imagine that the trip will be brief but find themselves spending days and nights on the streets, waiting for the procedure that Autumn was denied in Pennsylvania.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hittman has described her films as \u2018a narrative about a girl carrying around a lot of pain and burden, and the loneliness of it all\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Inspired by \u201cthese untold journeys that women take\u201d (Ann Rossiter\u2019s <em>Ireland\u2019s Hidden Diaspora:</em><em> The </em><em>\u201cAbortion Trail</em><em>\u201d and the Making of a London-Irish Underground, 1980-2000</em> apparently proved an instructive work), Hittman\u2019s drama may be fictional, but it is firmly rooted in factual research. Like Kitty Green\u2019s current release <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/03/the-assistant-review-julia-garner-kitty-green-me-too-office-drama-weinstein\">The Assistant</a>, </em>everything about <em>Never Rarely Sometimes Always</em> has a matter-of-fact veracity: from heartbreaking early scenes in which we see Autumn helplessly punching her own bruised stomach to her very different experiences at a pregnancy centre in Pennsylvania and a Planned Parenthood clinic in Brooklyn.</p> <p>Indeed, in the pivotal scene from which the film takes its title, it is not an actor but a real counsellor, Kelly Chapman, who asks Autumn about her history, her health, her safety, using a series of set questions to which those multiple choice answers apply. Autumn\u2019s responses, which include significant silences, speak volumes not only about her own experiences but about those of so many women who find themselves in a similar situation.</p> <p>Brief scenes of anti-abortion activists picketing clinics remind us of the crisis facing women\u2019s rights in Trump\u2019s increasingly retrogressive America. Yet, as with her previous features, Hittman\u2019s primary focus is her characters \u2013 their lives, their experiences, their dreams and disappointments. Early scenes of Autumn and Skylar in their home town, where both work part-time in the local grocery store, are an object lesson in how to convey vast amounts of information with minimal dialogue; snapshots of an environment that has shaped the lives of these two very different characters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/22/meet-the-new-hotshots-of-american-film-making-director-dee-rees-mudbound-eliza-hittman\">Meet the new hotshots of American film-making</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Significant, too, that the only time Autumn really seems to verbalise her feelings is when she plays a solo version of He\u2019s Got the Power at the school talent contest, turning the Exciters\u2019 upbeat 60s hit into a plaintive ballad (\u201cHe makes me do things I don\u2019t wanna do\u201d), provoking cries of derision from the audience, followed by an awful moment of emptiness, and then a steely continuation through barely restrained tears.</p> <p>Hittman has described <em>Never Rarely Sometimes Always</em> as \u201ca narrative about a girl carrying around a lot of pain and burden, and the loneliness of it all\u201d. That loneliness is certainly a key part of the film\u2019s emotional palette, captured with great insight and understanding. Yet ultimately it is the growing bond between Autumn and Skylar that sticks in the mind, beautifully expressed in a strange moment of silent hand-holding that quite took my breath away.</p> <p>Plaudits to French cinematographer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Louvart, who did such sensual work on <em>Beach Rats</em>, and who here manages to capture moments of intense intimacy in unobtrusive fashion. In a film in which so much is expressed through minute gestures, Louvart keeps a remarkable balance between the geography of these characters\u2019 faces and that of the ever-changing landscape through which they pass. Through her camera, we become both observers and participants \u2013 watching these young women\u2019s lives but also empathetically experiencing their shared journeys.</p> <p>The result is a film that combines the melancholy magic of John Schlesinger\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/12/midnight-cowboy-review-john-schlesinger-jon-voight-dustin-hoffman\">Midnight Cowboy</a></em> with the humanist artfulness of the Dardenne brothers\u2019 finest neorealist works. Perfectly pitched and sensitively played, this is truthful, powerful and profoundly moving fare from a film-maker at the very top of her game. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw_QTKr2rc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hjw_QTKr2rc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjw_QTKr2rc&amp;feature=emb_title\">Watch a trailer for Never Rarely Sometimes Always.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <ul> <li><p>Never Rarely Sometimes Always streams on multiple platforms from 13 May</p></li> </ul>",

He went to a friend whose theatre company, <a href=\"http://www.withwings.co.uk/\" title=\"\">withWings</a>, took inventive musical adaptations to the Edinburgh fringe. That year they were doing <em>Le Bossu</em>, a retelling of <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>. Patel mentioned that he wanted to get out of his comfort zone and do some theatre. \u201cHe came back to me and said, \u2018Cool, well, I can offer you the role of a pigeon.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Most actors who had spent their lives being watched by 8m viewers, four nights a week, would be unwilling to start again at the bottom rung of acting. (The pigeon was a bit part.) But Patel, now 29, leapt at the chance.</p> <p>\u201cAnd, honestly, playing that pigeon, for so many reasons, was one of the most important things I ever did. I remember that feeling being side of stage as the lights went down \u2013 that fear was so visceral. Then, as the run went on, it slowly ebbed away. It let me become a more extroverted performer, which set me up for what came next.\u201d</p> <p>What came next was a starring role in Danny Boyle\u2019s counter-factual caper <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/05/yesterday-review-the-beatles-richard-curtis-danny-boyle-himesh-patel\" title=\"\">Yesterday</a></em>, in which Patel stars as Jack Malik who, after a freak thunderstorm, is the only person on earth who remembers the music of the Beatles. Malik becomes a star overnight, plays Wembley with Ed Sheeran, and is hailed as the greatest songwriter of his generation. The film transformed Patel\u2019s life with similar force. His follow-up roles have all screamed prestige: leading turns in Armando Iannucci\u2019s sci-fi spoof <em>Avenue 5</em> and the BBC\u2019s adaptation of Eleanor Catton\u2019s <em>The Luminaries</em>, the 2013 novel, set in the New Zealand goldrush.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"84096c19d2116a39f2b26698956e4af45af16491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84096c19d2116a39f2b26698956e4af45af16491/0_1219_4912_6141/800.jpg\" alt=\"Himesh Patel in profile in a brightly coloured patterned shirt\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s the responsibility, as someone British, to say that this story about Indian soldiers is a British story\u2019: Himesh Patel.

When Patel started shooting, he was most concerned about how freezing Illinois gets in January. Then, as more news came from China, the strangeness of the situation started to sink in.</p> <p>\u201cThe episode we filmed was the beginning of the outbreak. It felt incredibly odd, making a show about a global pandemic, and now here we are.\u201d The oddest moment, he says, was finding out that production of a series about a pandemic was now on hold because of a pandemic. </p> <p>We meet on a weekday lunchtime at a pub in Islington, London in that eerie period before the enforced lockdown when pubs and restaurants are still open but people are furiously washing their hands and firing evil glares at anyone clearing their throat. The pub has posters declaring that the toilet doors have been jammed open so you don\u2019t have to touch any handles. It means the faint sound of ablutions can be heard throughout our conversation.</p> <p>Patel arrives straight from the photoshoot, an experience he tentatively enjoyed. His parents own a newsagents in the small village of Sawtry, near Cambridge, and he likes knowing that they\u2019ll get the papers in one morning and see photos of him looking suave. He hasn\u2019t always been a fan of Sunday supplements. As a teenager, he had to help out his folks by doing the local paper round. Weekends, he says, were always the worst. \u201cThe papers were full of magazines! So I\u2019d have to walk up the hill, then go back down, and then go further up the hill because you can\u2019t carry them all at once.\u201d</p> <p>His childhood days were crammed.</p> <p>As well as school and the paper round, he went to several different drama schools. He giggles when I ask what it was that set apart the kinds of kids he met at those after-school classes. \u201cWe were all a bit odd, mimicking things we\u2019d seen on telly, creating these little pop-culture storms within our own lives. Maybe some of us were quite attention-hungry, but we were alive with this energy. It\u2019s the antithesis of a maths lesson.

Patel was nervous in the audition for Tamwar Masood and thought he\u2019d ruined his chances when he told producers he didn\u2019t really watch the show. But they saw something in him and, once on board, he went about turning Tamwar into one of the most unusual characters in soap. He was removed and analytical. He existed almost outside the show, a kind of geeky flaneur who saw the absurdity of Albert Square in the same way the audience did. In a show that\u2019s always been about dramatic bust-ups and big acting, Patel played against the action: quiet and pitying, often lingering in the back of someone else\u2019s family crisis. Patel quickly became a fan favourite. His character\u2019s marriage to Afia Khan (Meryl Fernandes) won the pair <em>Inside Soap </em>award for best wedding.</p> <p>His parents, though proud, were also insistent that the paper round must continue. \u201cThose were the days,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d be, like, \u2018It\u2019s the weekend, I\u2019m trudging round the village in the rain, why am I having to do this?\u2019 But I look back on it fondly. It was important for me to be on national TV and be doing a paper round at the same time. It was just a daily reminder of being brought back down to earth.\u201d</p> <p>By his mid-20s, Patel was beginning to look at the career paths available to him. \u201cThere\u2019s a thin line between being on a soap and being a celebrity. You often see people from <em>EastEnders</em> going to do <em>I\u2019m a Celebrity</em> or <em>Strictly</em> \u2013 which is great if that\u2019s what you want to do. But from going to a lot of these awards ceremonies, it wasn\u2019t somewhere I was ever going to enjoy myself.\u201d</p> <p>He said the decision to leave was both easy and scary. \u201cI\u2019d been doing it since I was 16 and it was all I\u2019d known as an adult. It was a leap of faith. I remember on that last day I drove out the gates that last time, and I just thought: here we go, let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>His certainty about wanting to do something more than <em>Strictly</em> is the result of his particular upbringing, he says. The closest town growing up was Huntingdon, in the heart of John Major\u2019s old constituency. (Patel\u2019s mother would always point out his house when they drove past.) He didn\u2019t have any traumatic experiences of racism growing up, \u201cbut there were very few people who looked like me and there is a part of you that you consciously or subconsciously dilute in order to fit in. There are a lot of feelings that I grew up with that I later started to realise I wasn\u2019t alone in feeling, and that perhaps there\u2019s something to be done about that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c92a3bea7b60d69014f63b14d708a4cbe2cb7f1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c92a3bea7b60d69014f63b14d708a4cbe2cb7f1b/0_42_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himesh Patel on stage with a guitar in a scene from \u201cYesterday.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guitar man: in Yesterday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Prime/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His adolescence left him with a dogged feeling of responsibility \u2013 to make it easier for the next generation of kids like him. He talks about \u201cresponsibility\u201d a lot. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s the responsibility, as someone British, to say: \u2018This is also British, the story that I\u2019m telling you about my parents, or Indian soldiers that fought in the world wars.\u2019 These stories are also British. At a time when people want to limit the idea of Britishness, physically speaking, I think I\u2019d quite like to broaden it.\u201d</p> <p>He gives the example of Britain\u2019s colonial history in India, something he feels mainstream Britain has never properly wrestled with. \u201cWe watched a lot of Indian movies growing up, and every now and then there\u2019d be one about British rule, but I never really learned about that in school. So there was a disconnect between these films I was watching, set during a very turbulent time in India\u2019s history, and school, where we might be taught that Gandhi was a liberator, but not what he was liberating from.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not angry at people who haven\u2019t taken the time to learn that history, he says, but he sees his role as bringing those stories to them. He talks about watching <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> in history class, how it brought to life a war he would have otherwise struggled to imagine. \u201cOne of the most powerful ways of finding out about stuff is TV and film. If I can, in my current position, get the ball rolling on some of those stories then I\u2019d really like to do that.\u201d (He says he has writing and acting projects in the works that would fulfil that brief.)</p> <p>It\u2019s a sense of duty that imbues much of Patel\u2019s life. Even when we\u2019re talking about <em>The Luminaries</em>, in which he plays Emery Staines, a young prospector, conversation veers back to the importance of minority stories in national history. During the six months he spent in New Zealand filming the show, which will air later this year, he was impressed by the public\u2019s understanding of a wide range of historical events. \u201cI fell in love with the culture. For a country that was a colonial outpost, as it were, they\u2019ve really made efforts to integrate the indigenous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/m-ori\" title=\"\">M\u0101ori</a> culture. The country is not without its troubles, but we went up to Waitangi, where the British signed a treaty with the M\u0101ori, and even just tiny gestures, like the signs being both in English and in M\u0101ori. A lot of people who I met who were not of M\u0101ori descent were just as aware of that history, which was commendable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3932dabf4530e7a189fc137a13648f7bfa23f33e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3932dabf4530e7a189fc137a13648f7bfa23f33e/869_48_2249_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himesh Patel with Eve Hewson in The Luminaries.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Costume drama: with Eve Hewson in The Luminaries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One concrete change he is trying to make is through his membership of Bafta, which was heavily criticised for all-white shortlists in a number of award categories. Patel was one of several actors who offered alternative shortlists in protest: \u201cThe oddity for me is how an amazing film such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho-south-korean-satire\" title=\"\">Parasite</a></em> did so well and yet none of the actors got nominated.\u201d</p> <p>I ask whether he ever feels annoyed having to hand over his annual Bafta membership fee (not cheap at \u00a3495), when the awards fail to recognise diverse talent again and again. Does there ever come a point where the institutions themselves should be left to fail?</p> <p>\u201cI know some people feel like that, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m there yet because the impact of things like the Baftas is still huge. I grew up in a rural place, naive to how a lot of the industry works. For me watching the Baftas was a big deal. When <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/slumdog-millionaire\" title=\"\">Slumdog</a> Millionaire</em> won all those awards I thought, wow it\u2019s relevant on that level. So now I\u2019m a member I want to change things from the inside.\u201d</p> <p>Patel has a persistent seriousness about him. His manner is more that of an activist: dogged and thoughtful. The paper round, the pigeon, the desire to make movies that get shown in a classroom\u2026 it all reflects a person entirely uninterested in flashness. We all want to be seen as compassionate, but surely he has moments of indulging his new wealth and celebrity? What\u2019s been his most lavish purchase?</p> <p>\u201cMmm, well recently I kept seeing Teslas everywhere, so I did have a brief look at their website kind of going, \u2018Well, it\u2019s good for the planet isn\u2019t it?\u2019 But it is still very expensive. And I live in London, so I don\u2019t need a car.\u201d Instead, he says, he bought a new camera. \u201cMy dad always had cameras around. I like the very quiet way of saying things through photography. There\u2019s something about the ambiguity, and the silence of a photo...\u201d I am convinced, with the sombreness of this remark, this is the real Himesh.</p> <p><em>The Luminaries will screen on BBC Two later this year</em></p> <p><em>Grooming by Petra Sellge at The Wall Group using Living Proof; photographer\u2019s assistant Harry Brayne; fashion assistant Peter Bevan; shot at Big Sky Studios</em></p>",
  "<p>\u201cWe are like one big family,\u201d says Carolyn Doyle of the bond between the marshals of the British Grand Prix. \u201cWe are there because we love it and we want to achieve the same thing \u2013 that\u2019s what makes it really special.\u201d</p> <p>Much as it does bring great pleasure to this selfless collective, the sport knows their presence is invaluable. As Silverstone considers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/silverstone-confirm-plan-to-host-two-consecutive-grands-prix\">hosting two consecutive races</a> behind closed doors in July, the volunteer marshals are having to consider the new realities imposed on Formula One by the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Doyle, 28, has been marshalling for five years, during which she has worked at two British Grands Prix. It is clearly a labour of love and one she shares with her fiance, Keith Bond, himself a marshal for 15 years, including seven GPs at the circuit. They are members of the marshals team there and had been selected to work at this year\u2019s race.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/08/f1-on-track-july-resumption-drivers-association-safety-plan-coronavirus\">F1 on track for July resumption after drivers' association backs safety plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The presence of marshals is vital for safety reasons and as F1 attempts to go racing again and potentially hold a double-header at Silverstone, they are as crucial as the drivers and cars. Doyle and Bond usually marshal at circuits across the UK most weekends but they recognise that much as the sport is desperate to get back on track it should only do so if it will not pose any additional risk to the health of the wider community.</p> <p>\u201cWe did a couple of rallies before lockdown but then decided we wouldn\u2019t attend race meetings \u2013 we just thought it wasn\u2019t the responsible thing to do,\u201d says Doyle. \u201cPeople we spoke to had similar feelings. As much as we want to get back to it we recognise what is the responsible decision, even if it is not the desired decision.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2db2c1d0d014bd7044a4d0770a5f55f1bf23d06f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2db2c1d0d014bd7044a4d0770a5f55f1bf23d06f/41_0_900_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"Carolyn Doyle and her fiance Keith Bond are marshals at Silverstone but only want to see motor racing return if it has no impact on the health system.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolyn Doyle and her fiance Keith Bond are marshals at Silverstone but only want to see motor racing return if it has no impact on the health system.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Keith Bond</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If F1 makes the decision to go ahead at Silverstone, the numbers involved are no small beer. Last year there were 980 people ensuring the safe functioning of the track. These included rescue units, recovery crews and medical coverage, with a doctor on every one of the 34 marshalling posts. That total does include customer service volunteers and spectator marshals, neither of whom would be required for a race without fans, but for track marshals alone the figures are between 350and 400.</p> <p>For these hundreds of volunteers the outbreak has posed new questions. \u201cOn post it is possible to socially distance and marshal,\u201d Bond says. \u201cIt would be easy to stand two metres apart. But we couldn\u2019t socially distance if we were dealing with an incident and we needed to be close together. If that was needed we would just get on with it, that is what we are there for.\u201d</p> <p>F1\u2019s intent is to test all team, broadcasting and logistical personnel for the virus before race meetings. Their concept of a safe, \u201cclosed biosphere\u201d will depend on ensuring all the marshals are included but Motorsport UK, which oversees marshalling of the event, has yet to confirm if it will carry out testing. This could be key for many marshals agreeing to take part. \u201cIf people are tested and not showing any symptoms that means we can operate in a greatly safer environment,\u201d says Bond.</p> <p>Doyle, however, expressed concern that the sport must also take into account the bigger picture. \u201cI would feel very uncomfortable if there was an incident and a driver was taken to a hospital,\u201d she says. \u201cEven a driver with a minor injury that requires medical attention is an unnecessary burden on the health system at the moment. We all want to get back to racing, we all miss it, but it seems a slightly unnecessary risk. A lot of fellow marshals work in the NHS and it doesn\u2019t seem fair to put any more on them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nadine Lewis is the national chair of the British Motorsports Marshals Club, whose members also work at the British Grand Prix.

It must also consider simple logistics far from the paddock that mean a great deal to the volunteers, such as how they physically distance on the campsites where they stay or where they would obtain food with no commercial retailers on site.</p> <p>If the questions can be answered, the marshalling family is eager to get back to it and as always the sport will owe them a great debt. Typically of this devoted breed it is not one for which they expect any remuneration. \u201cI have never wanted to be paid for doing it, I do it because I love it,\u201d says Doyle.</p>",
  "<p>A commonplace criticism of political parties is that they have drifted \u201cinto their comfort zone\u201d, which mostly means that Labour talks a lot about raising spending, while the Conservatives talk about cutting taxes. But politicians have comfort zones that are operational as well as ideological: ways of working that they find more attractive than others.</p> <p>In late 2014, one ambitious young shadow cabinet minister asked his aides to draw up a 14-point plan to help him become leader of the Labour party. Step two involved an itemised list of Labour MPs, each of whom, he was told, he needed to wine and dine if he was to have any hope of making a successful bid at the job. The frontbencher in question contemplated evening after evening spent in conversation with his colleagues versus time spent with his wife and children. Surely, he reasoned, he could achieve the same end by writing thoughtful columns in the newspapers and delivering wide-ranging speeches? His leadership bid never recovered.</p> <p>The government has, similarly, fallen back into its comfort zone in the fight against coronavirus. There are few problems in life that Whitehall doesn\u2019t seek to solve through swallowing up our personal details: if the second coming were to take place in modern Britain, the authorities would doubtless immediately want Jesus to fill in 2,000 years of backdated tax returns.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The desire to know our secrets is present in essentially every British government regardless of its political hue</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Officialdom\u2019s addiction to hoovering up information has numerous benefits: it has allowed the Office for National Statistics to establish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">a link between ethnicity and the risk of dying</a> of Covid-19, because it was able to eliminate other explanations \u2013 income level, household type, occupation and so on \u2013 through the use of the vast reams of information that the state collects.</p> <p>But the downside of the government\u2019s appetite for surveillance can be found in the NHSX <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-is-it-safe-and-will-people-use-it\">contact tracing app</a> that is a vital plank of any attempt to keep new infections down and isolate outbreaks once lockdown ends. Although the app asks only for a postcode, storing the information centrally will allow the government, armed with the huge amounts of data it already holds, to identify other facts and secrets about the app\u2019s users. That horrifies privacy campaigners, but the biggest problem in practice will be the efficiency of the app. As designed, it is a battery hog that saps the life from users\u2019 phones \u2013 probably a far bigger barrier to people downloading it than its implications for surveillance. A second app is now in development \u2013 one that will be free of the government\u2019s tendency to collect as much information as it can about citizens.</p> <p>The endless desire to know our secrets is present in essentially every British government, regardless of its political hue. But this government has also reverted to a comfort zone that is distinct to itself: treating the battle against the virus as if it were a battle against a rival political party, one to be defeated by a savvy media strategy and careful leaks to preferred outlets. Genuine transparency should be kept to a minimum, with real news confined to setpiece events featuring the government\u2019s biggest gun, the prime minister.</p> <p>As a method to dispatch Labour in 2019, it worked like a charm. As an approach to defeating Covid-19 it lacks a certain something. Leaks beget leaks \u2013 cabinet ministers see that leaks are emerging from \u201cDowning Street\u201d and grumble to journalists; civil servants surmise that their bosses are spreading stories too, and also complain to the press. The process has also led to a muddled understanding of what exactly is being eased and when.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One Conservative gleefully told me that they would make Starmer 'a collaborator' in any politically painful decisions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reality is that the changes to how we live \u2013 people to be able to go out for exercise twice a day, garden centres to be reopened \u2013 are minor and sensible. The disease spreads less effectively in the open air, provided people observe physical distancing. It\u2019s easy to observe social distancing in garden centres, which will, in any case, probably fold if they cannot reopen over the coming months, which are as important to them as Christmas is to the high street. But the drip-drip of headlines suggesting an \u201cend\u201d to lockdown has made some voters think the government is taking unnecessary risks, and encouraged others to take unnecessary risks of their own, safe in the apparent certainty that the lockdown will soon be ended.</p> <p>The comfort zone strategy has real long-term downsides, too. MPs generally agree that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/pmqs-verdict-floundering-johnson-meets-calm-and-focused-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a> has had a good week: the Labour leader\u2019s call for the government to publish its lockdown exit plan has been validated twice over, once by the unhelpful culture of leaks and hints about what is to come, and once because, when all is said and done, the government will have actually produced and published an exit strategy.</p> <p>The fear among Labour MPs, however, is that the government will try to bind Starmer to any unpopular measures he signs up to. One Conservative gleefully told me that they would make Starmer \u201ca collaborator\u201d in any politically painful decisions. Hardly anyone believes that the global increase in the popularity of incumbent governments will last all the way to the next general election, but many think it will be harder for Starmer to criticise the government\u2019s unpopular decisions \u2013 of which, it\u2019s assumed, there will be many, due to the economic consequences of the lockdown \u2013 if he has been brought into the fold.</p> <p>Boris Johnson has had regular conversations with the opposition parties, but he has thus far failed to establish any crucial moments at which Starmer\u2019s hands are also at the tiller. The leaks have also allowed the devolved governments in Scotland and Wales, neither of which have been without fault during the crisis, to assert their distinctiveness from Westminster simply by clearly communicating a near-identical approach openly and transparently, rather than through the pages of favoured papers.</p> <p>But the comfort zone approach has obscured an issue that ought to be a real source of political pain for Johnson and Starmer. The way out of lockdown isn\u2019t a mystery: governments must first reduce the rate of new transmissions to as close to zero as possible, and then have the necessary infrastructure to test at scale, track the movements of possible carriers, and isolate the infected as and when new outbreaks emerge.</p> <p>There are two barriers in the UK\u2019s path to that destination. The first is logistical: Britain doesn\u2019t yet have the capacity to implement a system of testing, tracking and isolating infections. That is a painful area for the Conservatives, as it means discussing whether they have fallen short in procurement, or if the spending decisions taken since 2010 have left the state ill prepared for crisis.</p> <p>But the second barrier is painful for both parties: a functioning system of testing, tracing and isolating new cases would require a major reduction in our liberties and a prolonged period of increased surveillance. It\u2019s far from clear that there is a majority in parliament for that approach, and it\u2019s not a natural political position for Johnson or Starmer. Both are commonly said to be \u201cinstinctive liberals\u201d, though their records at the big organisations they ran, whether as mayor of London or director of public prosecutions, are muddier than that.</p> <p>What matters more is that most British people are not liberals, instinctive or otherwise. It\u2019s easy to forget that while New Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/27/theresa-may-scrapping-id-cards\">ID cards scheme</a> was unpopular within the party and in parliament, it enjoyed <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/05/12/majority-brits-support-introducing-id-cards\">majority support</a> in the country as a whole. The great British public has enthusiastically embraced CCTV, and no successful political party in the democratic era has been without a generous bung to the police. Whether the SNP in 2007, Johnson in 2019 or even Jeremy Corbyn in 2017, the way to win votes and influence people in British politics has long run on an authoritarian axis.</p> <p>So what will happen if British politics is dominated by two men, neither of whom are instinctively minded to point to the clearest and safest way out of lockdown? The lesson of Johnson\u2019s recent electoral success, in which he tapped into a political demand that has long existed \u2013 for a party that is tough on migrants and criminals but spends lavishly on the NHS and schools \u2013 but has been unavailable to voters since 2005, is that eventually the voters get what the voters want. If neither Johnson nor Starmer is willing to leave their comfort zone, they may find that someone else will.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Bush is the political editor of the <em>New Statesman</em></p>",

Samuel Roscoe, a senior lecturer in Operations Management at the University of Sussex, gave evidence to the Commons trade select committee last month calling for a \u201cmajor structural change in supply chains\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we should be thinking about is having a parallel supply chain, where you have the ability and the manufacturing capacity to make critical drugs in the UK,\u201d he told MPs.</p> <p>Drug shortages are not new, and are a global problem. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) now has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/medicines-that-cannot-be-parallel-exported-from-the-uk\" title=\"\">196 medicines which cannot be hoarded or exported from the UK</a> \u2013 so-called parallel exports. There were only 29 products on the list at the beginning of 2020.</p> <p>Many of the shortages relate to hormone replacement therapy. Women going through the menopause have experienced shortages since 2018. The prospect of a no-deal Brexit also alarmed diabetes sufferers because all insulin is imported. Asthma inhalers \u2013 some of which are made in Britain \u2013 are also in short supply in some parts of the UK.</p> <p>Global supply chains are long and complex. About 70% of all base ingredients for drugs \u2013 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) \u2013 are manufactured in China. Those ingredients are blended and packaged into medicines \u2013 India is the biggest supplier to the UK \u2013 but some are made in Europe and about 20% to 25% are made in the UK, according to the British Generic Manufacturers\u2019 Association (BGMA).</p> <p>In evidence to the Commons trade select committee, published last week, the BGMA said there had not been any direct impact on supply because pharmaceutical companies hold large stockpiles of APIs. Disruption caused by the Chinese lockdown had not yet affect those supplies, it said.</p> <p>\u201cA multi-layered approach is needed, which may well need to include, in addition to an enhanced UK manufacturing base, holding appropriate buffer stocks in the UK to deal with unanticipated future shocks to supply or peaks in demand; investment in the ability to increase or refocus production of specific medicines in times of crisis; and regulatory and procurement changes to incentivise manufacturers to build in resilience to their supply chains rather than simply to charge the lowest price.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, which represents pharmaceutical firms that make branded prescription medicines, said the supply chain had been remarkably resilient.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the scale of the global crisis, really, there is only one group of medicines where there is a supply disruption notice from the MHRA,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt always makes sense to ask the question: how can we be more even more resilient in the future? And I do agree that part of the story should be around what can we manufacture in this country. It makes sense in the UK to think about incentives and think about what can and should be manufactured here. But I think it should be one part of a holistic strategy that also includes making sure that the global system still operates, and is as diverse as possible.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Twenty years ago, the US Department of Defense set out a clear warning: \u201cHistorians in the next millennium may find that the 20th century\u2019s greatest fallacy was the belief that infectious diseases were nearing elimination. The resultant complacency has actually increased the threat.\u201d</p> <p>Along with other western nations, federal and state governments in America had spent the previous decade or so dismantling public health programmes dealing with communicable diseases in order to concentrate funds on degenerative illnesses: diabetes, heart disease, cancer, stroke. Corporate investment in the development of new vaccines and antibiotics almost dried up, as if the battle that humans had waged over millennia against plague and pestilence had now been won \u2013 at least in the developed world. Michael Osterholm, the Minnesota state epidemiologist, informed US Congress in 1996: \u201cI am here to bring you the sobering and unfortunate news that our ability to detect and monitor infectious disease threats to health in this country is in serious jeopardy. . . . For 12 of the states or territories, there is no one who is responsible for food or water-borne disease surveillance. You could sink the Titanic in their back yard and they would not know they had water.\u201d</p> <p>In the years since, as Frank Snowden\u2019s illuminating history shows, that indifference became endemic. The World Health Organization has argued for years that the mechanics of our globalised economy, the dramatic increase in urbanisation and mass intercontinental travel has exponentially increased the chances for infectious disease to mutate and spread. It identified a record 1,100 \u201cworldwide epidemic events\u201d between 2002 and 2007. A year later, researchers identified 335 new human diseases that had emerged since the development of the polio vaccine in the late 1950s, most of them originating in animals (many in bats). \u201cTheir names now run the gamut from A to Z \u2013 from avian flu to Zika,\u201d Snowden notes, \u201cand scientists caution that far more potentially dangerous pathogens exist than have so far been discovered.\u201d Yet still, when he finally acknowledged the destructive presence of Covid-19 in his nation\u2019s population, the primary response of the president of the US was one of genuine surprise: \u201cWho would have thought?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://history.yale.edu/people/frank-snowden\">Snowden</a>, an emeritus professor of history at Yale, believes that epidemic disease has shaped nations and civilisations every bit as starkly as economics or politics or war. One of the more depressing realisations in reading this necessary and persuasive book is that almost every line of it would apparently come as news to Donald J Trump: the terrible decades and centuries in the shadow of the bubonic plague, the desperate blight of smallpox and cholera and typhus and polio, and the enormous advances in public health brought about by sanitation and vaccination and antibiotics. All of that cumulative hard-won wisdom \u2013 the triumphs of Edward Jenner and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/09/butchering-art-review-joseph-listers-quest-grisly-world-victorian-medicine-lindsey-fitzharris\">Joseph Lister</a> and Alexander Fleming and Florence Nightingale and <a href=\"https://www.salk.edu/about/history-of-salk/jonas-salk/\">Jonas Salk</a> in persuading governments of the possibilities of their science \u2013 was erased from history by a president who believes injections of disinfectant might represent a novel cure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Napoleon\u2019s expansionist dreams were defeated by his inability to contain the spread of infections in his armies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Snowden\u2019s book began as an undergraduate lecture course at Yale during the immediate aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">ars</a> and Ebola, which exposed for him the vulnerability of modern society to sudden outbreaks of infectious diseases. No such course then existed. Snowden examined not only how the modern world was created in large part in response to the primary plague event, the Black Death, but also how that event still shadows the response of governments to epidemics.</p> <p>The trial and error measures of quarantine (the Venetian practice of holding the crew of trading ships in isolation for 40 days) and lockdown established \u201ca style of public health\u201d that \u201cconferred upon authorities the legitimating appearance of acting resolutely, knowledgably, and in accord with precedent\u201d. Sometimes those measures were justified, sometimes not, but in recent times, this book shows, they have been employed in large part to hide and mitigate a criminal lack of preparedness for what, with proper international coordination and immediate application of best practice, should be a predictable and manageable event.</p> <p>Of all the conditions that promote virulent disease, hubris emerges across the centuries as a prime mover. Napoleon\u2019s expansionist dreams were ultimately defeated not by the collective will of rival generals, but by his inability to predict or contain the spread of infections in his armies: he was defeated in the Caribbean in 1803 by an outbreak of yellow fever, and then in Russia in 1812, where the then largest assembled military force in human history was undone by dysentery and typhus.</p> <p>In an updated introduction to his book, Snowden traces a comparable arrogance in our own leaders, who have allowed global inequalities to foster the illusion that infectious diseases, old and new, are a thing of the past. As we enter the next phase of this pandemic, it is worth keeping in mind that there were, in 2014, more people suffering with TB, for example, than at any time in history (because of Covid restrictions, it is predicted that 1.4 million more people will die of that disease by 2025). Epidemics have never stopped being a fact of life and death for hundreds of millions of people across the world. Now that their presence has been brought home to all of us again, Snowden argues, the old wisdom that saved human societies in the past must be brought to the front and centre of government: \u201csalus populi, suprema lex esto\u201d, as the ancients had it; public health must be the highest law, and all else follows from it.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present</em> by Frank M Snowden is published by Yale University Press (\u00a316.99).

I\u2019ve done little photographic experiments, and they\u2019ve been OK. But by far the most meaningful thing that\u2019s happened to me is this letter exchange. In terms of the image itself, I just took a picture of the letter with my iPhone, using the screen on my bedroom window to make the writing illegible, though a few words pop out here and there. I really do find it interesting to reflect on the constraints of prison, which are a million times worse than what I\u2019m going through, and all the psychological weight of incarceration that you can\u2019t even imagine.</p> <p>I feel like I\u2019m rattling my cage at the moment, but it\u2019s so not a cage.

All you need is fresh dandelion flowers, sugar, a lemon and water. She suggested that perhaps it was something I could do with my granddaughter, Bella, because she knows we like making things together and doing things outside. Bella is six. In normal times we see each other quite a lot but because we\u2019re trying to obey the lockdown rules I haven\u2019t seen her for many weeks.</p> <p>Dandelions started to appear opposite my house and along the path where I take my daily walk, so even though I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be making the honey with her, I picked them and I\u2019m planning to follow the recipe. I\u2019m not vegan and neither is she but that is irrelevant, really \u2013 I just know it is something she would have loved to do.</p> <p>It was a coincidence that the cloth on our kitchen table the day I gathered the dandelions happened to have a pattern on it that looks like a beehive.

What\u2019s really nice as well is that dandelions represent the sun and, in fact, yellow is her favourite colour.

I realised quite quickly that this was an internal pressure I was putting on myself, it wasn\u2019t organic or authentic. I needed more time to process what I was feeling. I knew it was around solitude and touch but I wanted just to spend some weeks digesting it and then see how it comes out in my work rather than pushing.</p> <p>Part of that process was to bring a camera home and start looking more carefully at my house, turning my eyes on, in a way, and looking more deeply at my surroundings. I started taking pictures inside the house and spent a lot of time looking out of various windows at the plain blue sky without any streaks. One day we had this rainbow and I happened to notice it through the blind.</p> <p>I find it quite a gentle, poignant image. I like the way the blind drawn between inside and outside asks questions rather than answers them. The clear view would have been less ambiguous, I guess. This is veiled \u2013 I think that makes it more alluring.</p> <p>When lockdown was announced all my projects and the work I had just absolutely evaporated. But in many ways this period has been amazing, not frustrating. There are six of us at home \u2013 I have four children aged from 24 to 20 \u2013 and I feel very privileged to spend this time with them. I\u2019m actually in my element.

One of my ambitions in my photography is to make pictures that look like they were taken by a writer, but in a good way. They\u2019re not just pure emotion, they\u2019re constructed.</p> <p>I took this image in Cambridge, Massachusetts, within walking distance of my house. What drew me to the scene was the ladders. Ladders are a recurring theme in my work. They are full of metaphorical intensity: a ladder can take you up, but it can also bring you down. And, of course, in many religious positions, ladders suggest heaven. So I walk by this blue house and there\u2019s four ladders \u2013 it\u2019s slight ladder overkill. I tried to see what was going on and I saw the man and took a photo.</p> <p>That was my initial attraction. But once he turned around something had changed, because he was wearing a mask. And I was wearing a mask. The usual element of surveillance that we get in street photography has gone away because I couldn\u2019t identify him. He couldn\u2019t identify me. But a new tension had entered the exchange and that new tension felt to me like a new language that we were all learning to speak at the same time. There is also this cascade of association of what it means when somebody covers their face, and I thought about <em><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Beekeepers_and_the_Birdnester_-_WGA03528.jpg\">The Beekeepers and the Birdnester</a>,</em> a drawing by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.</p> <p>Emotionally, this is a particularly difficult time to do work.

April was a very beautiful month in terms of the weather and this picture was taken in my garden there.</p> <p>The image is by a photographer called Peter Basch, a German \u00e9migr\u00e9 who lived in New York. He did a series of photographs of women in the 1960s, which he called \u201cexotic beauties\u201d. So I was looking at this book and it was badly bound and very windy in the garden, and suddenly all the pages flew off. While I was collecting them, I thought they actually looked quite nice in the garden. There\u2019s a lot of poetry in real life: sometimes it\u2019s there simply by picking something up and combining it with something else that you wouldn\u2019t usually combine it with.</p> <p>The work that I do as an artist and as a photographer has a lot to do with black and brown representation. On one side, I was aesthetically attracted by Basch\u2019s photographs, but at the same time, I was also irritated by the whole \u201cexotic beauties\u201d setup of the book. This picture felt like a way to give these \u201cexotic beauties\u201d my own kind of interpretation.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very painful time, and the people that I like to represent are especially affected. But there\u2019s a certain luxury for me in being able to slow down and look at things without any time pressure. In Brighton, I have a 35mm camera and black-and-white film. That\u2019s all I need. Big plans at the moment are hard to accomplish, so I like the idea of small steps and small gestures. This picture is part of that. <strong>TL</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.newshatavakolian.com/\">Newsha Tavakolian</a><br>Tehran</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"464409494c4251fce555e4a9876795b97be0af0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/464409494c4251fce555e4a9876795b97be0af0c/0_0_7433_5943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Me at home being bored in the living room of my house, playing with my lighter., Tehran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Me at home being bored in the living room of my house, playing with my lighter, Tehran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Newsha Tavakolian/Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Iranian Magnum photojournalist is renowned for her coverage of conflict and social issues across the Middle East</em></p> <p>Iran was one of the first countries to be hit by coronavirus after China, so I wanted to show the outside world my experience of day-to-day life in self-quarantine. Stuck at home, you become more sensitive about details you might otherwise miss. For 17 years, I have been looking at this view of a lampshade at my home in Tehran, but I never thought of taking a picture of it. One night I was bored by myself and I was playing with my camera. I wanted to smoke, so I flicked on my lighter and noticed how the flame lined up nicely with the light from the bulb.</p> <p>My father passed away exactly a year before this was taken. We were meant to have a big ceremony for the anniversary, but we had to cancel it at the last minute. Instead, my mother, my sister and I went to the cemetery to visit his grave. I was shocked by how quiet it was \u2013 we were completely on our own. Then I came home and I was wondering: is this the new normal? It\u2019s like a scary film we are living. Fortunately or unfortunately, nearly two months later, I\u2019ve kind of got used to it. When I want to visit my mother, who lives close by, I put on my face mask without thinking.</p> <p>If I can say one thing to other photographers and artists , it\u2019s that they must act before this lifestyle becomes normal. Now is the best time to do projects, because everything is new. You\u2019ve got to capture that before you lose your appetite.<strong> KF</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.gilesduley.com/\">Giles Duley</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Hastings</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12aa91d3d06227608402ebd6c6472c11d041c82d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12aa91d3d06227608402ebd6c6472c11d041c82d/0_0_7882_9531/827.jpg\" alt=\"Hastings, Wednesday 29 April 2020 by Giles Duley\" width=\"827\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hastings, Wednesday 29 April 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Duley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>A documentary photographer focusing on the long-term impact of war, Giles Duley is a triple amputee after stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan</em></p> <p>This is the view from my window. Every day since lockdown began I\u2019ve been walking across the road in front of my house and sitting on the bench on the other side to do this kind of meditation for 20 minutes, get my fresh air for the day and take a photograph of the sea.</p> <p>I moved to live by the sea 20 years ago because when I\u2019m working I am normally in conflict zones, which are tense and stressful places, so when I come back I need peace and I find the sea really helpful. I am not sure if the sea reflects my mood or the mood of the sea is reflected in me but there is definitely a reciprocity of some kind. Often I\u2019ll wake up feeling a bit flat and I look at the sea and find it is a bit flat and grey too. This picture was taken on one of those days.</p> <p>I\u2019m in isolation on my own. It would be nice to have company but I guess photographers are loners by nature. I\u2019ve been cooking relentlessly \u2013 it\u2019s my way to relax \u2013 and the button burst off my trousers last week, so I\u2019ll have to watch that.</p> <p>I\u2019m spending the rest of the time trying to be useful. Through the charity I run, <a href=\"https://www.legacyofwarfoundation.com/\">Legacy of War Foundation</a>, I\u2019ve set up a group called Hastings Supports the NHS and we\u2019ve been providing free transport for NHS staff, buying PPE and hand sanitisers for them. It\u2019s been great because the whole community has got involved.</p> <p>We\u2019re going to auction a print of this photograph to raise more money. I still shoot on film, and by chance one of the world\u2019s best darkroom printers, <a href=\"http://www.robinbell.com/\">Robin Bell</a>, lives around the corner from me. So I left the roll of film on my windowsill, and he popped around to collect it and brought back this print a few hours later. <strong>LO\u2019K</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.alystomlinson.co.uk/\">Alys Tomlinson</a></h2> <p><strong>London</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4eb76cf232e4d9dd42e6ceefaca3567cbbf90a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4eb76cf232e4d9dd42e6ceefaca3567cbbf90a0/0_0_5304_7014/756.jpg\" alt=\"Image of trees silhouetted against lighted windows at night\" width=\"756\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Named photographer of the year at the 2018 Sony world photography awards, Alys Tomlinson studied anthropology as well as photography. Her 2019 book, Ex Voto, explores Christian pilgrimages</em></p> <p>Since the lockdown, I haven\u2019t felt really that inspired to take pictures. Then the other night, I realised I hadn\u2019t been out after dark for over a month. So I decided to go for some night wanders. The American photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/24/robert-adams-photographs-american-west-paris\">Robert Adams</a> did a series of nightscapes in the 1970s called <em>Summer Nights, Walking</em>. I\u2019ve always really admired that work so I thought I\u2019d explore the area around where I live, in Holloway, north London.</p> <p>This photograph was taken around 10.30pm on a housing estate near the Emirates Stadium. The day had been warm, but the evening was chilly and there was a strong breeze. So you had the trees blowing, which is quite atmospheric, and then the warmth and pockets of light in the windows of the people getting ready for bed or having a late dinner. Most of my recent work has been shot in black-and-white, although this was digital, because I normally use an old-fashioned 5x4 plate camera. I might have been arrested if I\u2019d got that out.</p> <p>I was surprised, because it felt eerie and quite unsettling. I\u2019ve lived in London for more than 20 years and never really felt unsafe, but I didn\u2019t really enjoy it, and that probably sums up how I was feeling at that particular moment. There were people lurking in the shadows and it felt odd to be in a neighbourhood I\u2019m so familiar with yet not feel comfortable.</p> <p>After the lockdown is over, I\u2019ll probably look more towards stories around me. In the past, I\u2019ve never felt that inspired by what\u2019s on my doorstep, but you don\u2019t have to go to the Amazon or Antarctica to make interesting pictures. Also, photographers are all going to be completely skint, so we won\u2019t be able to afford to go away anyway! <strong>TL</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.chrissteeleperkins.com/\">Chris Steele-Perkins</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>London</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"166cca33104f51fbdf6f8d9bea3eb9e4c1bf151c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/166cca33104f51fbdf6f8d9bea3eb9e4c1bf151c/0_0_3610_3628/995.jpg\" alt=\"Self portrait of Chris Steele-Perkins at the time of Covid-19 using i-phone Pano settings\" width=\"995\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self portrait at the time of Covid-19 using i-Phone pano settings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Steele-Perkins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Magnum photographer Chris Steele-Perkins published The Teds, his seminal book on teddy boys, in 1979.

I rigged up the phone so that it would rotate, and then I jumped in front of the lens and followed it as it moved, turning my head and pulling faces. I had no real control over the outcome, which I found interesting. Sometimes it misses you entirely, and it does strange things to your face.

I\u2019m at home in south London, but my wife, who is Japanese, is in Japan. I was meant to be going over there too, but we left it a bit late. I call her every day. Actually, that\u2019s what I\u2019m using my camera for more than anything else: I\u2019ll go out and photograph the garden and then send her an image and say: \u201cHere\u2019s the magnolia coming out.\u201d It\u2019s an alternative to taking photos of my monstrous face. <strong>KF</strong></p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global coronavirus cases pass 4 million</h2> <p>Global coronavirus cases stand at 4,024,973, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker, with global deaths at 279,321. The US has the most fatalities, at 78,794, followed by the UK (31,662) and Italy (30,395). </p> <h2>Three White House Covid-19 taskforce members in quarantine</h2> <p>Three members of the White House coronavirus taskforce have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/global-report-anthony-fauci-and-two-other-white-house-covid-19-taskforce-members-to-self-quarantine\">placed themselves in self-quarantine</a> after potential contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, are all expected to work remotely due to potential exposure to Covid-19.</p> <h2>Johnson to announce new warnings for England</h2> <p>Boris Johnson is expected to unveil a coronavirus warning system for England when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/johnson-announce-coronavirus-warning-system-england\">outlines his plans to gradually ease the lockdown</a>. The prime minister will drop the \u201cstay home\u201d slogan and instead tell the country to \u201cstay alert, control the virus and save lives\u201d when he outlines his \u201croadmap\u201d to a new normality during an address to the nation on Sunday. Johnson is planning to tell workers who cannot do their jobs from home to begin returning to their workplaces while following social distancing rules. It is understood that a warning system administered by a new \u201cjoint biosecurity centre\u201d will detect local increases in infection rates, with the aim of altering restrictions locally in England.</p> <h2>Elon Musk threatens to pull Tesla out of California</h2> <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk is threatening to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/elon-musk-threatens-to-move-tesla-hq-out-of-california-over-covid-19-restrictions\">pull his company\u2019s factory and headquarters out of California</a> after local officials stopped him reopening the electric car factory due to the Covid-19 risk. In a lawsuit filed in federal court, Tesla accused the Alameda County Health Department of overstepping federal and state coronavirus restrictions when it stopped Tesla from restarting production at its factory in Fremont.

Of the new cases, 26 were domestically transmitted infections and eight were imported cases, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The resurgence followed a small but growing coronavirus outbreak centred around a handful of Seoul nightclubs, which a man in his late 20s had visited before testing positive for the virus. The outbreak prompted Seoul city to impose an immediate temporary shutdown of all nightly entertainment facilities on Saturday.</p> <h2>Three child deaths in New York potentially linked to Covid-19</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/children-coronavirus-death-kawasaki\">deaths of three children in New York</a> of inflammatory complications possibly linked to Covid-19 has prompted Andrew Cuomo, the state\u2019s governor, to warn of \u201can entirely different chapter\u201d of a disease that had been believed to cause only mild symptoms in children. State health authorities said last week there have been 73 reported cases in New York of children falling severely ill with a toxic shock-like reaction that displays symptoms similar to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/kawasaki/index.html\">Kawasaki disease</a>. \u201cThis is new,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThis is developing.\u201d</p> <h2>Restrictions to ease in France and Spain</h2> <p>France and Spain, two of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus, are preparing to ease out of lockdown. French officials on Saturday said the day\u2019s death toll of 80 was the lowest since early April. Nursing home fatalities also fell sharply as France prepared to relax curbs on public movement imposed eight weeks ago. In Spain, about half the population will be allowed out on Monday for limited socialisation, and restaurants will be able to offer some outdoor service as the country begins a phased transition set to last through June.</p>",

  "<p>Franklin D Roosevelt did as much as anyone to ensure the allied victory 75 years ago. Following Japan\u2019s sneak attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and Nazi Germany\u2019s declaration of war four days later, the US president willingly joined the fight, able at last to overcome isolationist opposition in Congress and answer Winston Churchill\u2019s pleas to formally take Britain\u2019s side.</p> <p>Yet biographers suggest the defeat of fascism took second place in Roosevelt\u2019s mind to the postwar creation of an international organisation guaranteeing future global peace and security. At a White House meeting with Churchill that same month, they <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OztJcfbnpDsC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">agreed that their new alliance</a>, incorporating the Soviet Union and other anti-Axis countries, should be named the \u201cUnited Nations\u201d. </p> <p>A series of conferences led in June 1945 to the promulgation by 50 governments of the UN charter, rendering permanent the alliance that had won the war. Since then UN membership has grown to 193 sovereign states. Roosevelt\u2019s dream was realised, although tragically he did not live to see it. He died in April 1945, less than a month before VE Day.</p> <p>After a week in which Britain commemorated that famous victory in extremely difficult circumstances, it is plain that the world needs another 1945 moment. Inspirational leaders such as Roosevelt cannot be conjured up, more\u2019s the pity. But his legacy \u2013 today\u2019s UN and its many agencies \u2013 remains a vital resource for effective international cooperation in fighting global threats.</p> <p>Why, then, is the UN not better used and supported in the present crisis? \u201cCovid-19 is the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52114829\">greatest test we have faced </a>together since the formation of the United Nations,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, UN secretary-general, said last month. \u201cThis human crisis demands coordinated, inclusive and innovative action from the leading economies.\u201d Yet a lack of leadership and differing national approaches had <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-52496983/coronavirus-lack-of-co-ordination-let-virus-spread-un-s-guterres\">helped spread the virus</a>, he said.</p> <p>The UN is already heavily involved. It has established a multi-partner Covid-19 <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1060702\">\u201cresponse and recovery\u201d trust fund</a>. Agencies such as the World Food Programme and the children\u2019s fund, Unicef, are on the frontline. Guterres is also showing a lead. He has warned of increasing Covid-related human rights abuses and a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/global-report-china-open-to-cooperate-with-who-on-virus-origin-as-trump-repeats-lab-claim\">tsunami of hate </a>and xenophobia, scapegoating and scaremongering\u201d around the world.</p> <p>But many years of governments ignoring, circumventing or undermining the UN are taking their toll. This latest crisis has underscored the virtual irrelevance of the UN security council, foremost guardian of the charter. As Guterres says, the pandemic poses a clear threat to international peace and security. Yet still the council fiddles. On Friday, it again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/un-ceasefire-resolution-us-blocks-who\">failed to agree a global ceasefire </a>to help fight Covid-19.</p> <p>In the US, successive Republican administrations have shown their hostility by withdrawing UN funding and, in the case of the 2003 Iraq invasion, illegally flouting its authority. Donald Trump\u2019s contemptible <a href=\"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization]\">attempt to blame </a>an admittedly imperfect World Health Organization for his Covid failures is the latest manifestation of a wider hatred of the multilateralism embodied in the UN.</p> <p>Yet Russia and China behave little better. By repeatedly blocking UN efforts to halt the slaughter of civilians in Syria or investigate chemical weapons attacks, and by ignoring international treaties and human rights in Crimea, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, they degrade the international rules-based order which the UN crucially upholds.</p> <p>The UN has many problems. Reform of the security council is long overdue. Peacekeeping operations are controversial, in terms of effectiveness and sexual abuse and <a href=\"https://ti-defence.org/publications/corruption-risks-un-peace-operations-summary/\">corruption scandals</a>. The general assembly and the human rights council too often divide into rivalrous factions.</p> <p>But at this time of truly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/leaderless-lacking-and-late-a-global-plan-to-fight-coronavirus-is-desperately-needed\">global emergency</a>, when US leadership has collapsed, when others have failed to step up and when the pandemic threatens millions of lives and livelihoods here and across the developing world, an effective, well supported, well funded UN, as first envisaged by FDR, is needed as rarely before.</p>",
  "<p>\u2018In spite of the sunny bank holiday, it is vitally important that we continue to abide by the current restrictions: stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d That was the message delivered by the environment secretary, George Eustice, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/10DowningStreet/status/1259043536156196865?s=20\">at Friday afternoon\u2019s press conference</a>. Yet just the day before, most newspapers were emblazoned with <a href=\"https://www.thepaperboy.com/uk/2020/05/07/front-pages-archive.cfm\">excited headlines </a>foretelling a significant relaxation of social distancing restrictions, based on briefing from government sources: \u201cLockdown freedom beckons\u201d, \u201cFirst steps to freedom from Monday\u201d and \u201cStay home advice to be scrapped\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the critical importance of clear public messaging to any public health strategy, the government\u2019s communications have been marred by mixed messages throughout this deadly pandemic. Its core message, asking the public to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives, has been very effective, but this has consistently been undermined by ministers and advisers inaccurately briefing the press that there is about to be a shift in policy. Before the Easter weekend, reports appeared that ministers thought that the public had been too obedient in following the lockdown, and that a relaxation was imminent. The same happened before this bank holiday weekend, forcing the government to clarify that there was no change in restrictions and that people must continue to abide by the law.</p> <p>The tone of these briefings has been shockingly out of step with reality. Last week, the UK\u2019s official death toll overtook Italy\u2019s to make us the worst-hit country in Europe at this point (the UK\u2019s official statistics <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PedderSophie/status/1258497092953219072?s=20\">capture a smaller proportion</a> of excess deaths than in many other European countries, suggesting that, if anything, the UK will look worse as the death toll becomes more accurate). Every day, hundreds of families lose their loved ones to this virus, healthcare workers put their lives at risk by going to work without adequate protection, and care homes struggle to manage the spread of the disease among residents. As a result of high levels of public compliance with the lockdown, infection rates have fallen, but not to a point where there can be any significant relaxation of social distancing: the measures that will be announced later today will rightly be very incremental.</p> <p>It beggars belief that government sources have, regardless, been briefing that the end of lockdown is nigh, and floating, then stepping back from, major policy changes \u2013 such as the potential for households to mix in closed groups of up to 10 people. It is a recipe for sowing confusion and seeding a laidback approach to social distancing. New policy should be announced only to parliament or at the daily press conference. We can only hope that the public continues to listen to and comply with social distancing, despite the government\u2019s unclear messages.</p> <p>These shambolic communications are a sign of a worrying lack of competence at the heart of government. Bombastic war metaphors are being used as a substitute for long-term strategy. The government\u2019s success in rapidly expanding NHS critical care capacity has not been matched in other areas, from ensuring adequate supplies of protective equipment for frontline workers, to delays in expanding testing capacity, to the disaster that is unfolding in many care homes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bombastic war metaphors are being used as a substitute for long-term strategy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government has consistently faced calls from the opposition and scientific experts to be more transparent about how it intends to relax social distancing restrictions without triggering a second wave of deaths later in the year. Any significant relaxation of the lockdown is contingent not just on getting infection rates lower but on having adequate testing and tracing capacity to quickly identify and isolate new outbreaks.</p> <p>Yet the government has failed to publish a proper strategy. It has adopted arbitrary testing targets: first a quarter of a million tests a day, then 100,000, and now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/boris-johnson-misses-coronavirus-testing-target-for-fourth-day-in-a-row\">200,000</a>, without explaining how these targets fit into a strategy for managing future outbreaks. It manipulated testing figures \u2013 sending out a large number of tests post on one particular day, and counting these as completed tests \u2013 in order to meet its arbitrary 100,000 target, which it has since fallen back from. It would make more sense to adopt a dynamic target that aims to keep the proportion of tests that come back positive below a fixed figure: this would help ensure that we are testing in sufficient numbers given the incidence of the virus. We do not know what assumptions the government is relying upon; for example, how quickly test results will need to be turned around to feed into an effective track and trace system.</p> <p>In terms of tracing, experience from countries such as Singapore suggests that <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/contact-tracing-apps-coronavirus\">technology and contact tracing apps </a>can only assist, not replace, teams of human contact tracers. Yet there are worrying signs the UK may be relying too heavily on the development of an app, with all the privacy concerns that this involves, and not enough on building skilled teams of contact tracers. While it has committed to recruiting 18,000 contact tracers by the middle of this month, this may not be enough, and it emerged last week that the government is <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-private-call-centres-will-run-new-contact-tracing-system-bjqnpsxqc?wgu=270525_54264_1589026507825_73e1b80e32&amp;wgexpiry=1596802507&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278\">in talks </a>with large private-sector contractors to provide 15,000 call-centre staff, who would have only a day\u2019s training. One company is Serco, which was last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/03/serco-fined-229m-over-electronic-tagging-scandal\">fined </a>\u00a323m by the Serious Fraud Office over its delivery of electronic tagging contracts. Meanwhile, it is unclear if and how the government intends to deploy the thousands of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/06/uk-missed-coronavirus-contact-tracing-opportunity-experts-say\">environmental health officers</a> who work for local councils; it has been far too slow to involve local government public health experts in other areas, for example <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/public-health-directors-take-charge-covid-19-testing-care-homes\">testing in care homes</a>.</p> <p>This is the most difficult governing challenge the country has faced in decades; the gaps in our knowledge about this virus means that there is often uncertainty as to the best way forward. It would be unreasonable to expect a government to make no missteps. Yet the evidence is mounting that this government\u2019s rank incompetence has contributed to the terrible numbers of deaths of recent weeks. This cannot wait for a post-hoc public inquiry: ministers have to face up to and learn from their mistakes in the here and now. People\u2019s lives depend on it.</p>",

He was fined $1,000.</p> <p>How the Daily Telegraph got tipped to the story \u2013 they captured pictures of him shopping in Sydney and hanging out at Pearl Beach \u2013 remains the subject of intense conjecture. But most Liberals are are looking among their own colleagues for the culprit.</p> <p>\u201cHand on heart, it wasn\u2019t us,\u201d one Labor source said. \u201cThe Liberals catch and kill their own.\u201d</p> <p>Harwin was a big scalp for whoever weaponised the information.

Some Liberals sheet home the problems of the recent past to Berejiklian\u2019s reshuffle after the election in 2019, which left some key members of the right unhappy.</p> <p>But it may also be something about the NSW division.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hand on heart, it wasn\u2019t us. The Liberals catch and kill their own</p> <footer> <cite>A Labor source</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Liberal party, like many organisations, has seen its membership dwindle in modern times.</p> <p>The exact numbers are secret but <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/nsw-liberal-party-member-numbers-skyrocket/news-story/2f3268e2882110439f25f7a655fb2936\">the Australian reported</a> last year that 1,300 people, mainly from Pentecostal churches, had joined, raising the numbers by 10%. That implies the membership is now at around 14,000. It\u2019s a far cry from 1945 when the party of Menzies had 90,000 members, nationally.</p> <p>Among that relatively small membership, there are those who plan their career in politics from the day they join the Young Liberals or Young Nationals.</p> <p>These careerists seem to gravitate to state parliament, having served apprenticeships in ministers\u2019 offices as staff and in politically aligned consultancies.</p> <p>Perhaps they never learn to moderate the dark arts they honed while in university politics and the youth wings of the party. Some of the behaviours would certainly not be tolerated in most private sector workplaces.</p> <p>Which brings us to Constance and Barilaro.</p> <p>For those who haven\u2019t followed this soap opera, in the last fortnight Constance, the state MP for Bega and a Liberal, and Barilaro, the state MP for Monaro and a National, both put their hands up to run for the federal seat of Eden-Monaro, which will have a byelection sometime soon, after Labor\u2019s Mike Kelly said he was retiring for health reasons.</p> <p>On Monday Barilaro pulled out. The seat has been won by Liberals in the past but no National has won, so Barilaro faced a very difficult task in a three-cornered contest, particularly if Constance ran.</p> <p>But having said he was happy with his decision Barilaro then badmouthed the federal Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, by text for his lack of support of his candidacy and reportedly called his former friend Constance \u201ca cunt\u201d. He has declined to comment on the allegation.</p> <p>Constance then declared he would not run, having made much of his decision to take the fight for his bushfire-ravaged community to Canberra.</p> <p>An emotional Constance did a press conference on Monday: \u201cWhen I said politics is stuffed in this country and some of the people in it needed to take a long hard look, I meant it and we\u2019re now seeing that in such a great way on the front page of the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t signed up to contest federally to be called that type of smear.\u201d</p> <h2>Barilaro and Constance turn on each other</h2> <p>Barilaro and Constance both had a reputation of playing rough politically and there was some glee among colleagues that they had turned on each other.</p> <p>Others put Constance\u2019s about-face down to the difficulties he would have faced in gaining preselection, as the seat includes some very conservative branches. Driven by Tony Abbott, the party has reformed its preselection processes to give the branches a bigger say.</p> <p>Even more sinister suggestions emerged that there were dirt sheets circulating and about to see the light of day. One MP was said to have compiled files on his colleagues and to have boasted about them. Nothing has emerged and the Guardian is not suggesting that either man had reason to fear exposure. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/nationals-trade-blows-over-john-barilaros-aborted-tilt-at-eden-monaro\">Nationals trade blows over John Barilaro's aborted tilt at Eden-Monaro</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Berejiklian has since announced that Constance will lose his House leader role so he can concentrate on the transport portfolio, prompting Labor\u2019s Ryan Park to quip: \u201cShe\u2019s punished the victim and rewarded the villain.\u201d</p> <p>But there is nothing Berejiklian can do about Barilaro, who is leader of the NSW Nationals, a separate party.
