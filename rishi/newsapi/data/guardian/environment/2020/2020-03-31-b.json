These travellers are being quarantined in hotels and motels, though there have been some reports of those quarantined being allowed out to buy their own groceries -- which is not allowed.</li> \n   <li>Far more testing. Skegg said loosening of rules around testing -- which no longer require patients to have traveled overseas or have come into contact with a confirmed case -- haven\u2019t got through to doctors in the field. </li> \n   <li>The capacity for rapid case contract tracing must be greatly expanded as a matter of urgency, Skegg said.</li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>The epidemic committee was held by video call, with a live stream broadcast publicly and available to watch on social media and many news outlets. As with any group of people holding a Zoom meeting, there was the occasional person speaking with bizarre echoing feedback, although only one lawmaker asking a question had to be reminded to un-mute his microphone.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e82a8d58f0866297e9f3f3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mario-koran\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T02:21:08.774Z\">3.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Anger as Las Vegas turns parking lot into sleeping area for homeless</h2> \n  <p>Images of homeless people sleeping in a converted parking lot in Las Vegas have sparked criticism, even as the city officials describe an \u201cemergency situation\u201d and say the solution was the best option after another shelter was forced to close amid the coronavirus crisis. <br><br>Over the weekend, authorities in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/las-vegas\">Las Vegas</a> needed to find additional sleeping space for the city\u2019s sizable homeless population when a 500-bed overnight shelter closed after a client tested positive for the new coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Officials turned a parking lot into a makeshift shelter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClarkCountyNV/status/1244029870461472768\">saying</a> spaces for sleeping were drawn 6ft apart in observance of federal social distancing guidelines.</p> \n  <p>Many white boxes were covered up with blue mats that could be more easily cleaned.

The document, crafted in the wake of the 2016 Ebola outbreak, contained advice on tracking the spread of a new virus, how to ensure testing was conducted effectively and the need to stockpile emergency resources.</p> <p>The incoming Trump administration was briefed on the playbook but it was was \u201cthrown on to a shelf\u201d, according to an anonymous official <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/25/trump-coronavirus-national-security-council-149285\">quoted by Politico</a>.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t the administration\u2019s only insight into the threat posed by a pandemic.

One day it\u2019s like a miracle \u2013 it will disappear\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Trump\u2019s reaction to coronavirus has spanned disbelief, a severe understating of the problem and an optimism that appears unmoored from reality.</p> <p>In February, Trump said the virus could \u201cmaybe go away. We\u2019ll see what happens. Nobody really knows.\u201d He predicted it is \u201cgoing to disappear. One day it\u2019s like a miracle \u2013 it will disappear.\u201d</p> <p>This position has been repeatedly contradicted by public health experts who predicted the sharp increase in Covid-19 infections, blunted only by social distancing measures and the shut down of large gatherings.</p> <p>Even in China, which instituted the most severe crackdown on the movement of people, it has taken several months for cases to start tapering off.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be realistic, and you\u2019ve got to understand that you don\u2019t make the timeline, the virus makes the timeline,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-new-york-dr-anthony-fauci\">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said recently.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Anybody that needs a test gets a test. We \u2013 they\u2019re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Without basis, Trump has claimed the US has done an excellent job in testing people for the coronavirus. As early as January, the president said the situation was \u201ctotally under control\u201d. Just six weeks later the US had emerged as the new global center of the pandemic.</p> <p>In reality, healthcare providers faced a severe shortage of testing kits as coronavirus hit the US, with the situation exacerbated by faults in the testing system and restrictions on who could actually take a test. A big disparity opened up whereby rich or famous people were able to get tests while others struggled to do so.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/los-angeles-deserted-coronavirus-outbreak-california\">'Like a bad sci-fi movie': life in a deserted Los Angeles under coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mike Pence, the vice-president, has admitted \u201cwe don\u2019t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand\u201d.

Perhaps most infamously, Trump said \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency-sketch\">I don\u2019t take responsibility at all</a>\u201d when asked about the faltering US response.</p> <p>The president has repeatedly downplayed the threat posed by Covid-19, criticising concern over the crisis as a \u201choax\u201d, fretting that letting infected Americans off a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/stranded-at-sea-cruise-ships-around-the-world-are-adrift-as-ports-turn-them-away\">cruise ship</a> would increase the number of confirmed cases and claiming that only a couple of Americans had it as cases began to soar across the country.</p> <p>He has compounded this by suggesting social distancing restrictions be lifted around Easter \u2013 a timeline wildly out of kilter with public health experts who warn this would cause hospitals to overflow with sick and dying patients.</p> <h2><strong>Americans will have access \u2018to vaccines, I think, relatively soon\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In a White House meeting with pharmaceutical company bosses and public health officials, Trump suggested a vaccine for Covid-19 will be available \u201cover the next few months\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/stranded-at-sea-cruise-ships-around-the-world-are-adrift-as-ports-turn-them-away\">'Stranded at sea': cruise ships around the world are adrift as ports turn them away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was contradicted by Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, who pointed out: \u201cYou won\u2019t have a vaccine. You\u2019ll have a vaccine to go into testing.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Fauci and others at the meeting confirmed that clinical trials \u2013 standard for any new vaccine \u2013 would have to take place first. A vaccine is more likely to be a year or 18 months away.</p> <p>Despite being told this, Trump told a rally in North Carolina on 2 March that there will be a vaccine \u201crelatively soon\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hoarding, I think it\u2019s maybe worse than hoarding. But check it out\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On more than one occasion in recent weeks, Trump has questioned states\u2019 sudden surge in demand for equipment such as masks and ventilators \u2013 essential tools in doctors\u2019 battle against coronavirus.</p> <p>During his daily White House briefing, the president has said states are \u201cstocked up\u201d with medical equipment, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a question as to hoarding of ventilators, some hospitals and independent hospitals and some hospital chains, as we call them \u2013 they are holding ventilators, they don\u2019t want to let \u2019em up.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also questioned why hospitals in New York City suddenly needed 300,000 masks when they previously needed 10,000 masks. \u201cSo I think people should check that, because there\u2019s something going on, whether \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hoarding, I think it\u2019s maybe worse than hoarding. But check it out.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has since claimed the president was merely echoing Andrew Cuomo, New York\u2019s governor, who has said that he has asked the state police to investigate the theft of masks. But no evidence has been forthcoming on Trump\u2019s seemingly baseless assertion of \u201choarding\u201d or \u201cworse than hoarding\u201d by hospitals.</p> <p>Governors from several states have said they have received just a small fraction of the medical equipment they need to deal with the pandemic. New York, for example, has said it needs tens of thousands of ventilators but has only received a few thousand. The reason for the sudden surge in demand for these items is obvious \u2013 there is a pandemic of a new virus that is putting a huge and sudden strain on healthcare systems.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you know you can call it many different names. I\u2019m not sure anybody even knows what it is\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On 27 March, Trump made the above claim despite warnings from public health experts that coronavirus should not be conflated with seasonal flu. Fauci, for example, has said that Covid-19 is transferred between people far more easily than the flu and has a mortality rate around 10 times higher.</p> <p>While there was initial confusion over coronavirus when Chinese authorities described it as an unusual form of pneumonia, the world has been well aware of the dimensions of the virus since January, when China acknowledged the severity of the condition and released the genetic information of Covid-19.</p>",

  "<p>Rory McIlroy turned responses to personal adversity into an art form long ago. His Masters capitulation of 2011 was followed up by winning the US Open. A courtroom appearance against his former management and the high-profile cancellation of a wedding preceded the hitting of professional heights.</p> <p>McIlroy was at it again last autumn. Five weeks after missing the cut at the Open - and not<em> </em><em>any</em> Open - he took delivery of the FedEx Cup and its $10m bounty.</p> <p>He has enough perspective to realise the coronavirus crisis means golf is insignificant now and has joined a social media campaign to that end but, in a purely sporting sense, he must rue this hiatus. We will never know how far McIlroy\u2019s rebound from the gloom of Royal Portrush last July would have taken him in the context of April 2020 and the Masters. Evidence suggested this was his finest chance to complete the grand slam of major titles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/10/rory-mcilroy-moves-above-brooks-koepka-in-return-to-world-no-1\">Rory McIlroy moves above Brooks Koepka in return to world No 1</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His consistency was rewarded with a return to the top of the world rankings in February. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt this comfortable with all facets of my game,\u201d McIlroy said before sport shuddered to a halt.</p> <p>We speak a number of weeks before the coronavirus takes hold. McIlroy adopts self-deprecation on being reminded of his sentiments 12 months ago; the Open\u2019s visit to Northern Ireland for the first time since 1951 was dominating his thoughts. \u201cHow did that work out?\u201d asks the 30-year-old with a smile.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been able to turn very difficult things into positives. I\u2019ve been able to respond well and even excel. That comes from reflection, from thinking deep and hard about things. I\u2019ve always had a knack for \u2018what happened, what went wrong?\u2019 then making sure I\u2019m better the next time. You might not be 100% better, it could be five to 10%.

That might not have happened if Portrush hadn\u2019t turned out as it did. I had to take a long, hard look at myself. I needed to press the reset button and that might not have happened had I finished 12th or 10th. It was a huge catalyst for me to change a few things. I\u2019ve been disciplined and worked hard.\u201d</p> <p>The grisly details from Ireland\u2019s north coast will live long in the memory of anyone who witnessed them. McIlroy watched his first shot fly out of bounds. Backed by vociferous support, he came so close to surviving for the weekend but an opening round of 79 proved fatal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I messaged Tiger after the Masters. Anytime I win a tournament, he is the first to text me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He was close to tears during Friday interviews, with the complex relationship between a global star and his homeland laid bare. Christmas spent back in Holywood was \u201ca little bit different\u201d as a consequence.</p> <p>\u201cI have always felt like I\u2019ve been relatable and approachable,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there was a thing back home where people didn\u2019t feel that way about me any more. Because of what I went through at Portrush, maybe to show that vulnerability, people could relate to me a little more again. It\u2019s a weird one.</p> <p>\u201cWhen someone becomes who I have \u2026 I play all over the world and am a very recognisable sportsperson. I come from such a small place, I don\u2019t know if people think you get above your station and forget where you are from? I said it at the time, I forgot how much the place and the people mean to me.\u201d</p> <p>McIlroy was encouraged to loosen the shackles that naturally tighten as a career plays out so publicly. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing to lose,\u201d he says. \u201cFalling flat on your face in front of your home people, at a tournament you\u2019ve been thinking about for 10 years, that\u2019s the worst that can happen. So what have I got to lose after already experiencing that? Nothing else can top that in terms of disappointment, so let\u2019s go for it.\u201d</p> <p>In normal circumstances McIlroy would now be in the midst of Masters mayhem but he regularly emphasises the psychological distance he puts between himself and tilts at history. Spend all winter thinking of Augusta? No chance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6071c80b8d7bedc1ce4fca011e7feb1ecf0562c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6071c80b8d7bedc1ce4fca011e7feb1ecf0562c4/0_168_3547_2129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory McIlroy catches trophy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory McIlroy catches the trophy as it slips out of the hands of the US PGA president, Ted Bishop, after winning at Valhalla in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Spurlock/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhy would you? I\u2019ve never really done that. I don\u2019t really think about tournaments until I get there. What\u2019s the point? I don\u2019t see the point in over-analysing it.</p> <p>\u201cThe game still doesn\u2019t owe me anything and I wouldn\u2019t want it to, I want to go out and learn everything. If I don\u2019t win it [the Masters], I don\u2019t win it. It\u2019s not a life-changer for me. It\u2019s a golf tournament. It would be awesome and would put me in a place, in the game that I play, of very rare company. Wonderful. But I\u2019m not going to cry myself to sleep if I don\u2019t. I think people want to believe it consumes me but it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s the truth. I think people want to believe it\u2019s the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing before I go to bed. And it\u2019s not, life\u2019s too short. I\u2019ve been very good over the last 18 months at staying in the present. If I build things up too much they can backfire.\u201d</p> <p>McIlroy is equally candid when discussing his emotions at Augusta last year. He was frustrated at not being competitive, a feeling intensified by the prospect of answering questions about Tiger Woods\u2019s epic win for months to come. The cloud lifted sharply.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to get out of there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt had been a disappointing week, I wanted to get home. I removed myself from it and thought: \u2018Jesus, this is unbelievable.\u2019 The longer Tiger is at the top of the game, the better it is for all of us. I messaged him. Anytime I win a tournament or have a chance, he is the first one to text me. All the time. So I always make sure if he is doing anything, that I\u2019m right there.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we played 100-round events I would win every time, but it's about putting four together</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pre-Masters stories around McIlroy had been amusing. The admission that meditation and mindfulness were now part of his routine raised eyebrows. He seemed a tad baffled. \u201cOnce I get into things I really get into things. I enjoy reading, I enjoy self-help, I enjoy psychology. I can be portrayed as anything, I don\u2019t care. I know who I am.\u201d</p> <p>It seems astonishing to think nine years have passed since he threw up his hands in despair during rough weather at Royal St George\u2019s. The Open is scheduled to return to the Kent course this year but is shrouded in doubt. \u201cI was a lot younger and back then I wasn\u2019t good at embracing a challenge or adversity,\u201d McIlroy says.</p> <p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the common answer but that\u2019s never who I\u2019ve been. I was impulsive and speaking off the cuff. I played 13 holes in brutal conditions.

There are mitigating circumstances but they matter not, including to the player himself. \u201cI am obviously good enough, I can win World Golf Championships and FedEx Cups.

It is such a shame - relatively of course - that for now he is denied the opportunity when his form is so formidable. The grin returns when he contemplates whether any aspect of Portrush can be directly relevant at Augusta National. \u201cAt least if I hit it left off that tee, I\u2019ll be all right \u2026\u201d The thrill will be in standing there in the first place.</p>",
  "<p>One of the UK\u2019s most senior medical leaders lauded \u201cgreen shoots\u201d of recovery from the coronavirus crisis, even as the daily death toll hit a record 381 and experts questioned whether the government has a credible route out of the lockdown.</p> \n<p>Speaking in No 10, Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said there had been a \u201cbit of a plateau\u201d in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus, which could be a sign that the UK is seeing a slowdown in its spread.</p> \n<p>He gave his assessment at a press conference alongside Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, who said it was \u201cdeeply shocking, disturbing, moving\u201d that 381 people had died in a day. The latest figures take the total UK death toll from coronavirus to 1,789.</p> \n<p>Among the deaths was Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/boy-13-die-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus\">a 13-year-old boy from London</a>, the UK\u2019s youngest victim of coronavirus. He reportedly had no underlying health conditions.</p> \n<p>\u201cSadly, a 13-year old boy who tested positive for Covid-19 has passed away, and our thoughts and condolences are with the family at this time,\u201d King\u2019s College hospital said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Earlier in the day, NHS England confirmed that a 19-year-old had died after testing positive for Covid-19. The Italian chef, named as Luca di Nicola by La Repubblica, was at that stage believed to be England\u2019s youngest victim. His aunt told the website that he was \u201cvery healthy\u201d.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/england-and-wales-coronavirus-death-toll-40-higher-than-previously-stated\">New figures</a> showed an additional 40 previously unreported coronavirus deaths in England and Wales earlier this month. The new figures, published by the Office for National Statistics for the period to 20 March, suggest that almost one in five coronavirus deaths are occurring outside hospitals, so went uncounted in data published by NHS England.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite the highest day for deaths since the crisis began, Powis said there was some cause for hope that social distancing is working, because of the relatively flat numbers of people testing positive for coronavirus.He cautioned that there were \u201cgreen shoots \u2013 but only green shoots and we must not be complacent and we must not take our foot off the pedal.\u201d</p> \n<p>It came amid increased pressure over the failure to carry out mass testing, which some public health experts believe is the only sensible way to ease lockdown conditions. Daily testing stood at just over 8,200 on Tuesday, short of the 10,000-a-day target.</p> \n<p>Public health academics told the Guardian that widespread testing in the community \u2013 not just in hospitals and among NHS workers \u2013 was necessaryto suppress new hotspots.Gove said there were shortages of chemical reagents used for testing live cases of the virus. </p> \n<p>However, the Chemical Industries Association told ITV it was not aware<br>of any shortages and was contacting Gove\u2019s office to find out what he<br>meant.</p> \n<p>The group said reagents are being produced and delivered to the NHS.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile there is of course an escalating demand, there are reagents being manufactured and delivered to the NHS,\u201d it said in a statement.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery business here in the UK and globally is looking at what they can do to help meet the demand as a matter of urgency. To clarify the exact NHS need and meet it, all relevant UK industries are continuing to work closely with government.\u201d</p> \n<p>The difficulty of obtaining tests was underlined by the Welsh government\u2019s admission that a private company had pulled out of a contract to provide 5,000 tests daily, leaving Wales only able to carry out 800 tests a day.</p> \n<p>One Whitehall insider concerned about the government\u2019s strategy told the Guardian that there were two barriers to more testing \u2013 firstly that the UK had been too slow to order tests, and secondly that government experts are still privately \u201ccounting on herd immunity\u201d as a way out of the crisis, despite ministers\u2019 denials.</p> \n<p>The source said the fact that the government keeps talking about the possibility of an antibody test to show whether someone is immune shows ministers are still thinking about herd immunity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, insisted on March 15 that herd immunity was \u201cnot a part\u201d of government strategy. But as recently as March 24, Jo Churchill, a health minister, said in a written answer to parliament that it was still part of the government\u2019s expectations. \u201cHerd immunity is not part of the government action plan but is a natural by-product of an epidemic,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, appeared to confirm that the UK is still hoping for a large degree of immunity among the public to help lead to an easing lockdown measures. The alternative would be a strategy of suppressing the virus where it arises through rigorous testing and quarantining, as seen in South Korea.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe have-you-had-it test is the secret to the secret to the answer about the lockdown,\u201d she told the government press conference. \u201cIf we know how many people have had it, then we will understand the proportion of the population that could still get it. That gives us the clue to a number of things. For example, if we are to develop a vaccine, we can know how many people we need to immunise. If we are going to take lockdown measures off, we can model to say we know this proportion of the population is still likely to get the disease, so what happens to the second spike if we take them off\u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are other scientists testing cohorts\u2026 so we can start to get an idea how many people in the population have had it. That is more of a clue to managing the end of the outbreak and when we can take the locks off.\u201d</p> \n<p>Several public health academics challenged the government\u2019s strategy. Prof Nicola Stonehouse, an expert in molecular virology at the University of Leeds, said: \u201cWe should test for virus and exposure in the public. If we have that information we can have a more sensible approach about moving back to normality.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t get the perfect reagent or set of reagents do we do nothing, or say let\u2019s use something else? That\u2019s where things have jammed up. Other countries are working around that. We have to be more creative.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at University of Edinburgh, also said: \u201cEveryone in quarantine [is] not sustainable. It\u2019s really expensive economically and socially. There has to be a safe way out of lockdown and I can\u2019t see any other way than mass testing. We have to figure out who has the virus, who they are around, and change it so only they are in quarantine. Lockdown is a very blunt tool, it\u2019s not precise. If they can\u2019t do the testing they should just come out and say it.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said both tests of live cases and an antibody test \u2013 to show who has had the virus - were needed. </p> \n<p>Amid the concerns about testing, there appeared to be better news on ventilators, as Gove revealed that the first newly-commissioned devices will roll off the production line this weekend and be delivered to the NHS next week.</p> \n<p>Gove also confirmed that three RAF Puma helicopters are now stationed at Kinloss Barracks in Moray - working with a Chinook and Wildcat helicopter based at RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire - to meet requests for assistance from NHS boards and trusts across Scotland and Northern England.</p> \n<p>They have been made available to evacuate critically ill patients as well as moving equipment and medical personnel around the country.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 April 2020 to correct a reference to \u201cone in four\u201d coronavirus deaths potentially occurring outside of a hospital setting; this should have been one in five. It was also amended to make clear that the additional 40 recorded deaths were for the period to 20 March.</p>",

There has been so much pride already in what army personnel, private contractors, volunteers and health workers have achieved in summoning the outline of a new hospital.</p> \n<p>What is certain is that this place is going to be altered profoundly.</p> \n<p>As of Tuesday lunchtime the city beyond was still silent.

Optimism that the Covid-19 crisis will soon be over could be badly misplaced.</strong></p> <p>So writes my colleague Nils Pratley tonight:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The rapid bounce-back theory rests on the idea that lockdowns will last only two or three months, at most, with no need to reimpose them.</p> <p>Perhaps that will be accurate but, remember, the investment consensus eight weeks ago was that Covid-19 was mainly a China-only affair and would be over quickly. Projections have been made to look very silly very quickly in this crisis. It is why little should be read into Tuesday\u2019s better-than-expected survey of business confidence in China: one unreliable piece of data does not imply a lasting rebound.</p> <p>Nor do we know if governments\u2019 support packages, though they seemed enormous on announcement, will be sufficient. Look at the calls for extra help already piling up at the UK Treasury\u2019s door: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/intu-warns-it-could-go-bust-after-reporting-2bn-loss\">even commercial landlords</a>, who should be well placed to take some strain, are begging the state to cover shortfalls in their rental income.</p> <p>What we know now is that there will be a big bill at the end. The UK Debt Management Office on Tuesday said it would raise \u00a345bn just in April via sales of government debt, a stunning sum that compares with \u00a39.5bn in the same month last year. In the coming financial year, the UK\u2019s budget deficit could treble to \u00a3200bn, or 10% of GDP, the Institute of Fiscal Studies estimated last week. Meanwhile, companies, many of which were carrying too much debt in the first place, will be carrying even heavier levels.

Chinese companies have reported a pick-up in economic activity this month, as they start to recover from the Covid-19 shutdown.</p> <p>The latest survey of China\u2019s purchasing managers suggests that some green shoots are peaking out, as companies return to work.</p> <p>The Chinese composite PMI, which tracks activity across service sector firms and factories, surged back to <strong>53 </strong>from a record low of <strong>28.9 </strong>in February. That\u2019s stronger than economists expected.</p> <p>Crucially, that lifts the PMI above the 50-point mark that separates monthly growth from contraction. </p> <p>Both key sectors of the economy reported a pickup:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Manufacturing PMI</strong>: Up to 52 in March, from 35.7 in February. </li> <li><strong>Services PMI:</strong> Up to 52.3, from 29.6 in February</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s early days, of course. The rebound may be partly due to the shocking slump in February. And the PMIs are \u2018soft data\u2019, relying on managers reporting on their own conditions.<br></p> <p>China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics was somewhat cautious about the PMIs, saying the figures:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>....reflects that more than half of the surveyed enterprises have resumed work and resumed production, better than last month, but it does not mean that China\u2019s economic operation has returned to normal\u201d. </p> </blockquote> <p>But the survey does suggest China\u2019s economy is recovering as it starts to relax some of its coronavirus restrictions -- just as many other economies, large and small, head into a deep slump.</p> <p>As Reuters points out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The survey\u2019s sub-index of [China\u2019s] manufacturing production picked up to 54.1 in March from February\u2019s 27.8, while a reading of new orders rose to 52 from 29.3 a month earlier.</p> <p>New export orders received by Chinese manufacturers ticked up to 46.4 from 28.7 in February, but were still mired in contraction.</p> </blockquote> <p>This could reassure markets, and perhaps calm some of the recent volatility that has sent asset prices swinging. But, with infections still rising sharply in Europe and America, the pandemic is still threatening to cause a very steep downturn.</p> <p><em>I\u2019ll pull together some reaction now....</em></p> <p>Economic data due later today is likely to show that Germany\u2019s unemployment total has risen this month, while US consumer confidence has probably taken a big hit too.</p> <h2>The agenda</h2> <ul> <li>8.55am BST: German unemployment figures for March: Jobless total expected to rise by 25,000</li> <li>10am BST: Eurozone inflation figures for March: CPI expected to fall to 0.8% from 1.2%</li> <li>3pm BST: US consumer confidence index for March: expected to slump to 112.0 from 130.7 </li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T06:49:30.789Z\">at 7.49am BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>The arms race between human immunity and viral pathogens is constant. The contest had been hidden from the public until swine flu, the first global influenza pandemic for more than 40 years, hit the UK in 2009. This <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/15/last-pandemic-england-12401281/\" title=\"\">outbreak</a> was contained with fewer than 500 deaths. Britain was lulled into a false sense of security that its infection control measures would be enough to contain a new infectious disease.</p> <p>Governments pursued a course of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf\" title=\"\">mitigation</a>, where it is accepted a deadly disease will spread but the losses are bearable. This was true of Labour and Conservative governments. Alan Johnson, health secretary in Gordon Brown\u2019s administration, admitted to a <a href=\"https://www.jesip.org.uk/uploads/media/incident_reports_and_inquiries/Influenza%20Pandemic.pdf\" title=\"\">peers\u2019 inquiry</a> in 2009 that at the \u201cpeak of a \u2018reasonable worst-care scenario\u2019 pandemic, intensive care capacity may well be inadequate\u201d. That this calculation had not changed since is the reason for the extreme lockdown we are enduring.</p> <p>What has altered is the nature of the threat. Covid-19 is 50 times more deadly than swine flu. It is far more easily <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/coronavirus-vs-sars-mers-flu-how-deaths-compare-covid-19/\" title=\"\">transmitted</a>. The world is more globalised, heightening the risk of rapid spread of the virus, especially one that travels with close contact. These were all quantifiable risks. It is disastrous that such a virus has been left to spread untracked around the country. This would have tested any health system, let alone one running close to full capacity and groaning under a winter flu season.</p> <p>Our shortcomings are now being painfully exposed. The global demand for the ventilators that help severely ill coronavirus patients to breathe looks almost certain to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f2845b3-a1ed-44cb-90af-e04d8d712403\" title=\"\">outstrip supply</a>. Plans for homemade machines are being drawn up on the fly. Frontline medics complain they are putting their lives at risk because of a lack of protective equipment. The failure to act fast enough lies behind the testing fiasco. Testing is central to reducing the fatality rate, because it leads to early detection. It allows transmission to be curbed and for resources to be pointed rapidly to the infected.</p> <p>But to test requires staff, equipment and chemicals. The worry is that the NHS does not have enough trained workers to operate the tests. Then there are concerns over supply. Lombardy in Italy, one of hardest-hit places in Europe, is home to one of the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/18/817801222/testing-swabs-run-in-short-supply-as-makers-try-to-speed-up-production\" title=\"\">largest makers</a> of testing swabs. There is a worldwide race to secure the chemical reagents required for the kits. Michael Gove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/31/uk-coronavirus-live-ons-death-toll-covid-19-latest?CMP=share_btn_tw&amp;page=with:block-5e836b9d8f0866297e9f4694#block-5e836b9d8f0866297e9f4694\" title=\"\">acknowledged</a> on Tuesday evening that Britain has much ground to make up in order to copy South Korea\u2019s successful rollback strategy.</p> <p>Yet Seoul\u2019s achievement was founded on mass-sourcing reagents in January when they were plentiful. Now it\u2019s much tougher, as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Delfraissy, the immunologist who heads France\u2019s Covid-19 response, <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2020/03/20/jean-francois-delfraissy-nous-avons-une-vision-a-quatre-semaines_6033854_3244.html\" title=\"\">warned</a> this month. He said France had \u201ca huge problem with the reagents used in the tests. These basic reagents are from China and the United States. The production of machines stopped in China and the US keeps the [reagents] for itself.\u201d</p> <p>What is required is more international cooperation to prevent these rivalries from causing avoidable deaths. China has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/lockdown-china-coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">crucial role</a> to play, having experienced five <a href=\"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2016/5717108/tab1/\" title=\"\">respiratory virus epidemics</a> in 20 years. The success of Germany\u2019s well-resourced public health system in handling the outbreak ought to be a model to emulate. David Alexander, professor of risk at University College London, told the <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/03/why-weren-t-we-ready\" title=\"\">New Statesman</a> that pandemic preparation involves \u201ctelling governments what they don\u2019t want to know, to spend money they don\u2019t have, on something they don\u2019t think will happen\u201d.</p> <p>Every year, <a href=\"https://medium.com/wintoncentre/how-much-normal-risk-does-covid-represent-4539118e1196\" title=\"\">600,000 people die in the UK</a>. If unchallenged, Covid-19 threatens to almost double that and overwhelm the NHS. In the face of uncertainty, it\u2019s appropriate for government to be resilient to extreme events. The science may not be black and white, and no one can possess perfect actuarial clarity. But this crisis has shown us how we can \u2013 and must \u2013 insure against the uncertainty.</p>",

And, if you caught the bottom, congratulations: you could have made about 16% in three days.</p> <p>Grounds for optimism? It\u2019s far too soon to say, obviously. All one can conclude from the outbreak of relative calm is that investors like the policymakers\u2019 responses so far. A fortnight ago, their big fear was a credit crisis \u2013 and the first stirrings were definitely present. Central banks (at least for now) seemed to have seen off that risk by flooding the financial system with liquidity and \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d messages. That was the moment when peak panic passed. Even the rush to the haven of US dollars has abated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-pandemic-has-delivered-the-fastest-deepest-economic-shock-in-history\">Coronavirus pandemic has delivered the fastest, deepest economic shock in history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, western government\u2019s economic lockdown measures \u2013 everything from the $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) stimulus package in the US to UK chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-promises-to-guarantee-330bn-loans-to-business\">Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u00a3330bn lending package</a> plus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">80% \u201cfurlough\u201d</a> scheme in the UK \u2013 have been applauded as robust interventions that maximise the chances of a V-shaped recovery. Investors have even learned to love lockdowns: they speak to the same narrative that, once the spread of the virus has been contained, the global economy will rev with pent-up demand by the end of the year.</p> <p>The script could indeed develop that way but some heroic assumptions are being made. The rapid bounce-back theory rests on the idea that lockdowns will last only two or three months, at most, with no need to reimpose them.</p> <p>Perhaps that will be accurate but, remember, the investment consensus eight weeks ago was that Covid-19 was mainly a China-only affair and would be over quickly. Projections have been made to look very silly very quickly in this crisis. It is why little should be read into Tuesday\u2019s better-than-expected survey of business confidence in China: one unreliable piece of data does not imply a lasting rebound.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor do we know if governments\u2019 support packages, though they seemed enormous on announcement, will be sufficient. Look at the calls for extra help already piling up at the UK Treasury\u2019s door: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/intu-warns-it-could-go-bust-after-reporting-2bn-loss\">even commercial landlords</a>, who should be well placed to take some strain, are begging the state to cover shortfalls in their rental income.</p> <p>What we know now is that there will be a big bill at the end. The UK Debt Management Office on Tuesday said it would raise \u00a345bn just in April via sales of government debt, a stunning sum that compares with \u00a39.5bn in the same month last year. In the coming financial year, the UK\u2019s budget deficit could treble to \u00a3200bn, or 10% of GDP, the Institute of Fiscal Studies estimated last week. Meanwhile, companies, many of which were carrying too much debt in the first place, will be carrying even heavier levels. It all drags on investment.</p> <p>Stock markets can, obviously, look through such worries \u2013 they are in the business of peering round the next corner. All the same, it\u2019s hard to believe this bear market will be banished quickly. Stuttering progress, punctuated by frequent disappointments, feels as much as one can reasonably expect from shares for a while. In the phrase we\u2019re hearing a lot from clinicians these days, it\u2019s a marathon not a sprint.</p>",

That meant a mentally-ill patient could end up in a care home without their or their guardian\u2019s consent, to free up hospital beds for other patients.</p> \n  <p>In a policy memorandum published alongside the bill, the Scottish government said it was justified because elderly patients were the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, while the crisis meant extra beds were desperately needed.</p> \n  <p>The government said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Hospitals are looking to increase dramatically the number of beds available to deal with the expected large influx of patients affected by coronavirus and requiring hospital treatment. Adults lacking capacity are often elderly patients with dementia who are at high risk from coronavirus and it is a high priority to move them to somewhere safer and more suitable for their care and treatment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dr Arun Chopra, the commission\u2019s medical director, said it was very concerned about the rights of those patients. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We understand the need for this emergency legislation to become available during these exceptional times, but we would want to see the reduction in safeguards to only be used if absolutely necessary, and for as short a time as is possible.</p> \n   <p>We believe it is vital that effective mechanisms are in place to scrutinise how and when these powers are used.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The commission said it would adapt its monitoring systems to cope with the emergency powers published in the new coronavirus (Scotland) bill, and the impact the pandemic had on services.

For example, transport use has decreased dramatically. </p> \n  <p>Less social contact means a lower chance the virus can pass from one person to another. Over time that will mean a lower number of people testing positive. That will also translate into a lower number of hospital admissions, which typically takes place two weeks after transmission.</p> \n  <p>The rate of hospitalisation is currently increasing, which is expected at this stage. But if social contact continues to decline, the number of hospitalisations will also. </p> \n  <p>China over time has flattened the curve and the number of deaths has reduced.</p> \n  <p>Powis said there was a \u201cbit of a plateau\u201d in the number of new cases of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK, however: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have had a rise in the number of UK cases but recently there\u2019s a little bit of a plateau.

The government has organised for some deliveries to be made direct to those who have been told to self-isolate, leaving the division of responsibilities confused, local authorities say. </p> \n  <p>The food supplied to Rochdale for households was mostly made up of empty calories and included a giant bottle of sweetened fruit squash, a bag of sugar, teabags, confectionery, small individually wrapped gingerbread biscuits, egg noodles, hard-to-split catering size packs of Angel Delight dessert mix, and just one apple per person. </p> \n  <p>Inventories seen by the Guardian of what was delivered to some other councils over the last few days list similar items of very low nutritional value, including tins of creamed rice, long-life sweetened custard, and, as in Rochdale, giant bottles of fruit squash. Some have also received a small number of longlife \u201cone meal\u201d portions of ready meals such as sausages and mash. </p> \n  <p>One council told us that the only fresh fruit or vegetables on its list of what would be supplied were a limited number of apples, but these did not in fact get delivered. </p> \n  <p>The government promised the packages would contain essential food and household items for those with underlying health problems who need to self-isolate at home for 12 weeks and have no family or friends to help them. The communities secretary, <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, appeared on television news over the weekend helping deliver food boxes to houses with vulnerable people. </p> \n  <p>Rochdale council\u2019s Labour leader, Allen Brett, called on the government yesterday to improve the quality of its parcels: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Everyone appreciates that this is an unprecedented situation but the parcels that have been provided were not of the quality we were expecting. Thankfully our council officers are able to source food locally and add them to the packs to ensure that those receiving them have a better choice of items.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He told the Guardian that after he went public with his concerns he received a call late last night from the secretary of state\u2019s office accusing him of putting out false information. </p> \n  <p>A council spokesman said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We do not recognise the secretary of state\u2019s description of these packages being additional supplies to kick-start wider efforts as they were linked directly to our shielded residents. While we are pleased to hear reports that packages sent directly to homes were of a higher standard, we also note that other councils have expressed concerns about the quality of the initial packages they received from government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Referring food items sent out in Rochdale, a government spokesperson said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This picture is misleading, it is not one of the food boxes we are delivering directly to the homes of extremely medically vulnerable people.</p> \n   <p>Our food boxes are of a standard that is consistent and include cereal, fruit and vegetables and pasta.

Current estimates project fatalities exceeding 1 percent of the incarcerated population, amounting to over 800 deaths. </p> \n   <p>Just one person carrying Covid-19 can infect dozens of others in close quarters.

It is expected emissions will fall this year, though analysts have warned they are likely to return to previous levels once the threat from the virus has passed unless policies change.</p> <p>The data shows the biggest emitters last year were LNG projects: Chevron\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/08/gorgon-lng-plant-begins-long-delayed-carbon-capture-and-storage-project\">Gorgon development</a> in the Pilbara, Woodside\u2019s North West Shelf project and Inpex\u2019s Ichthys development.</p> <p>In addition to companies emitting at levels above previous baselines, the data shows a growing number of companies have been granted what is known as a multiyear monitoring period, under which emissions limits are no longer annual, but spread over a number of years. The number of facilities with these multiyear limits increased from 17 to 31.</p> <p>McFadzean said it was effectively another way for companies to avoid paying for emitting too much in a given year. \u201cIn many cases they are not reducing their emissions in subsequent years, but instead are allowed to recalculate their baselines and pollute more,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The safeguard mechanism sets a baseline for industrial facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes each year. When the scheme began, baselines were based on either a facility\u2019s highest emissions level over the previous five years or an independent forecast of future pollution.</p> <p>Under changes introduced this year, all facilities are moving to limits based not on total emissions, but on emissions intensity \u2013 how much they emit per unit of production. It means that companies that lift production will be able to release more CO<sub>2</sub> without risking a penalty.</p> <p>It could also allow a government to require companies to reduce emissions intensity over time to drive a shift to cleaner practice without affecting production levels. Labor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/30/labor-tighten-emissions-regime-climate-election\">indicated it would have done this</a>, without releasing much detail, if it won last year\u2019s election.</p> <p>In 2015, Hunt said the safeguard would be used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/01/emissions-target-will-require-major-changes-to-direct-action-say-experts\">to cut emissions by 200m tonnes over the decade to 2030</a>, but the government later shelved that estimate. The policy <a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/bb29bc9f-8b96-4b10-84a0-46b7d36d5b8e/files/climate-solutions-package.pdf\">was not included</a> among policies that the government said would help it meet Australia\u2019s commitments under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">Paris climate agreement</a>.</p> <p>In February, Taylor said the safeguard mechanism was \u201cdesigned to support growth while encouraging businesses to lower their emissions intensity\u201d.</p> <p>The Carbon Market Institute, representing businesses focused on climate action, has called for the safeguard mechanism and emissions reduction fund to be reformed as part of a post-virus economic repair that also focuses on \u201c<a href=\"https://carbonmarketinstitute.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=50ddb259e02df59545383e3e6&amp;id=e0176e95fe&amp;e=8bc188c98b\">land and climate repair</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The institute\u2019s chief executive, John Connor, said the emissions reduction fund would need to be less dependent on taxpayer\u2019s money and increasingly driven by business, and baselines under the safeguard should be strengthened to cut pollution over time.</p>",
  "<p>Surely the best witnesses to the fact that the key to awe and wonder is feeling small are astronauts. Like Captain Jim Lovell, who, when on board the Apollo 8 on Christmas Eve 1968, raised his hand against the window and watched the entire planet disappear. \u201cI realised how insignificant we all are if everything I\u2019d ever known is behind my thumb,\u201d he said. The first person to ever step on to the moon, Neil Armstrong, did exactly the same thing. He recalled later: \u201cIt suddenly struck me that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn\u2019t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.\u201d</p> <p>We have shot hundreds of human beings into space over the past few decades, most with a background in engineering, science, medicine or the military, and almost all of them seem to return with permanently widened eyes. Former soldiers suddenly speak of elation, mathematicians of bliss, biologists of transcendence. The term for the psychological impact of flying into space and viewing the Earth as a simple dot is called the \u201cOverview Effect\u201d, and it was coined by author Frank White in his book of the same name in 1987. White defined it as \u201ca profound reaction to viewing the Earth from outside its atmosphere\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/26/they-told-me-i-had-18-months-to-live-nothing-was-more-important-than-finishing-my-book\">They told me I had 18 months to live. Nothing was more important than finishing my book | Andrew Darby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Overview Effect turns astronauts into \u201cevangelists, preaching the gospel of orbit\u201d as they return from space with a renewed faith or on a quest for wisdom. For some it\u2019s a kind of lingering euphoria that results in a permanent change of perspective. The first human to reach outer space, the Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, who circled the Earth for 108 minutes in 1961, came back with a clarion call: \u201cOrbiting Earth in the spaceship, I saw how beautiful our planet is. People, let us preserve and increase this beauty, not destroy it.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, scientists have been trying to measure and understand the Overview Effect, even sending people into virtual space, where they view galaxies through portals, and then grilling them about their responses, but the accounts of astronauts provide the best insights. The words they use are saturated with awe, an understanding of how fragile the Earth is, with its paper-thin atmosphere, and how much needs to be done to protect it and its inhabitants.</p> <p>As Syrian astronaut Muhammad Ahmad Faris said, when you look at Earth from space, the \u201cscars of national boundaries\u201d disappear. American Sam Durrance said he became emotional after having hurtled past the stratosphere into black space because \u201cyou\u2019re removed from the Earth but at the same time you feel this incredible connection to the Earth like nothing I\u2019d ever felt before\u201d. Mae Jemison, the first black woman to travel in space, who orbited the Earth 127 times in 1992 on board the space shuttle Endeavour, also says she felt \u201cvery connected with the rest of the universe\u201d. (She later told students: \u201cLife is best when you live deeply and look up.\u201d)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0e1c6ec01989996cec7c116d13e1eda3461e5b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0e1c6ec01989996cec7c116d13e1eda3461e5b2/0_1000_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Planet Earth from space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Planet Earth from space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Japanese term <em>yugen</em>, which derives from the study of aesthetics, is sometimes used to describe space-gazing. It is said to mean \u201ca profound, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universe \u2026 and the sad beauty of human suffering\u201d, though the meaning and translation depend on the context. Japanese actor and aesthetician Zeami Motokiyo described some of the ways to access yugen:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>To watch the sun sink behind a flower-clad hill.</em></p> <p><em>To wander on in a huge forest without thought of return. To stand upon the shore and gaze after a boat that disappears behind distant islands. To contemplate the flight of wild geese seen and lost among the clouds.</em></p> <p><em>And subtle shadows of bamboo on bamboo.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Or to stare at the heavens from Earth, or Earth from the heavens.</p> <p>Yugen is also defined as \u201can awareness of the universe that triggers emotional responses too big and powerful for words\u201d. It\u2019s striking how, repeatedly, people who venture into space speak of the inadequacy of words. Former Nasa astronaut Kathryn D Sullivan, who in 1984 became the first woman to ever walk in space (and in 2013 was nominated by president Obama to be under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere), was also gobsmacked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain how amazing and magical this experience is,\u201d she says. \u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s the astounding beauty and diversity of the planet itself, scrolling across your view at what appears to be a smooth, stately pace \u2026 I\u2019m happy to report that no amount of prior study or training can fully prepare anybody for the awe and wonder this inspires.\u201d</p> <p>American engineer and astronaut Nicole Stott reported that she was \u201cstunned in a way that was completely unexpected\u201d. She described it to her seven-year-old son this way: \u201cJust take a lightbulb \u2013 the brightest lightbulb that you could ever possibly imagine \u2013 and paint it all the colours that you know Earth to be, and turn it on, and be blinded by it.\u201d</p> <p>When you shrink, your ability to see somehow sharpens. When you see the beauty, vastness and fragility of nature, you want to preserve it. You see what we share, and how we connect. You understand being small. Astronaut Boris Volynov said that after seeing Earth from black space \u201cyou become more full of life, softer. You begin to look at all living things with greater trepidation and you begin to be more kind and patient with the people around you.\u201d</p> <p>Scott Kelly, who spent a full year on the International Space Station from 2015 to 2016, delighting Earth-dwellers with his tweets and superb photographs, told Business Insider that the experience of space makes people more empathetic, \u201cmore in touch with humanity and who we are, and what we should do to not only take care of the planet but also to solve our common problems, which clearly are many\u201d. Kelly\u2019s insights echo those of many others: the splendour and vulnerability of the Earth, the connectedness of people, and the need to work in concert, across nations. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\u201cThe planet is incredibly beautiful, breathtakingly beautiful. Having said that, parts of it are polluted, like with constant levels of pollution in certain parts of Asia. You see how fragile the atmosphere looks. It\u2019s very thin. It\u2019s almost like a thin contact lens over somebody\u2019s eye, and you realise all the pollutants we put into the atmosphere are contained in that very thin film over the surface. It\u2019s a little bit scary actually to look at it.</em></p> <p><em>And then you realise looking at the Earth, that despite its beauty and its tranquility, there\u2019s a lot of hardship and conflict that goes on. You look at the planet without borders, especially during the day. At night you can see countries with lights, but during the daytime it looks like we are all part of one spaceship, Spaceship Earth.</em></p> <p><em>And we\u2019re all flying through space together, as a team, and it gives you this perspective \u2013 people have described it as this \u2018orbital perspective\u2019 \u2013 on humanity, and you get this feeling that we just need to work better \u2013 much, much better \u2013 to solve our common problems.\u201d</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The first Canadian to walk in space, Chris Hadfield, says whizzing across continents and seeing a sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes creates \u201ca feeling of privilege and sort of a reverence, an awe that is pervasive. And that sense of wonder and privilege and clarity of the world slowly shifts your view.\u201d He believes the Overview Effect is not limited to spaceflight but is more about \u201cwhen you sense that there is something so much bigger than you, so much more deep than you are, ancient, [that] has sort of a natural importance that dwarfs your own.\u201d This understanding, Hadfield suggests, can lead people to make smarter global decisions, and less \u201cjealous, local, narrow\u201d ones.

The easy option would be to piece together a version of the old that would be just as susceptible to increasingly common global disasters. The opportunity that presents itself now is to build something new \u2013 something that will last. Something more agile and inclusive.</p> <p>Given a chance to rebuild, let\u2019s create an industry that is equitable and an environment where elite athletes exist in the same reality as their colleagues in other roles across the industry. Let\u2019s rebuild this industry so that it truly reflects the society to which it owes its existence. Rebuild it with people of varying intersections, class and experiences inside headquarters and at clubs, as well as in the stands.</p> <p>As for this period of suspended play, there are but a few left standing. For all the hard work clubs and the league have done to be an inclusive game, in the industry that remains there are few women left, even fewer people of colour, and virtually no one who knows what it feels like to truly be on the outer and feel the squeeze of this downturn. Given this, the AFL must hold tight to its commitment to remaining inclusive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/mar/27/hawthorn-v-geelong-vfl-grand-final-1989-retro-liveblog\">Hawthorn v Geelong: VFL grand final 1989 \u2013 retro liveblog</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now more than ever, it\u2019s crucial to ensure diversity of gender in decision-making groups and committees. To ignore this is to betray any commitment to diversity in the first place. Similarly, any commitment to community football and programming for the traditionally marginalised will be rendered hollow and superficial if their voices are not considered or do not feature when the industry is revived. Those who are most vulnerable, who felt visible because for a time we shone our light on them, don\u2019t disappear because football has.</p> <p>If the most privileged voices in football are the only ones that have risen above others in this calamity of a year, then this game has been irresponsible in its commitment to its community. Yes, there are fiscal challenges to this, but investing in its community will bring the people back to football. Perhaps we can live without the bells and whistles. In fact, some would argue we should. But the people and communities who have given life to the game, at all levels and in all its dimensions? This we cannot live without.</p> <p>To answer these questions the AFL and clubs will need creativity, innovation and diversity among their ranks and, most importantly, inclusion at the core of its mission. The AFL will need to find new ways to reach out to people in their homes across the country. It will need to remind them the game is still theirs. Indeed, it always was.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rana Hussain is a diversity and inclusion specialist, a writer and a member of the Outer Sanctum podcast.</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>An anti-coronavirus song from Senegal, applause for health workers ringing out in Paris and the return of the dawn chorus in Warsaw are just a few of the sounds that have been captured as part of an art project that aims to record how the sound of cities is dramatically changing during the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://citiesandmemory.com/sounds/\">Cities and Memories website</a> has collected field recordings from around the world for the past five years and this week launched a new campaign to build a global crowdsourced sound map, which shows how our aural lives are shifting as lockdown affects the world and urban environments evolve.</p> <p>Stuart Fowkes who runs the project, which has had contributions from 70 countries, says the outbreak and subsequent lockdown has transformed the way cities sound in the matter of a few days. \u201cThis is a really unique time when the world is sounding like it\u2019s never sounded before,\u201d he said. \u201cIn none of our lifetimes has the world ever sounded like it does right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are lots of amazing photo galleries of abandoned cities and great video testimonies but there hasn\u2019t been a huge amount focusing on the way that the world\u2019s sounds have been shifting,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://citiesandmemory.com/\">interactive map</a> features a sound from around the world and information about the entry and the contributor. So far they have included everything from the changing sounds of morning prayer from a Tibetan monastery in northern India to a Finnish woman reading out excerpts of Roald Dahl stories to her infant relatives in isolation.</p> <p>Fowkes says the sounds can be categorised into four areas. Firstly, the new sounds that have been created because of the outbreak, such as applause for health workers. \u201cThere are recordings from Brussels, Paris, Lima, Madrid from people who are doing it every single night,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are church bells being rung to support health workers as well, these are the new sounds.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ec04a8f2653d0e663a3b9aaecbacd30075c1b20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec04a8f2653d0e663a3b9aaecbacd30075c1b20/0_40_5962_3578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People in Paris take part in a daily applause in support of medical workers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in Paris take part in a daily applause in support of medical workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoffroy van der Hasselt/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second category is sounds from inside the home, such as a woman in Helsinki who can\u2019t see the children in her family so she records stories for them remotely instead. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a chapter of the BFG being read out in Finnish,\u201d said Fowkes. \u201cIt\u2019s what people are doing inside their own houses and how they are coping with social distancing and how that can be translated into sounds.\u201d</p> <p>The third is sounds from the natural world that are reemerging as human activity in cities dwindles. Fowkes says a man from Warsaw said he could hear birdsong that had not been audible before. \u201cOne of the few positives from this situation is that people are starting to reconnect with nature a little bit and starting to notice the sounds that are usually drowned out around them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the biggest thing in the world but it is a little bonus.\u201d</p> <p>The last category is the lack of typical sounds caused by the desertion of certain places, such as Times Square in New York, which is one of the most popular urban attractions in the world but a recording sent to Fowkes captures how \u201cnow all you can hear is just an air-conditioning drone and nothing else\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc35f786fc9f8c5c6de6988d1dd8f056e325ea32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc35f786fc9f8c5c6de6988d1dd8f056e325ea32/0_255_5626_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Leigh, 93, (second left) rings a bell for the NHS, with her family  in Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara Leigh, 93, (second left) rings a bell for the NHS, with her family in Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fowkes says the project is not just about collecting the sounds, it\u2019s also about recording people\u2019s experiences and concerns, such as fears they may have about losing their jobs or how they are going to entertain housebound children for weeks on ends. \u201cWe had one in this morning from someone in New York who said the city hasn\u2019t sounded like this since 9/11,\u201d Fowkes said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense in New York that it feels like ground zero again because it is the epicentre of the outbreak in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Fowkes hopes the project will encourage people to pay more attention to their sonic surroundings and notice how human activity can change it dramatically, for example, the disappearance of air traffic \u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily notice when something disappears but when it comes back again they really notice it,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe sounds of cities are changing all the time,\u201d he added. \u201cBefore any of this happened traditional sounds, such as church bells, were starting to become harder to hear and birds were starting to change the way they call in order to combat traffic noise. But now things are really changing in a matter of weeks.\u201d</p> <p>Anyone can take part in the project by contributing a sound to the map. Entries can be sent to the website and Fowkes says his dream addition would be church bells from Italian towns and villages. \u201cI\u2019d love to be there to record the bell towers ringing while everything else is pretty much closed. I think that is a poignant reminder of daily life as it should be and daily life as it is now.\u201d<br></p>",

Police have a clear set of rules that they can enforce, and enforcement beyond those rules is outside the scope of their powers and unlawful.</p> <p>As the police monitoring group <a href=\"https://twitter.com/netpol/status/1244624516065767433?s=20\">Netpol remarked</a> yesterday, arbitrary policing wasn\u2019t suddenly invented last week. While some white people may be surprised by the inconsistent way in which the new powers are being enforced, communities of colour already know that police discretion is a gift not bestowed equally.</p> <p>There is a long history of police power being deployed as a disciplinary tool against communities of colour, from the<a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/news/fighting-sus-then-and-now/\"> sus laws of the 1970s</a> (the stop and search laws) to the more recent response to serious youth violence, which included calls for <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/police-to-start-armed-patrols-in-londons-gang-crime-hotspots-a3134201.html\">armed police patrols</a> on inner city estates, and even <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/knife-crime-uk-stabbings-gavin-williamson-military-police-cressida-dick-a8809581.html\">deployment of the </a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/knife-crime-uk-stabbings-gavin-williamson-military-police-cressida-dick-a8809581.html\">army</a>.

For some young people of colour, then, daily life was already locked down well before coronavirus arrived.</p> <p>Far from being the solution, police discretion is actually part of the problem.

This is Jack Palance\u2019s first picture and it co-stars the gifted and very young Zero Mostel.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk1r0TO-US8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gk1r0TO-US8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Wonderful movies to see (whether you\u2019ve seen them before or not) are:</p> <p>Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen\u2019s masterpiece Singin\u2019 in the Rain (1952), co-starring the fabulous Debbie Reynolds and Donald O\u2019Connor.

HG Wells loathed the film, when he saw what had been done with his anti-vivisectionist novella The Island of Dr Moreau. The book is equally sadistic, but this movie (and every other movie version since) adds a semi-human woman carved from a panther, for whom Dr Moreau has a decidedly unhealthy and unpleasant fate planned. Island of Lost Souls was banned in the UK when first released and has only recently become available via home video and Blu-ray.

I find myself envying their close-knit communities, which have rallied in mutual support. Meanwhile, I have only just met my next-door neighbour, who moved in six years ago. What am I doing here, so far from nature and from family? What was so important?</p> \n<p>I know the answer to this, of course: my work, my sense of identity, my friends, culture. I felt that the culture London had to offer was unparalleled. But when you close the galleries and the gig venues, what is left? I simply trudge through the same old backstreets on my daily walk; even my local green space, Hampstead Heath, has little new to offer. It has led me to conclude that the city is great because of its people, the people who have made its food and its art; its architecture, too, though much of that now lies empty. As for the geography, I can take it or leave it.</p> \n<p>I wonder if, after this is all over, our cities will see a mass exodus. Crises, such as this pandemic, always lead to a reassessment; in this case of what constitutes privilege, that much-overused term. Aside from wealth, I used to think privilege meant access to culture, which we rightly value as important. Yet many of us have forgotten to value the natural landscape and what it has to offer us. Privilege, as I see it now, in the midst of this emergency, is the ability to roam in the open countryside. I\u2019d lost touch with that, over the years, despite my childhood climbing trees, hiking up the sides of mountains, and swimming in the pools above waterfalls.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"656c1437-656f-47b7-846e-9585f2c91f09\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z5EpwAUwLkk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Of course, it could just be that I am of that age now.

  "<p>During a public health crisis, a government\u2019s credibility is a vital asset. To slow the spread of a virus, the government must convincingly inform and instruct the public.

By expelling a journalist who reported on the country\u2019s coronavirus cases, the government has invited others to wonder what it has to hide.</p> <p>It may have nothing to hide at all. Thus far, there is no evidence of an orchestrated cover-up of infections. Egyptian authorities responded faster and more aggressively than their counterparts in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-egypt/egypt-shuts-schools-universities-for-two-weeks-as-virus-cases-increase-idUSKBN2110SH\">shutting schools and universities</a> weeks ago. The government has halted flights and pledged a coronavirus package of 100 billion Egyptian pounds to combat the virus.</p> <p>Moreover, no country can claim a perfect response \u2013 the scientific consensus about the virus is still emerging, and nobody yet knows how much devastation it will ultimately wreak. Egypt could have acknowledged that most countries undoubtedly have more infections than confirmed numbers, because testing is still limited.</p> <p>The UK itself is contending with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-exposes-the-problems-and-pitfalls-of-modelling\">two dramatically different models</a>: one from Imperial College London researchers, who argue the country is still early in its fight with the virus, and another from researchers at Oxford University, which suggests that as much as half the population (over 30 million people) may have already been infected. In the absence of data about the virus, such models are partly reliant on assumption and speculation, as has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-exposes-the-problems-and-pitfalls-of-modelling\">argued</a> in the Guardian.</p> <p>Rather than concede the complexity of the subject, debate the merits of these claims or explain their views on the matter, Egypt\u2019s government lashed out at the reports, intensifying suspicions that it had something to hide.</p> <p>Indeed, its persistent aversion to transparency has led many observers and foreign governments to view most official claims with a degree of suspicion. When Isis downed a Russian passenger jet over Sinai in 2015, Egypt spent several months denying what countless governments had already concluded was true: Isis\u2019s affiliate in Sinai, Wilayat Sinai, was responsible. But Egyptian investigators pressed on, insisting there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/14/no-evidence-of-terrorism-sinai-air-crash-egypt-says\">no evidence of terrorism or foul play</a>.</p> <p>Several months after the attack, Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/world/middleeast/in-reversal-egypt-says-terrorists-downed-russian-jet-o.html\">casually acknowledged</a> that the plane was brought down by terrorists in a speech about the economy. To this day, conclusions from the investigation have not been made public.

Fatal security failures are a regular feature of our era. Admitting to failures, and working openly with other countries to resolve them, would have helped to build confidence in Egypt\u2019s government. Instead, by spending months denying and obfuscating, many countries questioned whether Egypt was truly committed to improving airport security.</p> <p>Not only was the government\u2019s response harmful \u2013 it was also unnecessary. After the Sinai incident, Egypt took steps to improve airport security, which has continued to be far more stringent than before the crash. But the damage to its reputation had already been done, and would last for years.

You could hand sew it instead. It\u2019s going to be a much longer process but could be very therapeutic, which is something we could all do with right now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dd16f8404f1824f923dd364630fb1647674df36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd16f8404f1824f923dd364630fb1647674df36/0_0_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel W Fletcher with his finished patchwork quilt\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel W Fletcher with his finished patchwork quilt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abbi Fletcher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> intermediate<br><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> an old blanket (or similar), scraps of fabrics, thread, sewing machine needle</p> <p><strong>How to:</strong></p> <p>\u201cFor the nitty-gritty, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danielwfletcher/?hl=en\">head over to my Instagram</a> \u2013 my wonderful sister captured the whole process.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-P9CcHJbql/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Thankfully @abbifletcher was there to document it \ud83e\udd74 I\u2019m always looking for ways to reduce my waste and make use of fabric scraps from the studio. So inspired by my @nextinfashion denim challenge I created this arctic landscape throw. You can use anything for this, old clothes, tea towels, your own waste from sewing projects, basically this should be about using up what you have not buying new. You\u2019ll need a base, this could be an old bed sheet, curtains, an existing blanket that needs updating; any size will do but mine was 140cm x 140cm made from some damaged denim from the studio. Cut it into a square then start laying out your scraps to create your landscape scene. Start from the back and work your way to the bottom of the square. Cut the scraps into rough points, there are no real rules to this, it can be as neat or as messy as you like. Pin everything down then start to sew. Don\u2019t worry about it being too neat here either, just sew along the edge of each piece until they are all attached. You can also do a few extra stitch lines so they look like mountain trails and to make sure all the fabric is secure.  To finish it off I added a bias binding around the edge but you could also fold it over twice and stitch down if you don\u2019t have any binding. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve missed some things out but let me know your question in the comments and I\u2019ll try and answer as many as I can! Can\u2019t wait to see all of your creations! Stay safe and stay home xx</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/danielwfletcher/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> DANIEL w.

At Liam Hodges, we&#39;ve been learning to crochet sporadically over the last months, making it up as we go and along and watching youtube tutorials for some help when needed. This week at home, Liam designed an \u2018ISOL8\u2019 rug for everyone staying in. The rug can be made from old clothes / fabric that you would throw away, or normal yarn.  Materials used: A mixture of old t-shirts (4 beige / green and 2 tie dye) along with @woolandthegang\u2019s jersey be good black yarn made from industrial waste from the manufacturing of garments.  Send us or tag us in your attempts or anything else you\u2019ve been learning and making during this time at home. #STAYATHOME</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/liam__hodges/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> LIAM HODGES</a> (@liam__hodges) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-03-27T11:56:54+00:00\">Mar 27, 2020 at 4:56am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <h2>Sew a shark mascot with designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jan/05/christopher-raeburn-sustainable-design-london-fashion-week-mens\">Christopher Raeburn</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bbcf4f6c6e2ca02f998a81612d118cdcdf46c79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bbcf4f6c6e2ca02f998a81612d118cdcdf46c79/0_0_2250_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Christopher Raeburn shark mascot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Christopher Raeburn shark mascot</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Broomfield/benbroomfield.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Designer Christopher Raeburn\u2019s team are adapting to the current situation by releasing weekly creative tasks via their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Raeburn_Design\">#RaeburnAtHome</a> initiative.</p> <p>\u201cThis project is to make one of our shark mascots. We have always featured animals in our collections, initially as a way to highlight and support endangered species through our WWF UK partner. The Shark is one of our most popular animals; we keep it in our collections each season, but it always evolves.</p> <p>\u201cYou need no more than one square metre of fabric \u2013 even less if you are conscious of pattern placement for waste reduction. Using a variety of smaller cuts of fabric is encouraged though as this adds pops of colour and texture to the final shark.</p> <p>\u201cNot only is reusing and repurposing old fabric a more interesting way of working, but extending the lifetime of garments is instrumental in reducing planetary impact. When people are spending more time at home than ever before, now is the chance to pull out those bits that we no longer use and give them new life.</p> <p>\u201cUnless you are an absolute master, it should keep you busy for about 10 hours. We only recommend a sewing machine for ease and speed \u2013 top marks for effort go to anyone tackles it by hand.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> advanced<br><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> a sewing machine, fabric, scissors, thread and paper.</p> <p><strong>How to:</strong></p> <p>For the <a href=\"https://www.raeburndesign.co.uk/explore/journal/post/id/diy-shark-mascot-raeburn-at-home\">full instructions click here</a>; you can <a href=\"https://www.raeburndesign.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Raeburn-Shark-Mascot-A4-Print.pdf\">download the shark pattern here</a>.

His first was to cut a pattern for and sew a one-piece kimono-inspired garment. Next up is making miniature sculptures of the kings and queens of England using modelling clay.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Make-Your-Own-Japanese-Clothes/dp/1568364938\">How to make Japanese clothes</a> by John Marshall is a book I have on my shelf that I thought it would be great to lose myself in during isolation.</p> <p>\u201cI love traditional Japanese clothing and now is the perfect time to study. What I love about kimonos is that they are traditionally dictated by the fabric \u2013 they are the width they are because that is how wide the looms could weave. For a fabric geek like me, that\u2019s a dream.</p> <p>\u201cA traditional kimono pattern looks like some different-length rectangles put together, but nothing is ever that simple and it takes a lot of skill to construct a traditional kimono properly. The one I made is much, much easier.</p> <p>\u201cI used three metres of fabric left over from the last collection, but you could make it with two metres if it\u2019s 150cm wide, or you can easily add seams to the patterns or patchwork fabrics together. Repurposing old curtains or a bed sheet would be perfect.</p> <p>\u201cIt took me around four hours to complete \u2013 there are only three seams and three hems. I tried to make it as simple as possible.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> advanced<br><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> a sewing machine, two to three metres of fabric, thread, scissors, paper and dressmaking pins.</p> <p><strong>How to:</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe pattern I made is available to <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u477xf47t0mj0im/AAAZK_dmuqJij-P-Aw93H3I5a/ONE%20PIECE%20ROBE?dl=0&amp;subfolder_nav_tracking=1\">download for free here</a>.

This so-called shrinky necklace is something we did as kids. We first made one as Tatty Devine in 2001. It was very early days, when we made jewellery from whatever we could get our hands on. We enjoyed <em>having</em> to eat crisps.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Difficulty level:</strong> beginner<br><strong>Equipment needed:</strong> old crisp packets (not foiled or metallic, such as Chipsticks or many supermarket own brands); a chain necklace (whether new or something you already own); greaseproof paper, a baking tray, a damp tea towel (for safety reasons), an old tea towel, a hole punch, a regular <a href=\"https://www.the-beadshop.co.uk/beads-and-beading-supplies-c491/jewellery-findings-c7/jump-rings-c12/silver-plated-jump-rings-c14\">jump ring</a> and two pairs of flat-nose pliers.</p> <p><strong>How to:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Set your grill to medium.</p></li> <li><p>While the grill is warming, fold the greaseproof paper to make it into rough envelope shapes and pop your empty food packets inside \u2013 one wrapper per envelope.</p></li> <li><p>Put the envelopes on a baking tray under the grill. The packet will start to shrink and curl up. You don\u2019t want them to burn or blister so watch closely.</p></li> <li><p>As soon as they are shrunken enough, remove the baking tray, quickly place a folded tea towel on top of the envelope and slam your hand down to flatten your \u201cshrinky\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>Use a hole punch to make a hole somewhere on the packet.</p></li> <li><p>Open a <a href=\"https://beadclublounge.com/what-are-jump-rings/\">regular jump ring</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOkBbCx7MP4\">with the pliers</a> and thread the packet on to the jump ring, then put the jump ring on to the necklace and close it.</p></li> </ul> <p>You can stop with one pendant or layer up for a charm effect.</p> <h2>Knit a scarf with dancer Meshach Henry</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5f646d1bea95fa174c71e2d72eb22a4c6ae90ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5f646d1bea95fa174c71e2d72eb22a4c6ae90ed/0_0_828_1327/624.jpg\" alt=\"Novice knitter Meshach Henry\" width=\"624\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Novice knitter Meshach Henry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Grimshaw/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite having no previous knitting experience, dancer Meshach Henry has made three scarves in as many days, documented on Instagram by his partner, the Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw.</p> <p>\u201cI always said I would learn a new skill like plumbing or plastering if I ever had a lot of time on my hands. But they aren\u2019t ideal skills to practice in this current situation. So, having seen knitting supplies in a craftshop window recently, I thought, \u2018Here\u2019s my new hobby.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI <a href=\"ttps://www.theknittingnetwork.co.uk/hayfield-bonus-super-chunky-berry-652?gclid=CjwKCAjwvOHzBRBoEiwA48i6Agw3S5RtfL5d5H6CnxtG3WWSPo5wA7_GTJeV9sZt29WqomOAWQAimBoCQwcQAvD_BwE\">purchased a thick wool</a> because it looked easier to use and less fiddly. I bought 10mm knitting needles, which I thought were an average size but later found out are strangely big \u2013 but I\u2019m really happy with the chunky effect they produce.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I like about knitting is that you can see your physical product. As a dancer, I rarely get to see my own work, so to be able to see and hold this tangible thing is a whole new world for me.</p> <p>\u201cMy intention is to move on to knitting jumpers.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Spain reports record single-day death toll</h2> <p>Spain has recorded a record new single-day coronavirus death toll after 849 people died from the virus between Monday and Tuesday. The country\u2019s total number of cases now stands at 94,417 \u2013 up from 85,195 on Monday \u2013 and its death toll at 8,189.</p> <h2>Russia records biggest daily increase for seventh day running</h2> <p>The number of coronavirus cases in Russia jumped to 2,337 on Tuesday, an increase of 500, as the country recorded its biggest daily rise for the seventh day in a row. In Russia, 18 people who contracted the coronavirus have died, while 121 people have recovered.</p> <h2>Italy extends lockdown until Easter</h2> <p>Italy has extended its lockdown until Easter. The number of new coronavirus infections reported on Monday was 1,648, as opposed to 3,815 the previous day. The death toll, however, rose again, with 812 deaths reported, compared with 756 the day before.</p> <h2>Death toll in England and Wales higher than previously reported</h2> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/england-and-wales-coronavirus-death-toll-40-higher-than-previously-stated\">additional 40 previously unreported coronavirus deaths occurred in England and Wales</a> earlier this month, according to new official backdated figures. The figures, which are based on death certificates, show there were 210 deaths where Covid-19 was listed as a cause by 20 March, 40 more than the 170 announced by the NHS at that stage.</p> <p>The figure is higher because it includes deaths outside hospitals, including those in homes and care homes, and includes patients who had not tested positive for the virus but were suspected of having the disease.</p> <h2>Ireland: confirmed cases of coronavirus halve</h2> <p>Ireland\u2019s daily growth rate in confirmed cases of coronavirus has halved. Ireland on Monday confirmed 295 new cases, the second highest daily number, bringing the total to 2,910. It recorded eight deaths, bringing the death toll to 54. Northern Ireland has 533 confirmed cases and 22 deaths.</p> <h2>WHO: epidemic \u2018far from over\u2019 in the Asia-Pacific region</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/us-deaths-pass-3000-as-world-bank-warns-covid-19-will-drive-east-asia-into-poverty\">coronavirus epidemic is \u201cfar from over\u201d in the Asia-Pacific region</a>, and current measures to curb the spread of the virus are buying time for countries to prepare for large-scale community transmissions, a WHO official said.</p> <h2>Coronavirus study reveals increased risks from middle age</h2> <p>The first comprehensive study of Covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations in mainland China has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/new-coronavirus-study-reveals-increased-risks-from-middle-age\">revealed in stark detail the increase in risk for coronavirus patients </a>once they reach middle age.</p> <h2>US coronavirus deaths pass 3,000</h2> <p>Figures from Johns Hopkins University show the toll from coronavirus in the US now exceeds that from the September 11 terrorist attacks. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, at 164,539 is double those in China.</p> <h2>World Bank warns of \u2018unprecedented global shock\u2019</h2> <p>China\u2019s growth could come to a standstill while 11 million more people in East Asia could be driven into poverty.</p>",
  "<p>Jack Grealish probably was not the only 24-year-old to ignore the government lockdown last weekend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/30/jack-grealish-apologises-for-stupidly-ignoring-lockdown-to-visit-friend-aston-villa\" title=\"\">in order to go socialising</a>, but he was the only one to do so almost immediately after lecturing hundreds of thousands of followers on social media about the importance of staying at home to keep people safe. His demonstration of a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do attitude has led many people to rail that he is unfit to continue captaining Aston Villa, though others might suggest it marks him out as a future prime minister.</p> <p>Grealish did a hypocritical and dangerous thing and his apology was not altogether satisfying, since his account of \u201cwhat happened at the weekend\u201d did not include any explanation as to how his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/29/police-investigate-after-jack-grealish-pictured-at-traffic-incident\" title=\"\">Range Rover came to collide</a> with several motionless vehicles. It would have been useful to hear his version of events given so many other people are offering theirs, real or imagined. It will be interesting to see what West Midlands police make of the matter. Maybe they will confirm reports that the player faces no charges. So far they have declined to do so.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/30/jack-grealish-apologises-for-stupidly-ignoring-lockdown-to-visit-friend-aston-villa\">Jack Grealish apologises for 'stupidly' ignoring lockdown to visit friend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What Aston Villa make of it is that they are \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d and believe Grealish deserves a fine for going against the government\u2019s and his own advice. There would, it is true, be a fair case for the club taking a sterner view and removing the captaincy from him, at least until he earns it back through improved behaviour. We are, after all, told that a potential consequence of gathering unnecessarily these days is that people will die. Having a man who has flouted the lockdown as the club\u2019s figurehead leaves Villa open to accusations that they, too, are not taking things as seriously as they should.</p> <p>But strange times put people, even rich young footballers, under all kinds of stress. And the deed is done. Villa, knowing Grealish well, have apparently judged his regret to be sincere, his determination to atone real, his latest social media utterance more trustworthy than his previous one. There is nothing wrong with being represented by someone who has made a mistake and resolved to mend their ways. Especially, of course, if that is the interpretation that suits club and player best. Grealish better prove he has grown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JackGrealish/status/1244658828932767744\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/XxoEt4yZNj\">pic.twitter.com/XxoEt4yZNj</a></p>&mdash; Jack Grealish (@JackGrealish) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackGrealish/status/1244658828932767744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>To an extent, Villa\u2019s reputation depends on him doing so. Certainly, his own reputation does. Leaving aside for a moment the damage he would risk doing to others by relapsing into thoughtlessness, it would be a real shame if the way Grealish led his life off the pitch were to prevent him from reaching the footballing heights of which his talent puts him within reach.</p> <p>But we must be wary, too, of extrapolating too much from one outbreak of recklessness in an exceptional time, added to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/22/aston-villa-internal-investigation-jack-grealish-conduct-hotel-party\" title=\"\">a couple of drinking sprees several years ago</a>. We do not know enough about Grealish to declare him wayward and incorrigible. We can be sure, though, that any clubs thinking of splashing tens of millions to lure him from Villa will be doing their utmost to establish how Grealish usually spends his free time. Does he have, or can he develop, the temperament to make any adjustments needed to his recreational pursuits?</p> <p>What we can say for sure is that on the pitch Grealish has pretty much always been exceptionally mature. There he is in his natural environment and he thrives. That much has been obvious since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/19/aston-villa-liverpool-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">2015 FA Cup semi-final</a> when, as an inexperienced 19-year-old, he sauntered out in front of 85,000 onlookers at Wembley and made Liverpool appear nervous and meek in a match that was supposed to be all about Steven Gerrard. A year ago Dean Smith decided the player would get even better if entrusted with the captain\u2019s armband.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6df045a480c7b9cecfb831a41ff2c88e0540f283\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6df045a480c7b9cecfb831a41ff2c88e0540f283/0_108_4980_3075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Grealish scores for Aston Villa against Brighton in October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"617\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Grealish scores for Aston Villa against Brighton in October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t be a burden to him and that he\u2019d relish it,\u201d Smith said last March. \u201cHe\u2019s a really good professional and I felt if I didn\u2019t give it to him that would be overlooking his leadership qualities.\u201d Until last weekend Smith could claim total vindication thanks to Grealish\u2019s performance in matches and in training, where the captain has led by example.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSometimes I have to drag him off the training pitch,\u201d Smith said in September. \u201cJack\u2019s a football person.

He\u2019ll go back home and he\u2019ll be watching football as well. He\u2019s a football nut.\u201d</p> <p>Last weekend, however, with no football to watch and little prospect of playing it again any time soon, Grealish apparently succumbed to boredom and made a goofy decision. He has to stop doing that, for everyone\u2019s sake.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/costa-rica\">Costa Rica</a>\u2019s president has pledged to protect the rights of indigenous defenders following a spate of violence against native communities in his country.</p> <p>Last month, an activist, Yehry Rivera, from the Br\u00f6r\u00e1n indigenous community in T\u00e9rraba, Puntarenas province, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/25/costa-rican-indigenous-land-activist-killed-by-armed-mob\">was shot and killed</a> after he was attacked by an armed mob while trying to reclaim ancestral land. The murder happened just two weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/17/costa-rica-indigenous-leader-shot-land-rights\">an indigenous leader of the Bribri indigenous</a> people in nearby Salitre was shot in a surge of unpunished violence against native communities in Costa Rica.</p> <p>Conflicts over land rights in Central America have driven a wave of violence and murders against indigenous activists in the region. In Costa Rica, activists have warned that state inaction over the violence is a question of political will.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d25b0baa0d20a193c007666ba9b494b0f2d0f51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d25b0baa0d20a193c007666ba9b494b0f2d0f51/0_41_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Costa Rica\u2019s President Carlos Alvarado\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Costa Rica\u2019s president, Carlos Alvarado, has set up a fund to compensate people who have lost their land.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Carlos Ulate/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an interview with the Guardian, the Costa Rican president, Carlos Alvarado, said he was committed to protecting indigenous land rights while making sure non-indigenous people living in protected areas were compensated.</p> <p>\u201cI believe one of the problems has to do a lot with the enforcement of those rights. In 1978, many lands were declared indigenous territories. But from that time until today, the state of Costa Rica has not had the capacity \u2013 mainly economic \u2013 to protect the land rights of the people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere were people that were there before that declaration that have rights also. But after 1978, many people had entered the lands and, in some cases, bought that land without it being possible. Today, the situation we need to fix is that we need to preserve the rights we\u2019ve already recognised and at the same time provide solutions for many of the people that for many years have lived in the lands.\u201d</p> <p>Under the 1977 Indigenous Act in Costa Rica, 24 territories are protected for people with historical ties to the area. Despite legal recognition, these land rights have never been formally implemented, causing the Br\u00f6r\u00e1n and Bribri people to retake possession of their ancestral land.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed its concern about the situation in the Buenos Aires area of Puntarenas province, the centre of the violence, a year to the day after <a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/law-policy/press-release/2019/press-release-indigenous-human-right-leader-costa-rica-assassinated\">the murder of </a><a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/law-policy/press-release/2019/press-release-indigenous-human-right-leader-costa-rica-assassinated\">Sergio Rojas</a>, a Bribri land and human rights defender.</p> <p>\u201cWe recently started the first fund for buying land and for compensation,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cWe are going to be presenting a bill in the national assembly as well to provide a solution both to recover the lands of the indigenous but, at the same time, have an integral solutions for the people that are Costa Ricans that need a livelihood solution. These are quite complex solutions but we are addressing it and we are following all the rights, not only on the rights of Costa Rica and international conventions, but also the commission on human rights in the region.\u201d</p> <p>But Vanessa Jim\u00e9nez, a lawyer for <a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/en\">Forest Peoples Programme</a> who works with indigenous defenders in Costa Rica, questioned the president\u2019s framing of the situation.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an issue of political will, not economics. In Salitre alone [where Rojas was murdered last year], eight eviction orders have been active now for between five and seven years, but the government has delayed executing them \u2013 even before the recipients decided to involve the courts with appeals,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd once the evictions are appealed, the executive washes their hands of responsibility, leaving the indigenous peoples at the mercy of hostile illegal occupants and numerous, prolonged judicial cases. The state is wholly responsible for what they call a conflict between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples.\u201d</p>",

Valuable quantities of fibre have also been lost from major high street retailers such as McDonald\u2019s, Primark, John Lewis, Argos and B&amp;Q after non-essential businesses were told to close.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65a9450f-4bec-4555-bdb0-c829a2782b42\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What do the restrictions involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible</li>\n     <li>One form of exercise a day \u2013 for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2013 alone or with members of your household</li>\n     <li>Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person</li>\n     <li>Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

Food and medical supplies all move by cardboard box and if we can\u2019t make cardboard boxes, everything stops. If councils stop collecting recycling, and many are, all this fibre is burnt or goes to landfill and we will be short.\u201d</p> \n<p>The body represents more than 100 organisations from the collection and processing sector, ranging from independent merchants, brokers, waste management companies and mills. It is the largest network of independent waste and recycling operators in the UK, with a combined annual turnover in excess of \u00a32bn.</p> \n<p>Fibre recycling is a global market and materials flow across Europe and the world, but the lockdown means physical barriers are increasingly springing up to prevent this distribution. In Germany \u2013 the biggest European player \u2013 significant volumes of fibre come from Poland, but the Poland-Germany border is now shut. This has meant Germany is now seeking material from France and the UK.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Local Government Association said: \u201cCouncils are leading local efforts to support communities through the coronavirus crisis. As councils prioritise protecting the vulnerable, there will be inevitable disruption to other important services, such as bin collections and street cleaning.</p> \n<p>\u201cSome councils are having to change their waste and recycling services as coronavirus impacts on their collection staff. They will continue to work hard to keep waste and recycling services working as effectively as possible.\u201d</p> \n<p>In some parts of the UK there has been a surge in \u201cbackyard burning\u201d \u2013 which is illegal \u2013 following the closure of recycling centres and refuse tips because of the virus.</p> \n<p>Fire crews in Wigan, for example, were recently called to at least 12 fires involving household waste following the closure of local recycling centres.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Unite, the UK and Ireland\u2019s largest union, is warning that some refuse contractors and local councils across the UK were failing to ensure that refuse workers are physically distancing and are provided with other safety measures to prevent coronavirus.</p> \n<p>It has identified numerous reports of workers being expected to travel with three or four other workers in the cab of refuse wagons in clear contravention of physical distancing rules. It also reported complaints of a lack of gloves and hand sanitiser, failure to deep clean wagons and other issues.</p> \n<p>Unite national officer for local authorities Jim Kennedy said: \u201cUnite members recognise they are essential workers and want to deliver this key service, but they are becoming increasingly frightened that they, and by implication their families, are being exposed to unnecessary and needless risks, due to the flagrant disregard of contractors and councils of the rules.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>As the world grapples with the human and economic devastation being wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, not even the relationship between the United States and China is being spared.

But we are where we are, and China, the United States, and the rest of the world must focus on fighting the pandemic.</p> <p>Unfortunately, neither the US nor CCP leadership seems willing to resist throwing mud at one another. Donald Trump, the House minority leader, Kevin <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/cdc-chief-spurns-term-chinese-coronavirus-used-gop-lawmakers-n1156656\">McCarthy</a>, and other elected officials have called Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and one White House official reportedly called it the \u201cKung Flu\u201d. The Republican senator Tom Cotton hinted (without evidence) that the virus could be a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/media/coronavirus-tom-cotton-china.html\">bioweapon</a> created by the CCP.</p> <p>In China, a spokesman for the PRC ministry of foreign affairs lied in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1238111898828066823\">suggesting</a> that the US military could be to blame for the virus. Chinese government officials have echoed that sentiment while the CCP\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/conspiracy-theorists-blame-the-us-for-coronavirus-china-is-happy-to-encourage-them/2020/03/05/50875458-5dc8-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_29&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_29\">propaganda</a> machine is busy promoting these conspiracy theories.</p> <p>This blame game is undermining diplomacy between the countries. Instead of calling his counterpart to coordinate responses to the global pandemic, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/secretary-pompeos-call-with-peoples-republic-of-china-politburo-member-yang-jiechi/\">called</a> China\u2019s senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, instead to object to \u201cPRC efforts to shift blame for Covid-19 to the United States\u201d. And the Trump administration has reportedly attempted to stop the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/u-s-insisting-u-n-call-out-chinese-origins-coronavirus-n1169111\">UN</a> security council and the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/g7-coronavirus-statement/index.html\">G7</a> from taking action against the pandemic unless the groups singled out China for blame.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to get the facts right. The virus started in China. In the early <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/timeline-the-early-days-of-chinas-coronavirus-outbreak-and-cover-up-ee65211a-afb6-4641-97b8-353718a5faab.html\">days</a>, doctors tried to sound the alarm, but were not allowed to do their jobs. As the virus spread, the CCP censored many of those attempting to raise alarm bells. The CCP\u2019s botched initial response to the virus probably made this pandemic far <a href=\"https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2020/03/covid-19-china.page\">worse</a>.</p> <p>But the priority for every nation right now must be the pandemic, and tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies cannot get in the way. Toning down aspects of the US-China competition temporarily in no way means that the United States should ignore the CCP\u2019s dangerous initial response to the virus, nor does it mean that the United States should stop blunting dangerous Chinese behavior elsewhere. What it means is taking concrete steps to ensure that the competition does not inhibit the fight against the pandemic.</p> <p>First, the United States must stop scapegoating China. Leaders need to stop referring to Covid-19 as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, trying to blame China for the outbreak and feeding conspiracy theories about China launching the disease on purpose. Halting this kind of rhetoric can help reduce some of the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-03-18/trump-dubs-covid-19-chinese-virus-despite-hate-crime-risks\">discrimination</a> against Asian Americans that has been sparked by racist comments surrounding the virus. And while China will continue trying to spin this crisis to its advantage to win headlines, at the very least the United States can play the role of responsible leader rather than infantile finger-pointer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We must ensure all the doors to cooperation on the pandemic are open right now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Second, the United States must ensure that no policy that is intended to blunt nefarious Chinese behavior will negatively affect the fight against the pandemic. In order to address genuine concerns, the United States has increasingly scrutinized Chinese <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/us/politics/china-foreign-investment-cfius.html\">investment</a> and private sector cooperation in <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/07/17/741239298/as-scrutiny-of-china-grows-some-u-s-schools-drop-a-language-program\">education</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/scrutiny-of-chinese-american-scientists-raises-fears-of-ethnic-profiling/2019/07/19/ffc5b292-a276-11e9-b8c8-75dae2607e60_story.html\">scientific</a> collaborations and the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/12/11/18134440/huawei-executive-order-entity-list-china-trump\">technology</a> sector. Sometimes, those actions can have unintended consequences: for instance, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-trump-administration-drove-him-back-to-china-where-he-invented-a-fast-coronavirus-test?utm_source=pardot&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=majorinvestigations\">ProPublica</a> reported that one scientist \u2013 who had lived in the United States for decades and left the country after being investigated for ties to China \u2013 is now developing a rapid coronavirus test in China. Whether it\u2019s scientists sharing research to find a vaccine or companies partnering to produce necessary equipment, we must ensure all the doors to cooperation on the pandemic are open right now. The Trump administration\u2019s <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-lifts-tariffs-on-chinese-medical-supplies-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-2020-3-1028973176\">move</a> to lift tariffs on Chinese medical products like masks and sanitization products is a good step.</p> <p>Third, the US and Chinese governments must work together to stem the tide of the pandemic. As tensions have risen in recent years there are fewer and fewer areas on which the two countries have pursued robust cooperation. But combating the pandemic is exactly the kind of challenge that requires the two nations to come together, from sharing lessons learned in their respective responses to searching for medical treatments to working together in multilateral organizations like the World Health Organization and the G20. And it means being open to support from one another: while China initially <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/health/cdc-coronavirus-china.html\">refused</a> US help, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbendery/status/1242798450967797765\">reports</a> now suggest the United States is declining China\u2019s offers of sending personal protective equipment.</p> <p>Fourth, don\u2019t worry for the moment about China\u2019s attempts to win public relations victories by sending aid to US allies. The United States must focus on actually helping US allies \u2013 such as coordinating travel restrictions to avoid the disaster when the Europe travel ban was announced \u2013 and being supportive of allies getting desperately needed help from anywhere it can, whether the United States, China or anyone else. Even if the United States has relatively little to offer and China is sending small amounts of aid as a public relations move, responding by trying to remind everyone that China is the cause of the outbreak will only make America look petty (and some countries are already finding out on their own that part of China\u2019s aid is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52092395\">faulty</a>).</p> <p>If the United States and China are successful in fighting this pandemic \u2013 and doing so together \u2013 perhaps, at the end of all of this, the two countries just might end up building bridges that could be useful in tempering the more dangerous aspects of their competition.</p>",

Biceps curls and shoulder presses are good for toning. If you don\u2019t have weights, improvise with a good old can of baked beans.</p> <p>There are so many things you can do in a plank. Mountain climbers (where you drive your knees into your chest in a plank position) or spider-mans (where you raise your right knee to your right elbow in a plank, then switch sides) are fantastic.</p> <p>During this pandemic, I\u2019m going to be making sure that I have a daily routine. Without it, you lose purpose. Wake up at a reasonable hour, enjoy being able to spend more time with your family \u2013 and try to fit in 20 minutes of exercise every day. It will make you feel happier.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.creativityinsport.com/\">Lizzie Webb</a>, former TV-am presenter and the creator of Joggy Bear</h2> <p>One positive thing to come out of the coronavirus crisis is that people often have more time to focus on themselves and their bodies. But be sensible: if you aren\u2019t a regular exerciser, don\u2019t suddenly go mad on a programme. Ease in gently. There\u2019s no rush. Every day, increase the number of repetitions or exercise for a little longer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"642b664b6f998be7cde32c45a70de5b34dbb5503\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/642b664b6f998be7cde32c45a70de5b34dbb5503/0_339_3744_5209/719.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzie Webb \u2026 \u2018The best bit of kit in your house is a chair.\u2019\" width=\"719\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzie Webb \u2026 \u2018The best bit of kit in your house is a chair.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilka &amp; Franz/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019d recommend exercising with the children \u2013 they\u2019re going to be home with you, so why not? I\u2019m a big fan of getting them to learn their times tables \u2013 but not sitting down at a desk. Instead, sit or stand the children opposite each other and have them throw a ball to one another while doing their times tables. The person who gets the highest is the winner.</p> <p>The best bit of kit in your house is always a chair. Hold on to the back of it at waist height, and use it as you would a ballet barre. Put your feet at hip-width apart and do squats. If you\u2019re strong enough, hold the \u201cbarre\u201d with one hand while squatting.</p> <p>If you\u2019re not very mobile, there are lots of things you can do in a chair. Make sure you\u2019re sitting with a straight back. Hug each knee to your chest, then put it down. You can even grab some bags of sugar or bottles of water to use as light weights: sit on the edge of the chair and do biceps curls.</p> <p>On TV-am, I would always make a point of saying: \u201cClear your space.\u201d You don\u2019t want to hurt yourself. I remember one viewer writing in to tell me that she was doing my exercises in a caravan. And, obviously, wear comfortable clothes. You want to have freedom of movement.</p> <h2>Shona Vertue, yoga teacher, YouTuber and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shona_vertue/?hl=en\">fitness influencer</a></h2> <p>Coronavirus has had an impact on my motivation to train \u2013 even I am having to use my own videos to motivate myself. I have been running live workouts on my YouTube channel, and yesterday I had 120 followers waiting to work out with me. I sat on the mat and told them the truth: I feel heavy, but I know that I\u2019m going to feel better after we exercise together.

The resistance is beneficial for bone density and helps to reduce the effects of muscle loss, which is important as many of us are likely to be sedentary for long periods of time under lockdown.</p> <p>At the end of the day, we\u2019re going through a global pandemic. No one gives a toss about abs. Aesthetics are out of the window. What you should think is: OK, movement is going to support my brain function, it\u2019s going to help me feel better and release endorphins.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/xandvt?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Xand van Tulleken</a>, doctor and broadcaster</strong></h2> <p>Normally, you would exercise for long-term health. This is different. Now we are training to not get ill. The stronger and fitter you are, the more likely you will be to fight coronavirus off, and your recovery time will be shorter. You are less likely to end up in an intensive care unit bed, and if you do end up in one, more likely to get out of it sooner \u2013 freeing it up for someone else. So try to do something.</p> <p>There\u2019s another good reason to exercise, which is that humans are inherently social animals. We depend on other people for our happiness, our wellbeing, advice and reassurance. Right now, we\u2019re cut off from other people. So exercise is crucial to maintaining mental health. </p> <p>If you can, leave the house regularly and go for walks, but stay away from other people. Download a step counter on to your phone and aim for 10,000 steps a day. Or do a basic circuit at home. My only word of caution would be that your home is not a gym. Be careful. You don\u2019t want to get injured and put the NHS under more strain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5a24978890eff58fb717e1551609c433e313c61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5a24978890eff58fb717e1551609c433e313c61/743_504_2054_1232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xand and Chris van Tulleken \u2026 \u2018You don\u2019t want to get injured.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xand and Chris van Tulleken \u2026 \u2018You don\u2019t want to get injured.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoctorChrisVT?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Chris van Tulleken</a>, doctor and broadcaster</h2> <p>There\u2019s a thing in geriatric medicine called pyjama paralysis.

So getting dressed in the morning is a good start.</p> <p>Walk up and down your stairs five times. If you have a garden, buy a skipping rope online and go outside and skip. Find a fitness YouTuber you like the look of, and copy their videos. It\u2019s so easy to get caught up in the technical aspects of exercise: how much should I be doing and what should my heart rate be? Do I need the advice of a doctor? But it\u2019s not complicated \u2013 just aim to get out of breath for a few minutes every day. That\u2019s it.</p> <p>If you can, do a simple circuit of press-ups, sit-ups and squats.

  "<p>Last Thursday, the leaders of the European Union <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/eu-leaders-clash-over-economic-response-to-coronavirus-crisis\">convened a video conference</a> to deliberate the escalating Covid-19 crisis. On the agenda was a simple proposal co-signed by <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/nine-eu-countries-say-its-time-for-corona-bonds-as-virus-deaths-rise.html\">nine different eurozone</a> governments: the \u201ccoronabond\u201d, a new type of public debt instrument backed by all the members of the currency union as they come together to combat the virus.</p> <p>After a long decade of crisis fighting in the eurozone \u2013 pitting north against south, creditor against borrower \u2013 the proposal marked a rare display of unity, and the meeting was a perfect opportunity to ratify it. Issued collectively, the \u201ccoronabond\u201d would drive down the borrowing costs of some of Europe\u2019s most heavily affected countries, staving off another sovereign debt crisis and freeing up much-needed resources to invest in public health and economic recovery. \u201cWe are all facing a symmetric external shock,\u201d the proposal read, \u201cand we are collectively accountable for an effective and united European response.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As long as the pandemic rages in Europe, even the supposedly frugal burghers of Amsterdam will suffer the consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alas, the request for solidarity was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/19/tensions-mount-between-eu-members-ahead-of-budget-talks\">swiftly rejected</a>. At the video conference, the eurobond motion came up against the eurozone\u2019s \u201cfrugal four\u201d \u2013 Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland \u2013 who argued that the issuance of a common debt instrument would punish the countries that had saved for such a rainy day, and encourage further fiscal mismanagement by those who did not. Solidarity, they claimed, just created moral hazard.</p> <p>In the course of this standoff, it was the Netherlands that positioned itself as the stony face of the frugal four. For a small and trade-dependent country that has long portrayed itself as Europe\u2019s liberal beacon \u2013 open, progressive and internationally oriented \u2013 it was a remarkably short-sighted position to take. Without a collective mobilisation of fiscal resources, countries such as Italy and Spain will be powerless to prevent further contagion, of both the medical and economic kind. And as long as the pandemic continues to rage elsewhere in Europe, even the supposedly frugal burghers of Amsterdam will suffer the consequences.</p> <p>Yet the Dutch government has held firm. Speaking after the meeting, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MehreenKhn/status/1243295594258587649\">declared</a> that he could not foresee \u201cany circumstances in which the Netherlands will accept eurobonds\u201d. Adding insult to injury, the finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, called on Brussels to investigate why some eurozone member states had failed to get their houses in order ahead of the pandemic \u2013 comments that the Portuguese prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, later described as \u201crepugnant\u201d and \u201csenseless\u201d.</p> <p>The spat has reopened painful old wounds. In the early stages of the eurozone crisis, the Dutch were among the most vocal opponents of the initial Greek \u201cbailout\u201d, and demanded draconian austerity measures in return for the emergency loans. The former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem gained widespread notoriety for his penny-pinching in the Greek debt negotiations, at one point appearing to suggest that his southern European neighbours had wasted their money on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5beb2902-0efa-11e7-b030-768954394623\">booze and women</a>\u201d. </p> <p>But Europe\u2019s governments have run out of patience with such fiscal moralism. Over the weekend, <a href=\"https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/generale/2020/03/27/news/eurobond_si_allarga_il_fronte_in_quattordici_contro_la_merkel-252507712/?ref=RHPPBT-BH-I252410466-C12-P2-S1.8-T1\">reports suggested</a> that Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Cyprus and Slovakia may add their names to the original eurobond proposal. Among these 14 governments, there is broad agreement that this is not the time for petty lectures on fiscal book-keeping, it is a time to think big and confront the continent\u2019s greatest collective challenge since the second world war as a united front. As Costa drily <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/netherlands-try-to-calm-storm-over-repugnant-finance-ministers-comments/\">observed</a>: \u201cNo one has any more time to hear Dutch finance ministers as we heard in 2008, 2009, 2010 and so forth.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/29/the-coronavirus-crisis-has-brought-the-eus-failings-into-sharp-relief\">The coronavirus crisis has brought the EU's failings into sharp relief | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Beside its untimely nature, the Dutch government\u2019s position is also exceedingly hypocritical. The Netherlands has long been known as one of the world\u2019s most infamous tax havens, siphoning off hundreds of billions of euros in corporate profits and international financial flows and keeping other governments from taxing them properly. To depict the Netherlands as a pillar of fiscal rectitude is to deny the myriad ways in which the very architecture of the Dutch tax system actively serves to undermine the fiscal capacity of its European and international partners.</p> <p>Ultimately, however, the best argument against the Dutch position is that it is self-defeating. By rejecting the call for \u201ccoronabonds\u201d, the Netherlands and its partners in the frugal four have undermined the ability of the wider eurozone to fight the pandemic as a whole \u2013 threatening the health and wellbeing of each of its members in turn.</p> <p>Solidarity is not charity. It is the recognition that the struggle of one is the struggle of all. In a pandemic like Covid-19, that logic is global. But it becomes all the more urgent in the context of a currency union as thoroughly integrated as the eurozone. If the frugal four continue to obstruct a common fiscal response to this crisis, the remaining eurozone countries will be right to ask if they are not better off going their own way.</p> <p>As Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez, kindly reminded Hoekstra following his much-maligned intervention last week: \u201cWe are in this EU boat together. We hit an unexpected iceberg. We all share the same risk.

  "<p>Advertising giant WPP has unveiled a \u00a32bn savings plan to shore up its balance sheet in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>WPP is the world\u2019s largest advertising company by revenue, with more than 107,000 staff around the world. It said it was implementing the measures after revenues in China slumped by 23% in the first two months this year. China, the world\u2019s second largest advertising market after the US, accounts for 7% of WPP\u2019s \u00a310.8bn net sales.

This would provide an overall sum of around \u00a3100,000, out of a rate relief saving of near on \u00a31m, to a community fund that would support libraries, children\u2019s services and other local projects.

Councillors, many of whom had links to the area\u2019s private schools, instead suggested opening up a \u201cdialogue\u201d with the four schools. Sadly, says Lisgo, that never happened.</p> \n<p>Recently, Lisgo saw her chance to have another go, after the merger of Taunton Deane with neighbouring West Somerset to create Somerset West and Taunton, now under Liberal Democrat control.</p> \n<p>Armed with what she calls her \u201coven-ready idea\u201d, she was more optimistic. \u201cIf austerity was very much on our minds in 2017, it is even more so three years down the line,\u201d she says.

In the recent budget, the government announced a review of business rates and the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/private-schools-100m-rates-relief-at-risk-6z5mnplw2\">Independent Schools Association</a>, which promotes the charitable objectives of private schools, is now warning the sector that business rate relief may not survive beyond 2021. More broadly, there is a widespread sense across the political spectrum that the resources gap between private and state schools is unacceptably wide and reform is necessary. This makes voluntary contributions look like a moderate step rather than an extreme proposal.</p> \n<p>The Conservative-controlled <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/extra-contributions-from-the-rich-are-working-in-westminster-ls6p2hgx6\">Westminster</a> council is currently asking householders in properties worth more than \u00a310m (council tax band H) to contribute a small sum to local services, and has so far raised \u00a3900,000 through this \u201cunofficial mansion tax\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/millionaire-residents-asked-to-pay-mansion-tax-towards-council-services-a4074051.html\">Kensington and Chelsea</a> and <a href=\"https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/surrey-residents-asked-volunteer-pay-17691271\">Surrey</a> councils have implemented similar plans.</p> \n<p>Mark Lehain, a free school founder and Conservative party candidate in the last election, says Lisgo\u2019s plan is an interesting idea but that private schools would need to have \u201ccontrol over how the funds were used to make sure they were for educational purposes\u201d.</p> \n<p>Many in Labour local government dislike the voluntary angle. Steven Longden, a Trafford councillor and co-founder of the campaign Abolish Eton, thinks going down this route merely \u201cgives private schools good PR. Do we really want the voluntary crumbs off their table? No, I want legislation to remove their privileges and tax exemptions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Succeed or fail, the proposal has created a useful mobilising tool. Historically, the political conversation around the private-state divide has tended to be about national inequalities: all those privately educated judges and journalists and old Etonian prime ministers.</p> \n<p>But Lisgo\u2019s initiative brings the issue back down to local earth, shining a spotlight on the vastly discrepant provision often found within a single area. \u201cA lot of people locally have said to me, \u2018I didn\u2019t realise that these schools were charities \u2013 and you mean that they don\u2019t pay business rates like everyone else?\u201d\u2019</p> \n<p> Lisgo remains upbeat. \u201cI have had so many conversations around the proposal. People think it is a jolly good idea. If we had genuinely begun to initiate that dialogue between our schools and the council, things might look different. I still struggle to understand why we can\u2019t make use of those minibuses parked on the other side of the fence.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The call came as she sat in her hotel room. \u201cThey gave us 10 minutes to pack up and leave,\u201d Dr Safaa Kumari was told down a crackling phone line. Armed fighters had just seized her house in Aleppo and her family were on the run.</p> <p>Kumari was in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, preparing to present a conference. She immediately began organising a sprint back to Syria. Hidden in her sister\u2019s house was a small but very valuable bundle that she was prepared to risk her life to recover.</p> <p>Kumari is a plant virologist. Her work focuses on a quiet yet devastating development crisis. Climate-fuelled virus epidemics <a href=\"https://grdc.com.au/resources-and-publications/groundcover/ground-cover-issue-61/research-the-key-to-a-healthy-pulse\">affecting </a><a href=\"https://grdc.com.au/resources-and-publications/groundcover/ground-cover-issue-61/research-the-key-to-a-healthy-pulse\">fava beans, lentils and chickpeas</a> are spreading from Syria to Ethiopia, gradually destroying the livelihoods of low-income populations. Known as \u201cpoor man\u2019s meat\u201d, these pulses are vital for both income generation and food security in many parts of the world.</p> <p>Finding a cure was urgent, Kumari explains. Hopeless farmers were seeing increasing levels of infected crops turning yellow and black. The cause? \u201cClimate change provides aphids with the right temperatures to breed exponentially and spread the epidemics,\u201d she says.</p> <p>For 10 years, Kumari worked to find a solution. Finally, she discovered a bean variety naturally resistant to one of the viruses: the fava bean necrotic yellow virus (FBNYV). \u201cWhen I found those resistant seeds, I felt there was something important in them,\u201d says Kumari from her lab in Lebanon where she now works. Only the fighting in Syria had moved. \u201cI had left them at my sister\u2019s in central Aleppo to protect them from the fighting,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They wanted to buy our product and then sell it to the farmers, but we refused</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Safaa Kumari, plant virologist</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Determined not to let a war get in the way of her work \u201cfor the world\u2019s poor\u201d, Kumari felt it her duty to rescue the seeds in Aleppo. \u201cI was thinking: how am I going to get those seeds out of Syria?</p> <p>\u201cI had to go through Damascus, and then drive all the way to Aleppo. There was fighting and bombings everywhere.\u201d After two days\u2019 driving along dangerous roads, seeds in hand, Kumari made it to Lebanon, where she now works as a researcher at Icarda <a href=\"https://www.icarda.org/\">(International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas)</a> in the Bekaa valley, close to the Syrian border. Hassan Machlab, Icarda\u2019s country manager says: \u201cMany of the Syrian scientists we welcomed here have suffered. It is tough.\u201d</p> <p>But bringing the seeds to safety was only the beginning. Kumari needed to turn them into a sustainable solution.</p> <p>As crop production collapsed in the region, producers started to rely heavily on insecticides. \u201cMost farmers go to the field and spray it without safety material \u2013 masks and appropriate jacket,\u201d she says. \u201cSome are dying, others are getting sick or developing pregnancy issues.\u201d</p> <p>At first, the sample failed. \u201cSo we crossed them with another variety that had a better yield and obtained something that is both resistant and productive,\u201d says Kumari. \u201cWhen we release it, it will be environment-friendly and provide farmers with a good yield, more cheaply and without insecticide.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b92769cc19383c4b085845e39341dbef560535f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b92769cc19383c4b085845e39341dbef560535f/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seed samples in the laboratory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seed samples in the laboratory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adib Chowdhury/Nathana\u00ebl Chouraqui</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kumari now plans to distribute her super-seeds free to farmers.

  "<p>A failure to invest more in the nursing workforce has put the NHS on the \u201cbackfoot\u201d in combating Covid-19, according to Dame Christine Beasley, a former chief nursing officer (CNO) who now serves as a trustee at the <a href=\"https://www.btfn.org.uk/\">Burdett Trust for Nursing</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers sort of speak for themselves really, don\u2019t they?\u201d says Beasley of the endemic shortage of nurses that has left the NHS vulnerable at a time of crisis. Given that the nurses on the frontline risk becoming the patients, coronavirus presents a double whammy. This \u201cabsolutely demonstrates what we\u2019ve been saying for a long time\u201d, she says.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>I don\u2019t think you could ever say that we could get all the people we need for a pandemic, but it has put us more on the backfoot than we might have been if there\u2019d been the proper investment.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No matter if you\u2019re a cross between Mother Teresa and the Angel Gabriel, you\u2019re not going to be able to sustain day after day of 12-14 shifts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Figures show that nursing has lagged behind other NHS staff groups over the past decade, with the workforce <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2020-0037/\">growing by just 6.2%</a> between November 2010 and November 2019, compared with 20.6% for hospital doctors, for example.</p> <p>Beasley, who is also chair of the London region of Health Education England<strong>, </strong>points to the fact that the pace of growth has stepped up in recent months. </p> <p>But while figures show an <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2020-0037/\">increase in nurses of 3% between November 2018 </a><a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2020-0037/\">and November 2019</a>, the fact remains that the nursing vacancy rate for England totalled <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2020-0037/\">38,</a><a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2020-0037/\">785 in December 2019</a>. \u201cIn order to deliver modern healthcare \u2013 however you look at it \u2013 and keep people safe, you can\u2019t do it without nurses; they\u2019re pretty critical,\u201d says Beasley. \u201cThis will give us a big impetus to demonstrate that as we begin to learn from what happens with this virus and what we need to do to keep our health service fit for purpose.\u201d</p> <p>Beasley, whose tenure as the government\u2019s chief nurse between 2004 and 2012 straddled the party political switch from New Labour to the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, cites several reasons for the shortage: <a href=\"https://www.nursingtimes.net/roles/nurse-educators/exclusive-disaster-warning-follows-12-drop-in-nurse-training-places-18-09-2012/\">cuts in nurse training places</a> early on in the coalition; the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2UnW5R0\">abolition of nursing bursaries in 2016</a>, which covered university tuition fees as well as providing means-tested maintenance support; an <a href=\"https://www.nursinginpractice.com/professional/nurse-NMC-ageing-workforce\">ageing workforce</a>; and the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/24/nhs-winter-crisis-thousands-eu-staff-quit\">haemorrhaging of EU nurses</a>. She also mentions poor retention as a significant factor. Figures show that <a href=\"https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/national-retention-programme-two-years-on/\">turnover is still running at just under 12% a year</a>. \u201cAll of that meant that we were in difficulties before this pandemic came along.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing that something needed to be done about nursing numbers, Boris Johnson made an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/will-a-conservative-government-deliver-50000-more-nurses\">election pledge for 50,000 more nurses</a> by 2024-25. But the shine soon came off amid accusations of double counting when it emerged that over a third of the figure factored nurses already in the job. </p> <p>Although the government announced an <a href=\"https://www.rcn.org.uk/news-and-events/news/uk-student-grant-response-181219\">annual grant of at least \u00a35,000</a> for healthcare students, which will kick in <a href=\"https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/nhs-bursary#Funding_NHS_bursary_ENGLAND\">from September 2020</a>, critics say this doesn\u2019t go far enough since <a href=\"https://www.unison.org.uk/news/2019/11/government-must-abolish-tuition-fees-health-trainees-says-unison/\">tuition fee costs</a> will remain a barrier for many. </p> <p>That was before Covid-19 overtook events and it was all hands on deck. To help cope with the crisis, final-year nursing students in England have been asked to join the ranks, and a call-out for experienced hands has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/ex-nhs-staff-rejoin-workforce-coronavirus-outbreak\">5,605 former nurses and midwives</a> come back. It\u2019s a sensible move and one that Beasley very much welcomes, but she doubts that the former nurses coming to help with the pandemic intend to return permanently.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/im-very-nervous-student-nurses-on-the-frontline-against-covid-19\">'I'm very nervous': student nurses on the frontline against Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s down to the government to invest better financial support for nursing students and a more conducive environment for staff already in the workplace, says Beasley.

She also makes the case for the need for nursing practice to change so that we can \u201cmake the most of the nurses that we have\u201d. This means allowing nurses to work to the top of their proficiency, supported by other colleagues such as nursing associates and healthcare assistants, and expecting more patients to manage their own health, including using basic technology. \u201cIt\u2019s happening in parts of the health service, but we need to push that much more.\u201d</p> <p>Beasley completed her own nurse training as far back as 1965, yet her interest in nursing shows no sign of waning. Since retiring as chief nursing officer, she has held a number of non-executive posts, and has been a trustee of the Burdett Trust for Nursing for nine years.</p> <p>The charity, which grants funding to support nurse-led innovation, is also responsible for footing the \u00a3500,000 core costs for<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.who.int/hrh/news/2018/nursing_now_campaign/en/\">Nursing Now</a> \u2013 a three-year global campaign to raise the profile and status of nursing worldwide, which concludes at the end of this year. </p> <p>Beasley says the battle against Covid-19 highlights the combination of technical skills and the \u201chuman touch\u201d that nursing provides. <strong>\u201c</strong>This is a really good, but rather sad and awful, example [that] showcases what nurses can do to contribute to containing and looking after people who get sick through a<strong> </strong>pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>The year 2020 is proving quite the moment for nursing: it has been designated the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/campaigns/year-of-the-nurse-and-the-midwife-2020\">International Year of the Nurse and Midwife</a> by the World Health Organization to coincide with the <a href=\"https://www.florence-nightingale.co.uk/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyPbzBRDsARIsAFh15JYTxWq0yKz_Hi1_rGc8bBejk5BR9eNeIw1wZIslPFBpo0I8NWKHmMcaAuWDEALw_wcB\">bicentenary of Florence Nightingale </a>\u2013 the pioneer of modern nursing who first identified handwashing as key to infection control.</p> <p>As chief nurse, Beasley pressed home the importance of clean hands during the battle against hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/nov/10/nhsstaff.health\">early noughties</a>. The initiative was very much nurse-led, she says. </p> <p>\u201cMost doctors didn\u2019t believe that it could really make any difference to MRSA because it was a byproduct of modern medicine, and consequently they slightly stepped aside,\u201d Beasley recalls. \u201cObviously they then came on board.\u201d She is pleased that awareness about handwashing, and the use of sanitisers in hospitals in battling infection are now the norm. But they are only part of the story in tackling the latest bug on the block.</p> <p>There is a \u201cbig challenge\u201d in getting testing kits and protective equipment to hospitals to keep staff safe. \u201cThe equipment is getting through, but that needs to be sustained and it needs to be done faster.\u201d</p> <p>Health and safety also means that staff should not be doing 12-14 hour shifts \u201cday after day after day\u201d.

  "<h2>Top story: Lancet study gives picture of age-related risk</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with you again, and don\u2019t be surprised if you start seeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/bear-hunt-helps-banish-coronavirus-boredom-for-new-zealand-children\">teddy bears appearing in people\u2019s windows</a>.</p> \n<p>The first comprehensive study of Covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations in mainland China has revealed in stark detail the increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/new-coronavirus-study-reveals-increased-risks-from-middle-age\">risk for coronavirus patients once they reach middle age</a>. Four per cent of infected people in their 40s needed hospital treatment, as did more than 8% of patients in their 50s. More than 18% of those in their 80s and above needed hospitalisation after catching the virus. Only 0.04% of 10 to 19-year-olds had to go into hospital if infected.</p> \n<p>The analysis found that while the overall death rate for confirmed cases was 1.38% it rose sharply with age, from 0.0016% in the under 10s to 7.8% in those 80 and over. The study reported in Lancet Infectious Diseases was based on analysis of 70,117 laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases in mainland China, combined with 689 positive cases among people repatriated from Wuhan. The number of deaths related to coronavirus in the US has passed 3,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Meanwhile today marks a week of no new cases reported in Wuhan city, China, where the outbreak first emerged. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US is almost double those in China. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/us-deaths-pass-3000-as-world-bank-warns-covid-19-will-drive-east-asia-into-poverty\">pandemic\u2019s economic fallout could cause China\u2019s growth to come to a standstill</a> while driving 11 million more people in East Asia into poverty, the World Bank has warned.</p> \n<p>In major European cities homeless people are increasingly going hungry during the enforced lockdown and even being issued with police fines for being outside, Daniel Boffey writes from Brussels. A shortfall in protective supplies for staff means food banks and soup kitchens have closed, while efforts to stop the spread have ranged from shelters in Amsterdam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/europes-homeless-hit-hard-by-coronavirus-response\">turning residents out during the day</a>, to homeless people being herded into gymnasiums in Paris to stop them gathering outside.

Sussex police launched a murder investigation but said they were not seeking anyone else in connection with the deaths. Officers attended after receiving a call raising a welfare concern about the residents. All of the victims were believed to be members of the same family, the force said, and all were pronounced dead at the scene.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Test spots cancer\u2019s DNA fingerprints \u2013 </strong>A blood test that can detect more than 50 types of cancer has been revealed by researchers. It picks up chemical changes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/31/new-blood-test-can-detect-50-types-of-cancer\">DNA that is shed by tumours</a> and ends up circulating in the blood. Researchers say the test can not only tell whether someone has cancer but also what type. The test was developed using a machine learning algorithm that examined \u201cmethylation\u201d patterns in cancerous and non-cancerous DNA. The rate at which it could detect cancer varied, but reached 93% in advanced cases. Researchers say it also offers hope in regard to cancers that are otherwise difficult to detect. The system correctly identified 63% of those with stage I pancreatic cancer, rising to 100% in stage IV.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Carbon harms your planet\u2019s health \u2013 </strong>Graphic cigarette packet-like warnings should appear on high-carbon products from airline tickets and energy bills to petrol pumps, to show consumers the health impacts of the climate crisis, say public health experts.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global infections head towards 800,000</h2> <p>Infections worldwide have passed 786,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, with 37,800 deaths. The three countries with the highest infections are: the United States with nearly 165,000 (see below), Italy with nearly 102,000 and Spain with just under 88,000. Italy retains the highest death toll (11,591), followed by Spain 7,716) and China (3,309).</p> <h2>US deaths pass grim milestone, as hospital ship arrives in New York</h2> <p>The US cases of Covid-19 rose to just under 165,000, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/us-deaths-pass-3000-as-world-bank-warns-covid-19-will-drive-east-asia-into-poverty\">more than 3,000 deaths.</a> The new infection figure is nearly double China\u2019s (82,240) and fast approaching China\u2019s death toll of 3,309. Late on Monday the US Navy ship Comfort docked in Manhattan, with its 1,000 beds to treat non-coronavirus patients to free up hospitals. A field hospital opened in New York City\u2019s iconic Central Park, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/new-york-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo-makeshift-hospitals\">and will begin taking patients on Tuesday.</a> US infectious disease experts warned smaller cities were about to witness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-pelosi-coronavirus-response\">rapid acceleration of cases.</a></p> <h2>China\u2019s Wuhan city records no new cases for a week</h2> <p>The Chinese Health Commission says the centre of the outbreak, Wuhan, has not had a new cases of Covid-19 since 23 January, and some shopping areas were beginning to reopen. The commission also said there were just 2,161 cases across the country remaining, with 76,052 people recovered.</p> <h2>World Bank warns of \u2018unprecedented global shock\u2019</h2> <p>The World Bank says the pandemic could \u201cbring growth to a halt and increase poverty\u201d, according to its East Asia and Pacific chief economist, Aaditya Mattoo. Even in the best-case scenario, the region will see a sharp drop in growth, with China\u2019s expansion slowing to 2.3%from 6.1% in 2019.</p> <h2>Japanese government resists calls for state of emergency</h2> <p>A government spokesman dismissed calls for the prime minister, Shinzo Abe to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/karaoke-shutdown-in-tokyo-amid-calls-for-covid-19-state-of-emergency-in-japan\">declare a state of emergency,</a> as the country recorded nearly 2,000 cases and 56 deaths. The country\u2019s economics minister warned that shutdowns in cities such as Tokyo or Osaka could have huge consequences on the world\u2019s third largest economy.</p> <h2>Australia\u2019s infection rate slows</h2> <p>Australia reported reported a sustained fall in the rate of new coronavirus infections, with the rate of growth in new infections slowing from 25-30% a week ago to an average of 9% over the past three days.</p> <h2>Airlines call for help</h2> <p>American Airlines said it plans to seek $12bn in government aid to cover payroll costs over the next six months. On Monday EasyJet grounded its entire fleet of aircraft for at least two months and will seek to scale back plans for $5.5bn of spending, including payments for new planes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/airbus\">Airbus</a>. Early on Tuesday, reports emerged that British Airways had cancelled all flights out of Gatwick.</p> <h2>Risk in middle age</h2> <p>The first comprehensive study of Covid-19 deaths and hospitalisations in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> has revealed in stark detail the increase in risk for coronavirus patients from middle age onwards, according to analysis published in the <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30243-7/fulltext\">Lancet Infectious Diseases</a>. It found that while the overall death rate for confirmed cases was 1.38%, the rate rose sharply with age \u2013 from 0.0016% in the under 10s, to 7.8% for those in their 80s and over.</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic has forced questions of life and death to the fore around the world.

As coronavirus dominates the news, other topics fall even further down the agenda for public attention.</p> <p>But the war in Yemen remains active, with a recent escalation in hostilities after a few months of relative calm. And the UK is intimately involved in the war: through the provision of weapons, military training and support, and diplomatic cover for the Saudi-led coalition. Without the support of the UK, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s primary supporter, the US, the war would have to end.</p> <p>The UK government\u2019s arms export policy made headline news in June 2019 when the court of appeal found it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jun/20/uk-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-for-use-in-yemen-declared-unlawful\">to be unlawful </a>because the government had not properly assessed risks associated with weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. Since then, the government has committed to not issuing any new licences for exports to the coalition, but is allowing already-registered companies to continue exporting. The overall effect is to permit the ongoing supply of weapons to the coalition whilst also claiming to act in the spirit of the law.</p> <p>It has batted away questions from concerned MPs, repeating the canard that the UK has one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world. It has not yet concluded the process required of it by the court of appeal, to retake past decisions, this time lawfully. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33c782bda15eeda3d0d3973db0b955a958427400\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33c782bda15eeda3d0d3973db0b955a958427400/0_0_3500_2288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dust rises from the site of a Saudi-led air strike in Sana\u2019a, Yemen, on 30 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saudi-led air strikes have targeted civilians and hospitals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khaled Abdullah/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One key feature of the way the government is handling the arms export controversy has something in common with its response to the coronavirus pandemic: a desire not to know.</p> <p>With Covid-19, the UK has lagged behind other countries in rolling out testing. This has kept the number of confirmed cases artificially low. Such political expediency seems central to how the government has managed questions of responsibility and action in relation to the pandemic.</p> <p>With its policy on arms exports, the Ministry of Defence has failed to keep track of whether Saudi-led coalition attacks might have constituted a violation of international law. As a result, by claiming not to know whether attacks have been unlawful, the government can allege there is no clear risk that weapons will be misused \u2013 and hence no reason to halt exports. This refusal to track the use of weapons in the war is central to how the government continues to support the Saudi-led coalition while claiming to uphold international law.</p> <p>However, as with coronavirus, not knowing about a problem doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not there; and doesn\u2019t exempt the government from responsibility.</p> <p><em>Anna Stavrianakis is a </em><em>professor of </em><em>international </em><em>relations at the University of Sussex</em></p>",

This, rather than putting money directly into the hands of the individual, makes sense: it will be better for any economic recovery if people with jobs keep them, if companies don\u2019t go bust.</p> <p>However, it is unlikely that covering the payroll will be enough to forestall disaster for many firms, and the word \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/virgin-atlantic-to-seek-millions-in-state-aid-amid-covid-19-slump\">bailouts</a>\u201d has roared back into fashion. As a talking point, bailouts were largely furloughed five years ago. All that state money of the 00s, poured into saving corporations, then clawed back from social safety nets around the world, was so much spilt milk for many people. But if we\u2019re going to do it again, we must <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\">do it differently</a>.</p> <p>Many failures \u2013 individual, institutional and systemic \u2013 went into creating the financial meltdown of 2008, but it is the failure of the social response that resonates now. It looked like a vindication: ultimate capitalism, when push came to shove, needed ultimate socialism in order to survive. Surely, after that, nothing could go back to the way it was? Well, we failed utterly to appreciate the audacity of wealth, and the masochistic appeal of political narratives that blamed us all for a crisis that the unimaginably rich created.</p> <p>The analogy with the present emergency is not exact, of course, since it is nobody\u2019s fault. But if we\u2019re going to bail out large corporations and businesses, there need to be some conditions. The Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren has already laid this <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/18/business/elizabeth-warren-bailout-buyback-ban/index.html\">out </a><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/18/business/elizabeth-warren-bailout-buyback-ban/index.html\">in the US</a>, and many of her points apply internationally. Any company being bailed out must maintain their payrolls and use funds to keep people employed; they\u2019re permanently barred from <a href=\"https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1dfj9g9mfnqxb/Share-Buybacks-May-Be-Bad-Just-Not-for-the-Reasons-You-Think\">share buybacks</a>, which is one way to funnel state aid directly to shareholders; they should be prohibited from paying out dividends or executive bonuses for three years; and a minimum of one seat on the board should be given to a representative from the workforce. No union agreement can be renegotiated under the relief programme. Warren\u2019s proposal also includes a requirement of a $15 minimum hourly wage, which the UK could frame as a living wage requirement (an actual living wage; not George Osborne\u2019s ersatz <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-osborne-s-living-wage-is-not-actually-a-living-wage-says-living-wage-foundation-10375897.html\">\u201cnational living wage\u201d</a>).</p> <p>There is another opportunity here: use state aid to curtail <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/tax-avoiders-coronavirus-bailouts\">tax avoidance</a>. No company that isn\u2019t headquartered in the UK should receive help from the British government. The measure doesn\u2019t have to be vindictive \u2013 companies can re-domicile. But if you want the protection of the state, you have to pay tax to that state. </p> <p>And these conditions can be agile, building in fixes as the situation unfolds: write requirements against <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/649a7e5a-6dab-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\">price gouging</a>, particular to Sports Direct (although it denies any wrongdoing), or if Wetherspoons gets a bailout demand that its founder, Tim Martin, pay smaller suppliers.</p> <p>Every sector is having specific crises: <a href=\"https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/reports/emergency-landing-how-public-stakes-can-secure-a-sustainable-future-for-aviation\">grounded planes</a> and shuttered pubs face different challenges to agriculture, where demand has never been more insistent but there\u2019s a shortage of workers. Yet what they all have in common is that, socially, we need them to survive and we need them to emerge from this moving towards a decarbonised and fruitful workplace. Airline bailouts could also require a plan for carbon reduction. The thinktank Common Wealth proposes that agricultural subsidies be used to drive sustainability, <a href=\"https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/interactive-digital-projects/re-wilding-uk\">rewilding</a> and better forestry techniques and soil management. These deeper measures, which are about the next 50 years rather than five months, can be jointly established by government, employers and employees, whose interests are the same: hibernation with the promise of reawakening to something better.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-crisis-tories-cuts\">In this crisis, the Tory cuts can no longer be hidden by empty gestures | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are now in an era of intense generosity: we want individuals, families, small businesses, large corporations, life as we know it to survive, and there is no space in that for parsimony.

  "<p>For some time this pandemic will focus almost all of our attention. It is a tragedy that will play out differently in different parts of the world; the poor world will suffer more than the rich one. We will see it as a potential turning point, a portent, a sign that we should have cared more and prepared better. However, human progress was slowing before this pandemic began, and our world will continue to slow down for some time to come \u2013 long after the pandemic has ended. I mean slowing down in almost every way that matters. Because the slowdown was itself slow, we had hardly noticed it. In fact, many people thought that we were still accelerating.</p> <p>For older generations everything had changed so fast, but in fact that fast pace ended years ago. There is no normal for us to return to; the normality of economic growth is an illusion. </p> <p>A century ago the pace of change was faster than it had ever been and would become faster again. During the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">Spanish global flu pandemic</a> of 1918-19, carbon emissions fell by 14%. Industrial production and consumption slowed down dramatically. But then, just a year later when most of the sick had recovered, production and pollution rose by 16% in the year to 1920. Back then we were on the upswing. We were seeing ever faster population growth worldwide; back then a pandemic could not slow us down for long.</p> <p>In 1918, influenza had a far greater effect on <em>worldwide</em> trends in industry, production and consumption than the first world war \u2013 which was a war almost entirely confined to Europe. A century ago that worldwide influenza pandemic killed tens of millions of people, no one knows for sure how many. Yet today when we look back at demographic and economic trends, that last great pandemic appears as a small blip with few long-term consequences. </p> <p>Over the past two centuries, the number of people alive in the world has doubled and doubled and doubled again; from 1 billion shortly before 1820, to 2 billion by 1926 and 4 in 1974; it will be 8 billion in 2023. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/27/what-goes-up-population-crisis-wrong-fertility-rates-decline\">crucially the rise is slowing</a>. As I write, our numbers are rising by 80 million people a year. Next year it will be by 79 million, the year after by 78 million. We are still growing in number as a species, but that growth has been slowing for more than half a century already.</p> <p>We do not yet know what effect the current pandemic will have on worldwide demographics. But it is actually slightly more likely to increase future populations than decrease them. If the actions of governments, or at least of most governments, make people feel more insecure, economically and socially, then younger people may in the near future have more children than they would have had; and the pandemic will, counterintuitively, very slightly increase the total future population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b310ccc5fb76ba44c75c42b4afc0ee0a212c2eec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b310ccc5fb76ba44c75c42b4afc0ee0a212c2eec/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The dramatic fall in concentrations of nitrogen dioxide over China between 1 January and 25 February is related to the coronavirus quarantine, Chinese New Year and an overall economic slowdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dramatic fall in concentrations of nitrogen dioxide over China between 1 January and 25 February is related to the coronavirus quarantine, Chinese New Year and an overall economic slowdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nasa/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Security matters. In normal times this point has to be laboured because many readers of newspapers in affluent countries do not realise how precarious the safety net is for most people in the world. But today they are feeling as most people in poorer countries feel most days. Such insecurity played a part in the great acceleration in human population that began more than two centuries ago. It is worth looking back before looking forward.</p> <p>In 1859 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/09/darwin.bestseller\">Charles Darwin wrote</a> about \u201cthe numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following seasons\u201d. Darwin used examples ranging from minuscule seedlings to giant elephants; he discussed the very rare cases in nature when exponential population growth occurred in a species. Darwin had no way of knowing it, but he was writing just as his own species was about to have its favourable seasons.</p> <p>The word \u201cslowdown\u201d was first used in the 1890s, with its meaning being to go forward more slowly. Our current belief systems \u2013 economic, political and sociological \u2013 are all built on assumptions of rapid future technological change and perpetual growth. Yet even since the 1930s, technological change has slowed; the rate of economic growth has slowed every decade after the 1950s; population growth similarly has slowed since before the 1970s; and since at least the 1990s we have started to behave more like our parents again. By the 2010s we (at least in the rich world) were no longer seeing each generation better-off than the one before.</p> <p>The general slowdown we are living through is advantageous. Recognising this requires us to shift our fundamental view of change, innovation and discovery as unalloyed benefits. We need to stop expecting ceaseless technological revolutions. We need to worry about what mistakes we will make if we carry on assuming that slowdown is unlikely and new great shifts lie just around the corner.</p> <p>The time has come to properly contemplate what will happen if things stay much the same as they are now, while the rate of change simply slows down.</p> <p>An era is ending \u2013 and this was obvious years before the pandemic arrived. The great acceleration that has occurred in recent generations created the culture in which we still live. It created our current expectation for a particular kind of progress. By \u201cus\u201d I mean the large majority of older people now living on Earth, those who have for the most part seen their health, housing and workplaces improve, those who had seen both absolute and relative poverty recede, but who now have a sense that their children\u2019s generation will not be better off than they themselves are, those who are feeling a sense of let-down due to slowdown.</p> <p>The alternative to slowdown is unimaginably bad. If we do not slow down, there is no escape from disaster far worse than a pandemic. We would wreck the planet we live on. Slowdown means we need not fear the nightmare scenario of worldwide famine depicted at the end of Paul and Anne Ehrlich\u2019s 1968 book <em>The Population Bomb</em>, in which they concluded of India that its people should be allowed to starve: \u201cUnder the triage system [suggested by them] she [India] should receive no more food.\u201d This kind of brutal conclusion was rife in the recent past. Images of out-of-control acceleration became commonplace. That was just half a century ago, at the peak of human population acceleration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6cb9829db9b283af27985e30cce415293cbed14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6cb9829db9b283af27985e30cce415293cbed14/0_80_1569_1962/800.jpg\" alt=\"A child in 1946 during the Chinese famine last lasted from 1958-61.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child in 1946 during the Chinese famine last lasted from 1958-61.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Silk/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although now may not be the time to point it out, the frequency and severity of disaster are both falling. The great Chinese famine of 1958\u201361 was worse in its effect than any of the earlier terrible huge Indian famines, or the east Africa famine of the 1980s. But the flu pandemic of 40 years before that famine had been worse still in terms of millions of deaths.</p> <p>Today almost everything is increasing at a slower pace. Prior to the 2020 pandemic, the four great exceptions were: university graduates enrolled worldwide, consumption of goods, carbon pollution and air flights. They have all suddenly slowed due to the pandemic. Before January of this year they all appeared to be rising exponentially and uncontrollably. Today it is even possible that worldwide temperature will not rise in 2020 in the way it rose in 2019, as a reaction to reduced pollution.</p> <p>Outside brief periods of wartime and pandemic, the global rates of population growth have exceeded 1% every year since 1901. However, according to the latest UN estimates published in June 2019, they will now almost certainly fall below that level by 2023, then quickly drop to below 0.9% annual growth around the year 2027. Everything was slowing down already, everything will still slow down when the current crisis ends. But the slamming on of the brakes on the train we were travelling on might, at the very least, wake us out of our stupor.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Danny Dorling is the author of <a href=\"http://www.dannydorling.org/books/SLOWDOWN/\">Slowdown: The End of the Great Acceleration \u2013 and Why It\u2019s Good for the Planet, the Economy, and Our Lives</a>, published 14 April (\u00a314.99, Yale).</em></p>",

Hundreds of millions of people around the world will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\" title=\"\">out of work</a>.

Would you have believed what you were hearing?</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not just the size and speed of what is happening that\u2019s dizzying. It\u2019s the fact that we have grown accustomed to hearing that democracies are incapable of making big moves like this quickly, or at all. But here we are. Any glance at history reveals that crises and disasters have continually set the stage for change, often for the better. The global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk\" title=\"\">flu epidemic of 1918</a> helped create national health services in many European countries. The twinned crises of the Great Depression and the second world war set the stage for the modern welfare state.</p> \n<p>But crises can also send societies down darker paths. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, government surveillance of citizens exploded, while George W Bush launched new wars that stretched into indefinite occupations. (As I write this, the US military\u2019s current attempt at reducing its troop presence in Afghanistan, 19 years after the invasion, is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/world/asia/coronavirus-withdrawal-afghanistan.html\" title=\"\">being slowed</a> by coronavirus-related complications.) Another recent crisis, the 2008 financial crash, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\" title=\"\">resolved</a> in a way that meant banks and financial institutions were restored to pre-crash normality, at great public cost, while government spending on public services across the world was slashed.</p> \n<p>Because crises shape history, there are hundreds of thinkers who have devoted their lives to studying how they unfold. This work \u2013 what we might call the field of \u201ccrisis studies\u201d \u2013 charts how, whenever crisis visits a given community, the fundamental reality of that community is laid bare. Who has more and who has less. Where the power lies. What people treasure and what they fear.</p> \n<p>In such moments, whatever is broken in society gets revealed for just how broken it is, often in the form of haunting little images or stories. In recent weeks, the news has furnished us with countless examples. Airlines are flying large numbers of empty or near-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/eu-airlines-ghost-flights-coronavirus-fightback-airport-landing-rules-empty-planes\" title=\"\">empty flights</a> for the sole purpose of protecting their slots on prime sky routes. There have been <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200321-french-police-accused-of-fining-homeless-people-amid-virus-lockdown\" title=\"\">reports</a> of French police fining homeless people for being outside during the lockdown. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/new-york-is-making-hand-sanitizer-with-prison-labor.html\" title=\"\">Prisoners</a> in New York state are getting paid less than a dollar per hour to bottle hand sanitiser that they themselves are not allowed to use (because it contains alcohol), in a prison where they are not given free soap, but must buy it in an on-site shop.</p> \n<p>But disasters and emergencies do not just throw light on the world as it is. They also rip open the fabric of normality. Through the hole that opens up, we glimpse possibilities of other worlds. Some thinkers who study disasters focus more on all that might go wrong. Others are more optimistic, framing crises not just in terms of what is lost but also what might be gained. Every disaster is different, of course, and it\u2019s never just one or the other: loss and gain always coexist. Only in hindsight will the contours of the new world we\u2019re entering become clear. </p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>The pessimistic view is that a crisis makes bad things worse. People who study disasters \u2013 and especially pandemics \u2013 know all too well their tendency to inflame xenophobia and racial scapegoating. When the Black Death came to Europe in the 14th century, cities and towns shut themselves to outsiders \u2013 and assaulted, banished and killed \u201cundesirable\u201d community members, most often Jews. In 1858, a mob in New York City broke into a quarantine hospital for immigrants on Staten Island, demanded that everyone leave and then burned the hospital down, fearful that it was putting people outside at risk of yellow fever. Wikipedia now has a page collating examples from more than 35 countries of \u201cxenophobia and racism related to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic\u201d: they range from taunts to outright assault.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a totally rational world, you might assume that an international pandemic would lead to greater internationalism,\u201d says the historian Mike Davis, a renowned American chronicler of the disasters incubated by globalisation. For Davis, who wrote <a href=\"https://thenewpress.com/books/monster-our-door\" title=\"\">a book</a> about the threat of avian flu in 2005, pandemics are a perfect example of the kind of crises to which global capitalism (with its constant movement of people and goods) is particularly vulnerable, but that the capitalist mindset (with its inability to think in terms beyond profit) cannot address. \u201cIn a rational world, we would be ramping up production of basic essential supplies \u2013 test kits, masks, respirators \u2013 not only for our own use, but for poorer countries, too. Because it\u2019s all one battle. But it\u2019s not necessarily a rational world. So there could be a lot of demonisation and calls for isolation. Which will mean more deaths and more suffering worldwide.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the US, President Trump has tried hard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\" title=\"\">to brand</a> the new coronavirus as inherently \u201cChinese\u201d, and to use the pandemic as a pretext for tightening borders and accepting fewer asylum seekers. Republican officials, thinktanks and media outlets have <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/republican-xenophobia-coronavirus-pandemic/\" title=\"\">claimed or implied</a> that Covid-19 is a man-made Chinese bioweapon. Some Chinese officials, in turn, have pushed the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html\" title=\"\">conspiracy theory</a> that the outbreak came to China by way of American soldiers. In Europe, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, recently announced: \u201cWe are fighting a two-front war: one front is called migration, and the other one belongs to the coronavirus. There is a logical connection between the two, as both spread with movement.\u201d</p> \n<p>When you\u2019re fighting a war, you want to know as much about the enemy as possible. But it\u2019s easy, in the rush of crisis, to put in place surveillance tools without thinking about the long-term harm they might do. The scholar Shoshana Zuboff, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/02/age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff-review\" title=\"\">author of</a> The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, reminded me that, prior to 9/11, the US government had been in the process of developing serious regulations designed to give web users real choice about how their personal information was and wasn\u2019t used. \u201cIn the course of a few days,\u201d Zuboff says, \u201cthe concern shifted from \u2018How do we regulate these companies that are violating privacy norms and rights\u2019 to \u2018How do we nurture and protect these companies so they can collect data for us?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>For governments looking to monitor their citizens even more closely, and companies looking to get rich by doing the same, it would be hard to imagine a more perfect crisis than a global pandemic. In China today, drones search for people without facemasks; when they are found, the drones\u2019 built-in speakers <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/coronavirus-watch-drones-scold-maskless-civilians-in-china.html\" title=\"\">broadcast scoldings</a> from police.

Lockdowns have made many of us, sitting at home glued to our computers and phones, more dependent than ever on big tech companies. Many of these same companies are actively pitching themselves to government as a vital part of the solution. It is worth asking what they stand to gain. \u201cPeople have a hard time remembering privacy rights when they\u2019re trying to deal with something like a pandemic,\u201d says Vasuki Shastry, a Chatham House fellow who studies the interplay of technology and democracy. \u201cOnce a system gets scaled up, it can be very difficult to scale it back down. And then maybe it takes on other uses.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the space of a few weeks, the prime ministers of both Israel and Hungary have effectively been given the power to rule by decree, without interference from courts or legislature. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s recently rolled-out coronavirus bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-suspects-may-be-detained-under-uk-emergency-powers\" title=\"\">gives police</a> and immigration officers the authority \u2013 in place for the next two years \u2013 to arrest and detain people suspected of carrying the virus, so that they can be tested. The US Department of Justice has, since the outbreak began, filed <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/doj-suspend-constitutional-rights-coronavirus-970935/\" title=\"\">a request</a> with Congress for a new rule that would allow judges to suspend courtroom proceedings in emergencies, creating the possibility of people being jailed without ever being able to formally object. \u201cThose of us who follow the police know how this goes,\u201d said Kevin Blowe of Netpol, a UK group focused on protest rights. \u201cThese powers get put in place, and it sounds reasonable enough at the time \u2013 and then very quickly they\u2019re applied for other purposes that have nothing to do with democracy and nothing to do with public safety.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a 2008 <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/report/pandemic-preparedness-need-public-health-not-law-enforcementnational-security-approach?redirect=cpredirect/33642\" title=\"\">report</a> on the legal aspects of pandemic response, prompted by the increase in pandemic flu outbreaks, a team of historians and medical ethicists assembled by the American Civil Liberties Union bemoaned a common tendency \u2013 resurgent, in their view, since 9/11 \u2013 for government to address public health problems using mindsets more appropriate to tracking down criminals. This suspicious mindset, they argued, ended up most affecting racial minorities and the poor. Tactics like these can make fighting the disease harder, by driving a hard wedge of distrust between government and citizens. As the report put it: \u201cPeople, rather than the disease, become the enemy.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4af07576-d7aa-4d4c-98dc-13da3ec13aef\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RnTfvrhJs88?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>There\u2019s another school of thought that looks at crisis and sees glimmers of possibility. For thinkers in this camp, the example of the 2008 financial crash looms large. But where, from their view, 2008 led to defeat \u2013 with the broad public giving up a great deal while a small few profited \u2013 Covid-19 might open the door to political progress<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re just so different to how we were before we saw the aftermath of the 2008 crash,\u201d said the American writer Rebecca Solnit, one of today\u2019s most eloquent investigators of crises and their implications. \u201cIdeas that used to be seen as leftwing seem more reasonable to more people. There\u2019s room for change that there wasn\u2019t beforehand. It\u2019s an opening.\u201d</p> \n<p>The argument, in its simplest form, is this: Covid-19 has revealed the political status quo to be broken. Long before anyone had heard of the new coronavirus, people died of diseases we knew how to prevent and treat. People lived precarious lives in societies awash with wealth. Experts told us about catastrophic threats on the horizon, including pandemics, and we did next to nothing to prepare for them. At the same time, the drastic measures governments have taken in recent weeks testify to just how much power the state <em>does</em> have \u2013 the extent of what government can accomplish (and quickly!) when it realises it must act boldly or risk being seen as fundamentally illegitimate. As Pankaj Mishra <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-17/coronavirus-will-revive-an-all-powerful-state\" title=\"\">recently wrote</a>: \u201cIt has taken a disaster for the state to assume its original responsibility to protect citizens.\u201d</p> \n<p>For years, in mainstream politics the conventional line \u2013 on everything from healthcare to basic living expenses such as housing \u2013 has been that even if the world has its problems, expansive government intervention is not a feasible solution. Instead, we have been told that what works best are \u201cmarketplace\u201d solutions, which give large roles to corporations motivated not by outdated notions like \u201cthe public good\u201d but by a desire to make a profit. But then the virus started spreading, governments spent trillions in days \u2013 even going so far as to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-us-bailout-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">write cheques</a> directly to citizens \u2013 and suddenly the question of what was feasible felt different.</p> \n<p>From this perspective, the task today is not to fight the virus in order to return to business as usual, because business as usual was already a disaster. The goal, instead, is to fight the virus \u2013 and in doing so transform business as usual into something more humane and secure.</p> \n<p>In her 2009 book, A Paradise Built in Hell<em>,</em> Solnit used case studies of disasters \u2013 including the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 2001 terror attacks and Hurricane Katrina \u2013 to argue that emergencies aren\u2019t just moments when bad things get worse, or when people inevitably become more scared, suspicious and self-centred. Instead she foregrounded the ways in which disasters opened up human reserves of improvisation, solidarity and resolve, pockets of purpose and joy, even in the midst of loss and pain. The book was not a call to celebrate disaster \u2013 but to pay attention to the possibilities it might contain, and how it might shake us loose from old ways. In Solnit\u2019s telling, \u201cofficial\u201d disaster responses had a tendency to muck things up by treating people as part of the problem to be managed, not an invaluable part of the solution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\" no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sometimes this mismanagement is a result of mere incompetence \u2013 other times it is more sinister. In her 2007 book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/15/politics\" title=\"\">The Shock Doctrine</a>, the Canadian writer Naomi Klein laid out a dark account of crisis politics. In Klein\u2019s view, there is always Disaster 1 \u2013 the earthquake, the storm, the military conflict, the economic slump \u2013 and Disaster 2 \u2013 the bad things that people with power subsequently get up to, such as ramming through extreme economic reforms or gobbling up post-crisis opportunities for self-enrichment, while the rest of us are too dazed to notice. (In fact, Klein argued, these people sometimes engineer Disaster 1 to get the process started.)</p> \n<p>Unlike Solnit\u2019s book, The Shock Doctrine doesn\u2019t have much to say about the resilience of everyday people when everything goes horribly wrong. (Indeed, Solnit directly criticised Klein for this omission.) But the two books fit together like puzzle pieces. Both address crisis not in terms of what inevitably \u2013 or \u201cnaturally\u201d \u2013 happens as they unfold, but in terms of choices that people make along the way. And both were well-timed to contribute to the political conversations taking shape in the rubble of the financial crash.</p> \n<p>In 2008, days after Barack Obama\u2019s election, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, famously said: \u201cYou never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\u201d Today\u2019s leftists, for whom Obama mostly represents disappointment, are prone to agree. They feel that, in the wake of recent crises, they lost, and now is the time to make amends. If, facing a pandemic, we can change this much in a few weeks, then how much might we change in a year?</p> \n<p>For anyone making this argument, the contrast between 2008 and the present crisis is striking. Compared to the opaque financial crisis, with its credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations, the coronavirus is relatively easy to understand. It is a dozen crises tangled into one, and they\u2019re all unfolding immediately, in ways that cannot be missed. Politicians are getting infected. Wealthy celebrities are getting infected. Your friends and relatives are getting infected. We may not quite all be \u201cin it together\u201d \u2013 as always, the poor are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-outbreak-inequality-austerity-pandemic\" title=\"\">hit worse</a> \u2013 but there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-means-we-really-are-finally-all-in-this-together\" title=\"\">more truth</a> to the idea than there ever was in the wake of 2008.</p> \n<p>In this, the optimists believe, there is hope that we might begin to see the world differently. Maybe we can view our problems as shared, and society as more than just a mass of individuals competing against each other for wealth and standing. Maybe, in short, we can understand that the logic of the market should not dominate as many spheres of human existence as we currently allow it to.</p> \n<p>\u201cMore people are in a position to connect the dots,\u201d Klein said. \u201cIt has to do with people\u2019s experiences; for people of a certain age, their only experience of capitalism has been one of crisis. And they want things to be different.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>That screaming buzzsaw noise in the background of this conversation is the sound of the climate crisis. If 2008 is the disaster that Klein and like-minded thinkers want to avoid repeating, climate change is the much bigger disaster they see coming \u2013 that they know is already here \u2013 and that they want to fight off. Indeed, in the years since publishing The Shock Doctrine, Klein has made climate change her central focus, framing it as the paradigmatic emergency that must be wrenched from the clutches of fossil-fuel profiteers and their enablers in government.</p> \n<p>Although Covid-19 is likely the biggest global crisis since the second world war, it is still dwarfed in the long term by climate change. Yet the two problems have suggestive similarities. Both will require unusual levels of global cooperation. Both demand changes in behaviour today in the name of reducing suffering tomorrow. Both problems were long predicted with great certainty by scientists, and have been neglected by governments unable to see beyond the next fiscal quarter\u2019s growth statistics. Accordingly, both will require governments to take drastic action and banish the logic of the marketplace from certain realms of human activity, while simultaneously embracing public investment. In other words, to think of this new level of state intervention as a temporary requirement is to ensure that we continue barrelling down the path to climate disaster.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for years to get people out of normal mode and into emergency mode,\u201d said Margaret Klein Salamon, a former psychologist who now heads the advocacy group The Climate Mobilization. \u201cWhat is possible politically is fundamentally different when lots of people get into emergency mode \u2013 when they fundamentally accept that there\u2019s danger, and that if we want to be safe we need to do everything we can. And it\u2019s been interesting to see that theory validated by the response to the coronavirus. Now the challenge is to keep emergency mode activated about climate, where the dangers are orders of magnitude greater. We can\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go \u2018back to normal\u2019, because things weren\u2019t normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>The analogy between the two crises only goes so far. There is no getting around the fact that the impacts of climate change are more gradual than those of Covid-19. Most people do not feel they or their loved ones could die from the climate crisis this month, and so emergency mode is harder to activate and sustain. As Salamon pointed out to me, if we truly accepted we were in a climate emergency, then every day the news would lead with updates about which countries were reducing their emissions the fastest, and people would be clamouring to make sure their leaders were adopting the policies that worked.</p> \n<p>But it is not unimaginable that the experience of Covid-19 could help us understand climate change differently. As the virus has reduced industrial activity and road traffic, air pollution has plummeted. In early March, the Stanford University scientist Marshall Burke <a href=\"http://www.g-feed.com/2020/03/covid-19-reduces-economic-activity.html\" title=\"\">used pollution data</a> from four Chinese cities to measure changes in the level of PM2.5, a particularly harmful pollutant that attacks the heart and lungs. He estimated that, in China alone, emission reductions since the start of the pandemic had in effect saved the lives of at least 1,400 children under five and 51,700 adults over 70. Meanwhile, people around the world have been sharing their own anecdotal findings online \u2013 stories of sweet-smelling breezes, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipoltermann/status/1244189207867854848\" title=\"\">expanded</a> bike lanes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/29/uk-wildlife-enjoys-humans-lockdown-but-concerns-raised-over-conservation\" title=\"\">birdsong returning</a> to neighbourhoods \u2013 in a way that almost resembles a digitally distributed Rebecca Solnit project: people catching glimpses, in the midst of a disaster, of a future they know they want and need.</p> \n<p>Alongside these hopeful signs, a far less heartening story is unfolding, which fits Klein\u2019s \u201cshock doctrine\u201d framework. Disaster 1: Covid-19. Disaster 2: the dismantling of even the meagre existing rules designed to protect the environment. On 26 March, following lobbying from the energy industry, the US Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/trump-pollution-laws-epa-allows-companies-pollute-without-penalty-during-coronavirus\" title=\"\">announced that</a>, in recognition of the pandemic\u2019s effects on the workforce, it will not punish violations of pollution regulations so long as companies can link those violations to the pandemic. China\u2019s environmental ministry has started <a href=\"https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/china-relaxes-environmental-rules-to-curb-viruss-economic-hit\" title=\"\">waiving inspections</a> that assess the environmental impact of industrial facilities. And advocacy groups funded by the plastics industry have launched a <a href=\"https://heated.world/p/the-right-is-using-covid-19-to-wage?fbclid=IwAR3v3a7oV_CSeQE448S_fMVv-CpVBTst75tAiHD7HDKUIOSi_ugkikxR6nQ\" title=\"\">public relations blitz</a> on behalf of single-use plastic bags, spreading the unproven claim that the virus is less likely to stick to plastic than to the cloth fabric of reusable bags. Looking back at the crisis of 2008, we can see that emissions dropped then, too \u2013 only to rebound drastically in 2010 and 2011.</p> \n<p>Salamon believes that one lesson of the coronavirus crisis is the power of shared emotion, which has helped make possible radical action to slow the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about people giving each other medical expertise. I\u2019m talking about people calling each other up and saying: \u2018How are you doing? Are you scared? I\u2019m scared. I want you to be OK, I want us to be OK.\u2019 And that\u2019s what we want for climate, too. We need to learn to be scared together, to agree on what we\u2019re terrified about.\u201d Only then, she said, would governments be forced to act. \u201cIt\u2019s good that we\u2019re entering emergency mode about the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unless we also do it for climate \u2026 \u201d She didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>What kind of actions would it take for the optimists\u2019 vision to materialise? The historian Philip Mirowski, author of <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/1613-never-let-a-serious-crisis-go-to-waste\" title=\"\">Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste</a>: How Neoliberalism Survived the Financial Meltdown, warns against complacency. \u201cThe left thought it was so obvious to everyone that the crisis revealed the utter bankruptcy of a certain way of looking at the economy,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t obvious to everyone, and the left lost.\u201d How do we prevent the world from going back to a version of the way it was before Covid-19, with the virus vanquished but all of the old ongoing disasters still unfolding?</p> \n<p>\u201cThe political outcome of the epidemic,\u201d said Mike Davis, \u201cwill, like all political outcomes, be decided by struggle, by battles over interpretation, by pointing out what causes problems and what solves them. And we need to get that analysis out in the world any way we can.\u201d One major obstacle, of course, is social distancing, which certainly hinders many time-tested methods of waging such struggles, such as political canvassing and street protest. \u201cThe biggest risk for all of us,\u201d said Klein, \u201cis going to be frittering away this time sitting at home on our social media feeds, living the extremely limited forms of politics that get enabled there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davis hoped protesters would find their way into the streets sooner rather than later, and speculated that a street action with all the sign-holding participants spaced 10 or 15 feet apart would make a dramatic media image. He lives in San Diego, and as our conversation wrapped up, he mentioned that he was planning to spend part of the afternoon doing his part by standing by himself on a street corner, holding a sign. He hadn\u2019t decided what to write on it yet, but was thinking about \u201cSUPPORT THE NURSES\u2019 UNION\u201d or \u201cDEMAND PAID SICK LEAVE\u201d.</p> \n<p>Solnit told me she was taking heart from all the new ways people were finding to connect and help each other around the world, ranging from the neighbourhood delivery networks that had sprung up to bring groceries to people who couldn\u2019t get out, to more symbolic interventions, such as kids playing music on an older neighbour\u2019s porch. The Italian political scientist Alessandro Delfanti said he was finding hope from a post-outbreak <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/staten-island-amazon-warehouse-workers-strike-coronavirus-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">wave of strikes</a> roiling Amazon warehouses in the US and Europe, and also the steps that workers across different sectors of the Italian economy were taking to help each other secure equipment they needed to stay safe.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">'It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What happens next might depend on the optimists\u2019 ability to transport such moments of solidarity into the broader political sphere, arguing that it makes no sense to address Covid-19 without at least trying to fix everything else, too, creating a world where our shared resources do more for more people. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a language for this emotion, in which the wonderful comes wrapped in the terrible, joy in sorrow, courage in fear,\u201d wrote Solnit in A Paradise Built in Hell. \u201cWe cannot welcome disaster, but we can value the responses, both practical and psychological.\u201d </p> \n<p>The world feels awfully strange right now, but not because \u2013 or not <em>just</em> because \u2013 it is changing so fast and any one of us could fall ill at any time, or could already be carrying the virus and not know it.

  "<p>On 18 March 1985, Australian TV viewers got their first glimpse of the sun-soaked cul de sac of Ramsay Street, in a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Australia. Its inhabitants were a convivial, nosy bunch particularly prone to romantic affairs and, increasingly, bouts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/03/when-neighbours-jumped-the-shark\">personality disorder, amnesia and violence</a>. The confines of Erinsborough provided a moral utopia \u2013 no matter how much soapy drama poured forth, the barbies, bikinis and banter would soon return.</p> <p>First broadcast in the UK in October 1986 on BBC One, the show was a symbol of exotic aspirationalism amid the gloom of Thatcherite politics and the continual shuttering of industry.

That turned into the clumsiness and naivety that Harold brought to the screen. I nurtured that over the next 20 years.</p> <p><strong>Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy): </strong>I started out in 1987 doing three weeks\u2019 work as a guest character called Greg Cooper. I had no idea it would be a success back then \u2013 the look and feel was cheaper, the sets tended to wobble and it mainly was just a nice gig for a jobbing actor to have.</p> <p>When they asked me to audition for the role of Karl in 1994, the show had completely taken off. Although it wasn\u2019t until I went to the UK in 1999 to do panto that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/australia-culture-blog/2018/feb/20/neighbours-is-australias-grandest-trashiest-soapie-export-so-why-did-it-fail-in-the-us\">I realised it was a global phenomenon</a>.</p> <p><strong>Stefan Dennis: </strong>The show completely skyrocketed once it went on to the BBC. We were never prepared for what was going to happen when we went over to Britain for the first time for the Royal Variety Performance in 1988. That was only a couple of weeks after Scott and Charlene\u2019s wedding was broadcast. We were lambs to the slaughter in those early days. When you\u2019re sitting in a bus being rocked backwards and forwards by crazed fans, you realise something major is happening.</p> <p>The mania over the wedding was really something else \u2013 people wanted to wear the same clothes, to have the same hair, and they were even singing the song Kylie walked down the aisle to. I\u2019d never seen anything like it before and I\u2019m not sure I will again.</p> <p><strong>Geoff Paine (Clive Gibbons): </strong>When I joined in 1987 things were still looking pretty tenuous. I was playing the role of Clive, a doctor who quit the medical profession to rediscover himself, eventually setting up a gorillagram agency, of all things \u2013 although this was back in the 80s so it made sense. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6819142a5eec0a6e900bae89066b58e39133f9eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6819142a5eec0a6e900bae89066b58e39133f9eb/0_218_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harold (Ian Smith) and Paul (Stefan Dennis) tussle it out.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harold (Ian Smith) and Paul (Stefan Dennis) tussle it out.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fremantle Media/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Jason Herbison (executive producer): </strong>When I was in high school I wrote a letter to the production team giving them a few ideas for the show. To my great surprise, someone from the script department called to tell me that they liked them. Then, when there was a job available in the early 90s, I joined the writing team.</p> <p>The writers were a lot older back then than they are now and I remember one of them telling me that it was so difficult since the show had been on for about six years and they were struggling to think of what to write next. Here we are 35 years later still coming up with new storylines.</p> <p><strong>Alan Fletcher: </strong>Neighbours is a show that speaks to people because it is honest. It has the right blend of comedy and drama and the characters are incredibly relatable because we all have our flaws and we don\u2019t try to cover them up. People find that endearing.<br><br><strong>Jackie Woodburne (Susan Kennedy): </strong>When we started as the Kennedy family in 1994, we had a great response because the audience connected with the fact that we were far from a perfect family unit. The cracks in our marriage were already there and we were struggling to keep up with three kids.</p> <p><strong>Alan Fletcher: </strong>When you start on a show like this, you have to create a family instantly \u2013 there\u2019s no practice and I got very lucky indeed. I was working with three marvellous young people and, most importantly, one of my great pals, Jackie Woodburne. We gelled as a family unit quickly and I think that\u2019s what has kept us on the show for 25 years.</p> <p><strong>Jackie Woodburne: </strong>I\u2019ve always really enjoyed the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle because there are so many facets to each character that can be explored. Before Izzy, I don\u2019t think Susan had anyone she had truly hated. She is generally a decent person, so to have someone that she could show her less compassionate side to, I found that very interesting to play. And of course there were the huge fights and screaming matches to get into.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c0f01069f20b584c9b84c8998426ae505ceefed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c0f01069f20b584c9b84c8998426ae505ceefed/0_1_3440_2064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kylie Minogue, Craig McLachlan, Anne Charleston and Ian Smith.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlene (Kylie Minogue), Henry (Craig McLachlan), Madge (Anne Charleston) and Harold (Ian Smith).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FremantleMedia Ltd/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Alan Fletcher: </strong>I remember so clearly filming the scenes when Karl had a heart attack, he made his final phone call as he was dying and instead of ringing his current squeeze, Izzy, he called Susan. That was so poignant.</p> <p>Then there is also the famous slap that Jackie gave me when she found out about my character\u2019s affair with Sarah. That is a big fan favourite and also a big favourite with the crew because straight after they got the take, they all lined up to slap me too.</p> <p>On a more serious note, though, I used to think that I was completely unaffected in my own life by playing Karl, that I could leave the big emotional stuff at the green room door. But I came to realise that\u2019s not true. When you\u2019re doing emotional scenes, it does stay with you and you can see yourself feeling quite unsettled in life. So you have to be careful and much of the entertainment profession suffers from all sorts of anxiety and mental illness because of that. Our work life is lived right on the edge of that high emotion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c300917a54f831cbf0f10385e78bf5bea5f9d02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c300917a54f831cbf0f10385e78bf5bea5f9d02/97_0_2697_2698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike (Guy Pearce) and Clive (Geoff Paine).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike (Guy Pearce) and Clive (Geoff Paine).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fremantle Media/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ryan Moloney (Toadie Rebecchi): </strong>I\u2019ve spent more of my life on the show than off it. I joined when I was 15 and it was a bit of a wild time to be on TV so young, so Jackie and Alan have provided a parental presence for me; they have certainly been there for me through some tough times.</p> <p>It all began because I played a vandal in one episode and then the producers rang up and asked if my hair was the same and if it was whether I would come back to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/21/neighbours-jumps-the-shark-can-toadies-goatee-and-a-bonkers-plot-twist-save-the-soap\">expand on the character of Toadie more</a>. It grew from one scene to just over 26 years. The hair was probably the only reason I got the job.</p> <p><strong>Stefan Dennis: </strong>Probably the most noticeable change in the show over the past 35 years would be the physical changes \u2013 the lack of huge hair and shoulders and big baggy suits. We have set some fashion trends over the years though; Jason [Donovan] and Ryan brought back the mullet in a huge way and made it really popular.</p> <p><strong>Jason Herbison: </strong>The secret to the show is that it is constantly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2019/jan/21/how-ramsay-street-became-mulholland-drive-is-neighbours-channelling-david-lynch\">evolving and moving with the times</a>, while staying true to its core premise of ordinary people living in an extraordinary street.</p> <p>Our motto is that everyone\u2019s welcome on Ramsay Street, so it\u2019s really important to represent society faithfully. In the past year, we\u2019ve had a transgender character on the show. Since her storyline was announced, I\u2019ve had a number of young transgender people telling me how amazing it was to see themselves reflected on television. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/04/neighbours-first-same-sex-wedding-reflects-australias-glorious-new-reality\">also had a same-sex wedding</a> between David and Aaron in 2018<strong> </strong>and that has really shaped public perceptions on the issue. </p> <p>Our audience is very broad, so our stories cut across society. We try not to be heavy-handed about it. Now our transgender character has told her story, she is just another part of our cast and the fact that she\u2019s transgender doesn\u2019t even come into it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81162f686dfb871e3988eaf78ed2059d05b919dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81162f686dfb871e3988eaf78ed2059d05b919dd/0_0_2054_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sky (Stephanie McIntosh) and Joe Mangel (Mark Little) in 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sky (Stephanie McIntosh) and Joe Mangel (Mark Little) in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FreMantle Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Takaya Honda (David Tanaka, Paul Robinson\u2019s son): </strong>It\u2019s a shame that Neighbours hasn\u2019t been celebrated more for everything it has been doing for social change over the years. It is a core part of the show and my character embodies that in a number of ways.</p> <p>There\u2019s not a whole lot of representation for the LGBT community or for Asian Australians on TV. Before I took this role it was a rare thing to see someone on screen who didn\u2019t look Caucasian but who had a natural Australian accent.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had several messages where people have said how powerful the Asian representation has been for them, or they are saying that David\u2019s coming-out storyline gave themselves or their friends the courage to come out, which is just amazing.</p> <p><strong>Stephanie McIntosh (Sky Mangel): </strong>The Sky and Lana storyline was groundbreaking. It was the first time on Neighbours that they had explored a same-sex relationship and they had a same-sex kiss in 2004.</p> <p>Neighbours was very bold in doing that on daytime TV and of course there were very mixed emotions and quite some backlash from the media. But to now come back and complete that storyline in having Sky marry Lana, it shows just how far we have come. These storylines are completely normalised now and that\u2019s how they should always be.</p> <p><strong>Jason Herbison: </strong>There were of course the heightened storylines, like Bouncer\u2019s Dream or the return of Dee from the dead, which turned out to be an evil doppelganger. That\u2019s incredibly soapy, but we grounded it in a lot of fantastic performances.</p> <p>Ultimately, Neighbours is the best university for work in television that there is. Actors hone their craft and then we watch them leave the show and become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/03/margot-robbie-woman-lead-flop\">Margot Robbie</a> or Kylie sometimes. </p> <p><strong>Colette Mann (Sheila Canning): </strong>I\u2019m a mentor to a couple of the younger characters on the show and it\u2019s wonderful. There was no one around to help me when I was that age and starting out. I have to watch the show to give them feedback, which can be a bit excruciating. I often think: \u201cOh my God, who\u2019s that old woman who looks like my mother?\u201d But I do it for the kids as a learning experience because if you stop learning, there\u2019s no point in doing this job any more.</p> <p><strong>Geoff Paine: </strong>The show has endured for so long because it represents a community that looks after each other. So if anything goes wrong in Ramsay Street, someone will try and help to correct it. And isn\u2019t that the kind of world we all want to live in?</p> <p><em>Neighbours airs on Monday and Friday on Channel 5. Catch up with Neighbours Late: Endgame on My5.</em></p>",
