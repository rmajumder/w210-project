This \u201cexceptional\u201d crisis measure gave the government temporary constitutional powers to introduce restrictions during the pandemic. Now the government is planning legislation allowing it to lift the state of emergency while keeping certain measures to avoid a second wave of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>The number of patients in intensive care units in hospitals with the virus has dropped to below 1,000, from a spike of more than 7,000 in April, and the number of deaths each day is falling.

These measures would last until November, but could be changed according to circumstances. The law would not give the French authorities the power to reimpose a lockdown; if the virus suddenly returns, the government will have to seek a decree authorising new restrictions over the whole or part of France, Matignon, the French equivalent of Number 10, said.</p> \n  <p>France\u2019s external borders are currently closed to all but essential workers and those with a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason to enter the country.

One in four tests conducted in the country come back positive, the WHO said, which indicates a high level of infection. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brazil restored on Tuesday detailed Covid-19 data to the official national website,</strong> following a scandal about the removal of cumulative totals and a ruling by a Supreme Court justice that the full set of information be reinstated.<br>The detailed information, with cumulative totals and breakdowns by state, was restored to the website https://covid.saude.gov.br/, Reuters confirmed on Tuesday afternoon.</li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead backtracked on her comment that asymptomatic transmission of the virus was \u201cvery rare\u201d</strong>. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a misunderstanding to state the asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare,\u201d Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said, noting modelling suggesting 40% of infections could be transmitted by people without symptoms.</li> \n   <li><strong>A group of EU member states called for medical and equipment stockpiles to be increased.</strong> The leaders of Denmark, Spain and Germany, as well as France, Belgium and Poland, called for measures to boost the bloc\u2019s long-term resilience to public health crises and backed proposals for shared research and development of vaccines and treatment.</li> \n   <li><strong>The epidemic in Mexico is advancing toward its peak level of infections, the World Health Organization warned.</strong> Mexico, where total confirmed cases exceed 120,000 and the death toll stands at about 14,000, began a gradual re-opening of the economy at the start of June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pakistan should implement intermittent lockdowns to counter a surge in infections, the World Health Organization advised</strong>. The increase has come as the country was loosening restrictions.</li> \n   <li><strong>Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas will be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June. </strong>Boris Johnson will make the official announcement on Wednesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>There have been </strong><strong>sharp rises in reports of violence against women across Latin America</strong>, already a hotspot for gender-based violence, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Rescue Committee has said. Meghan Lopez, the IRC\u2019s regional director for Latin America, said some women and girls were stuck with perpetrators 24 hours a day.</li> \n   <li><strong>The world faces a food crisis worse than any seen for at least 50 years, the UN has warned</strong>. Social protections for poor people are urgently needed as the looming recession following the Covid-19 pandemic may put basic nutrition out of reach.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>A supreme court judge in Brazil has ordered Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s administration to resume publishing complete Covid-19 statistics</strong>. His government sparked outrage on Saturday by purging the health ministry website of data on to pandemic and announcing it would stop publishing the death toll or number of infections.</li> \n   <li><strong>Nearly one in five people in Iran may have been infected with coronavirus since the country\u2019s outbreak</strong>, a health official said. This meant the virus was \u201cmuch less lethal than we or the world had anticipated\u201d, said Ehsan Mostafavi, a member of the taskforce set up to combat Covid-19.</li> \n   <li><strong>Face masks will remain compulsory in all public spaces even after Spain\u2019s Covid-19 state of emergency ends on 22 June.</strong> \u201cThe message is one of prudence and caution,\u201d said the government spokeswoman, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero. \u201cUntil there is a vaccine or a treatment, the virus remains a threat. We can\u2019t think that the danger has gone.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Fifty-two Cuban medics who flew to Italy to help doctors treat Europe\u2019s first mass coronavirus outbreak returned home to a heroes\u2019 welcome</strong>. The medical brigade, comprising 36 doctors, 15 nurses and a logistics specialist, arrived in Milan on 22 March and were the first ever to be deployed to a European country.</li> \n   <li><strong>Up to 600 deaths in Kano, northern Nigeria, most within a single week in April, were caused by an undetected outbreak of Covid-19, officials said</strong>. Government investigations, which began after reports of hundreds of deaths caused alarm in Nigeria\u2019s second largest city, linked 50-60% of 979 \u201cmysterious\u201d deaths to the virus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Coronavirus may have been present and spreading in Wuhan as early as August last year</strong>, according to a study that analysed satellite imagery of car parks outside major hospitals and search engine data.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>",
  "<p>Britain\u2019s housing market remains depressed despite a pick-up in enquiries from people looking to buy, but estate agents are expecting a sharp increase in demand for homes with gardens over the next two years because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/12/housing-market-in-england-to-reopen-for-socially-distanced-property-viewings\">estate agents </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/12/housing-market-in-england-to-reopen-for-socially-distanced-property-viewings\">being allowed to reopen in England</a> on 13 May following an eight-week shutdown, sales and house prices continued to fall across the UK in May, according to a monthly survey of surveyors and estate agents from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics).</p> <p>A balance of 35% estate agents said newly-agreed sales were down. The balance deducts the number of agents who said sales rose from those who said sales fell.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/13/opening-of-english-housing-market-catches-estate-agents-on-hop-coronavirus\">housing market in England started to get going</a> again, enquiries from new buyers picked up markedly but remained in negative territory. A balance of 5% of estate agents reported lower enquiries in May, compared with a record number of 94% in April.</p> <p>Near-term sales expectations were flat in May, while the majority of agents are now expecting slightly higher sales over the next 12 months.</p> <p>Michael Darwin, a chartered surveyor in Northallerton, in North Yorkshire, said: \u201cThe last three months are the strangest I have known in 39 years. There are enquiries, but can people obtain finance to buy, whose jobs are safe and how long will the danger of Covid continue? If anyone has answers they are keeping very quiet.\u201d</p> <p>The Rics measure of house prices moved deeper into negative territory. A balance of 32% of estate agents reported lower prices compared with 22% in April, marking the weakest figure since 2010. Even looking 12 months ahead, a balance of 16% of agents are expecting prices to fall.</p> <p>This echoes surveys from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/02/uk-house-prices-fall-coronavirus-nationwide\">mortgage lenders Nationwide</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jun/05/uk-house-prices-fall-for-third-month-in-a-row-as-covid-19-stifles-market-halifax\">Halifax that showed house prices fell further</a> last month.</p> <p>Rics said there were no major changes in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales where restrictions on estate agents were not removed in May.</p> <p>The vast majority of surveyors and estate agents (81%) say homes with gardens or balconies will be in demand over the next two years, along with houses near green spaces, and 68% reckon that properties with greater private and less communal space will become more desirable. Tower blocks and properties in crowded urban areas are expected to be less in demand.</p> <p>Simon Rubinsohn,&nbsp;Rics&nbsp;chief economist, said: \u201cFollowing the reopening of the housing market in England, pre-Covid sales that were in the pipeline are now largely going through. This is&nbsp;encouraging but it remains to be seen how sustained this improvement will prove.</p> <p>\u201cMuch will inevitably depend on the macro environment and, in particular, the resilience of the jobs market as the furlough scheme unwinds. For the time being respondents to the survey see the trend in transactions being broadly flat.\u201d</p>",

Rio Tinto had received ministerial consent under WA legislation to destroy the nearby Juukan Gorge in 2013, but the approval for BHP\u2019s $4.5bn South Flank expansion by the Western Australian minister for Aboriginal affairs, Ben Wyatt, came just days after the explosion of the Juukan Gorge garnered global headlines.</p> \n<p><strong>The European Union has accused China of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/eu-says-china-behind-huge-wave-covid-19-disinformation-campaign\">orchestrating a \u201chuge wave\u201d of disinformation</a></strong><strong> about coronavirus. </strong>Commission vice president, V\u0115ra Jourov\u00e1, told reporters the EU should not \u201cshy away from naming and shaming\u201d, listing China alongside Russia in creating and spreading \u201ca surge in narratives undermining our democracies and in effect our response to the crisis\u201d.

But none of the three men said anything to suggest that the Ferguson assessment might be wrong. On Sunday, when another epidemiologist, <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, made a very similar claim on the Andrew Marr show, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked out right if he agreed <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062001.pdf\">and he said no. </a>Johnson may have decided that the claim is too plausible to dismiss outright. <strong>Whitty</strong> stressed that, at the time when decisions about the lockdown were being taken, they had \u201cvery limited information about this virus\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/support-bubble-plan-lets-single-parents-in-england-combine-households\">Johnson announced that around 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d in England.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the coronavirus pandemic had \u201ca long way to go\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are lots of things, lots of data, things that we still don\u2019t know, and this epidemic has a long way to go, alas.

So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have reduced the final death toll by at least a half.</p> \n   <p>Whilst I think the measures, given what we knew about this virus then, in terms of its transmission and its lethality, were warranted, I\u2019m second guessing at this point, certainly had we introduced them earlier we would have seen many fewer deaths. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69889190-90d6-40f1-a768-cffabc2d8ce4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SKNpCBBuVws?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ferguson said he also agreed with <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, another epidemic modelling specialist, based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropic Medicine. Edmunds sits on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (as Ferguson did, until he had to resign in May), and on Sunday Ferguson <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062003.pdf\">told the Marr Show: </a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We should have gone into lockdown earlier. I think it would have been hard to do it, and I think the data that we were dealing with in the early part of March, and our current situational awareness was really quite poor. And so I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point, but I wish we had. I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives unfortunately.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>After Edmunds made this claim on Sunday ministers hit back hard, and it is not hard to see why. The UK government introduced a full lockdown after most other European countries (see the chart below, from <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-30-COVID19-Report-13.pdf\">this paper)</a> and it has been claimed that this was, at least in part, because Johnson had a strong, libertarian aversion to measures of this kind.

And then there are other days when it struggles hard to get much beyond the \u2018so what\u2019 territory. Today was closer to the latter category. Despite all talk of unease on the Tory benches (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7#block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7\">10.17am)</a>, not a peep emerged. The Black Lives Matters protests did come up, but only in a relatively perfunctory manner. And the Boris Johnson/Keir Starmer exchanges - normally the highlight - were inconclusive. Neither was particularly good.</p> \n  <p>Starmer seems to view PMQs as a war of attrition; he shows no interest in flash, \u2018knockout blow\u2019 moments, preferring a steady stream that portray the opposition as measured and sensible, and Johnson as negligent. Mostly this has worked well, but it did not particularly today. He devoted his first two questions to asking why measures in reports weren\u2019t being implemented. But they are, claimed Johnson. This may be wishful thinking, but it was not contested by Starmer, and a viewer without prior knowledge may have been left wondering if Johnson had a point.</p> \n  <p>Starmer\u2019s best question was his third, about the death numbers. He was calm and factual, and his question - \u201cthere\u2019s no pride in these numbers, is there?\u201d - was unanswerable. Johnson\u2019s response was particularly poor. If No 10 really thinks it will be able to hold off addressing this issue for the rest of the year just by claiming it\u2019s too early to make international comparisons, it is likely to be disappointed.</p> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s best moments came when Starmer asked about schools, and Johnson was able to accuse Labour of inconsistency - arguing for continued closures earlier, complaining about continued closures now. This is not wholly fair - Labour\u2019s argument is that a more consensual approach was needed to facilitate school opening - but defending a nuanced position is never straightforward, and by the standards of political sloganising rather than high-grade logic, Johnson\u2019s charge was true enough to stick. It was also interesting to see him use Starmer\u2019s profession against him. Generally commentators have taken the view the Starmer\u2019s lawyerly precision (we are not allowed call him \u201cforensic\u201d any more, the clich\u00e9 police have ruled) is a bonus, but Johnson now seems to running the line that, because Starmer is a barrister, he will just say whatever is convenient to his case.</p> \n  <p>Johnson actually had an announcement to make: a \u00a363m welfare programme for schools. But the way he raised it, it was hard to tell whether or not this was anything new. If this was supposed to give him good ammunition to use against Starmer, it did not work out.</p> \n  <p>The best question of the day was probably Kirsty Blackman\u2019s. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663#block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663\"> 12.28pm.) </a>But even that did not generate a memorable answer.

Tory MPs believe cutting the 2-metre rule down to 1 meter is absolutely at the heart of the wider opening of the economy \u2026 One very senior Tory MP said to me: \u2018Our leadership is pitiful. Boris Johnson needs to be honest. Opening up the economy brings risks.

  "<p>MPs are demanding the government holds a review of the national curriculum led by black and ethnic minority leaders and historians to better reflect black history.</p> <p>The cross-party group of more than 30 politicians has written jointly to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to ask for a re-evaluation of the history syllabus in light of the global Black Lives Matter protests over the killing of George Floyd.</p> <p>Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson and a former teacher, said:&nbsp; \u201cWe all have a duty to make sure the next generation, at least, has a better understanding of the historical injustices contributing to institutional racism that persists in the UK and elsewhere today.</p> <p>\u201cAs a former teacher, I know first-hand the value of education as a tool to empower young people to make change happen. That\u2019s why we need to include a more diverse range of historical perspectives in our curriculum and examinations.\u201d</p> <p>The letter, signed by the Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley, Labour\u2019s former shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and former frontbencher Clive Lewis, members of the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas, said there should be a more balanced reading of Britain\u2019s colonial and imperial past, and its legacy of abuse and exploitation.</p> <p>More recent history, such as the treatment of the Windrush generation should also be included, they suggested, as well as the positive contribution black people and people of all ethnicities have made to Britain.</p> <p>The British empire and its slave trade is not a statutory part of the curriculum, although many schools choose to teach it. Black History Month takes place in the UK in October with resources available for schools.</p> <p>The MPs\u2019 call for a curriculum review follows campaigning by Labour under Jeremy Corbyn to create an emancipation educational trust that would deliver school programmes and focus on African civilisation before colonisation.</p> <p>The civil rights campaigner Paul Stephenson, who who led the Bristol bus boycott in 1963, was suggested as someone all pupils could study.</p> <p>The organisation The Black Curriculum is also collecting signatures for an open letter to be sent to Williamson on making black history compulsory in primary and secondary schools and requesting a face-to-face meeting with him. It would like a response from the minister before Windrush Day on 22 June, which was observed for the first time in 2018.</p> <p>The letter, led by Moran in parliament, comes as Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the curriculum must be improved to break down barriers to defeating racism.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe must improve the curriculum so that students learn about how Britain was founded on global histories.

The economic plan is to advance into other global markets and \u201cindustries of the future\u201d where regulatory standards will be set in London, not Brussels. In that vision, the EU is supposed to decline and watch Britain\u2019s newfound dynamism with envy, or to thrive in some convenient way that involves buying British exports and not competing with British industries. It is a fantasy that cannot survive prolonged exposure to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/uk-economy-likely-to-suffer-worst-covid-19-damage-says-oecd\" title=\"\">cold economic winds</a> blowing in behind the pandemic.</p> <p>The EU is not overly intimidated by Eurosceptic threats to collapse talks, since the harm that would inflict is greater on the British side. But there is concern about the longer-term consequences of Britain injuring itself in that way, sacrificing its own economy on an altar of national pride, and the incentives that generates to shift blame on to foreign neighbours and burn old alliances. The prospect of a disastrous Brexit sending the UK on to a rogue trajectory through the next decade is discussed in Paris and Berlin, even if in Westminster few want to engage much beyond next week.</p> <p>Only a few months remain if a deal is to be signed and ratified before the end of the year. There are too many variables to predict any outcome with confidence. A recession might focus minds on compromise or provoke Tories into a scorched-earth approach to old trading ties. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\" title=\"\">US presidential election</a> in November will change global power balances whichever way it swings. The current danger is that Britain is working its way through this uncertainty hand to mouth, chasing a fairytale of global renaissance while ignoring inconvenient evidence. Our negotiating partners can see the delusion, but their leverage is limited. It is not too late for Mr Johnson to arrive at a more realistic appraisal of his options, but he must first lift his eyes to a strategic horizon, and there is not much sign that he is even capable of focusing that far ahead.</p>",

  "<p>The medley of jubilant black, brown and white faces cheering the destruction of Edward Colston\u2019s statue has had many rethinking. Discussing even. Britain, a nation not keen on making much of a fuss, is having to talk about slavery. For too long we would rather have dunked our digestives into mugs of tea and not bothered with dredging up our past. But what if we had all learned at school that <a href=\"https://www.futurity.org/tea-british-empire-1536862-2/\">the history of our great British brew</a> is inseparable from our history of empire? While Brits have been embracing lockdown baking, how many will know our national sweet tooth is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/13/lifeandhealth.britishidentity\">the direct result of slave labour on Caribbean sugar cane fields</a>?</p> <p>At this moment, remaining ignorant about such history looks increasingly indefensible. Overnight, it has become a moral imperative to learn both the good and bad of British history. Meanwhile support for organisations that have long been working on \u201cdecolonising the curriculum\u201d has skyrocketed since the killing of George Floyd.</p> <p><a href=\"http://decolonisethecurriculum.com/\">Pran Patel</a>, a consultant on decolonising the curriculum for schools in the UK and beyond, says that over the past two weeks the interest in his work from headteachers has been \u201ccrazy\u201d. For Patel, decolonising the curriculum means exposing kids to the richness of knowledge from what he calls the \u2018\u201cglobal curriculum\u201d. Denying children a wider range of subjects and perspectives does them a disservice. So too does a lack of consideration for how material is taught and who is teaching it.</p> <p>\u201cOur curriculum leaves&nbsp;some of us feeling inferior and others, through no fault of their own, superior,\u201d says Patel. \u201cNobody wins in that scenario. When we teach literature, we should be teaching Dickens but we should also be talking about Tagore. When we teach poetry, we should absolutely be teaching Shakespeare and his sonnets but also Rumi.\u201d</p> <p>Signs declaring \u201cWhite silence is violence\u201d on our streets and social media feeds have forced thousands to act. According to Penny Rabiger, an ex-teacher and member of the <a href=\"http://www.bameednetwork.com/about-us/\">Black and Minority Ethnic Educators Network</a>, this \u201chuge collective white guilt\u201d has led to an enormous volume of traffic to the network\u2019s website. A lot of white educators are logging on and asking how they can bring more diversity into their classrooms. How, too, they want to know, do they start having conversations about race and racial inequality with young people?&nbsp;Rabiger hits a cautious note, though, when she says: \u201cWhite guilt is dangerous. It\u2019s a start but it\u2019s not going to \u2018fix\u2019 racism\u2019.\u201d White educators must, she says, continually ask themselves how racial inequality comes to exist and in what ways they perpetuate it.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We saw the same euphoria after the Mark Duggan shooting but once the anger dies down, the energy to participate dies too</p> <footer> <cite>Brother Nia Imara</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I first speak to Lavinya Stennett, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/\">The Black Curriculum</a>, it is lunchtime but she has only minutes to spare. She is in back-to-back meetings till 6pm. Has she noticed an increase of support over the past two weeks? She gives a tired laugh. In the week before Floyd\u2019s death, her website, which details the implicit racial bias of the curriculum, received nearly 1,500 visits. Last week, the figure jumped to 133,000. On Monday, the social enterprise had 1,500 Twitter followers; three days later, that number had ballooned to 80,000.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thousands of teachers and parents are logging on to download its teaching resources.

This is why, in its latest report, The Black Curriculum is demanding that the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, makes black histories mandatory in the national curriculum. Those deluging them with requests clearly agree.</p> <p>For Stennet, the increased exposure is \u201cbittersweet\u201d. She is grateful for the support but is also exhausted.

In the past two weeks, students have come forward offering to volunteer, donations have risen and parents have been in touch to seek advice about setting up their own schools.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the world-weariness of someone who has seen it all before, Imara says: \u201cNABSS received this same euphoria after the 2011 uprising following the Mark Duggan shooting, but, unfortunately, once the anger dies down, the energy to participate in solutions dies down with it.\u201d He hopes that \u201cthis time is different, and people can sustain their urge to make a difference\u201d.

  "<p>Driving into Nottingham a few years ago, I remember seeing posters for new \u201clocal\u201d radio shows hosted by Myleene Klass&nbsp;and the tall one from JLS. It was a strange scene that has likely been replicated across the country, where once genuinely local output is replaced by a celebrity presenter sitting in a central London studio.</p> <p>In recent years, the idiosyncrasies and charm of regional shows have quietly been replaced by a cheaper, identikit radio. In 2019,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/26/scores-of-uk-radio-stations-to-lose-local-programmes\">Global Radio&nbsp;replaced</a> the 40-plus local breakfast shows across its Capital, Smooth and Heart networks with just three nationwide programmes hosted from London.&nbsp;The formula was simple enough: replace&nbsp;local hosts&nbsp;with big names based in the capital and beam one blanket service out to the regions.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/27/local-radio-regional-stations-england-bauer-rebranding-national-network\">Dozens of local radio stations to vanish across England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now the commercial group Bauer has announced plans to fold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/27/local-radio-regional-stations-england-bauer-rebranding-national-network?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">almost 50 regional radio outlets</a> into a national network.&nbsp;It means dozens more&nbsp;towns and cities across England will lose their own distinctive local radio stations later this year, with&nbsp;stations such as York\u2019s Minster FM and the West Midlands\u2019 Signal 107 being replaced with&nbsp;largely syndicated programmes made in London, hundreds of miles from the communities they serve.&nbsp;</p> <p>It has also recently emerged that the BBC is considering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/29/bbc-set-to-cut-regional-news-despite-high-audience-figures\">axing its regional current affairs</a> television shows.&nbsp;The award-winning Inside Out series of investigative programmes&nbsp;has already had its autumn series cancelled \u2013 and budget cuts mean&nbsp;bosses have launched a review of all regional programming in England.&nbsp;MPs, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/local-bbc-news-vital-role-must-be-kept-jacob-rees-mogg?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">criticised the move</a>&nbsp;but offered no promise of a reprieve.&nbsp;</p> <p>If this is the end of regional output, it is going out with a whimper.&nbsp;The death of local radio in the UK has been a quiet type of decline.&nbsp;While the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/29/local-newspapers-closing-down-communities-withering\">closure of local newspapers</a> in recent years has rightly gained at least some attention, the morphing of regional radio into a centralised London hub has happened with little fuss.</p> <p>The world can seem like it\u2019s moved on from local broadcasting. Local radio or regional reporting can bring up less than favourable references to Alan Partridge, and the cost-cutting of commercial vehicles can easily be written off as a sad but inevitable sign of the times.<strong> </strong>Britons increasingly listen to the radio via DAB radio and smart speakers; we are more used to Amazon Echo now than FM radio.&nbsp;Like so much of the media, there is dwindling revenue in radio and ever growing competition as podcasts and playlists become the norm. Meanwhile, the 24/7 global news cycle is available on our phones at the press of a button.</p> <p>But there is still demand for regional programming, and considerable value to it.&nbsp;Radio generally&nbsp;has <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/25/radio-coronavirus-connected\">come into its own</a> during the coronavirus pandemic, providing structure and togetherness for listeners, and even&nbsp;company for those who are alone.&nbsp;Local stations have been particularly well suited for this, bringing a sense of community through the airwaves. In recent weeks, my local BBC station\u2019s Saturday night show has had its presenter broadcasting from his kitchen table. Listeners are familiar enough to text in with niche local jokes, like signing off as \u201cLincolnshire Mountain Rescue\u201d (in a notoriously flat county); the host can refer to nearby bands and music venues in a way no national hub can.&nbsp;</p> <p>Local broadcasting is also a rare and vital vehicle for the media outside the south.&nbsp;The BBC regional current affairs television shows&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/29/bbc-set-to-cut-regional-news-despite-high-audience-figures\">now under threat</a> have&nbsp;been a training ground over the years for many journalists based outside London. My first television job, on Sunday Politics East Midlands, was on my local BBC service. With no contacts at the bigger stations and being unfamiliar with the capital, local news was an invaluable way to get a foot in the door. Taking away one of the few platforms available outside the capital will only enshrine the hold of a southern, non-disabled, white, middle-class media.&nbsp;</p> <p>In an ever busier and more&nbsp;disconnected&nbsp;culture, there is something unique and personal about local media output. Hearing a regional accent on the airwaves, you are transported to&nbsp;your own corner of the world, rooted in the people and places that are meaningful to you. It is a sense of identity, a voice that would otherwise be drowned out. As we look afresh at what it means to be home, local broadcasting suddenly feels all the more needed. We will surely miss it when it\u2019s gone.</p> <p>\u2022 Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",

  "<p>After university, I signed up for Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s management trainee scheme. When I was pregnant with my first child, I went to see a nurse. I said to her: \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a nurse, you&nbsp;know.\u201d She said: \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why you can\u2019t be.\u201d </p> <p>I started my training&nbsp;in 1983 at the Royal London hospital when my son was six months old. My sister had applied to do nursing at that same hospital a year before me \u2013 she was the first black nurse at the hospital. When she went for her interview, they tried to persuade her to train as a state-enrolled nurse, which is a lower grade than a registered general nurse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes patients would say: \u2018I don\u2019t want to have any black hands on me.\u2019 That was fairly common in the 1980s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She told me: \u201cWatch out, they\u2019ll try to push you into a lower grade.\u201d She was right. In my interview they started saying it would be better for me to be a state-enrolled nurse. I said: \u201cNo thank you, not with my qualifications, and if you don\u2019t want me I\u2019ve got an interview at Bart\u2019s down the road.\u201d That was my first experience of racism in the NHS.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sometimes patients would say: \u201cI don\u2019t want to have any black hands on me.\u201d That was fairly common in the 1980s. It was obvious that some people didn\u2019t expect me to progress. They would be surprised that I had such a good education, as if black people couldn\u2019t go to university.&nbsp;But there were also people who were white and saw the talent I had. They created opportunities for me to flourish. </p> <p>When I took on the role of chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing in 2018 (to which I was permanently appointed in April 2019), I became the UK\u2019s second black female trade union leader. As a black leader, you are always aware that if you are not a good role model, someone coming up behind you may not be afforded the same opportunity you\u2019ve been given. There are, sadly, too few of us. We only have 10 black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) chief nurses across the whole of the NHS in England. The leadership of the NHS is not reflective of the workforce, or the communities we serve.&nbsp;</p> <p>There are huge structural issues at work when it comes to how BAME communities access healthcare in the UK. When you look at the outcomes for BAME patients, they\u2019re worse in almost every category, from heart disease to diabetes. In every community we work with, BAME patients suffer the most.&nbsp;</p> <p>When you rock up to your GP as a BAME person, your illness isn\u2019t taken as seriously. Sometimes it takes five or six visits before you get into the system. Every step of the way, from services to treatment, some BAME patients have a worse experience of the NHS than their white counterparts.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I\u2019m in the street, people don\u2019t see me as the head of the Royal College of Nursing; they see me as a black woman</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Coronavirus has exposed the underlying healthcare inequalities experienced by BAME communities.

Every death is a tragedy. We need to understand how we can prevent this happening in the future. Do we need to give BAME healthcare workers better personal protective equipment? Should we redeploy them away from the frontline, in case there is a second wave of the pandemic? How are we risk-assessing our staff, to ensure that we aren\u2019t putting healthcare workers with underlying conditions at unnecessary risk?</p> <p>When I\u2019m in the street, people don\u2019t see me as the head of the Royal College of Nursing; they see me as a black woman.

  "<p>Ah yes, statues: the only subject powerful enough to wrestle the news focus away from the pandemic, the oscillating UK infection rates, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/i-cherished-barnard-castle-as-a-hidden-gem-before-dominic-cummings-ruined-it\">Dominic Cummings road trip movie</a>, the global Black Lives Matter movement and the looming prospect of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/no-10-must-regain-publics-trust-to-avoid-second-wave-scientists-warn\">second coronavirus wave</a>.</p> <p>As the statue of the slaver Edward Colston was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">toppled into the harbour in Bristol</a>, a sort of statue-shaped bat signal went out to Britain\u2019s patriots, a special pheromone that somehow can only be picked up by those blokes who are always in the audience on Question Time: Our Statues Need Saving. Now the patriots are going in to bat for mediocre town centre statues that would otherwise collect hot, white streaks of bird shit. You\u2019re right, they are the real heroes of the hour.&nbsp;</p> <p>In case Statue Discourse has passed you by, a refresher: over a weekend of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/07/just-the-beginning-voices-from-the-black-lives-matter-protest-in-london-video\">nationwide BLM protests</a>, two whole statues were treated badly. I know, I know. The first was Bristol\u2019s much-petitioned-about Edward Colston statue, which, after years of prevarication, was toppled into the waters where his <a href=\"http://www.discoveringbristol.org.uk/slavery/routes/bristol-to-africa/shipping/bristols-slave-ships/\">slave ships</a> used to dock. The second, the Churchill statue in Parliament Square, was amended with a squiggle of spray paint that read \u201cwas a racist\u201d, and was quickly licked clean again the next morning by an army of Conservative MPs. (Hard to know who cleaned the Churchill statue, to be fair: I\u2019ve seen at least three photos of people who say they got up early to clean it, out of Respect, but only one photo of a hi-vis-wearing council worker with an actual wet sponge and some soap. So maybe there is some false valour being claimed here.) Either way, we are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/south-africa-toppling-statues-racist-cecil-rhodes-cape-town\">talking about statues</a> \u2013&nbsp;both for, and against \u2013 more than at any time in history since maybe the peak of Ancient Greece.&nbsp;</p> <p>The pro-statue crowd have gone for the familiar line that tearing down statues is \u201cerasing our history\u201d, as if history books cease to exist the second a statue goes splish \u2013 and as if celebrating brutal slavers is in any way good or honourable anyway (we really have to start teaching British history in schools). In defence of this, a subsection of the populace has emerged, a brave heroic army of defenders, whom I am loosely calling \u201c<a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/04/what-is-simping-and-what-is-a-simp-12001620/\">Statue Simps</a>\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>As statue demolition gained traction, clots of lads started standing outside war memorials with their arms folded. They <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GMElement3/status/1269623778667003904\">started in Plymouth</a>, where a group of 35 stood menacingly outside a memorial so robust a bomb couldn\u2019t topple it, then moved on to Bristol, where <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/group-men-try-edward-colstons-4209811\">topless men in wet socks</a> gamely attempted to prize Colston out of the abyss with nothing more than a big pole. Various groups of \u201cmen who communicate only via Facebook Messenger\u201d were moved on from loitering around the Churchill statue over the weekend, and have been keeping a roving guard there ever since.</p> <p>But we\u2019ve got a taste for destroying statues now, and no matter how many caffeine shampoo ultras stand in the way of them, more will come down. As Colston was getting his first swimming lesson, Belgium was busy defacing a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandrasternlicht/2020/06/09/belgium-removes-burnt-out-statue-of-colonial-king-leopold-ii-as-statue-takedown-goes-global/#11459c3b46af\">statue of King Leopold II</a>, who oversaw an unimaginably brutal regime in Congo that led to the death of millions \u2013&nbsp;his Antwerp statue was taken down for public safety this week. On Tuesday, Sadiq Khan unveiled a new commission to review the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-unveils-commission-to-review-diversity\">diversity of London landmarks</a>, and 11 hours later a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jun/09/statue-of-18th-century-slave-owner-robert-milligan-taken-down-in-london-video\">statue of Robert Milligan</a> was being removed from West India Quay.</p> <p>BritBox, iPlayer and Netflix have done their own statue-toppling this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/09/little-britain-removed-from-bbc-iplayer-netflix-and-britbox-blackface\">removing Little Britain</a> \u2013 a series we should also, as a warning, teach in schools \u2013 from their services, though as yet no gangs of lads have started a rousing chant of \u201cYEAH BUT NO BUT\u201d in the faces of the woke militia. One rule for centuries-old statues of slavers left without question to stand firm in Bristol\u2019s streets, another rule for the only comedy we were legally allowed to watch in 2003.</p> <p>I\u2019m still trying to get my head around the idea of responding to widespread protests calling for human dignity and fairer policing with \u201cyeah but what about our statues, though\u201d; the idea that in the midst of all of this, the inanimate objects that most weekends get urinated on by town drunks are somehow more important and worthy than social justice and human life. But then I suppose we are living in 2020 \u2013 and it is naive of me to be surprised by anything any more.</p> <p>Tommy Robinson is fuming, obviously: on Sunday, he released a video in which he raged necklessly on his sofa, shouting of the Colston statue: \u201cWho gives a shit what it\u2019s about and what the man\u2019s done? It\u2019s part of British history.\u201d </p> <p>He\u2019s right: it is part of British history. So we should learn about and confront that, rather than let it stand, memorialised and unbothered, in our various town centres. If you impulsively care about protecting our dark history so much, you\u2019re probably on the wrong side of it. As of this weekend, Britain has two fewer heads to try to throw traffic cones on top of. That\u2019s about the net loss of this entire escapade.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant</p>",
  "<p>The killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd by a white police officer</a> took place thousands of miles from the UK. But the 46-year-old\u2019s cry in Minnesota that he could not breathe has sparked widespread protest in Britain. In the past two weeks, there have been demonstrations across UK cities. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 25, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d. The demonstrations were largely organised through word of mouth and social media rather than established anti-racism groups.</p> <p>Protesters carried handmade placards with the names of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/05/mark-duggan-shooting-report-challenged-by-human-rights-groups\">Mark Duggan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/sean-rigg-five-officers-cleared-of-misconduct-over-death-in-custody\">Sean Rigg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/22/julian-cole-police-officers-face-dismissal-over-incident-in-which-student-was-paralysed\">Julian Cole</a> and others killed or left disabled by British police. They chanted for the Windrush generation, the victims of the Grenfell tower fire, and decried the high <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\">Covid-19 death rate among members of the BAME</a> community. </p> <p>The Guardian asked the two women who organised the protest as well as other organisers and demonstrators what has driven them to this momentous time in the UK\u2019s history of race relations about the moment that made them want to protest. Black lives matter in the streets and in police custody \u2013 but also, they said, in schools, hospitals and workplaces. Six of the protesters in London explained why they were there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4abcf47e75eefb93c7e53721c6fe86338829af1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4abcf47e75eefb93c7e53721c6fe86338829af1/0_58_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"John, 24, mechanic\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>John, 24 </strong></h2> <h2>Car mechanic</h2> <p>I became politicised at a really young age, probably when I was four. I was leaving a shop and security stopped me and my mum. The woman pulled out a scanner and started scanning me from head to toe. My mum gave her an earful, but that\u2019s when I realised that I looked different, that I was a target. They automatically assumed that I\u2019d stolen something when I hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>It was an important point in my life. It\u2019s the same issue trying to get a job. Even with mechanic shops all around London, it\u2019s harder for black people to get picked for a job in some of these places. The mechanic would rather take the white boy and not give me a shot. Enough is enough. My children aren\u2019t going to go through similar racist experiences. If I\u2019ve got to be out here every single day, I will be. </p> <p>Police brutality is a strong issue here in the UK too. During the coronavirus pandemic, police started coming round my area and black boys like me were getting stopped. Their excuses are we look like we\u2019re trying to steal something. They are stopping me in front of the building I live in, putting me in cuffs, embarrassing me in front of everyone. You\u2019re putting your hands on my parts for what? Just to feel power that you can abuse? These things need to stop. There are so many young black people here, outside the American embassy, because we all feel it. </p> <p>There has never been a time when I\u2019ve felt I can call the police: they\u2019re more likely to suspect me than actually help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36d22907cfa0bb3e60f0b1ad1eab2f1c12c5d3da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36d22907cfa0bb3e60f0b1ad1eab2f1c12c5d3da/0_1034_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chioma Atuanya, 22\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chioma Atuanya, 22</strong></h2> <h2>Former recruitment consultant</h2> <p>I realised there was institutional racism in the UK when I was 15. My dad lives in Nigeria and he said he knew someone who had died of Ebola. Everyone at school was making jokes, whereas I was worried for my father\u2019s safety. I told people that it wasn\u2019t cool and that they had to stop because what if I made a joke about cancer? </p> <p>Everyone started kicking off. Someone made a racist comment towards me and my mum got called into school. Not because of what they said, but because of what I said. They said I needed to stop talking about controversial subjects at school or I would be excluded. It was probably the first time I had a proper conversation about racism with my mum. I thought the teachers would be more understanding, but nothing happened.</p> <p>Since then, I realised it\u2019s a lot bigger than I first thought. George Floyd isn\u2019t the first man to die at the hands of racism, but there is such a hype right now, we need to jump on it. These are innocent people who are not sick and they are dying anyway. People are just taking lives here. </p> <p>The presence of social media has blown up the issue. There is a large black community online sharing everything, and it has brought it to everyone\u2019s attention. There is no shadow of a doubt what\u2019s happening and now everyone is wising up to previous things when excuses were made. Everyone is seeing it\u2019s all just smoke.</p> <h2><strong>Aima, 18</strong></h2> <h2>Student and co-organiser of the London Black Lives Matter group LDN BLM</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f0b9ffa430a12df92fc1572f9a05a38bb1b542f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f0b9ffa430a12df92fc1572f9a05a38bb1b542f/0_560_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Aima\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve grown up with so many videos of police brutality; videos from the US, UK and all over the world.

It\u2019s been 10 years of watching people die online that has driven me to being so angry and wanting my voice to be heard.</p> <p>When I moved to the UK from Nigeria in 2012, I saw so much that I have never seen before. Seeing and hearing my friends talk about stop and searches has really affected me. There was a lot of racism in school; other students calling me the N-word, calling me a monkey. I\u2019m here today because I stand in solidarity with all my US brothers and sisters. Enough is enough; black people cannot keep suffering.</p> <p>Racism doesn\u2019t just happen in the US; it also happens here and that\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting. We need to realise that so many people have been harassed and assaulted by the British police. I\u2019m tired because systematic racism within the police system has been going on for years. Just because it\u2019s not talked about much doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening. We want people to be educated and to hear us. That is the main thing \u2013 hear our voices.

I think they all had a \u201cthis could be me\u201d or \u201cthis could happen to someone I know\u201d moment. This is a sign of real change and people want things to be different.</p> <p>I\u2019m here to call for justice for Grenfell. There are residents who still don\u2019t have housing. It was a tragedy. We want change and we want our voices to be heard. I cannot believe that in 2020, and even though we are facing a global pandemic, we still have to come out and protest for our civil rights and for our lives.</p> <p>You can\u2019t tell the oppressed how to feel.

We aren\u2019t all that dissimilar to America. It\u2019s ignorant to think there isn\u2019t racism in the UK. There is racism here, there is racism practically everywhere, even in Africa, where nearly everyone is black. You have to educate yourself; look around you and look online.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure there are plenty of places that can tell you just how racist the system is. For me, racism in the UK was people in school making fun of your accent, people in restaurants wondering why you\u2019re not speaking English, people telling me they can\u2019t pronounce my name and asking whether I\u2019d prefer to be called John or Jack. It\u2019s wondering why they can\u2019t spell my last name, yet they can easily pronounce names like Schwarzenegger.</p> <h2><strong>Ruth Ngombo, 24</strong></h2> <h2>Student nurse</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af8e1d4a749dadb9da7b574227632ee9e51efbb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af8e1d4a749dadb9da7b574227632ee9e51efbb8/0_1120_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Ngombo\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It started when I was in secondary school. I came in for my first day, feeling great. My mum did my hair in little bobbles and plaits. The head of year seven, who was a white woman, shouted at me within moments of me entering the school. She said that my hair was not acceptable. She told me to remove it all. I was 11. I went to the toilet and cried. I wondered what I was supposed to do. The teacher would rather I looked like a fool and had my hair out than how it was. I just didn\u2019t agree with that. </p> <p>From that moment, it kind of shifted everything else for me. White teachers would say things like, \u201cYou\u2019re acting a bit ghetto,\u201d and I would think how is this allowed? I\u2019m here today for black women. We hear about what happens to black men in cases of police brutality, but it\u2019s black women that we don\u2019t really hear that much about. And, unfortunately, with black women who have been killed due to racism, nothing really happens.</p> <p>I felt like I needed to say something because it could be me. It could be any black woman and nobody would know our names. Black men, it\u2019s also your job to help take care and protect our black women. We are the ones who are going to provide the future.</p>",

It will need support and understanding, particularly when it ventures out in public once more. The first year of performing with fewer musicians to a much smaller public will be our toughest time, and we will need a helping hand to make it through.\u201d</p> <p>The government has set up a cultural renewal taskforce to help plot a way back for the the UK\u2019s recreation and leisure industries and there has been criticism that no representatives from music are on the taskforce. Ministers argue music is well represented on the important workgroups set up to develop guidance for reopening.</p> <p>Rattle and Elder point to the experience in mainland Europe where orchestras are gradually opening up and finding ways to deal with physical distancing.</p> <p>They write: \u201cIn the UK we must gain time by learning what has already been proved to work, rather than starting from the beginning yet again, with people not from the performing arts making the decisions. Until we have some practical idea of what our future might entail, musicians in our country will continue to feel out in the wilderness.\u201d</p> <p>Arts leaders in the UK warn that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/15/uk-theatres-in-high-jeopardy-as-doors-remain-closed-amid-pandemic\">the position for performing arts companies is perilous</a>. About 70% of theatres say they will run out of money this year. Horace Trubridge, the general secretary of the Musicians\u2019 Union, this week told MPs: \u201cWe could very easily lose half the music venues we\u2019ve got in the UK during this crisis unless there isn\u2019t more permanent support for them.\u201d</p> <p>The West End producer Sonia Friedman&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/21/british-theatre-on-brink-of-collapse-sonia-friedman-west-end-london\">has said</a>&nbsp;the performing arts face \u201cthe real possibility of complete obliteration\u201d without substantial government support, while the director&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/05/sam-mendes-calls-on-netflix-and-amazon-to-share-covid-19-windfall-with-theatre\">Sam Mendes said</a>&nbsp;\u201can ecosystem this intricate and evolved cannot be rebuilt from scratch\u201d.</p> <p>Industry leaders say they are not after a bailout, but investment which will prevent parts of Britain\u2019s world leading arts sector going bust just at the moment it is most needed.</p> <p>The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said this week that he was involved in \u201cintricate discussions\u201d with the Treasury and suggested a deal was almost done. \u201cI am not going to stand by and see our world-leading position in arts and culture destroyed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I want to get the money flowing, I am not going to let anyone down.\u201d</p> <h2>The Rattle/Elder letter</h2> <p>There are so many pressing problems to solve in the UK that it takes courage even to mention the desperate situation of classical music in the time of Covid-19.</p> <p>There\u2019s a real possibility of a devastated landscape on the other side of this; orchestras may not survive, and if they do, they may face insuperable obstacles to remain solvent in our new reality. What we write applies, of course, to all types of music, not just classical music which is our area of expertise. Our music is essentially a live experience and requires all the participants, performers and listeners alike, to be in the same room together. What we may do individually over the internet in these months is all well and good, but the living core of our work is a live communion, a sharing of&nbsp;space, art and emotion which is both vital and healing.</p> <p>This healing will become ever more necessary&nbsp;in the coming time as we attempt to bear witness and understand what we have all gone through. In such an existential crisis, the realisation of our shared vulnerability&nbsp;will surely change and deepen our relationship to all the arts. In our own field we are asking ourselves; how can we get back to live music? How can we give our audiences the courage to gradually return?</p> <p>More immediately, how can we maintain musical continuity when orchestras are silenced? And how do we nurture a generation of young musicians whose prospects look bleak just as they embark on a career in this ever more uncertain world?</p> <p>The recent extension of the furlough scheme is a blessing and enables many organisations to hang on. For freelance musicians, which include four of the London orchestras among others, huge problems remain. Currently many freelancers fall between the cracks of the government\u2019s self-employment schemes. We need to find a way to sustain some kind of backbone of income so that we will eventually be able to play whenever that will be possible. At the most basic level, despite all appearances to the contrary, musicians are humans. They need to eat and pay their bills. But we also need to play together and train, just like any sports team, albeit in a totally new environment. Crucially, this musical team is part of a complex structure that is focussed around, and serves, its home town or city.</p> <p>We will have to reinvent the wheel in so many ways. Learning to play while remaining distanced from each other will be much harder than it may initially seem.</p> <p>Our venues will have to learn to shepherd audiences in and out of performances in safety, and accept that at maximum only 25% capacity will be allowed, with all the economic knock on effects that this reality implies. We MUST find a way to play together soon, even without an audience, if we are to maintain anything like our normal standards, and we badly need clarity from government, a timeline, of when that might be and how it can be implemented. We understand that we cannot expect to revert to everything as it was before;&nbsp;we will be creative and tireless in making contingency plans and solving problems.</p> <p>All musicians of whatever genre share the magnificent problem of an art form which is, fundamentally, songs transmitted to people in a room. When will our audiences have the chance to experience this once more?</p> <p>We refuse to believe that live music will die, but it will not survive merely on energy and optimism. It will need support and understanding, particularly when it ventures out in public once more. The first year of performing with fewer musicians to a much smaller public will be our toughest time, and we will need a helping hand to make it through.</p> <p>In Mainland Europe orchestras are gradually opening up and finding different ways to deal with the problems of distancing. Good practice is being built up: in the UK we must gain time by learning what has already been proved to work, rather than starting from the beginning yet again, with people not from the performing arts making the decisions.

  "<p>French police are hunting the killer of a brown bear in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es after the government said it would bring legal action against the culprit.</p> <p>\u00c9lisabeth Borne, the ecology minister, described the shooting of the animal, a protected species, as \u201cillegal and deeply regrettable\u201d.

France adopted a 10-year \u201cbear plan\u201d in 2018 to reintroduce more of the animals, but environmentalists claim the government suspended the measure after lobbying from farmers; last year, locals said bears killed 1,173 sheep and destroyed 36 bee hives.</p> <p>To encourage \u201ccoexistence\u201d between farmers and bears, the French government offers funding for training guard dogs, installing fences to protect herds and the hiring of extra shepherds to keep an eye on flocks. Farmers say the mountain terrain means the measures are ineffective because the sheep spread out over a wide area, making them difficult to follow and vulnerable to attack.

  "<p>The killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, with protests around the world capturing the anger at the death of yet another black person at the hands of the police, as well as the racial inequalities it exposed. After seeing the traumatic footage of Floyd\u2019s final moments, many people are asking what they can do to bring about change. With racism so deeply rooted in our social order, there can be no quick fixes \u2013 but here are 20 steps you can take.</p> <h2>Organise&nbsp;</h2> <p>When&nbsp;the civil rights leader Kwame Ture (formerly Stokely Carmichael) visited Birmingham in 1983, his message was clear: \u201cIf you are not in an organisation, then you are against your people.\u201d In other words, racism can only be addressed collectively; we can\u2019t afford to stand on the sidelines making excuses.</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Join one of the many organisations campaigning to change the system or to improve the conditions faced by minorities. There are always reasons to be sceptical: the people in them; the funding; the time commitment. But rather than criticise, if you agree with the organisation\u2019s goals, get involved and make it work.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://uffcampaign.org/\">United Families &amp; Friends</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.4frontproject.org/\">4Front</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ubele.org/\">Ubele</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.blackunity.org.uk/\">Organisation of Black Unity</a>&nbsp;are some suggestions; there&nbsp;are <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/black-lives-matter-charity-donate-uk-stephen-lawrence-stop-hate-a9544786.html\">many more</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2</strong> If you are not able to join an organisation, create one. Start small, with a reading group, a community library or a campaign about a local issue.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Organise globally. This is not an American or British problem. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/brazil-black-lives-police-teenager\">The police killing of 14-year-old&nbsp;Jo\u00e3o Pedro Matos Pinto&nbsp;in Brazil</a> is a reminder of the global stakes.

History teaches us that it is only when those in power have something to lose that change occurs. Strikes work because they cost your employer; boycotts because they deprive companies of revenue; and civil disobedience because it shuts down institutions. Urban rebellions were key in securing civil rights in the US in the 60s and the limited police reforms in the UK in the 80s. Clear demands coupled with disruptive campaigns converge the interests of those in power with the interests of the oppressed.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Support an organisation financially. Organising is not for everyone and certain struggles are black-led by design. But all groups need financial support. Remember that freedom is not free \u2013 if we want change, we have to put our money where our mouths are.</p> <h2>Make your vote count&nbsp;</h2> <p>Malcolm X warned that the \u201cfox\u201d who poses as your friend as he oppresses you is just as deadly&nbsp;as the \u201cwolf\u201d who is more open about his violent racism. Trump is wolf-in-chief in the White House, but watch out for those foxes.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Think about who you vote for. Maya Angelou said: \u201cWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them.\u201d Look at the records of the party you want to vote for: how have they treated immigrants; what laws have they passed around equal rights and race relations?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3470aa3aaed002d9aabf753b62fc9903517584ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3470aa3aaed002d9aabf753b62fc9903517584ad/0_42_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A vigil in remembrance of black women and girls killed by US police, New York, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s not just about the men: a vigil in remembrance of black women and girls killed by US police, New York, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Knox/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>7</strong> Write to your MP. You can write to your elected representative even if you did not vote for them. You could start by supporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2020/may/16/pm-faces-calls-for-independent-inquiry-into-bame-covid-19-deaths\">an&nbsp;independent inquiry into minority deaths&nbsp;from Covid-19</a> or an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-maangamizi-we-charge-genocide-ecocide\">all-party inquiry into reparations</a>. But feel free to write about any issue, whether action on police brutality, education equality or any other area of racial injustice.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Make work fairer</h2> <p>We have all seen businesses and institutions issue statements of horror at recent events. But expressing outrage is one thing; dealing with a lack of diversity or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/07/bias-in-britain-what-can-employers-the-government-and-you-do-about-it\">bias in the workplace</a> is quite another. Employment is key to a fairer world, because lack of access to jobs and career progression compounds economic inequalities.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Call out unjust hiring practices. If you work in, or use the services of, an organisation that seems only to hire white people, say something. Next time you are in a team meeting and it is entirely white, remember that this is a problem you can be part of solving. Promotions are also important. The NHS, for example, has a diverse workforce, but, as a report on its <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/edc7-0514.pdf\">\u201csnowy white peaks\u201d</a>&nbsp;noted, representation declines the higher up the organisation you go.&nbsp;Universities are so white that there are no black vice-chancellors in the UK and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/27/fewer-than-1-of-uk-university-professors-are-black-figures-show\">only 140 black professors out of 21,000</a>.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> Find out your workplace\u2019s policies for dealing with racial harassment. If you have no idea how to report racism in your workplace, you are not alone. People often feel intimidated about raising complaints and unsupported in doing so. You can challenge this by writing to companies and institutions to provide clarity or explain the lack of any such policies.</p> <p><strong>10</strong> Drop the term BAME. There are a multitude of&nbsp;experiences of racism, making the catch-all term black, Asian and minority ethnic unhelpful when dealing with racism. Instead try to understand how racism towards different minority groups is expressed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/09/black-people-racism-anti-blackness-discrimination-minorities\">the distinctive features of anti-black racism</a> that are so central to understanding what is happening today.

This is just the tip of the iceberg; dive into <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/02/top-10-books-about-black-radicalism\">an alternative&nbsp;radical vision of&nbsp;history</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>12</strong> Think intersectionally. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/30/sayhername-why-kimberle-crenshaw-is-fighting-for-forgotten-women\">Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw</a> coined the term as a way to truly understand how different parts of our identities can overlap and compound discrimination. For instance, the killing of George Floyd has sparked protests in a way that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/breonna-taylor-louisville-protest-george-floyd\">the death of Breonna Taylor</a> in March did not. We have gendered how we understand police killings, which is why the campaign to highlight police brutality and anti-black violence against women,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aapf.org/shn-campaign\">#SayHerName</a>, was so important. One of the reasons we focus on violence against men is that it is so public. Taylor was killed in her home; the oppression of women often happens in private.</p> <p><strong>13</strong> Write to your local school about its curriculum. If you are a parent, you have the responsibility and power to challenge your school on what it is teaching the children. Make sure black history goes beyond the token display in October.&nbsp;Support campaigns to transform the school curriculum, such as <a href=\"https://www.theblackcurriculum.com/action\">the Black Curriculum</a>.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> If you are a student, demand reforms at your university. Universities produce the knowledge dispensed in schools. It is student movements that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/30/students-want-their-curriculums-decolonised-are-universities-listening\">pushed the sector into trying to \u201cdecolonise\u201d the curriculum</a>. As a consumer, you can demand a different curriculum and new hiring practices. Also, consider a course that challenges the Eurocentric curriculum: for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/black-studies-ba-hons-2020-21\">black </a><a href=\"https://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/black-studies-ba-hons-2020-21\">studies</a> at Birmingham City and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-black-british-history/\">black British </a><a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-black-british-history/\">history</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-black-british-writing/\">black British writing</a> at Goldsmiths, University of London.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>15 </strong>Build alternatives. We do not have to accept the confines of the school system. In the UK, there is a 60-year history of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nabss.org.uk/\">black supplementary schools</a>, where people volunteered to teach what the schools would not. This point goes hand in hand with organisation and ensuring that, if we believe something is important, we do it regardless.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"386b8ceee081fb73bff233b83fc310fd442ca8c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/386b8ceee081fb73bff233b83fc310fd442ca8c5/129_894_4176_2506/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters in Louisville, Kentucky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Question privilege: protesters in Louisville, Kentucky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darron Cummings/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Personal</h2> <p>No individual can solve the deeply embedded issue of racism. But personal change must be part of beginning to address it, particularly because the daily paper cuts of casual racism are so painful for those who experience them.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>16</strong> Listen. If you know black people, they will likely have told you lot of times about their experiences \u2013 but did you really listen? We are not playing the race card, nor do we have chips on our shoulders. It should not take a video of a man being killed and thousands of people in the street for you to pay attention.</p> <p><strong>17</strong> Take responsibility for tackling racism where you see it. This could be in personal interactions, the workplace or on the bus. People tend to act in ways they can get away with. Calling out racist behaviour can make life more bearable for others.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>18</strong> It is better to stay out of it than to dip your toe in. Shallow, tokenistic commitment is worse than silence. If you are interested in racism only when it is trending, keep your solidarity to yourself.</p> <p><strong>19</strong> Check your privilege. Recognising white privilege has become a major focus in building a fairer society, but we also need to recognise the privilege of living in the west. We can watch the killing of George Floyd only because of smartphones, which are so cheap only because they are made using resources stolen from Africa. Racism can be deadly in the west, but it is a daily matter of life and death in developing world, where <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22935692\">a child dies every 10 seconds because of poverty</a>. We cannot limit our imagination to solving the problems of inclusion into a system that oppresses worldwide.</p> <p><strong>20</strong> Stay positive. We have been conditioned into believing that there is no alternative, that we have reached the end of history. That is white supremacist PR that cannot see beyond its own experience. It is time to radically rethink society to make it value black life. History tells us that the oppressed won\u2019t wait for ever. It is time to get on the bus or get out of the way.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>Before the coronavirus crisis, Britain already had a longstanding challenge on social mobility. Ours is a country where background and circumstance shape a person\u2019s life instead of talent, hard work and potential. For too long Britain has functioned on connections over competence.</p> <p>But coronavirus and its economic impact is now making that opportunity gap significantly wider. <a href=\"https://www.socialmobilitypledge.org/news-and-blog/study-reveals-areas-facing-double-hit-in-opportunities-after-covid-19?rq=Corby\">Research</a> by the Social Mobility Pledge has identified emerging opportunity gaps in communities across the country where people are being left behind. The analysis shows places such as Corby, Wellingborough and Norwich are all facing an economic double hit from existing poor social mobility made worse by the impact of the economic crisis of coronavirus.</p> <p>It\u2019s now urgent that ministers set out their strategy for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/the-guardian-view-on-levelling-up-easy-to-say-hard-to-do\">levelling up</a>\u201d our country, in the government\u2019s own words, including helping these communities hit hardest by the economic impact of coronavirus.&nbsp;Boris Johnson\u2019s government risks presiding over a levelled-down Britain.</p> <p>The prime minister was right to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/levelling-up-let-tories-off-hook-conservative-policies\">levelling up</a> a key objective for his government. Yet nearly a year after coming into office last July, ministers have still not set out a comprehensive strategy on how the government proposes to achieve it \u2013 even as it becomes more crucial. Levelling up must be a strategy that cuts across government and is the foundation stone that all other policy must sit on. Weak social mobility is a systemic problem for Britain, so every department will need to set out its own part of this strategy. Unless action is joined up across government, it will fail, and it needs the sort of ambition that has not been seen previously. Levelling up is about far more thana roads and rail programme and a pothole fund.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/the-guardian-view-on-levelling-up-easy-to-say-hard-to-do\">The Guardian view on levelling up: easy to say, hard to do | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the meantime, the risk of going backwards is obvious. There is a lack of any overarching longer-term plan beyond the summer to deal with the economic fallout of coronavirus \u2013 whether in education and careers for young people, or retraining for those who will lose their jobs.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s also clear that some communities facing the worst job losses will need more targeted action to support them over the coming months and years. Again, there is little sign of this from ministers.</p> <p>There are lessons to be learnt from other recessions too. In the 1980s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/07/britain-recessions-history\">recession</a>, my father lost his job in the steel industry but was offered retraining as a welder \u2013 even as welders were also being made redundant. Poor advice and poor retraining meant he was unemployed for over a year. We should not repeat those mistakes but, as things stand today, there is no plan of the breadth and scale that will be needed to help newly unemployed people transition into new green jobs such as those in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage\">carbon capture and storage</a>.</p> <p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said he would do \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">whatever it takes</a>\u201d to help businesses and households get through the coronavirus health crisis. Now he must do whatever it takes to support these children, young people and communities to level up.</p> <p>Yet the reports of road building, VAT or stamp duty relief and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/25/gdp-contracting-slower-than-thought-recession\">cash for clunkers</a>\u201d car schemes are just the same old Treasury proposals that were made to the incoming Treasury team I was part of in 2010. I know, I saw them come across my desk. A decade on, new ideas and solutions are needed. It\u2019s as if Treasury officials have just searched back in old files and then presented them to a new set of ministers.</p> <p>A budget initially mooted for mid-July has now been downgraded to some announcements on spending. If a full budget is now not planned until the autumn, that could be too late for millions of people affected by the economic fallout of coronavirus.&nbsp;</p> <p>Boris Johnson must bring some more immediate vision to where he takes our country as we emerge from the health crisis \u2013 now could be the moment for him to set out how we reskill Britain to deliver a green economy. It could be the opportunity for the government to support a wholesale shift on homeworking to allow unwanted office space to convert to the extra housing that many families and young people so badly need. Much smaller class sizes, with the right teaching and investment, could be the chance for our hard-pressed education system to finally fulfil its promise of being the great leveller for less advantaged children. But without decisive action and ambition, this moment will pass him by.</p> <p>The public don\u2019t want piecemeal initiatives and empty rhetoric from ministers. Instead they need clear-cut, long-term plans.</p> <p>Last summer, I urged Johnson\u2019s incoming government to set an emergency budget for social mobility and levelling up. I believed it was vital \u2013 but that opportunity was missed.&nbsp;Nearly a year later, as the weeks pass by, and with coronavirus still in our midst, for young people and left-behind communities, it\u2019s more important than ever.

  "<p>As traumatised&nbsp;US&nbsp;farmers continue to cull their animals in response to the slaughterhouse crisis, an Iowan&nbsp;pig producer&nbsp;has developed an on-farm method which he believes is quicker and more humane than other available options.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has hit US meat plants particularly hard. As a result there is a lack of slaughter capacity, and farmers are being forced to cull or \u201cdepopulate\u201d their animals on-farm.&nbsp;</p> <p>Approved methods include gassing with CO2, but the practice is controversial. \u201cDying this&nbsp;way is not a peaceful experience\u201d, even under normal circumstances, let alone in&nbsp;makeshift sheds or trailers, said&nbsp;president of welfare group,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/\">Mercy for Animals</a>,&nbsp;Leah Garc\u00e9s.</p> <p>Gassing the animals is currently thought to be one of the fastest and most humane methods,&nbsp;leaving&nbsp;animals unconscious within two minutes and dead within 10. The carcasses are incinerated, composted or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nara.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rendering_ingredients_pigs.pdf\">rendered</a>&nbsp;for fat, fertiliser and pet food.</p> <p>But for Dwight Mogler of Iowa\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pighillfarms.com/about\">Pig Hill Farms</a>,&nbsp;that is too long.&nbsp;Mogler is a sixth-generation pig farmer with firsthand experience of gassing newborn pigs. \u201cI have talked to people who have been on site for a CO2 depopulation and we have used it for neonatal [new-born] pigs.&nbsp;It can take up to a minute,\u201d&nbsp;he said.</p> <p>Mogler, who produces about 150,000 pigs a year, says he is fairly confident the gassing is not painful for&nbsp;newborns, but it is disturbing. \u201cThere are muscle spasms and the limbs flail, but no vocalising,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Another depopulation option is overheating, or hyperthermia, commonly known as ventilator shutdown (VSD). A recent undercover video of an alleged VSD pig cull at a different Iowa producer contained disturbing scenes and sounds.</p> <p>Asked about the video,&nbsp;Mogler said it would have involved turning off the ventilation, turning up the temperature and then the introduction of steam. \u201cIt would take less than one hour and any remaining pigs would be shot with bolt guns. It might only take 10 minutes in fact for the pigs to die. But for us that is too long.\u201d</p> <p>Having rejected CO2 and&nbsp;VSD,&nbsp;Mogler decided to build his own cull&nbsp;facility. It&nbsp;will replicate a slaughterhouse death time of less than two seconds.&nbsp;Ready to undergo testing,&nbsp;Mogler\u2019s system consists of a mobile unit with a V-restrainer, an electrical stunning point and a captive-bolt gun. </p> <p>Mogler aims to slaughter about 170 pigs every 45 minutes, using a rotating slaughter crew to avoid mental or physical fatigue. \u201cOur capacity would be about 1,500 to 2,000 pigs a day,\u201d he said, and no pig caretakers will be involved in the slaughter.</p> <p>As well as developing his own cull technique, Mogler donated two pigs to a Missouri&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.farmaste.org/\">sanctuary</a>.&nbsp;Initially reluctant, because the goals of a sanctuary are so at odds with those of a farmer, Mogler changed his mind after talking to a rescue coordinator.&nbsp;\u201c I found we had so much more in common [than expected]\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Donating pigs to food programmes is another option for farmers, particularly with so many Americans facing increased financial and food insecurity, but slaughtering remains&nbsp;a challenge. For a few there is still space at local lockers, as Iowa\u2019s smaller, state-inspected butchers are known. Most, however, are already overwhelmed,&nbsp;with some fully booked into 2021.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/28/animal-feedlots-are-a-likely-threat-to-drinking-water-in-minnesota-says-report\">Animal feedlots are a likely threat to drinking water in Minnesota, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite donation difficulties, psychologist and Iowan farmer Dr Michael Rosmann thinks it\u2019s worth the effort. \u201cIt helps the farmers a bit, to know they have tried to find a solution for at least some of their pigs,\u201d Rosmann said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably only going to help with about 1% of their animals.&nbsp;These are farmers with anywhere from 3,000 to 10,000 pigs.&nbsp;It\u2019s a very complex situation and it is not going to end soon.\u201d</p> <p>Farmers are extremely distressed by the possibility of having to depopulate their animals, said Rosmann, who has talked to several in the past few weeks. \u201cOne of them was in tears. He could not bring himself to kill his pigs and he was asking for advice,\u201d Rosmann said. \u201cMy suggestion was to find food programmes or local butchers, or people who are able to butcher the animals themselves \u2013&nbsp;that\u2019s allowed by law, if you kill it and eat it yourself.\u201d Sadly, he said, many of those able to slaughter their own animals might be illegal migrants and afraid to come forward.</p> <p>At industry level, <a href=\"https://www.iowapork.org/producer-resources/resources-and-information/covid-19/\">Iowa&nbsp;Pork Producers Association</a> spokesperson, Dal Grooms, said its newly&nbsp;created food-bank donation programme, Pass the Pork, has seen 48,404lb of pork, about 456 pigs, enter the food chain via local lockers.&nbsp;</p>",

And it\u2019s and there\u2019s a continuing pattern.</p> <p>There\u2019s a systemic pattern here which I appeal to the government, and this new system that the ministers believe is going to find the answers to it, this federation reform council, that this group of people actually look at the systemic approaches that take place where First Nations people are likely to come to the attention of police.</p> <p>We know that First Nations people who come to the attention of the police are likely to be arrested and charged. </p> <p>We know that First Nations people who come to the attention of the police will be charged but will also be sent to court. And when they go to court, what happens, they\u2019ll be sent to jail. Now this is a pattern. This is a paradigm, that systematic, it\u2019s systemic, it\u2019s institutionalised. </p> <p>And if you look at this, from a First Nations point of view, this is about the subjugation of the First Nations people. </p> <p>This is not about enlightened policy. This is about subjugating the First Nations people, you correlate that to the number of people who are being taken away, the number of kids, there will be 30,000 kids in their home care. </p> <p>And you\u2019ll come up with a \u2018it\u2019s going to take time. It\u2019s complicated. And you know, it\u2019s really difficult.\u2019</p> <p>Well, it\u2019s not. Address the underlying issues \u2013 health, housing, education, employment \u2013 and work with First Nations peoples through the Coag system, or through the new system of the reform council, whatever it is, to actually set some targets as senator Wong has said, around the scenes for incarceration rates, and for the diminishment of removing kids from custody, or being removed from their homes and put into custody of another family, which ultimately will lead to the adoption out of these kids. </p> <p>And I\u2019ll remind the government that the Bring Them Home report re-analyse the policies and practices that pertain to that, practices as heinous practices, bordered on genocide, bordered on genocide. </p> <p>So I agree, I asked you sincerely to make this a priority, a top priority for too long \u2013 nice words, good intentions, but the lack of action and commitment has not seen a reduction of deaths in custody. </p> <p>It\u2019s seen an escalation in the social indicators that diminish First Nations people and diminish us as a nation because we are incapable of dealing with it. </p> <p>So I ask the government to sincerely put the best intentions into its commitments, and enter in a real working commitment with the First Nations peoples, and get real agreements with the states, and stop pussyfooting around with the states, say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the state\u2019s responsibility\u2019. </p> <p>Well, we know this.

As I said before, racism has no place in Australia, and we condemn it and call it out wherever we can.</p> <p>And the type of division that we\u2019ve seen in the US has been distressing and the fact that you have circumstances where black communities feel that they cannot live in an environment of safety \u2013 the fact that equally you now have circumstances where police, most of whom in the United States would still be good, law-abiding citizens, feel that they are being vilified, is creating a terrible circumstance there and I hope the US can find a way to come together and more successfully address these issues, and I don\u2019t want to see that sort of division brought at all into the Australian political debate.</p> <p>... Well, look, as I say, I\u2019m not surprised, but I am saddened and disappointed. I wouldn\u2019t engage in that type of vilification. His record can speak for itself, but equally, more importantly now, as we look to the future, the acts surrounding his death, I think, speak to an injustice that needs to be addressed in terms of that incident by the US legal system, but more broadly, an injustice that, as we\u2019ve seen, tragically in the US, the rates of deaths around Covid-19 have been disproportionately borne in communities \u2013 often black American communities. </p> <p>Thankfully in Australia, we have a much fairer system, a universal healthcare system, we are able to tackle many of these issues \u2013 not to the point of perfection. The job is never done in terms of stamping out racism, or driving towards creating the best environment for equality and opportunity for individuals. </p> <p>We have to be ever-vigilant and keep working there. But I think we have been saying that our system, in all of those areas, holds up amongst the best in the world, and much better than some of the challenging circumstances we\u2019ve seen in the US.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T06:49:47.451Z\">at 7.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee07ea38f08beee219d88db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-hurst\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T06:33:32.208Z\">7.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Australian year 12 students will receive their final results in the second half of December.</p> <p>A meeting of education ministers from across the country has decided the release of individual Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (Atar) results, for students completing year 12 in 2020, would occur \u201cwithin a nationally consistent window of 15 December to 31 December 2020\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement issued this afternoon, the group \u2013 known as the Education Council \u2013 said it recognised the challenges being year 12 students and their families were experiencing as the pandemic had disrupted their final year of schooling.</p> <p>It also \u201cacknowledged the seriousness of these concerns and agreed that year 12 students and their families must be supported and have reliable information to pursue their post-school pathways\u201d.</p> <p>A working group \u2013 which includes Universities Australia, the Australasian Curriculum, Assessment and Certification Authorities, and the Australasian Conference of Tertiary Admissions Centres \u2013 had advised students who wish to enter university in 2021 to \u201cwork hard and complete the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education\u201d.</p> <p>The Education Council also decided on a nationally consistent set of messages for all year 12 students to avoid any misunderstandings or confusion about the admissions processes for 2021. </p> <p>These key messages include:</p> <ul> <li>Current year 12 students will be able to complete a Senior Secondary Certificate of Education (SSCE) this year.

The member for Rankin in phrasing that question in that way has demonstrated, I think, a great deal of immaturity.</p> <p>The introduction of the jobkeeper program, the single largest form of social support this country has ever seen, in the most uncertain economic environment anyone could possibly imagine of our generation ... and Mr Speaker ... and rolled out in considerably rapid time and as we have achieved a level of economic outcome well in advance of what we had expected to achieve by this time. </p> <p>And having announced the fact that we would look carefully at the implementation when we announced the jobkeeper program before announcing any revisions that might be necessary, Mr Speaker. These are not things that can be done, Mr Speaker, in a rushed or ill-considered manner.</p> <p>The review is being undertaken in June. The review will make recommendations, I would imagine, to the government, as would be its purpose, and then the government would consider those recommendations. It would consider the fiscal implications of those recommendations and, Mr Speaker, it would take advice on that as cabinet\u2019s work. </p> <p>Now, I appreciate the member who asked the question has never served in a cabinet, Mr Speaker, let alone an expenditure review committee or had any sort of ministerial responsibility for working through such decisions of great importance.</p> <p>But he might be educated on this point. That when you make decisions of this gravity and this seriousness, Mr Speaker, in a situation like this, you are very careful about it.</p> <p>So as the government announced, we will make the decisions on the basis of the view that\u2019s been submitted by Treasury and that will be done in the third week or thereabouts of July, as is our anticipated timeframe, to provide that further economic statement that will take into account the review that is being done of the jobkeeper program. </p> <p>Now, that is the proper, responsible way to manage important financial decisions.

  "<p>Dr Johanna Price hasn\u2019t looked back since joining the urgent care home treatment service in west Kent five years ago. \u201cI said I\u2019d give it a year but I\u2019m still here,\u201d she says. Her colleague Dr Amy Heskett feels the same: \u201cI joined when it was a pilot then became a bit addicted to it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>So what is the enduring appeal for these two specialist doctors who work with advanced clinical practitioners and healthcare assistants to deliver this innovative service run by Kent Community Health NHS foundation trust?</p> <p>Community trusts will often have \u201chospital at home\u201d services designed to provide extra support to patients discharged from hospital who have gone back to live at home. But in Kent the urgent care home treatment service has a completely different focus.</p> <p>The priority of the multiprofessional team, led by a consultant geriatrician, is to prevent people living at home from being admitted to hospital in the first place \u2013 especially those who are older and frail, with long-term conditions.&nbsp;</p> <p>A community associate specialist doctor \u2013 or in some cases an advanced clinical practitioner such as an experienced nurse or paramedic with postgraduate training \u2013 supported by an advanced healthcare assistant will visit patients in their own homes.&nbsp;</p> <p>The team carries advanced medical equipment that would usually only be available in hospitals, such as intravenous drips, oxygen supplies and specialist diagnostic handheld machines, which can give on-the-spot results. The trust has two teams \u2013 one in west and another in east Kent.&nbsp;The teams take referrals from GPs, the ambulance service and the network of community hospitals. In west Kent the average number is 170 to 180 a month.</p> <p>\u201cWe sit somewhere between hospital and the GP,\u201d says Heskett. \u201cWe have good relations with local practices and patients will often flip between the two.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e58a77feb855daa5193ab53dd6ba4316f54e5825\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e58a77feb855daa5193ab53dd6ba4316f54e5825/0_337_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Johanna Price, left, and a healthcare assistant make a home visit\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Price, left, and a healthcare assistant make a home visit</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Price, who spends about an hour with each patient, says seeing people in their own home has huge advantages. \u201cPatients feel much more comfortable in their home environment \u2013 you can have easier conversations. They are happy to talk about what matters to them,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cYou can see their knick-knacks, and find out about the patients \u2013 what makes them tick. You aren\u2019t just focusing on the numbers and how many patients are on your list for that day.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Heskett agrees: \u201cIf you are considering an operation or medication, for example, you can decide whether it suits the patient\u2019s way of life or their priorities at that time. It\u2019s a much more satisfying experience from both sides.</p> <p>\u201cI think in a more clinical setting you don\u2019t pick up on these implications. In an emergency situation it\u2019s obviously right to be in a clinical environment but when people are managing long-term conditions which affect their lives for many years and their family, that decision-making process becomes more complex.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr George Noble, geriatrician and consultant lead for the team in west Kent says this way of working has created new patient pathways for older patients.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe offer a greater level of support, more than a GP would typically offer and they don\u2019t have the resources behind them that we have,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now with point-of-care testing, what was previously done in a lab can be done in a little box in the patient\u2019s home.\u201d</p> <p>According to Noble, the team\u2019s advanced clinical practitioners enjoy more autonomy than they would usually experience in a hospital environment. \u201cThey have more freedom with us and are able to practise more independently,\u201d he says. \u201cI also think in our team the medical and social problems they face are more diverse and it\u2019s a question of how do you manage that?\u201d</p> <p>Clinicians also have the opportunity to work more creatively. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a developing specialty you have the chance to bring about change,\u201d says Heskett. \u201cYou have the freedom to bring in new processes, so for somebody who loves to see results and to stick with something, it\u2019s a fantastic career move.\u201d</p> <p>Working for one of the largest community trusts in England \u2013 which is ranked \u201coutstanding\u201d by the Care Quality Commission \u2013 is another plus for those doctors or advanced clinical practitioners attracted to this innovative practice model.</p> <p>But living in the \u201cgarden of England\u201d, as the county is often called, is an additional pull. An hour\u2019s train ride to London, with cheaper house prices than the capital and a good network of schools, Kent is also an ideal place for family living.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe balance for me is a good one,\u201d says Price. \u201cI\u2019ve also found a job where I can really enjoy spending time focusing on my patients when I am at work and equally it works with my family as well.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>And what\u2019s the appeal for Noble, who has been in west Kent for 22 years? \u201cIt\u2019s the diversity of the job,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s never the same from one day to the next \u2013 and most of what we do improves the patient experience, and happier patients make for happier doctors and nurses.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.kentcht.nhs.uk/west-kent-clinical-recruitment/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Find out more about roles in west Kent at Kent Community Health NHS foundation trust</a></em></p>",

As a kid struggling with my burgeoning queerness I grabbed on to Madonna as a drowning person would a rubber ring. Here was one of the biggest stars in the world speaking about, and directly to, a queer audience. It was an alternative education of sorts (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102370/\">Truth or Dare</a> was the first time I ever saw men kissing) and it wouldn\u2019t be hyperbole to say it saved my life. Like a Prayer pushed all the right buttons, with its blasphemous blend of the sacred and sex. Years later, in a Catholic secondary school, I handed in an essay about how the song and the furore around it (it saw Madonna\u2019s music banned from my school entirely) helped me work through feelings of guilt and confusion around my sexuality and my religion. The teacher who read it asked if I was sure I hadn\u2019t been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d. I was sure. It is also, of course, an absolutely incredible pop song and despite having heard it thousands of times now, it still gets my heart pumping. I have so many moments of joy associated with it and it still inspires mass singalongs in the east London bars I frequent these days. <strong>Philip Matusavage</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oo8QzDHimQ\">Alice Cooper</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oo8QzDHimQ\">: School\u2019s Out</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Oo8QzDHimQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2Oo8QzDHimQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In the summer of 1972 I was almost 14, seething with hormones and unfocused rebelliousness. Music was very important to me, and I adored the glam rock scene with all its outrageousness, its glitter and its tat. I was a huge fan of Marc Bolan and waited hungrily for the follow-up album to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/10/marc-bolan-t-rex-interview\">Electric Warrior</a>. But when it came, as with many eagerly awaited events, The Slider was a huge disappointment and I was young enough to believe it was the end of the world. Suffering the deep disillusionment that only a 14-year-old can feel, I sought another hero. And suddenly there he was, on Top of the Pops \u2013 a tall, skinny guy with ratty black hair, a black leotard open to the navel, a sword and a lot of black makeup. Sometimes, in the grip of some intense of emotion, it\u2019s impossible to articulate the feeling even to ourselves. Sometimes, one can chance upon a song or a poem that expresses how we feel so powerfully it becomes the personification of that emotion x 100. That\u2019s what School\u2019s Out was to me, with its barrage of drums and dirty guitar riffs and the rasping vocals of Alice himself: an embodiment of joy, anger and rebellion. \u201cWe got no class / And we got no principles / We can\u2019t even think of a word that rhymes \u2026\u201d 1972 was a long time ago; so was that girl who was mesmerised by Alice. But at various angst-filled times in my life, I\u2019ve belted out School\u2019s Out in order to vent my feelings. And I still get a glimmer of that 14-year-old. <strong>Anon</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxtfdH3-TQ4\">Desmond Dekker and the Aces</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxtfdH3-TQ4\">: Israelites</a></h2> <p>Sometimes there would be a potential situation at teenage parties when both hippies and skinheads turned up.

The standout solo artist from this period was, of course, Cliff Richard; the standout instrumental band was certainly the Shadows (and not the Tornados); and the standout act was beyond all doubt Cliff Richard and the Shadows, working in collaboration and performing together. Cliff Richard and the Shadows were featured in the films Expresso Bongo and The Young Ones, which are hugely important defining film statements about the emerging of the new pop culture that would explode with creativity during the height of the 1960s. They were followed by Summer Holiday, a film musical that is full of wonderful songs and dance routines, and that gives expression to the spirit of the innocent last days of an era that would come to an end with the establishing of the Beatles hegemony at the end of 1963. Those are days that I find myself recalling more and more as the years pass; and it is good for me to do honour to an iconic UK No 1 hit single that celebrates summer, and the sunny exuberance of youth, now that I have entered the autumn of my life! <strong>Thinkandleap1234</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLZtqLrzbfs\">Culture Club</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLZtqLrzbfs\">: Do You Really Want to Hurt Me</a></h2> <p>A torch song in reggae style?

But there\u2019s also a strength there, that makes you feel her despair will burn itself out and she\u2019ll get through this, and come out the other side better than ever. In any other singer\u2019s hands, the repeated \u201cbelieve me\u201d at the end would sound pathetic, but somehow Dusty makes them sound positive.

The music, chosen by my parents, is heavily biased to the 50s and 60s, Buddy Holly and the Beatles and Johnny Cash (who I really believed had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDktBZzQIiU\">shot a man in Reno</a>) interspersed with Tom Lehrer, Flanders and Swann and socialist Geordie folk satirist Alex Glasgow. Quite a mix. But best of all, we\u2019d listen to Lonnie Donegan. Lonnie was my dad\u2019s musical hero, and he talked about hearing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI4nRD-DRpk\">Rock Island Line</a> on the radio for the first time as a true life-changing experience, the first time pop music spoke directly to him and his generation. That particular track didn\u2019t make No 1, but Lonnie did hit the top spot for the first time with Cumberland Gap. It\u2019s simple, stripped-down music, with a propulsive rhythm and a performance of total conviction. And yet, of course, like all great pop music it\u2019s totally fake \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/05/guardianobituaries.arts\">Lonnie</a> adopted the name in homage to the great Lonnie Johnson and sang songs of the American south despite coming from east London via Glasgow. He was a serious professional jazz musician, playing with Chris Barber, but inspired tens of thousands of kids to grab a battered guitar and a washboard and form a skiffle combo. It\u2019s the punk DIY aesthetic 25 years earlier, showing that anyone can form a band and make some noise with a guitar. Some of these skiffle bands were awful, a few were brilliant, and many musicians who came to prominence later on first learned to play in such a combo. Cumberland Gap remains an astonishing two minutes of fast and exciting pop music, but also has a place in history as skiffle morphed into the later British rock\u2019n\u2019roll. <strong>Nicholas Jones</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAXnqjUfal4\">Blur</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAXnqjUfal4\">: Beetlebum</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAXnqjUfal4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WAXnqjUfal4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Although it\u2019s mostly ridiculed now, at the time Britpop meant a lot to a huge number of teenagers looking to find their identity in the post-Thatcher landscape. However, by the end of 1996, the bottom had fallen out of it. When Pulp got to No 2 with Common People, it felt like a subversion of the mainstream, but when Oasis headlined Knebworth just over a year later, it felt like the opposite. As a 15-year-old at the time, I eagerly awaited the release of new Blur music, with a realisation that it was either going to lead me to turn my back on the genre altogether, or take me on a new voyage of discovery. I remember listening to the first Radio 1 play with my blank cassette ready so I could listen to it again immediately and decide whether or not I liked it. The first thing that was obvious was how different it was \u2013 how unlike a hit single it sounded with its discordant guitar and sleepy vocals. The lyrics were pretty impenetrable too (apparently about heroin?) but it soon grew on me, and as I\u2019d hoped, led me to discover a whole manner of new music from Pavement and Sonic Youth to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/from-the-archive-blog/2018/nov/09/beatles-white-album-review-november-1968\">White Album</a>. (It seems improbable now, but in the 90s, if your parents didn\u2019t own these classic albums, you had no access to them.) I still love the song. I think it\u2019s the perfect summation of what Blur are all about \u2013 a bit arty and obtuse but with an undeniable melodic core and, especially apparent in the outro, one of the best guitarists in pop music history. It changed the musical landscape too and, along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jun/24/pulp-10-of-the-best\">This is Hardcore</a>, demonstrated how empty so much of Britpop was, and meaning that by the following year, music had again moved on. <strong>Jamie Taylor</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ddz-rRI16k\">Wizzard</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ddz-rRI16k\">: Angel Fingers</a></h2> <p>You know that Goldwyn saying about a film starting with an earthquake and building up to a climax?

There\u2019s a lot of anodyne traditional pop in those early days, a lot of which is completely forgettable. This one, released in 1955 and first on top in January 1956, was the second one to really wow me (after the wonderful Rock Around the Clock) and is a departure from most No 1s at the time. It\u2019s quite dark, chronicling the monotony and futility of a coal miner as he trudges through each day. Merle Travis\u2019s lyrics have a timeless quality and still seem relevant in some professions today, with the unforgettable chorus \u201cYou load 16 tons and what do you get? / Another day older and deeper in debt\u201d. Ford\u2019s tenor voice underscores the miner\u2019s plight with a real grittiness and, honestly, sounds very cool. Perhaps not the same kind of cool as Bill Haley\u2019s Comets, but a sort of weary, wise cool. It\u2019s also worth talking about the instrumentation here \u2013&nbsp;while it\u2019s mostly minimal, with a catchy bassline underscored with finger clicks, there\u2019s also a flourish here and there from trumpets, trombone and clarinet to punctuate the mood, with the latter beginning and ending the song nicely. And to think the top-selling single of that year was Pat Boone\u2019s tepid I\u2019ll Be Home. Ugh. <strong>Will</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8OipmKFDeM\">Oasis</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8OipmKFDeM\">: Don\u2019t Look Back in Anger</a></h2> <p>I was 14 when (What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory? came out. [I was] impressionable, naive, just getting into music, and it sounded incredible. The lyrics meant nothing, but with a drink inside you and an arm round your mate, they meant everything. Like so many of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/05/noel-gallagher-i-liked-my-mum-until-she-gave-birth-to-liam\">Noel Gallagher</a>\u2019s songs, it\u2019s not one you think about. You feel it. When those big stolen piano chords start and lead into that descending melody, melancholic, celebratory, somehow defiant, universal \u2013 who can say they\u2019ve not been told by their mum \u201cTake that look from off your face\u201d? \u2013 you feel it in your stomach. This is a great song. It\u2019s a song that\u2019s meant the world to me throughout the years, the start of relationships and the end of them, but it got a new meaning in 2017. I was a journalist at Granada Reports, ITV\u2019s news programme for the north-west, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/manchester-arena-explosion\">22 people were killed</a> at Manchester Arena. I was news editor the day after the bomb, when students from Chetham\u2019s School of Music, mere yards from the arena, sang the song outside their school, with their arms round each other. Defiant. I produced the main news programme on the Thursday. That was the day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/25/dont-look-back-in-anger-becomes-symbol-of-manchester-spirit\">Lydia Bernsmeier-Rullow broke into Don\u2019t Look Back </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/25/dont-look-back-in-anger-becomes-symbol-of-manchester-spirit\">in Anger</a> in the middle of St Ann\u2019s Square, surrounded by hundreds of people silently paying their respects. Slowly, they joined in. A bloke shouted, \u201cCome on, sing up\u201d, and the crowd swelled as one: \u201cShe knows it\u2019s too late, as she\u2019s walking on by / Her soul slides away / But don\u2019t look back in anger / Don\u2019t look back in anger / I heard you say\u201d. Goosebumps then, now and forever. </p> <p>At the We Are Manchester charity gig Noel said some words that only seem to get more relevant as the world unravels around us: \u201cEvery time you sing, we win.\u201d This, for me, is the greatest No 1 ever. <strong>Paul Duckworth</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFacWGBJ_cs\">Joe Dolce</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFacWGBJ_cs\">: Shaddap You Face</a></h2> <p>My all-time favourite UK number one is Shaddap You Face by Joe Dolce. Hear me out with this. Even though I was brought up on the likes of Talking Heads, the Clash, Bowie, the Smiths and all the other post-punk, new wave and indie bands that it is achingly trendy to namedrop, I always had a soft spot for Shaddap You Face. I don\u2019t mean this in an ironic, \u201clook at me\u201d kind of way. I really like it. Yes, it\u2019s a novelty song. Yes, it is terrible. Probably. But is that such a bad thing? For me, I can\u2019t think of many other songs that can put a smile on your face as much as this one. My love for it was cemented when I moved to Italy a few years ago for work, and found the Italian people to be a mirror of the song \u2013 playful, friendly, upbeat, good fun. I have played it to many Italian people I have met, and they love it! One of them would even say to me \u201cWhatsa matter you?\u201d every time he greeted me after listening to it. Is it better than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/27/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s\">Ghost Town, Wuthering Heights, West End Girls</a>, etc? No. Does it make you smile more than those songs? Absolutely. And sometimes that is what pop music is all about. Just good, simple fun.

Like Marcel Duchamp\u2019s Fountain (a signed urinal placed in an art gallery), this may not be classic Art, but works as a piece of conceptual, situationist art. Yes, it\u2019s a mash-up, relying entirely on a cacophonous mix of samples (Dr Who theme, the Sweet\u2019s Block Buster!, Gary Glitter\u2019s Rock and Roll Part 2 \u2013 even Daleks voicing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/31/harry-enfield-and-paul-whitehouse-a-double-act-that-gets-better-with-age\">Harry Enfield\u2019s \u201cbosh bosh bosh loadsamoney</a>\u201d). Yes Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were taking the proverbial, but at the same time the song is a catchy, bizarre and joyful riot of noise. Variety is the spice of life and so it is with No 1s. You wouldn\u2019t want something like Doctorin\u2019 the Tardis to be No 1 every week, but it deserves its place. To be No 1, you have to sell more records (back in the day) than any other artist that week. The KLF (I mean, the Timelords) did it that week. They made \u201cloadsamoney\u201d, but later burned \u00a31m of it, which goes to show I don\u2019t quite know what, except that they were in it for something other than money. A No 1 pop single must be catchy and tap into the mood of the moment, but (like most things) it is also something quite disposable. <strong>Simon Briggs</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n327ncoU_ZU\">Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n327ncoU_ZU\">: Shakin\u2019 All Over</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n327ncoU_ZU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n327ncoU_ZU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Fifties chart music by British artists was either polite pop or anodyne Elvis impersonators. In August 1960, before the Beatles and the Stones, the most original rock\u2018n\u2019roll record ever produced in this country topped the charts for one week only. It was intended as a B-side and hastily written in the cramped basement of a London coffee shop among crates of Coca-Cola the night before recording, and nothing like this had been heard before by national listeners. What makes Shakin\u2019 All Over a worthy inclusion on your list? That opening electric glissando riff, drenched in echo and aided by a cigarette lighter sliding up and down the fretboard. The white-coated EMI technicians said such a sound wasn\u2019t possible as it wasn\u2019t in their manual. The loud prowling bass and vocals first proved that rock\u2018n\u2019roll singing didn\u2019t have to parrot an American. Exciting, heavy, raunchy and seedy, it\u2019s a much covered song that still occupies a special place in the core repertoire of rock\u2018n\u2019roll. Not bad for a tune apparently recorded in six minutes, less time than it took to set up the equipment. <strong>Gareth Miles</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofSnsGkops\">James Blunt</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofSnsGkops\">: You\u2019re Beautiful</a></h2> <p>2020 is such an abomination that it\u2019s almost criminal to not include the one song that would make everyone completely lose their shit and allow them to forget killer viruses and killer cops for just one pure, beautiful moment. <strong>Nathan Green</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwZNL7QVJjE\">Ben E King</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwZNL7QVJjE\">: Stand By Me</a></h2> <p>It does what the best pop always does. Says what it wants to say in the fewest possible words and then buggers off. Nor does it need a big arrangement or big production input to work. Still sounding as fresh as a daisy. What an effortless soaring melody. That bass line. It\u2019s so easy to sing along to. And everybody does, \u2018cos it gives everybody a heart and a soul, even if they didn\u2019t have either when it kicked in. You feel like you\u2019re Ben E King when you sing it, even if you sound like King Kong. Lyrically it remains universally poignant, potent and forever pertinent.

The new millennium hadn\u2019t started well. The alleged \u201cend of history\u201d had quickly been replaced by new horrible history-making: world-traumatising acts of terrorism, dubiously justified and grottily fought wars, torture (and torture porn), a seemingly worst ever (to that point) administration in the White House, apocalyptic fears of global pandemics, of stop-at-no-cost immigrants ... Crazy was the wholly logical response; the only sane way of coping. CeeLo Green sounds frantic, his voice trying to escape the gravity of the song\u2019s melancholy while the naggingly addictive spaghetti western sample reels us back in like a whirlpool with him. That their Top of the Pops appearances included an even more stately slowed down version made this event TV, an emotional affirmation of the hysteria we were all feeling and confirmation that we weren\u2019t alone in feeling it. No other No 1 but for Ghost Town better articulated its time or illuminated its darkness. Hundreds of hearings later, it still haunts me. <strong>Nick Black</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB54dZkzZOY\">Soul II Soul</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB54dZkzZOY\">: Back to Life</a></h2> <p>As the 80s were ending and the 90s were starting, there was a real feeling of optimism and good vibrations. There was definitely something in the air: yes, a lot of that was due to certain chemicals but it seemed to go much deeper. Football hooliganism started to go down. I remember in a club one night, accidentally knocking into someone and their drink spilling. In the past, this might have led to aggro, but, during this period, no problem and no fighting on the dancefloor. Different music cultures seemed to blend together. No one seemed to get that blend better than Soul II Soul. And this was happening when the cold war was ending. The good vibrations were spreading out into the world, peace was going to break out and the future was going to be so much better. When I think back to that time, and see how the world is now, I almost want to cry. Also to me at least, it seemed to be when UK soul music created its own identity, separate from the US. That is the cultural background. But it is also such a hypnotic swaying blissful piece of music. You just want to float on air when you hear it. <strong>Paul</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG9otasNmxI\">Terry Jacks</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG9otasNmxI\">: Seasons in the Sun</a></h2> <p>I was ill in bed when they played it on the radio.

The song is a poetic description of [Hendrix\u2019s] own dynamic and visceral playing, his guitar is indeed chopping down mountains and then picking up grains of sand. There are huge dynamics in every move he makes. He is too quick to be bombastic; the music veers between solo, chords and glissandi in an epic tour de force. While his guitar could do plenty of talking, his vocal prowess matches it. The casual belief in his own boasting is delivered with complete authority and an infectious enthusiasm. Whispering asides, even apologies, are made before he ascends into the next world, screaming with dramatic urgency: \u201cDon\u2019t be late.\u201d The lyrics, while suggesting he has god-like powers, also contain genuine concern, with lines from a love song worried that he will \u201ctake up all your sweet time\u201d. Still, before long he is an alien again, there is another world out there, the counterculture, and out there God knows he\u2019s a voodoo child. Just listen: his guitar tells you all you need to know. <strong>Douglas Cape</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOnYY9Mw2Fg\">The Righteous Brothers</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOnYY9Mw2Fg\">: You\u2019ve Lost That Lovin\u2019 Feeling</a></h2> <p>You\u2019ve chosen the wrong male duo for your No 1 \u2013 the Brothers not the Boys would have made more sense. For such a seminal masterpiece not even to be in the Top 100 at all is such a blinding blatant omission it beggars belief \u2013&nbsp;akin to neglecting to include Citizen Kane in a list of the hundred greatest films of all time. It means a great deal to me because at the time it was the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-25024587/the-righteous-brothers-1965-chart-battle-with-cilla-black\">battle between this American original and the British cover version</a>. They were neck and neck for the prized chart top slot and this fight was reflected in my school playground, where I gained the battle scars in my defence of this great record by these unknown artists, but it was worth it when my side won and it reached No 1. I loved this blue-eyed soul classic so much because as a young teenager it was the first time a record enveloped me in its own sound and atmosphere and moved me emotionally. Now, all these decades later it still impacts on me the same way and it stands the test of time as a perfect pop record and work of art. <strong>Gordon Roome</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNIPqafd4As\">C</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNIPqafd4As\">\u00e9line Dion</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNIPqafd4As\">: My Heart Will Go On</a></h2> <p>The reason I love it is not because I love the song above all others, far from it. But because it embodies best how music can provide Proustian flashbacks and emotions you may have long forgotten. So firstly, it reminds me of attending my first teen birthday party bash, in which it was played every 10 minutes in order to aid these ritualistic snogging fests. Under the critical gaze of more experienced 13-year-olds I nervously danced with Zoe, who told everyone I was shaking (I was not). This was then followed by an excruciatingly awkward hands-holding waltz with Katie, my first crush who \u2013 unbeknownst to me \u2013 already had a boyfriend and as it transpired was merely pawning me into some kind of mind-game jealousy between the two of them. But now when I hear that song I can look back and appreciate how ludicrous we all were and how thankful I am to have grown a more thicker, existential skin when it comes to public humility and failed desires. The song never contained an innocence or romance for me like it was perhaps intended. But it provided a valuable benchmark for me on what romance isn\u2019t. <strong>J</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86d7a5aeccc305c722d047314cc003b76bad69d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86d7a5aeccc305c722d047314cc003b76bad69d0/0_0_1524_2368/644.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Ant in 1981\" width=\"644\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Ant in 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Young/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p__WmyAE3g\">Adam and the Ants</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p__WmyAE3g\">: Prince Charming</a></h2> <p>My first crush.

So much beauty and style, the overblown video (Diana Dors, for heaven\u2019s sake!), the ridiculous dance \u2013 it was amazing and thrilling and utterly alien to everything that had gone before. It was impenetrable to grown-ups, which only increased its appeal. I didn\u2019t have a record player and my parents only listened to Radio 2. I lived for the brief snippets I could catch on Saturday morning TV or at a friend\u2019s house. Adam Ant encapsulated the glamour and excitement of the city and this record was Peak Ant.

There is no wonder it had such a tear-jerking sung response from the crowd at the 2005 Live 8 concert. Despite being around six at the time, I can genuinely remember realising the unparalleled ecstasy and feeling of togetherness that only live music can bring when watching this, albeit televised, performance. And yet, both lyrically and musically, this song has layers. It is anthemic but intimate; soothing and, at the same time, raging. The band\u2019s project is big, as they list off a never-ending list of social ills that they sentimentally believe can be solved with love \u2013 perhaps this is why it speaks so much to a childish impulse. But not only does it criticise the blatant racism and division in society, it also acknowledges the part played by those who do not \u201cpractise what they preach\u201d. To me, this sentiment feels more relevant than ever. For a generation of young people who sing this blissfully at the top of their lungs, it is not only a nostalgic reminder of childhood but a reminder of how to act now. <strong>Will Owen</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isAXzsQFthQ\">Chef</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isAXzsQFthQ\">: Chocolate Salty Balls</a></h2> <p>Puerile, offensive and perhaps Isaac Hayes\u2019s biggest hit!

It held off <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMYg_Ra4cr8\">David Bowie\u2019s The Jean Genie</a> from the top spot, a song with which it shares an almost identical riff, though both parties claimed this was coincidental. Nor do the mysteries end there, for Block Buster has inspired all manner of theories. In its opening seconds a blaring police alarm merges with the kind of scuzzy licks that REM would later channel for Monster. Brian Connolly\u2019s anxious vocal warns us about the perils of having long black hair, while in the second verse Buster\u2019s \u201ccrimes\u201d extend to womanising, or far worse. Quite why the law is in such flux over this man isn\u2019t explained, but the tension is palpable with pounding kettle drums and a mad-eyed finale like the baying of some lynch mob. Were those bellicose sirens and drums a reference to Blockbuster bombs used by the RAF in World War II? Or does the \u201cevil\u201d Buster, a predator and master of disguise, signify our fears of sexual abuse? Steve Priest\u2019s puzzled cry \u201cWe just haven\u2019t got a clue what to do\u201d soon descends into an incoherent babble, such is the chaos left by Buster. Whatever the elusive Buster did wrong, this song\u2019s message was that everyone wanted him gone, never to be heard from again. It left my 10-year-old self exhilarated by the sheer drama of its deadlocked chase. But who was I siding with back then? The perspiring cops, or this villain who offered me a window into some illicit adult world? <strong>Gareth Thompson</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiaY2GQuuzA\">JJ Barrie</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiaY2GQuuzA\">: No Charge</a></h2> <p>In the hot, hazy summer of 1976, when the tar literally melted on the roads, a kind of collective madness overtook Britain. Suddenly, bafflingly, a seemingly insatiable public appetite for mawkish country songs saw a succession of novelty one-hit wonders shoot up the charts, inevitably to be quickly followed by a dismal parody by Billy Connolly. It was into this febrile atmosphere that JJ Barrie launched this rhinestone encrusted grenade, and that June the peerlessly terrible No Charge was No 1 for one single glorious week.</p> <p>If, like me, you love a song with a story, strap yourself in. A little boy unsuspectingly approaches his parents with a list of chores he\u2019s undertaken \u2013 made his bed, taken out the rubbish, that kind of thing \u2013 and suggests that they reward him for his endeavours. True, he does seem to be pushing his luck a little (25 cents for \u201cplaying with his little brother\u201d) but this being America you might have expected them to praise his nascent entrepreneurialism. Not a bit of it. Instead, they embark on an epic musical guilt trip, outlining the expense, pain and just plain inconvenience their son has wreaked on his mother\u2019s life. Mom croons plaintively in the background while dad delivers her wounded response in a \u201cnot angry, just disappointed\u201d voice: \u201cFor the nine months I carried you, growin\u2019 inside me \u2013 no charge.\u201d \u201cFor the toys, food and clothes and even for wipin\u2019 your nose \u2013 there\u2019s no charge, son.\u201d Well, maybe not yet. But the cost of years in therapy after your parents go to the lengths of recording and releasing a novelty passive aggressive country song detailing your extreme ingratitude? Exorbitant. <strong>Sam Turner</strong></p>",
  "<p>Here is a list of the quarterbacks who have been signed across the NFL since 23 March: Jameis Winston, Joe Flacco, Geno Smith, Andy Dalton, Blaine Gabbert, David Fales, Mike Glennon and Tyler Bray.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/09/colin-kaepernick-george-floyd-roger-goodell\">Colin Kaepernick sacrificed it all for this moment. Now the work begins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is one name conspicuous in its absence: Cam Newton. The former NFL MVP was released nearly two and a half months ago and yet remains without a team. \u201cI\u2019m told from sources that his market has cooled considerably in the last month or so,\u201d ESPN\u2019s&nbsp;Jeremy Fowler&nbsp;said during a recent SportsCenter appearance. \u201cIt is believed that he spoke to the Patriots at some point early in free agency around March. Since then, nothing.\u201d</p> <p>As a collective, the NFL has seemingly given up on Newton, a player who entered the second half of the 2010s as a bona fide superstar \u2013 someone who was a unanimous top-five selection in any \u201cwhich quarterback would you start a franchise with for the next decade\u201d discussions.</p> <p>Throughout his time in the league, Newton has embodied zeal and energy, a bundle of happiness and ego with an uncompromised passion for football. Now, at just 30, he is talked of in hush tones and whispers.&nbsp;<em>He\u2019s washed up</em>.&nbsp;<em>Doesn\u2019t have it anymore</em>.&nbsp;<em>Too beat up. What a shame.&nbsp;</em>With all that has gone on inside and outside of the football world, Cam Newton\u2019s free agency is hardly at the forefront of anyone\u2019s mind. But it remains objectively bonkers that a&nbsp;former MVP less than two-years removed from high-level play is unable to find a starting job.</p> <p>A reminder: Newton turned 31 years on last month. The last time we saw him on a field fully healthy was during the first 11 weeks of the 2018 season. He was as sparkling and efficient as ever. Each of his key metrics, base and advanced, was at or above his career averages. As always, his accuracy waned (a non-stop frustration with Newton), but he more than made up for it with explosive, game-breaking plays.&nbsp;A shoulder injury&nbsp;tanked&nbsp;the second half of&nbsp;his 2018 season&nbsp;and was followed with a&nbsp;foot injury that robbed him of all but two games in the 2019 season. And like that, the Newton experience was over.</p> <p>At the peak of his powers, Newton was a singular force: A blend of size, speed and arm strength the quarterback position has never seen. He helped take the Panthers to a Super Bowl in a funky offense that was built around his own quirks: his willingness to bang between the tackles and his penchant to mistime some of dropbacks. The team dumped a number of timing passing concepts and instead built an offensive identity around what Newton did best, handing him complete command of the offense.</p> <p>It worked! For that year, Newton was as close to an unstoppable a force as anything we\u2019ve seen this side of Patrick Mahomes. Cheat down to stop the run, and Newton would launch the ball behind the defense. Load up in the passing game, and the Panthers would turn the game into a series of 1v1 matchups, only their one, Newton, was bigger, fast and stronger than anything on your side of the field.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/cam-newton-marcus-mariota-next-team\">Second time lucky: will Newton or Mariota be this year's Tannehill?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That we\u2019re even reflecting on Newton\u2019s past greatness is both fitting and odd.&nbsp;<em>Right now</em>&nbsp;should be the apex of his powers, the moment when his athletic skills and technical nous coalesce to make him a consistent top-five quarterback rather than the high-variance version he was in his early years.&nbsp;He should be the&nbsp;cornerstone of a perennial Super Bowl contender. Instead, he\u2019s a street free agent being passed up for jobs by a fossilized Joe Flacco.</p> <p>Whether or not Newton is still able to ratchet it up to his old level is hardly a debate \u2013 he almost certainly cannot. It\u2019s not as though he\u2019s sustained one serious injury or repeat injuries within the same area. He is now up to multiple injuries in multiple spots, the most recent of which impact his two key traits: his throwing shoulder (throwing power) and his feet (speed). But could he still be an effective starter who could do for a team what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/cam-newton-marcus-mariota-next-team\">Ryan Tannehill</a> did for the Titans last season? Controlling the flow of the game and then making big plays on third downs? Sure. Why not?</p> <p>Almost every team in the league has now settled on its starting quarterback for the 2020 season. And those who may be lukewarm on their starter have made a strong dent in their cap sheet by trying to surround their quarterback with as much talent as possible. Trying to find a spot that has both a potential starting spot for Newton and the money he would command is difficult. The Patriots are about it.</p> <p>Most likely: Newton will have to be happy signing a one-year, incentive-heavy \u201cprove it\u201d deal in which he will have to unseat an incumbent starter.</p> <p>But maybe not. Maybe he thinks the punishment isn\u2019t with it if he\u2019s only walking into a backup gig. Newton has an earned ego, the best kind. He carried an Auburn team on his back to the national championship in college and came within a game of replicating the feat with the Panthers in the Super Bowl. To think he might come in and sit behind Matt Ryan or Ben Roethlisberger or Jared Goff feels fanciful, even if it would make all the sense in the world for the respective teams.</p> <p>Newton was a paradigm shifter when he entered the league, the kind of new-age, spread-option quarterback who helped revolutionize a conservative league. Will he be a paradigm shifter on the way out?<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Is this the new life cycle of professional quarterbacks?</p> <p>We have become accustomed to dropback, rhythm passers playing to their 40s. That the Packers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/27/aaron-rodgers-green-bay-packers-nfl-draft-jordan-love\">would plan for a future beyond their 38-year-old quarterback</a> came as a shock. But as the era of Manning, Brady, Brees, Rodgers and Roethlisberger ages out of the league, mobile quarterbacks will have a monopoly on the landscape.</p> <p>While Newton represents one of the high points of that style, it is a skill set that is more available than ever before. If college and high school teams are not putting their best athlete at quarterback at this point, they\u2019re getting left behind.</p> <p>As the league shifts wholesale to an embrace of spread-option, pace-and-space concepts, perhaps the career arc of quarterbacks will change with it: get in, wow, get hurt, get out \u2013 kind of like running backs or wide receivers.&nbsp;<em>This is my number and I\u2019m not playing unless you reach it and I\u2019m good with that.</em></p> <p>In Newton\u2019s case, that would be a shame. The Panthers failed to supply him with a team that was consistently equipped to compete deep in the playoffs. In the season that the Panthers went to the Super Bowl \u2013 when Newton infamously failed to dive for a loose ball \u2013 that image of Newton failing to spring to the ground for it has lived on in the consciousness. It has been through the meme cycle and is now a fully baked-in part of his legacy. So has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/feb/08/cam-newton-sulked-after-losing-super-bowl-50-and-thats-ok\">his post-game performance</a>, with opinions ranging from sore-loser-whiner to great-competitor-who-hates-to-lose depending on the opinion-givers innate bias.</p> <p>For that to be the lasting image of Newton\u2019s career, a potential championship right-there-but-lost<em>, </em>would be a shame. Too often he was forced to drag a moribund bunch to the playoffs (with a strong assist from a consistently brilliant defenses). As the team gathered towards competency again, his body gave out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here\u2019s hoping he can rebound, that this isn\u2019t the end of Newton as a starter but a speed bump on the way to a fascinating second act.</p>",

Wherever Zara stores have opened their doors from Paris to Tunis, shoppers have formed long first-day queues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"739a1fe7194ab2452b6fa8ec8eac12c146c21a6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/739a1fe7194ab2452b6fa8ec8eac12c146c21a6d/0_138_4125_2475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy Hilfiger shop reopening in Azerbaijan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tommy Hilfiger shop reopening in Azerbaijan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aziz Karimov/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With pubs, cafes and restaurants yet to reopen, those who do go clothes-shopping next week will be guinea pigs for the new normal. They will be the first to assess the look and feel of the world of commercialised leisure time in which many of us used to spend our weekends.</p> <p>With warehouses of unsold summer stock to shift, retailers are at pains to do everything they can to make customers feel safe. Some of the basics will be universal. In-store numbers will be strictly limited, so expect queues outside. Stores with more than one door may operate separate entrances and exits to avoid face-to-face contact at these points. Masks will be worn by staff, and shoppers will be encouraged to follow suit. Contactless payment will be encouraged (expect a push on Apple Pay and other mobile payment services, which are not usually subject to the \u00a345 limit)<strong> </strong>and sanitiser pumps stationed by each cash desk. Only household members can shop together, and lift occupancy will be limited to one person or those from one household.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Order several pieces at once \u2013 if you only order one, you might convince yourself you like it to avoid returning it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lots of things will vary between stores, however. In the first wave, many will open only those branches whose customer base can travel by foot, bike or car. John Lewis will keep changing rooms closed for now, but Reiss and Gap will open some, with rigorous sanitising between customers.</p> <p>Jewellery and watches will be particularly challenging to try on, as the virus can live on metal for much longer than on fabric. Most stores have extended their returns policy to encourage shoppers to try clothes on at home; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/27/john-lewis-announces-first-wave-of-store-reopenings-coronavirus\">John Lewis is considering installing \u201cdrop boxes\u201d</a> at store entry points, so that returns need not add to in-store footfall. Some shops will open for shorter hours so that staff don\u2019t need to travel at rush hour, others will open for longer to spread out footfall. Selfridges is considering reducing the amount of stock on the shop floor so that shoppers can give each other more space. <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8396107/Harrods-open-outlet-pop-store-West-London-shopping-centre.html\">Harrods will open an outlet at the west London Westfield</a> shopping centre in July where the traditional tightly packed sales rails can have more room. Most stores will keep cafes closed, but 49 Marks &amp; Spencer stores will sell takeout coffees. Some stores will have toilets open \u2013 but as one PR told me off the record, those that will aren\u2019t keen to broadcast the fact and become de facto public toilets while few alternatives are available.</p> <p>Even the greatest cheerleader for the embattled retail industry would struggle to frame this as an enticing day out. Vigilance over meticulous hygiene may reassure customers that they are safe, but that is not the same as making them feel relaxed, happy and in the mood to spend. After all, until three months ago, bricks-and-mortar retail relied on delivering a fun experience to tempt shoppers offline \u2013 and \u201csterile\u201d was one of the most damning verdicts you could deliver.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bb6a30e6e3a2ac890f64a10b4816182fb2d982a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bb6a30e6e3a2ac890f64a10b4816182fb2d982a/0_270_4859_2915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Expect queues \u2026 waiting to get into a reopened clothes shop in Switzerland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Expect queues \u2026 waiting to get into a reopened clothes shop in Switzerland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Gilli\u00e9ron/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are already signs that a new genre of IRL shopping trip could begin to emerge. The lost art of window shopping, for instance, is enjoying a renaissance. During the pandemic, Mixology, a teenage fashion store on the Upper East Side of New York, resisted boarding up its windows and instead installed new outfits in the windows with a sign reading: \u201cSee something you like in the window? Feel free to text or call,\u201d with the shopkeepers\u2019 phone numbers listed. Where fashion stores have reopened in other city centres, retailers have repurposed their windows from abstract, artsy cubes to showcases for key looks available in store, encouraging shoppers to do their initial browse of the selection in the open air and without touching any stock.</p> <p>\u201cYou need a plan,\u201d says Helen Seamons, the Guardian\u2019s menswear fashion editor and a gold-standard shopper, when I ask for her tips for a successful physically distanced shopping trip. \u201cThe age of the aimless browse is over for now. And the etiquette of flicking through rails seems doubtful. So do an online recce and save screenshots to your phone of pieces you like. That way you can ask staff where they are, and reduce your wandering-about time.\u201d Some small neighbourhood boutiques that will have capacity for only one or two shoppers at a time plan to offer short bookable appointments rather than having customers lined up outside.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aff92bb8550d0a96278d45b5e601ce8124dd7d39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aff92bb8550d0a96278d45b5e601ce8124dd7d39/0_47_3206_1923/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A shop in Moscow preparing to reopen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A shop in Moscow preparing to reopen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikhail Tereshchenko/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alternatively, this could be the time to pivot to online clothes shopping. The best place to start is with a brand you already wear, so that you have a good sense of what size you take and a realistic expectation of what the fabric and finish will be, these being tricky to assess online. Melanie Wilkinson, the Guardian\u2019s styling editor, suggests: \u201cThis probably isn\u2019t the best time to buy a new pair of jeans \u2013 historically, the one item that requires hours of trying on. Continue to embrace the smart jogging-bottom trend of lockdown instead. You can wear these with silk blouses and relaxed shirts, which are easier to shop for online.\u201d Order several pieces at once and expect to send most of them back \u2013 if you only order one item, you might be tempted to convince yourself you like it to save the bother of returning it. But whether you are shopping in store or online, you won\u2019t be taking anyone with you into a changing room for a while.</p> <p>To recreate shopping with friends, consider setting up a WhatsApp group for honest advice so that each of you can try on new purchases in front of the mirror and send selfies for feedback. (Consider carefully who you want to include in this group. Does their taste match with yours? How much brutal honesty is too much? Will it annoy you if they copy what you buy?)</p> <p>Things will get better. Swifter sanitising systems, some using ozone-based technology and others ultraviolet light, are being worked on, with a view to reducing the quarantine time for clothes that customers have been handled to an hour or less. <a href=\"https://www.zara.com/uk/en/help/sizes-h11.html\">Zara already has an online fit tool</a> that uses your height, weight and body shape to recommend which size you buy \u2013 so far, this has always worked out for me, although the hit rate is inconsistent between different body shapes and sizes. Amazon is developing an app that will <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6637217/Amazon-develops-virtual-fitting-room-dress-version-built-social-media.html\">\u201cdata mine\u201d photos from your phone to create a bespoke virtual mannequin</a> that accurately represents your body shape, which can then \u201ctry on\u201d clothes. The new normal is a strange place. Anyone for retail therapy?</p>",

The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, asked the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to confirm that in just three weeks since parliament last sat the government had admitted it overestimated coverage of its jobkeeper scheme by 3 million workers, announced it would repay $720m to victims of its robodebt Centrelink debt recovery scheme and Australia entered its first recession in three decades. \u201cIt is a recession, Mr Speaker, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Morrison said. Morrison said the opposition was using the economic challenges created by the pandemic for political purposes.</p> \n<h2><strong>Year 12 students to receive final results in December</strong></h2> \n<p>Australian year 12 students will receive their university entry scores in the second half of December. Students and families have faced major challenges as a result of disruption the pandemic has caused to their final year of schooling. A meeting of education ministers from across the country decided the release of individual Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (Atar) results, for students completing year 12 in 2020, would occur \u201cwithin a nationally consistent window of 15 December to 31 December 2020\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Hurdle for Queensland high court challenge</strong></h2> \n<p>A legal challenge to the Queensland government\u2019s decision to keep the state\u2019s borders closed hit a snag. The high court in Brisbane refused an application from lawyers for the Travel Essence challenge to access the documents used by the government when it decided to close the border. The chief justice,&nbsp;Susan Kiefel,&nbsp;said the application was \u201ca fishing expedition\u201d and \u201csubsidiary\u201d to the constitutional matter at hand.</p> \n<h2><strong>Labor senators who attended marches tested for coronavirus</strong></h2> \n<p>Four Labor senators who attended Black Lives Matter marches were being tested for Covid-19 as a precautionary measure. The Northern Territory senator Malarndirri McCarthy, Alice Springs-based MP Warren Snowdon and Queenslanders Graham Perrett and Anika Wells left parliament for tests on Wednesday and were isolating until they receive results. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said they were being tested \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>Mass audit of papers linked to firm behind hydroxychloroquine scandal</strong></h2> \n<p>Dozens of scientific papers co-authored by the chief executive of the US tech company behind the Lancet hydroxychloroquine study scandal are now being audited, including one<strong>&nbsp;</strong>that a&nbsp;scientific integrity expert&nbsp;claims contains images that appear to have been digitally manipulated. The audit follows a Guardian investigation that found the company,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/surgisphere\">Surgisphere</a>, used suspect data in major scientific studies that were published and then retracted by world-leading medical journals, including the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine.

  "<p>None of us are going to be going to weddings anytime soon. In many states and cities, what we see as traditional weddings, with large gatherings of people, have been banned. We are living through a period defined by its disappointments, by concert debuts that will not happen, by plays that will not launch, by aborted careers and, yes, by grand wedding dreams that will never reach fulfillment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/24/a-bride-a-groom-and-a-booking-but-no-big-day-yet-for-lovers-in-lockdown\">A  bride, a groom and a booking \u2026 but no big day for lovers in lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The disappointments of missed weddings are no doubt painful. But the truth is that a re-evaluation of the contemporary wedding was already well overdue.</p> <p>In 2019, the wedding industry is, or rather was, worth $70bn, and that\u2019s in the United States alone, and that doesn\u2019t include honeymoons. It was pure madness. Many industries are going to have be be reconsidered in the wake of the economic shutdown, and weddings should be at the top of the list. Like the cruise industry, we should just let it die.&nbsp;</p> <p>The institution of marriage has been declining even as the cost of weddings&nbsp;has been exploding. Today, about half of adult Americans are married. In 1960, the number was three-quarters. And the people who do get married, get married way, way later.<strong> </strong>In 1962, half of 21-year-olds were married. In 2019, that number was down to 9%. In 1962, 90% of 30-year-olds had been married. In 2019, only <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/average-marriage-age-united-states-2019-2\">slightly over half of 30-year-olds</a> had been.&nbsp;</p> <p>Half a century ago, marriage meant big life changes:&nbsp;losing your virginity,&nbsp;moving in, merging bank accounts, having kids. But now, three-quarters of couples already live together. They split the bills. They share a bed. Marriage is not a requirement to be an adult any more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Nonetheless, we maintain these supposedly necessary traditions. The most widespread collective response to the approach of gender equality has been that, in our most significant public declarations of love and commitment, women dress up like they\u2019re minor members of the Russian royal family from the 19th century and men dress up like they\u2019re waiters on cruise liners. I guess it\u2019s good to begin any major phase in life with a consciousness of your own ridiculousness, but surely there ought to be limits.</p> <p>And then there is the cost. The average cost of a wedding in 2019 was $32,329. The median cost for a house in the States that year was $200,000, according to Zillow. Do the math: the average cost of a wedding is a serious downpayment on an average house. You start off the period of your life when you really need money by collecting it in a pile and burning it. A big wedding makes leasing a sports car look like a good financial decision.</p> <p>Spending all that money on a wedding won\u2019t make you happier, it won\u2019t make your marriage stronger. The opposite, in fact. In 2015, social scientists in Singapore did the work. In \u2018<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2501480\">A Diamond is Forever\u2019 and Other Fairy Tales: The Relationship between Wedding Expenses and Marriage Duration</a>,&nbsp;they found marriage duration is inversely associated with the spending on the ceremony and the engagement ring. The more you spend, the shorter the marriage lasts. But that\u2019s obvious any time you go to a wedding. You can tell how unhappy a couple is by the size of the flower arrangements.&nbsp;(For the record, my wife and I eloped in the aftermath of September 11. We were, according to lifestyle journalists at the time, a \u201cterror marriage\u201d.)&nbsp;</p> <p>The idea that you need to have the big wedding because of \u201ctradition\u201d? The \u201ctradition\u201d behind weddings was all thought up by Madison Avenue types a hundred years ago. Karen Dunak, a history professor at Muskingum University in Ohio, wrote As Long as We Both Shall Love: The White Wedding in Postwar America. It\u2019s a fascinating history of the consumerist nonsense that is the modern wedding. \u201cWhen you have this rise and this increased democratization of a consumer culture in the 1920s, this is when you have more wedding registries; this is when you have department stores that would have wedding departments,\u201d she told me. \u201cThis is when you have the commercialization of a lot of services related to the wedding. That you would have bakers who make wedding cakes, you would have wedding boutiques, you would have florists who would make wedding arrangements rather than people doing it as a part of home craft.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7051e7172d5cd258ed719f96388aabb0b5fb2c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7051e7172d5cd258ed719f96388aabb0b5fb2c7/0_220_6595_3957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The happiest day of their lives.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The happiest day of their lives.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Utrecht/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But global crises like Covid-19 changed it overnight. \u201c[The wedding industry] was disrupted a little bit with the Great Depression. It\u2019s changed some more with the nature of World War II, where you happen to have very rushed weddings where people meet each other and somebody\u2019s heading off to war. It\u2019s after World War II where you would have a church wedding, that you would have a reception, that you would have dinner, that you\u2019d have dancing.\u201d</p> <p>The tradition of huge elaborate ceremonies followed by enormous parties, all at vast expense, belongs to the recent past of unparalleled growth. That period is over. It\u2019s time to make some new traditions \u2013 vastly, vastly cheaper ones.</p> <p>Before Covid-19, a wedding was a way to begin your life together in a splurge of debt and wasteful narcissism. That is what a pre-Covid wedding forced you to do: it forced you to turn your love into a lifestyle. It forced you to turn your private life into a big display. There was enormous social pressure to engage in what is obviously a folly: to begin adulthood by lying, by making up fraudulent histories, by pretending that you\u2019re independent, by grotesque and unoriginal conspicuous consumption.&nbsp;</p> <p>Covid-19 is ruining a great many beautiful things, glorious art, wonderful meetings, even love itself. But this destruction \u2013 the destruction of the wedding industry \u2013&nbsp;we should take for what it is, a blessing in disguise. Let\u2019s not let the insanity back.

These protests were initially prompted by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/george-floyd-killing-triggers-wave-of-activism-around-the-world\">killing of George Floyd in the US</a> and systemic racism everywhere, but they may finally force us into a thorough examination of the British empire and its role in slavery.<br><br>Born in Bristol in 1636, Colston was the preeminent slave trader of his day, and during the time of his involvement with the Royal African Company \u2013 between 1680 to 1692 \u2013 it is estimated that the company transported some 84,000 Africans to the Caribbean and the Americas, of whom 19,000 died on the way.</p> <p>In the decades that followed Colston\u2019s death in 1721, another slave merchant rose to notoriety in Bristol: Samuel Span. Span headed the influential Society of Merchant Venturers, which had once petitioned parliament to lift the monopoly granted to the Royal African Company over the slave trade so that it could join it.</p> <p>Span resonates on a personal level, because not only did he own the Caribbean island to which my African forebears were brought to work as slaves, he himself was also my ancestor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/protests-british-history\">These anti-racism protests show it's time for Britain to grapple with its difficult history | Olivette Otele</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those clamouring for change must also make demands on behalf of those \u2013 in the Caribbean and beyond \u2013 who have been hard-hit by men like Colston and Span. They must begin to speak of reparations.</p> <p>In 1763, at the conclusion of the seven years\u2019 war, France ceded to Britain the islands of St Vincent and the Grenadines, which included tiny Union Island, where my family have lived for generations. Span, then a naval chief, was rewarded with the island, giving him absolute control over its slaves. He set about transporting more Africans on Bristol-crewed vessels to work on the island\u2019s cotton plantations. The island\u2019s slave population reached a peak of 635 in 1822. Span named the island\u2019s two main settlements after <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/story-the-clifton-ashton-remarkable-3970925\">places in Bristol</a>: Clifton and Ashton.

Other descendants who worked to create the family\u2019s wealth would not see a single penny.</p> <p>In the early 2000s I moved to Clifton, Bristol, for my undergraduate degree at the University of Bristol, which was founded with money <a href=\"https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/history/past-matters/\">derived</a> from the sale of tobacco produced on plantations in the American south that once held slaves.<br><br>That the university had failed to address the racism and elitism upon which it was founded seemed glaringly obvious. There were only a handful of black students. And over the three years I spent there, I did not see a single black academic. Last year the student union called on the university to commission an independent review into <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-50788321\">\u201cinstitutionalised racism\u201d</a> after a slew of incidents.<br><br>Racism still appears to loom large in Bristol\u2019s recent history, too. It is worth remembering that the city\u2019s African-Caribbean community, inspired by Rosa Parks\u2019s refusal to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama, <a href=\"https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/section/bhm-heroes/the-bristol-bus-boycott-of-1963/\">led a boycott</a> of the local bus service in 1963, protesting against widespread racial discrimination in employment and housing.<br><br>The boycott is considered to have been an influence on the passing of the landmark Race Relations Acts of 1965 and 1968, which outlawed racial discrimination in employment and housing \u2013 a reminder that direct action has brought about change. Failure to tackle poor housing and the over-policing of black communities were among the factors that led to <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/st-pauls-riots-37-years-17634\">riots in April 1980</a> in St Paul\u2019s, an inner-city neighbourhood with historic importance for the African-Caribbean community (now the area is undergoing rapid gentrification). <br><br>Today, Colston\u2019s toppling and subsequent drowning in the waters of Bristol\u2019s harbour, where his slave ships once docked, should force the city \u2013 and the country as a whole \u2013 into a wider reckoning about racism and empire.<br><br>In fact, the process has already begun: last year the University of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/30/olivette-otele-uk-first-black-female-history-professor-to-research-bristol-slavery-links\">Bristol appointed</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/30/olivette-otele-uk-first-black-female-history-professor-to-research-bristol-slavery-links\"> Olivette Otele</a> as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/protests-british-history\">professor of the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/protests-british-history\">history of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/protests-british-history\">slavery</a>, with a mandate to investigate the institution\u2019s and the city\u2019s links to the trade.</p> <p>But what about Union Island?</p> <p>Unionites continued to live in poverty long after slaves were freed in 1838. The island had to wait until the mid-1970s to gain access to electricity, just before St Vincent and the Grenadines won its independence from Britain. Labelled the Tahiti of the Caribbean, because of its lush volcanic silhouette set in sparkling coral-laden seas, Union attracts an international cast of wealthy jetsetters \u2013 even though its 3,000 or so permanent residents find themselves grinding through a third year of recession. Unemployment and poverty are rife. <br><br>Statues in tribute to the likes of Colston and Span in British cities rightly seem abhorrent to many. But the material damage they wrought was felt far beyond these shores \u2013 it is high time that the damage is fully accounted for.</p> <p>We in the UK need to begin a national debate on reparations for slavery, a crime which heralded the age of capitalism and provided the basis for racism that continues to endanger black life globally. It will follow a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/reparations-slavery-congress-hearing-ta-nehisi-coates-danny-glover\">landmark US Congress</a> hearing on the topic last year.</p> <p>Protesters making demands of British institutions and examining the individuals who profited from slavery, must also follow the money trail to places such as Union Island.

None outdid Michael Gove, comparing Trump to George Washington. The first president had also been misunderstood by Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/15/michael-gove-uk-interview-tory-times\">Gove wrote</a> in an unctuous interview with the 45th. He cast Trump as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who did not merit the \u201cscorn and condescension\u201d of his UK critics.&nbsp;To compensate for his countrymen\u2019s discourtesy, Gove posed with his subject, grinning and giving the thumbs-up.</p> <p>In the gallery of cringing subservience that image can hang alongside Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/27/trump-may-hold-hands-white-house-video\">holding the president\u2019s hand</a> during her first visit to the White House. Later that day, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/28/trump-immigration-ban-syria-muslims-reaction-lawsuits\">issued executive order 13769</a> \u2013 the entry ban on nationals from predominantly Muslim countries. May did not condemn it.</p> <p>Some said there was a better man behind the mask, but there was no mask. The racist snarl, the bully\u2019s sneer and the infantile pout were all his. The face of the campaign was true to the character of the candidate. The only way to see a nobler Trump was to mould one from delusion, cowardice and self-interest \u2013 plentiful resources in a government embarking on Brexit.</p> <p>Those who found Trump\u2019s appeals to white nationalism a little vulgar retreated to arguments based on realpolitik. The transatlantic relationship is bigger than personalities, they said. We honour the office of president, regardless of who sits there. That diplomatic rationale led Britain to roll out what Jacob Rees-Mogg boasted should be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-uk-visit-jacob-reesmogg-address-parliament-a8337946.html\">the reddest of red carpets</a>\u201d for a state visit.</p> <p>The problem is that Trump is a malignancy eating away at the authority of his office. He has no concept of alliances based on mutual interest. Like any despot, he demands submission, then despises as weaklings those who submit. Britain\u2019s loyalty should be to the institutions of liberal democracy in the US and around the world that Trump attacks.</p> <p>Angela Merkel got the tone right. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/09/angela-merkel-congratulates-donald-trump-kind-of/\">German </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/09/angela-merkel-congratulates-donald-trump-kind-of/\">chancellor\u2019s message</a> marking Trump\u2019s victory was more&nbsp;rebuke&nbsp;than congratulation. She itemised the ethical foundations of partnership between democracies, \u201cthe rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin colour, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views\u201d. She offered cooperation \u201cbased on these values\u201d.</p> <p>Back in Westminster, giddy Brexiteers scoffed at Merkel\u2019s piety, which they took as a symptom of strategic decline. New power alignments were coming into focus, the old order was unravelling and Berlin was disadvantaged by its lack of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the US. Forget Brussels, London had Washington on its side.</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s critics underestimated her own capacity for hard-headed realpolitik. She identifies Germany\u2019s interests with the European Union as part of the broad apparatus of international rules-based cooperation. When Trump hurls aggressive rhetoric at those structures, when he calls the EU a \u201cfoe\u201d, when he lavishes praise on authoritarian rulers, Merkel listens. She does not gamble on apologist interpretations of what he really meant to say.<br><br>There is a certain type of squeamish Trump fellow-traveller who, embarrassed by displays of actual fascism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/peter-thiel-defends-donald-trump-muslim-ban-mexico-wall\">draws a distinction</a> between taking the president&nbsp;<em>literally</em>&nbsp;and taking him&nbsp;<em>seriously</em>. It is a clever formula, usually attributed to the libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, but probably not coined by him. This rhetorical device is used to exonerate people who rally to hateful language on the grounds that they are responding to some deeper meaning. The thuggish misogyny and racist provocations are just short-cuts, like icons on a desktop leading to a more sophisticated program. By a feat of moral gymnastics, the nastiness could then be justified as empathic rage, expressing the legitimate concerns of humble Americans, traduced by metropolitan globalists.<br><br>But Trump despises the people who elected him. His economic policy transfers their money into the pockets of his family and friends. He befouled American public administration, leaving the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/01/donald-trump-coronavirus-boris-johnson-failures-president\">defenceless</a> against Covid-19. It is the stuff of banal kleptocracy, but a vanguard of ideologues and broadsheet media outriders dressed it up to seem complex, profound and somehow historically inevitable.<br><br>The narrative of popular grievance seeded the liberal calamity with guilt \u2013 a burden of self-criticism placed on the losers for neglecting the terrain where Trumpism flourished. A necessary stage, perhaps, to understand electoral forces in play, but then what? The ultimate task was still resisting a tyrant.<br><br>And what did the Tory party do, meanwhile, but jostle among the sycophants and courtiers seeking favours, kidding themselves that they had influence. They shredded European alliances to make confetti for a venal egomaniac\u2019s parade, cheered by the world\u2019s autocrats who knew the grotesque carnival route led away from law and order.&nbsp;</p> <p>And what is the reward for Britain? If Trump is defeated in November, the last four years are nothing but a stain on transatlantic relations. If Trump stays, the only global role for Boris Johnson is dishevelled sidekick to a rogue superpower. Either way there is a price to pay for collusion. History will record that Britain was no mere bystander at America\u2019s tragedy, nor was it innocent.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Chokeholds, or \u201clateral vascular neck restraints\u201d, have been banned by many American police departments since the 1990s. This is sometimes hard to remember because there have been so many deaths since then, using precisely this technique. Chokeholds look like a kind of judo manoeuvre: an arm thrown around the neck followed by a slow squeezing pressure applied to the carotid artery. It can quickly disable an adversary, although more than a few seconds of applied pressure can kill.&nbsp;As in judo, a knee to the neck accomplishes much the same end.</p> <p>The police chokehold is a sensitive issue among African Americans. The history of black death by suffocation evokes an ugly history that is not limited to lynching with nooses. Many do not remember that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/22/rodney-king-riots-25-year-anniversary-los-angeles\">Rodney King</a> was not only beaten with batons, but that one officer, Theodore Briseno, put his foot on King\u2019s neck to hold him down.&nbsp;Perhaps because King did not die, that small fact is lost in today\u2019s discussions.&nbsp;</p> <p>But this week has been all about the dead. Eric Garner died in 2014 and his name usually begins the litany.&nbsp;He was arrested for selling \u201cloosies\u201d, or unwrapped single cigarettes. Officers threw him to the ground, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/01/eric-garner-nypd-chokehold-homicide\">applied a chokehold</a> and held him down until he died. We know this incident well because angry crowds gathered, begging officers to let him go as Garner cried out 11 times: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d We know this because bystanders took lots of pictures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/america-george-floyd-protests-trump\">A week that shook a nation: anger burns as power of protests leaves Trump exposed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Garner\u2019s name is chanted like a mantra in the long, sad sequence of more recent deaths of black Americans, deaths by many means. Breonna Taylor, Philando Castile, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown. That sequence now culminates with the name of George Floyd.&nbsp;Arrested on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill, Floyd was thrown to the ground where he succumbed after nearly nine minutes, with the full weight of police officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s knee held on his neck.&nbsp;Again crowds gathered.&nbsp;Warnings were shouted as Floyd\u2019s life slipped away.&nbsp;Clear pictures were taken.&nbsp;</p> <p>The world has exploded since then. Floyd\u2019s death has been a lightning rod for demonstrations around the planet. While much attention has centred on the behaviour of the four police officers at the scene \u2014 and particularly upon Chauvin\u2019s carelessly cavalier demeanour throughout \u2014 the harm should not be thought of as limited to these officers\u2019 behaviour, nor ought it be confined to the question of police reform. Here, for example, is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/30/someone-who-didnt-know-better-might-think-death-by-underlying-health-conditions-was-murder/\">the initial charging document for&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/30/someone-who-didnt-know-better-might-think-death-by-underlying-health-conditions-was-murder/\">Floyd\u2019s death</a>, issued by the Minneapolis medical examiner:&nbsp;\u201cThe autopsy revealed no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.&nbsp;Mr Floyd had underlying health conditions including coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease. The combined effects of Mr Floyd being restrained by the police, his underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>This is an astonishing description, a shameful circumlocution.&nbsp;</p> <p>But of course Floyd did die by asphyxiation.&nbsp;That much is so obvious that the medical examiner\u2019s report reads like systemic bureaucratic corruption, indicating more than simply the lethal indifference of a single \u201crogue\u201d officer.&nbsp;Blaming Floyd\u2019s death on \u201cunderlying health conditions\u201d is a remarkably determined deflection of Chauvin\u2019s agency.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the end, Floyd\u2019s family hired an independent coroner who confirmed lethal asphyxiation.&nbsp;And quickly thereafter, a final report was issued by Minnesota\u2019s coroner, who logged the official cause of death as strangulation.</p> <p>The linguistic effacement of agency often directs gaze in powerful ways, tells us where to look and where not to.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/21/police-release-video-of-kajieme-powell-shooting-in-st-louis\">Kajieme Powell</a> was a black man with mental health problems.&nbsp;In 2014, he took snacks from a convenience store and tossed them on the street,&nbsp;allegedly brandishing a&nbsp;steak&nbsp;knife. He called out to the police: \u201cShoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me now.\u201d They obliged him, 12 times over.&nbsp;</p> <p>The police\u2019s actions were explained with what has since become a fairly common appellation,&nbsp;\u201csuicide by cop\u201d, or police-assisted suicide.&nbsp;It is an interesting deployment of the passive. It eliminates official responsibility by recasting a trigger-happy officer as the extended will of the deranged, self-sacrificing Powell.&nbsp;He did it to himself.&nbsp;No one\u2019s fault but his own.</p> <p>This is a feature of the trope of black bodies killing themselves.&nbsp;It echoes the degree to which higher rates of Covid-19 infections among African Americans are often blamed on biological difference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/genetics-bame-people-die-coronavirus-structural-racism\">rather than the circumstances of their lives</a> \u2013 the toll too frequently referenced as solely the product of \u201cco-morbidities\u201d such as obesity, asthma, bad choices, genetic \u201cpropensity\u201d.&nbsp;But poverty creates petri dishes for the virus: black, poor and older people die at higher rates in America because their social circumstances have ghettoised them into tight, poisoned geographies, like bugs placed in a jar, with the cap screwed on tightly.&nbsp;</p> <p>As we watch, two great tragedies unfold and intertwine: the toll of coronavirus, and the toll of extrajudicial deaths at the hands of state actors. One maps on to the other in a double helix of grief and despair. Americans are yearning to resolve the incoherence of this moment.&nbsp;This emotional tinderbox must be read against the backdrop of other events.&nbsp;We respond not merely to the misuse of police power but also to the bewildering federal mismanagement of life-sustaining resources amid a global pandemic:&nbsp;we watch the mishandling&nbsp;in every possible way, of food distribution, of subsidies and financial assistance, of medical equipment.&nbsp;</p> <p>This perfect storm of collective smothering \u2013 a foot on all our necks \u2013&nbsp;has made the image of Floyd\u2019s death even more exceptionally powerful. It is legible to such a broad political spectrum because the resonance of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d makes us cringe with sorrow, induces frightening political constrictions, yet doubles also as coronavirus\u2019s power to make its victims literally gasp for breath.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is such a fragile moment.&nbsp;Perhaps we sit on the razor\u2019s edge of real reform. Or perhaps we will never find our way out of the linguistic maze that keeps turning the dead into deadly agents of their own demise.</p> <p>\u2022 Patricia Williams is a professor of law at Columbia University and a regular columnist for the Nation</p>",

Some Titirangi residents have said on social media that the chickens bring a quaint and charming character to the village. Others say they\u2019re \u201clike something out of a Stephen King movie\u201d.</p> <p>Presland, who said \u201cabout 15\u201d of the birds have taken up residence 50 metres from his house, said the problem began in 2008 when a resident had released two domesticated chickens in the village and they had \u201cgone rogue.\u201d</p> <p>The flock\u2019s numbers swelled in the years since, peaking at as many as 250 in 2019.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cA combination of being sleep deprived and seeing the neighbourhood wrecked made some people really hate them,\u201d said Presland, adding that the chickens had also harmed the roots of kauri trees, an endangered New Zealand native.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the last straw came when the suburb was \u201cterrorised\u201d by a pestilence of rats \u201cthe size of cats\u201d, he said, which were attracted by food left out for the birds. Residents were finally united: the chickens had to go.&nbsp;</p> <p>Council contractors set up large nets in different parts of the village, rounding up about 230 of the birds.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an extremely difficult technique because residents wanted to get rid of them but not to harm them,\u201d Presland said. A vet was even on standby to check the chickens and ensure they were well cared-for.</p> <p>\u201cThen we would send them off to this farm to live happily ever after,\u201d he added.</p> <p>After the chicken capture operation, fewer than 10 remained, with eight more rounded up before the country was locked down to curb the spread of Covid-19 in late March. That left about two especially wily birds, which proved resistant to capture, at large.&nbsp;</p> <p>Attempts to track them down were suspended during the lockdown, and when the residents of Titirangi emerged from the shutdown, the chickens were back in force.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a very kind-hearted local who feeds them and has kept feeding them so the numbers have started to spike up again,\u201d Presland said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re convinced that there\u2019s been at least two dumping episodes, where someone\u2019s got their chickens and just dumped them in the village.\u201d</p> <p>Efforts to capture the birds will now redouble, although some exasperated locals had suggested they instead be sent to a local frozen chicken company.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe thought\u2019s actually starting to appeal,\u201d Presland said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Eradication of the birds from Titirangi \u201cwould be ideal\u201d he said. But as long as locals continue to feed the chickens, the menace would likely continue.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI know who it is and I can\u2019t make her stop,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried.\u201d</p>",
  "<h2>What\u2019s going on in financial markets?</h2> <p>Stock market values have been heading back up for a couple of months despite the rapid spread of the coronavirus around the world and the worst US street protests for half a century. The US benchmark S&amp;P500 index of leading companies is on course for its best quarterly performance for 82 years while the Nasdaq index, which measures technology stocks, reached an all-time high on Tuesday in New York. Shares in the UK, Germany, Asia and Australia are all up strongly as well.</p> <h2>But I thought they were all going to hell in a handcart because of Covid-19?</h2> <p>Well, they were. The onset of the global coronavirus pandemic in early March precipitated some of the biggest stock market falls for years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/global-stock-markets-post-biggest-falls-since-2008-financial-crisis\">Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off the value of companies</a> all around the world as it became clear that the virus was going to stop the global economy in its tracks and see millions of workers laid off as industries such as aviation and tourism were reduced to a shell overnight. But the markets, driven by Wall Street as usual, seem to think that the worst is over.</p> <h2>So what happened?</h2> <p>By the second week of March the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, had seen enough. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/us-and-european-markets-plunge-further-after-trump-travel-ban\">It decided to pump $1.5tn dollars into the financial system</a>, consisting of buying up government bonds that no one else wanted to buy, direct loans worth billions to struggling companies and also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/23/the-fed-is-running-out-of-options-to-stave-off-a-coronavirus-depression\">circumventing legislation to hoover up the debt of risky companies as well</a>. The policy driven through by Fed chairman Jerome Powell paved the way for massive intervention from other central banks across the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/emergency-stimulus-explained-what-the-rba-and-government-are-doing-to-boost-australias-economy\">such as in Australia</a>, where the Reserve Bank embarked on quantitative easing \u2013 or money printing \u2013 for the first time.

The post-Lehman intervention was massive and paved the way for a decade-long boom but it continued the cycle of reliance on debt and we never really weaned ourselves off it. This current market intervention is even bigger and risks extending what many experts saw as an unsustainable cycle. It has essentially underwritten risk in the markets and investors have seen this as a sign that governments will do whatever it takes to prevent large falls in the stock markets \u2013 a kind of proto-nationalisation of the global economy. Hence money has poured back into stocks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-crisis-could-lead-to-new-credit-crunch-as-companies-struggle-with-debt\">despite many companies being on their knees</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/global-report-asian-markets-at-three-month-high-on-hope-of-covid-19-recovery\">Global report: Asian markets at three-month high on hope of Covid-19 recovery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Angus Coote of Jamieson Coote Bonds in Melbourne said metrics used by analysts such as the earnings per share of companies showed that money had flowed into indebted companies, indicating that the current wave of investment was especially risky. He warned that the mistakes of the post-2008 response were being repeated and that ordinary working people would end up bearing the costs. \u201cIt\u2019s quite sickening to see Mr Powell bail out Wall Street types at the expense of the man on the street,\u201d he said. \u201cSocialise the losses, privatise the gains. It\u2019s not capitalism.\u201d </p> <h2>So we are in danger of inflating another bubble here?</h2> <p>That is a possibility because so much new money has been created \u2013 only last week the eurozone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jun/04/covid-19-uk-car-sales-aston-martin-lookers-ecb-christine-lagarde-interest-rate-sterling-dollar-euro-business-live?page=with:block-5ed8e1118f082107f453aa6e#block-5ed8e1118f082107f453aa6e\">doubled its support measures </a>to \u20ac1.35tn \u2013 and it has to go somewhere. The feeling among experts is that if it is put to productive use, such as in infrastructure spending, or channelled into the pockets of people on low incomes who will spend the money in shops and on services, then the real economy might be rebooted on a more sustainable footing. But if it is simply passed to investors to inflate the prices of assets such as shares and property, knowing that the Fed will support the market if it turns sour, then we have simply doubled down on the problem.</p> <p>Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser of the insurance giant Allianz, says massive Fed support was not just propping up unproductive \u201czombie companies\u201d but risks creating \u201czombie markets\u201d which are so distorted that capital is not used properly. \u201cIt also adds to the disconnect between Main Street and Wall Street [and] worsens wealth inequality,\u201d he says. Damien Klassen of Nucleus Wealth in Melbourne says the feeling that investors could not lose is stacked with risk and moral hazard. \u201cIt\u2019s OK if the money created by central banks goes into productive things like infrastructure but it has no value if it goes into bidding up asset prices. That\u2019s where the moral hazard comes in and that is where we risk inflating another bubble.\u201d</p> <h2>But what about the recession we\u2019ve heard so much about?</h2> <p>Good point. Just about every major economy is already in recession or is heading that way at a rate of knots. The World Bank said on Tuesday that its baseline forecast envisions that the world economy will shrink by 5.2% this year, the deepest global recession in decades. The current quarter is expected to be the worst but we won\u2019t know how bad until later in the year, by which time unemployment will be peaking at well over 10% in many countries. On top of that, we don\u2019t know what will happen when governments start to phase out the wage furlough schemes and people are left potentially without incomes.</p> <h2>So it might get worse again?</h2> <p>That\u2019s a strong possibility because the current action on stock markets appears to be totally disconnected from the real world economy. \u201cAt the moment traders are thinking that this is as bad as it gets and it will get better,\u201d says Klassen. \u201cBut they might have to start looking at the fundamentals at some point. They think it looks OK now but it doesn\u2019t take into account the demand destruction or supply chain disruption that we\u2019ve seen and that has to be rebuilt. Small and medium-sized business losses and job losses might become so great that the market can\u2019t ignore it.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>\u2018I\u2019m tramping through damp, long grass in the wake of two poodles,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-packham\">Chris Packham</a> tells me, over the phone, at nine in the morning, from his home near Southampton. \u201cOne of the joys of the UK is this rich, verdant colour at this time of year, so green that it\u2019s almost blinding.\u201d The naturalist\u2019s voice, compelling and contemplative, draws you in and slows you down, to the point where you are concentrating hard enough to see what he describes, even when you can\u2019t.</p> <p>Generally, of course, you can see it: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/springwatch\">Springwatch has been back on screens</a>, packed with the images \u2013 baby birds with their gaping maws, treecreepers blinking \u2013 we have always cherished and lately come to rely on. Packham, 59, has such a natural, contagious sincerity in his enthusiasm that he should be in the \u201cnational treasure\u201d class, one of those rare figures who unites the country and is immune from politics. But he determinedly is not \u2013 he won\u2019t, today, talk about grouse, hen harriers or any of those bird-cruelty issues that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/14/a-of-crows-chris-packham-and-the-countryside-war-over-bird-killings\">brought him death threats</a> of the most lurid kind (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/dead-crows-left-at-chris-packhams-home-in-row-over-killing-pest-birds\">dead birds hung up by his gatepost</a>, Twitter abuse too awful to detail). The BBC, I am given to understand, would prefer him not to speak on these topics. But in January he fell foul of the neutrality police in another way: while promoting his documentary about the global population, he said that, for the sake of the planet, people should consider having fewer children (he has no biological children).</p> <p>Packham admits the idea is controversial, but \u201cI approach things as a pragmatic biologist\u201d, he says, calmly. \u201cThere\u2019s not a racist cell in my body; I don\u2019t think of humans as being different.\u201d That was not my question, although he has been accused \u2013 nefariously, he says \u2013 of singling out countries such as Nigeria, and therefore pointing the finger at sub-Saharan Africa, when \u201cthe real problem is what you and I are consuming\u201d. \u201cUltimately, we are all the same species, in the same place, at the same time, with the same problem, and if we don\u2019t start thinking collectively to sort it out, then we won\u2019t do it,\u201d he says. \u201cA global conversation about how many people the planet can sustain is something that has to happen.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13a1ecc558dbacefb526098f912bd7e1230242ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13a1ecc558dbacefb526098f912bd7e1230242ea/0_0_3500_1968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Packham with his Springwatch colleagues Michaela Strachan, Gillian Burke and Iolo Williams\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s been an absolute joy to see people posting pictures with ladybirds on their fingers and frogs in their ponds\u2019 ... with his Springwatch colleagues Michaela Strachan, Gillian Burke and Iolo Williams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo Charlesworth/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I happen to disagree \u2013 if you look at the recent work of the social geographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/danny-dorling\">Danny Dorling</a>, it shows that birth rates are already in decline worldwide; we are entering a natural slowdown. What we have not managed to slow down is rich people\u2019s consumption.</p> <p>But, in a way, this makes me admire Packham all the more: there is enough to contest in these choppy waters that he could avoid them altogether and still hold his head high as a passionate defender of the natural world. He does not play it safe, nor does he skirt the largest, most uncomfortable implications of his analysis. He worries constantly \u2013 about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\">IPCC\u2019s warning that we have 10 years to solve the climate crisis</a>, about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/16/right-new-strongmen-winning-everywhere-brazil-hungary-rightwing\">strongman politics</a> dominating the world stage, about the loss of biodiversity and the long-term impact that will have on harvests \u2013 but he does not&nbsp;<em>sound</em>&nbsp;worried. He sounds like a man telling you that your boiler is broken, but he knows how to fix it.</p> <p>So, we don\u2019t need only to have fewer children; we also need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/21/lifestyle-change-eat-less-meat-climate-change\">stop eating meat</a>. \u201cThe reason why Jair Bolsonaro [the president of Brazil] and his henchmen are ravishing the Amazon is that they want it for agricultural land. They want to grow soy there, and beef, and that\u2019s because people eat it. If meat consumption were cut, we could sustain more people.\u201d</p> <p>We need better leaders, given that we are living under \u201cundoubtedly the worst portfolio of politicians that we could possibly have imaged in our lifetime\u201d, and we need to \u201cshape a new world\u201d after the pandemic, with the environment at the centre of our decision-making. On reflection, we all know how to fix this boiler, just as we all enjoy the sight of a ladybird, but it is soothing and exciting to hear it described.</p> <p>Packham always says of his early life, growing up in Hampshire, that he was a bit difficult, emotionally adrift, until he took a baby kestrel from its nest when he was 14 and fell violently in love with it. This led to a zoology degree, at the University of Southampton. He got into TV not via presenting, but in production, for the BBC\u2019s 1984 series The Living Planet. His career as a presenter started with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAwEz1suVUI\">The Really Wild Show</a>, in 1986, when he electrified the nature scene with his Gary Rhodes hair and his apparently effortless fluency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"220a027cb4638d3ac5554c0a9116f6604c39e4c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/220a027cb4638d3ac5554c0a9116f6604c39e4c4/1472_425_2732_3415/800.jpg\" alt=\"Packham declares his support for Extinction Rebellion as he delivers the annual Bafta television lecture in January\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All these young people give me a sense of hope\u2019 ...

Here he is with an owl, now with a badger. He is much more evangelist than showman.&nbsp;\u201cI probably got as much joy out of other people reconnecting with nature as I have got from reconnecting with nature myself,\u201d he says of the lockdown period. \u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute joy to see people posting pictures with ladybirds on their fingers and frogs in their ponds and birds singing in their gardens, but they will now have to join our ranks and remember what they took from that, because we do have to fight for it.\u201d</p> <p>As the pandemic confined us all to our homes, he and his 25-year-old stepdaughter, Megan McCubbin, launched <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/sibirdclub/\">The Self-Isolating Bird Club</a>: half an hour a day of guerrilla twitching, broadcast on Facebook every morning. \u201cPeople seemed to like it,\u201d he says (7.8 million of them tuned in). He and McCubbin have since taken their double act to Springwatch. \u201cThe producers of Springwatch liked our on-screen rapport. I call it bickering, they call it on-screen rapport.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He is keen to stress that McCubbin is a good, sound zoologist in her own right: \u201cShe knows her stuff, she likes science and understanding things. She loves finding out things that I don\u2019t know and she does that very easily.\u201d You would struggle to say who is the straight man of the double act \u2013 they are both incredibly, winningly geeky.</p> <p>McCubbin is the daughter of Packham\u2019s ex-partner, Jo McCubbin. They split up years ago, but Packham remained a large and influential part of her life \u2013 she came to zoology partly thanks to time she spent at the Isle of Wight zoo run by Packham\u2019s partner, Charlotte Corney. He describes these relationships as \u201ca relatively confused \u2013 but not too unusual, these days \u2013 family setup.\u201d They all get on very well. \u201cCharlotte goes to Jo\u2019s parties; I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not a party sort of person.\u201d (I am reminded of the joke about the doctor, the lawyer and the mathematician who are each asked whether it is better to have a wife or a mistress. The doctor says it is better for your health to be married. The lawyer says it is better for your finances to be unmarried. The mathematician says: \u201cIt is better to have a wife&nbsp;and<em>&nbsp;</em>a mistress \u2013 then they can chat and you can go off and do maths.\u201d)</p> <p>He is relatively equanimous about the restrictions of the pandemic, as you might imagine of a person who does not like parties. But he is deadly serious about Covid-19. \u201cSpeaking entirely biologically, what the whole, horribly harsh, tragic lesson of the virus has taught us is that we are part of nature; we\u2019re not there to hold dominion over it, we\u2019re not above it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A global conversation about how many people the planet can sustain is something that has to happen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always been exposed to pathogens \u2013 everything from smallpox to bubonic plague. We\u2019ve beaten them through our advances in science and I\u2019m not regretting that. But we are an organism, living on a planet, and the way we were living was unsustainable. We were overcrowded, we were eating animals that we\u2019d shipped alive from one part of the world to another, and we\u2019re paying a terrible price for it.\u201d</p> <p>This is not a million miles away from the putative Extinction Rebellion (XR) stickers, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-52039662\">disavowed by the group as fake</a>, that read \u201cCorona is the cure, humans are the virus\u201d. But he reiterates that he is not against medical advances; he is very much in favour of people living long and healthy lives. Nevertheless, he does not situate the plight of mankind at the centre of his thinking; we are no more than one part of an infinitely precious ecosystem \u2013 and we are the part causing the problems.</p> <p>This is the kernel of his radicalism \u2013 and no broadcaster\u2019s duty of impartiality will make him disavow it, nor his support for XR and similar movements. \u201cThat\u2019s the most positive thing that we\u2019ve seen \u2013 Extinction Rebellion, <a href=\"https://fridaysforfuture.org/\">Fridays for Future</a>. All those young people have taken to the streets, in an informed way and in a peaceful way. That\u2019s been absolutely heartening. That gives me a sense of hope.</p> <p>\u201cAnd again, in the last week, we\u2019ve seen all of these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/protests-george-floyd-black-lives-matter-saturday\">demonstrations because of continued racism</a>. Some of them have been violent. I never support violence, but a lot of people are very, very angry. When people reach that tipping point, they no longer sit in bars; they take to the streets and demand their rights. We need to be demanding a right to a healthy environment and I think we\u2019ve started to do that.\u201d (I spoke to Packham before the Bristol protest at which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">the statue of Edward Colston was torn down</a>, so this should not be taken as a comment on that, but my impression is that his heart is with the angry protesters, rather than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jun/08/what-bristol-should-erect-in-place-of-toppled-colston-statue-black-lives-matter\">those bemoaning the civil unrest</a>.)&nbsp;</p> <p>In his sentiment and his delivery \u2013 quietly passionate, unabashed by what is and is not considered acceptable \u2013 Packham is very like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\">Greta Thunberg</a>, who often says that she thinks her Asperger\u2019s is part of what makes her the activist she is.

Not as a young child, but later, when I was an adolescent and going in to my 20s. And my hope in speaking about it openly was that young people wouldn\u2019t suffer in the same way. Because if they had a better understanding, and the people around them had a better understanding, life would be a lot easier. And it\u2019s been quite heart-rending; more people come up to me and talk about autism than do about natural history.\u201d</p> <p>His job, though, is the same in both cases \u2013 to explain things, he says, in relatively simple ways. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that in a patronising way. I just mean speaking frankly and plainly.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The last time I interviewed Packham was five years ago. Back then, while powerfully exercised about animal cruelty, he was much more comfortable on the territory of other species, patiently explaining why he preferred birds to mammals (\u201cI like feathers better than fur; I think eggs are neater than placental matter; I like things that fly rather than things that walk; and \u2013 this is a subjective thing \u2013 they\u2019re a more beautiful organism\u201d). But the geopolitical intensity of the world we are in now draws him back constantly to our species. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest: a lot of the governments that have mishandled the corona crisis are not going to survive it. I sincerely hope that there will be a huge peaceful shake-up and people will start moving in the right direction.\u201d</p> <p>While he is careful about which governments he means, he is resolute about the right direction: away from fossil fuels and flying; away from careless consumption; away from considering the natural world a resource to exploit. We are good at solutions, but only under pressure. \u201cOne of the stats that I\u2019m always drawn to is that, when Pearl Harbor was attacked, in 1941, 7 December, America was producing 4m cars a year. From that point until the end of the war, they only produced 141. That\u2019s how powerful our ability to respond to problems is. They used that capacity to produce weapons.\u201d</p> <p>I am surprised by the parable \u2013 it does not feel like humanity at its finest, that, when push comes to shove, we will throw everything we have at killing each other better. But he is not a sentimentalist \u2013 whether or not we are capable of great change, we are certainly capable of huge change \u2013 and that is what the world needs.

  "<p>The first time AnneMary Raduva, 16, and her sister Faith, 13, went shopping for sanitary pads after the coronavirus outbreak hit their home of Fiji, they noticed two things: there were barely any to choose from, and those that were available cost more than before the pandemic.</p> <p>The Pacific region, which is home to some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable communities, has escaped the worst health impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak, but is feeling the full brunt of its economic effect.</p> <p>There have only been 18 confirmed cases of the virus in Fiji (all recovered, and no deaths), but travel restrictions have meant that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/its-catastrophic-fijis-colossal-tourism-sector-devastated-by-coronavirus\">tens of thousands of people across the country have lost jobs associated with tourism</a>, which contributes nearly 40% to Fiji\u2019s gross domestic product \u2013 about FJ$2bn (AU$1.4bn) \u2013 and directly or indirectly employs over 150,000 people in various industries.</p> <p>As imports have become limited and incomes have dropped, women in Fiji have reported that prices of sanitary goods have increased by between FJ$0.50 and FJ$3 per packet in a country where the minimum wage is $2.32 an hour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1428571108a0688abd3b83ca665bfa95a25be68c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1428571108a0688abd3b83ca665bfa95a25be68c/0_224_3543_2128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AnnMary Raduva (right) and her sister Faith with the dignity kits they have helped to put together, which contain sanitary pads, a toothbrush, toothpaste and soap.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">AnnMary Raduva (right) and her sister Faith with the dignity kits they have helped to put together, which contain sanitary pads, a toothbrush, toothpaste and soap.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jovesa Naisua/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPads are sold from FJ$3 to $7 or more,\u201d said AnneMary. \u201cFor a family that is struggling financially, those extra dollars can be stretched to buy an extra loaf of bread, canned tuna, and a slice of butter.
