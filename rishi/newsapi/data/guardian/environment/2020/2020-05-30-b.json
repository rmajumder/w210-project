  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Pope begs world leaders to provide coronavirus relief</h2> <p>Pope Francis<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2b1518f087122eca528f3#block-5ed2b1518f087122eca528f3\">implored world leaders on Saturday</a> to act wisely and generously to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments to instead be used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future.</p> <h2>Top health scientists blame British PM\u2019s chief adviser for losing public trust</h2> <p>Britain\u2019s top public health leaders and scientists have warned the prime minister, Boris Johnson, that trust in the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/30/dominic-cummings-has-broken-covid-19-policy-trust-say-top-scientists\">has been shattered by the Dominic Cummings affair</a> and this now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Johnson\u2019s top aide has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/30/tory-poll-lead-collapses-as-voters-say-cummings-should-go\">Opinium poll for the Observer</a>&nbsp;shows 81% of people believe Cummings broke the lockdown rules, and 68%, including 52% of Conservative supporters, think he should resign. The poll also shows the Tories\u2019 lead over Labour has crashed from 26 points at the end of March to just four points now.</p> <h2>Romania\u2019s PM pays fine for breaching own Covid-19 rules</h2> <p>Romania\u2019s prime minister, Ludovic Orban, paid a 3,000 lei fine ($687/\u00a3556) on Saturday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2ba5a8f087122eca52913#block-5ed2ba5a8f087122eca52913\">for breaking his own coronavirus restrictions</a> by not wearing a face mask and smoking indoors. A picture which went viral on social media shows Orban in his office, sitting around a table with several other cabinet members, smoking a cigarette while none of them wore masks.</p> <h2>Russia to start vaccine trial within two weeks</h2> <p>Russian scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2b7518f08f5e3730118f2#block-5ed2b7518f08f5e3730118f2\">plan to start clinical trials within two weeks</a> on a vaccine to combat coronavirus, the health minister was quoted as saying on Saturday as authorities approved the country\u2019s first anti-Covid-19 drug, Avifavir.</p> <h2>Greece to test arrivals coming from EU\u2019s high-risk airports</h2> <p>Greece <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2b4e98f08f5e3730118ec#block-5ed2b4e98f08f5e3730118ec\">will conduct coronavirus tests</a> on visitors arriving from airports deemed high-risk by the European Union\u2019s aviation safety agency, EASA, when it opens its airports to tourism traffic on 15 June. EASA regularly updates a list of airports located in affected areas with high risk of coronavirus transmission, which include 13 in the UK, all airports in 22 US states, and those in the Ile de France region surrounding Paris.</p> <h2>Mexican healthcare workers to protest for better protection</h2> <p>Frontline workers in Mexico City\u2019s hospitals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2d9cf8f084df971c8cc0b#block-5ed2d9cf8f084df971c8cc0b\">are planning a national march</a> on Monday to demand appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Nurses and other health workers account for about a quarter of all of Mexico\u2019s coronavirus infections, government data shows, one of the highest rates in the world.</p> <h2>South Africa\u2019s infection cases top 30,000</h2> <p>The country\u2019s detected coronavirus infections <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed2be3f8f087122eca52924#block-5ed2be3f8f087122eca52924\">now exceed 30,000</a>, the health minister,<strong> </strong>Zweli Mkhize, said on Saturday. South Africa reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967. Its death toll increased by 32 to 643.</p> <h2>Record daily death toll in Pakistan</h2> <p>Pakistan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed290808f08f5e37301180d#block-5ed290808f08f5e37301180d\">has reported 78 coronavirus deaths on Saturday</a>, a single day record since the pandemic arrived in the country in March. The country has recorded 135 deaths in the past two days and over 5,000 new cases, with health experts warning of a steep rise in the number of infections in coming days.</p> <h2>Colombia to lift quarantine in parts of the country</h2> <p>Colombia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed287238f084df971c8caaa#block-5ed287238f084df971c8caaa\">issued new measures</a> to control the spread of coronavirus in three of its most affected cities on Saturday, including the capital, Bogota, as the rest of the country prepares for quarantine rules to start lifting. It has reported more than 26,600 coronavirus cases and 853 deaths.</p> <h2>Death benefit for New York frontline workers announced</h2> <p>The New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, signed a bill on Saturday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/30/coronavirus-live-news-trump-us-quitting-who-brazil-russia-iran-australia-uk-outbreak?page=with:block-5ed29a078f084df971c8cb0d#block-5ed29a078f084df971c8cb0d\">will grant death benefits</a> to the families of police officers, public health workers and other frontline workers who have died of the coronavirus. \u201cYou gave your lives for us, we will be there for your families going forward,\u201d Cuomo said as he signed the legislation.</p>",

This time they caught a break.</p> \n<p>The Falcon rocket booster, as has become almost routine for SpaceX, returned to Earth after first-stage separation and landed successfully on a recovery ship in the Atlantic for use on a future mission.</p> \n<p>The capsule reached orbit 12 minutes later, and will spend 19 hours chasing the space station 250 miles above the planet before docking on Sunday. Hurley and Bob Behnken, veterans of space shuttle missions, will join their Nasa colleague Chris Cassidy, already resident with two Russian cosmonauts aboard the ISS.</p> \n<p>As a test mission paving the way for regular flights of Dragon later this year, every aspect of the spacecraft\u2019s performance will be analyzed by SpaceX engineers. Behnken and Hurley will remain in orbit for up to 120 days.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been way too long,\u201d Jim Bridenstine, the Nasa administrator, said of the launch. \u201cIt was just an amazing day. I\u2019m breathing a sigh of relief but I won\u2019t be celebrating until Bob and Doug are home safely.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the public was urged to watch the launch remotely because of coronavirus restrictions, Donald Trump and his wife Melania, and Vice-President Mike Pence, attended in person. Trump has made space a priority through the foundation of <a href=\"https://www.spaceforce.mil/\">space </a><a href=\"https://www.spaceforce.mil/\">force</a> as a branch of the US military, independent of Nasa, and the unveiling of his <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-unveiling-america-first-national-space-strategy/\">America First National Space Strategy</a>.</p> \n<p>He has also directed Nasa to land humans on the moon by 2024, for the first time since the final Apollo mission in 1972, although the agency\u2019s deep-space Artemis program is many months behind schedule <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/white-house-requests-significant-nasa-budget-increase-to-fund-artemis-program/\">and over budget</a>.</p> \n<p>Some analysts, see Trump as seeking to exploit space programs set in motion before his presidency for political gain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/30/donald-trump-space-coronavirus-spacex-election\">channeling a message of US global supremacy</a> even amid a pandemic to which his response has been roundly criticized.</p> \n<p>Saturday\u2019s flight was groundbreaking. The four-seat, touch-screen technology Dragon capsule is a 21st-century spacecraft bearing little resemblance to the largely mechanical Apollo capsules of the 1960s and Nasa\u2019s fleet of space shuttle orbiters.</p> \n<p>The crew eschewed the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/behindscenes/astrovan.html\">\u201ctin-can\u201d Astrovan</a> that has been the crew transport since the US began sending humans into space in 1961, traveling to the launchpad in electric cars manufactured by Tesla, another Musk company, listening to music by AC/DC.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"806f1d0b19691d44402e178555b584db7c266e0c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/806f1d0b19691d44402e178555b584db7c266e0c/0_130_3932_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nasa astronauts Douglas Hurley, left, and Robert Behnken wave while seated in a Tesla SUV on their way to Pad 39-A, at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nasa astronauts Douglas Hurley, left, and Robert Behnken wave while seated in a Tesla SUV on their way to Pad 39-A, at the Kennedy Space Center.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Raoux/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Their pressurized flight suits, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-design-spacex-spacesuits-worn-nasa-astronauts-2020-5\">partly designed by Musk himself</a>, look like \u201csomething out the Jetsons\u201d according to Leland Melvin, a former shuttle astronaut.</p> \n<p>Some traditions remain. Dragon fired off from launchpad 39A, site of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u2019s blast-off to the moon in 1969, the first flight of the space shuttle Columbia in 1981 and also the most recent crewed Nasa flight, the 2011 launch of the orbiter Atlantis, piloted by Hurley.</p> \n<p>The launch is another milestone for SpaceX, Musk\u2019s company, which has been ferrying cargo to the ISS aboard uncrewed spacecraft. One of two contractors under Nasa\u2019s $6.2bn commercial crew program, SpaceX stole a march on Boeing by completing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/19/spacex-crew-capsule-escape-test-rocket-explodes-nasa-space-station\">uncrewed abort test</a> in January. Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule suffered an in-flight anomaly during its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/22/nasa-boeing-starliner-capsule-lands-safely-new-mexico\">test flight in December</a>. Future launch dates are under review.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to believe this is real,\u201d Musk, the billionaire PayPal founder who doubles as the California-based company\u2019s chief engineer, said before Wednesday\u2019s launch attempt.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a dream come true for me and everyone at SpaceX, the result of a tremendous number of smart people working tremendously hard to make this day happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>SpaceX has overcome challenges of its own. A Crew Dragon capsule was destroyed in a <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2200406-spacex-crew-dragon-capsule-lost-after-anomaly-during-ground-test/\">ground test explosion</a> at Cape Canaveral in April 2019 and in 2015, a Falcon rocket <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/public_summary_nasa_irt_spacex_crs-7_final.pdf\">blew up 139 seconds into flight</a>.

And that\u2019s been one of the ways that Musk has been able to make the progress and carry out the innovation that SpaceX has brought about.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe age of the public-private partnership in spaceflight is here. Whether Nasa is going to save a lot of money by paying SpaceX rather than paying the Russians, that\u2019s not clear. But the money is staying in the US. And for strategic and geopolitical reasons it\u2019s good to have our own human launch capability.\u201d</p> \n<p>Since 2011, Nasa has been forced to rely on the Russian space agency, purchasing seats aboard ageing Soyuz spacecraft for up to $85m apiece. If this mission, known formally as SpaceX Demo-2, is successful, all that has changed.</p>",
  "<p>A federal government scientific report has issued a warning about chemicals used in unconventional gas drilling in the sensitive wild rivers of the <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.gov.au/water/national/lake-eyre-basin/about\">Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre basin</a>.</p> \n<p>As the government weighs up recommendations to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/leaked-covid-19-commission-report-calls-for-australian-taxpayers-to-underwrite-gas-industry-expansion\">expand the gas industry </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/leaked-covid-19-commission-report-calls-for-australian-taxpayers-to-underwrite-gas-industry-expansion\">for a post-coronavirus recovery</a>, the western rivers of Queensland loom as a significant test for how authorities will balance economics with the environment.</p> \n<p>The rivers and floodplains that fracture and snake towards the great inland lake are largely unaffected by the sort of developments and other interventions that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/14/water-wars-will-politics-destroy-the-murray-darling-basin-plan-and-the-river-system-itself\">made a mess of the Murray-Darling system</a>.

But for a lot of Australian growers, it is a handy part of their cropping program, with the end product either sold as malting barley or feed supply, two thirds of which goes to the export market.

After breeding, they migrate across Bass Strait and spend autumn and winter feeding on flowering gums along the NSW south coast before returning to Tasmania\u2019s southern forest region to breed again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89b2a09d62c984631cd5f280829b1c61fc46d374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89b2a09d62c984631cd5f280829b1c61fc46d374/0_244_3660_2196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The swift parrot is found nowhere else on the planet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The swift parrot is found nowhere else on the planet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Tzaros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The parrot was first listed as endangered in 2000, just after the EPBC Act was introduced. It was upgraded to critically endangered in 2016, meaning it faces an extremely high risk of extinction. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to turn it around,\u201d Ingwersen says.</p> <p>The bird was selected by the federal government five years ago for inclusion in a \u201c20 birds by 2020\u201d plan, a strategy that was meant to improve the trajectory of nominated species. But the parrot\u2019s plight has continued to worsen due to an exemption in Australia\u2019s environment laws that makes it legal to log both its breeding habitat in Tasmania and its feeding habitat in NSW.</p> <p>The exemption applies to all areas covered by a regional forestry agreement, a bilateral agreement between states and territories. Forestry operations subject to an agreement do not have to be assessed under federal environment law for their impact on nationally listed threatened species.</p> <p>The consequence has been continued habitat loss, one of the key drivers of extinction.</p> <p>Ingwersen says the recovery team has worked hard across the swift parrot\u2019s range to try to help it survive. It has conducted monitoring to gather data, worked with private landowners on habitat restoration, and invested in research to reduce the impact of sugar gliders, which prey on swift parrots.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an overreach to say a lot of that work is being undermined if we keep taking habitat out of the Tasmanian forests and out of the south coast forests in NSW where they feed,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/29/extinction-is-a-choice-margaret-atwood-on-tasmanias-forests-and-saving-the-swift-parrot\">'Extinction is a choice\u2019: Margaret Atwood on Tasmania's forests and saving the swift parrot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Tasmania, researchers from the Australian National University examined forest loss from logging in important swift parrot breeding areas in the southern forest between 2007 and 2016.

  "<p>We are in a public health crisis unprecedented in living memory. We have written to the prime minister because we are very concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the public. There is ample evidence that effective epidemic control requires the public to trust and respect both the messages and the messengers who are advocating action. This trust has been badly damaged by the actions of Dominic Cummings, including his failure to stand down or resign in the public interest, and Boris Johnson\u2019s subsequent unwillingness to remove him.</p> <p>As lockdown is eased, public trust and high compliance is essential to reduce the risk of a second spike in infections and deaths. It is vital for all people in positions of power to follow the rules with the same discipline as the rest of the population. The public also needs to see that the necessary infrastructure and effective systems are put in place rapidly and effectively.</p> <p>A national track and trace scheme is a major undertaking. This makes it even more crucial that there is complete transparency about likely time scales and the risks associated with the strategy and plan. The public mood is fragile and unlikely to cope with another over-optimistic target-based strategy that goes on to fail. We are also concerned that the needs of people primarily affected by non-Covid-19 diseases are being neglected. For example, since the pandemic hit, there has been a 70% or more reduction in cancer diagnoses and there is an estimated backlog of 100,000 undiagnosed or untreated cancer cases (growing by about 5,000 a week). Similar backlogs are evident in every non-communicable disease. </p> <p>This exceptional situation also requires urgent and detailed planning and investment. We ask that the prime minister better harness the expertise in the NHS, social care, local authorities, academic institutions and the civil service to strengthen the response to Covid-19 and its knock-on effects on other health and care provision. We would be happy to assist in mobilising an effective strategic and operational response.</p> <p><strong>Professor Maggie Rae</strong>, president of the Faculty of Public Health, <strong>Professor Elio Riboli</strong>, Imperial College London, <strong>Professor David McCoy</strong>, Queen Mary University London, <strong>Professor David Hunter</strong>, University of Oxford, <strong>Professor Trish Greenhalgh</strong>, University of Oxford, <strong>Mike Gill</strong>, former regional director of Public Health, south-east England, <strong>Professor Raj Bhopal</strong>, University of Edinburgh, <strong>Professor Martin McKee</strong>, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, <strong>Professor George Davey Smith</strong>, University of Bristol, <strong>Professor Ruth Gilbert</strong>, University College London, <strong>Professor Neil Pearce</strong>, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, <strong>Professor Helen Ward</strong>, Imperial College London, <strong>Professor Mark S Gilthorpe</strong>, University of Leeds and Alan Turing Institute, <strong>Professor Adrian Martineau</strong>, Queen Mary University London, <strong>Professor Allyson Pollock</strong>, University of Newcastle, <strong>Dr Rochelle Burgess</strong>, UCL Institute for Global Health, <strong>Professor Paolo Vineis</strong>, Imperial College London, <strong>Anne Wilson</strong>, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, <strong>Dr Tim Colbourn</strong>, University College London, <strong>Professor Majid Ezzati</strong>, Imperial College London,<strong> Professor Deborah Ashby</strong>, Imperial College London, <strong>Professor Sonia Saxena</strong>, Imperial College London, <strong>Professor Richard Healey</strong>, University of Portsmouth, <strong>Professor Deborah A Lawlor</strong>, Bristol Medical School, <strong>Professor Guiqing Lily Yao</strong>, University of Leicester, <strong>Dr Nisreen Alwan</strong>, Southampton University<br></p> <h2>Don\u2019t blame tobacco <br></h2> <p>Catherine Bennett obviously can\u2019t look at a smoker enjoying their cigarette (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/david-hockney-may-be-a-great-painter-but-dont-listen-to-him-on-matters-of-health\" title=\"\">David Hockney may be a great painter but don\u2019t listen to him on matters of health</a>\u201d, Comment).

One problem is the armchair anthropologists who use Ikea and Abba jokes to authoritatively critique Swedish culture (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/may/23/sweden-covid-19-policy-model-for-right-also-a-deadly-folly\" title=\"\">Sweden\u2019s Covid policy is a model for the right. It\u2019s also a deadly folly</a>\u201d, Comment). </p> <p>We do not blindly trust the government. We read the news, we watch the public health agency\u2019s briefings and we make our own decisions. We are both communal and individualistic in ways that may seem contradictory to outsiders but usually make sense to us. Moreover, defining Swedishness misses the point. What is more useful is to examine how Swedish culture is defined, used (and abused), by whom, to what audience and why.</p> <p>The question is not why Swedes are like this or that, it is this: what is so provocative about their approach that compels the international media to construct a drama about our Covid-19 experience?<br><strong>Rachel Irwin, </strong>researcher<br>Lund University, Sweden<br></p> <h2>Give hope to young people <br></h2> <p>The call of those committed to action to help young people was relevant and timely (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/an-open-letter-why-we-need-a-national-youth-corps\" title=\"\">An open letter: why we need a National Youth Corps</a>\u201d, Comment). The idea of a Youth Corps is not new. From 1998, the New Deal for the Young and Unemployed incorporated a range of options to tackle head on youth unemployment, following the Labour victory. As education and employment secretary, I and colleagues could take this forward because of the investment made available by Gordon Brown through the levy on the profits of the utilities. What was interesting in terms of the take-up (up to 100,000 in the first year) was the desire of young people to rejoin education and training, but their lack of enthusiasm for opportunities where they could not see a medium-term prospect of a job.</p> <p>In my view, it will not be possible to scale up such a project in the time frame set out by the authors of the letter but, if a start was made now, over several months a significant contribution could be made to counteracting the despair and alienation that many young people will feel if they cannot access education, training or a job.<br><strong>David Blunkett</strong><br>House of Lords, London SW1<br> </p> <h2>My father\u2019s anti-fascist fight<br></h2> <p>Harriet Sherwood\u2019s article about the 43 Group brought back a piece of my family\u2019s history (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/24/the-british-jews-who-fought-postwar-fascism-on-londons-streets\" title=\"\">The Jews who fought postwar fascists on the streets of London</a>\u201d, News).

  "<p>Foreigners can sometimes see a country with the greatest clarity. British politicians and journalists, who think themselves sophisticated, watched Dominic Cummings\u2019 press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on Monday \u2013 along with countless citizens outraged by elite double standards. To my knowledge, only one viewer saw the trick Cummings was pulling. It wasn\u2019t an opposition MP or hot-shot reporter but Jens Wiechers, a data protection consultant from Cologne.</p> <p>Wiechers had the wit to do what the Cummingses of this world hate above all else: check. He found that, for all his inflated reputation, Cummings is nothing more than a sneaky little cheat.</p> <p>The context of his charlatanism matters because it connects the Cummings-Johnson administration to the global attempt to delegitimise criticism. A section of the UK right is desperate <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/news/uk-press-freedom-under-threat-lockdown-government-dismisses-reporting-campaigning-newspapers\">to shift blame</a> for this government\u2019s inability to govern to \u201cthe media\u201d. Online mobs hounded television reporters last week, as government loyalists rallied behind the banner of #scummedia.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cummings\u2019 evidence that the media were running \u2018false stories\u2019 against him was a false story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cummings gave them the marching orders. He wanted Tories to believe he was not a hypocrite who broke the lockdown his government instructed others to obey. Rather he was <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dominic-cummings-statement-speech-transcript-durham-full-text-read-lockdown-a9531856.html\">the victim</a> of \u201cnumerous false stories in the media about my actions and statements regarding Covid\u201d. Journalists, he continued, claimed he had opposed the lockdown and \u201cdid not care\u201d about the mass deaths. Nothing could be further from the truth, the radical disrupter of the stodgy status quo explained. He possessed a prescience that bordered on the magical. He could prove he cared because as long ago as last year he \u201cwrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning\u201d.</p> <p>Viewers might have wondered why, if Cummings was warning about coronaviruses in 2019, his government had failed so abjectly to protect the British in 2020. You saw it coming, and still messed up? They might have thought twice before believing the man who gave us the outright falsehood that <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/350-million-week-boris-johnson-statistics-authority-misuse/\">Brexit would deliver \u00a3350m</a> to the NHS in the 2016 referendum campaign.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t doubt him because lies are so common in contemporary politics they blow past us like dust in the wind. No one checked, apart from Wiechers. \u201cIn retrospect, I could pretend I knew not to believe Cummings and Johnson,\u201d he told me from Germany, where he watches British and American public life with a horrified fascination. \u201cBut I began by wondering what he had written on his blog last year.\u201d</p> <p>He found that Cummings had <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2019/03/04/the-most-secure-bio-labs-routinely-make-errors-that-could-cause-a-global-pandemic-are-about-to-re-start-experiments-on-pathogens-engineered-to-make-them-mammalian-airborne-transmissible/\">posted on 4 March 2019</a> on the dangers of the Sars coronavirus in a wider piece on pandemics. Or so he wanted us to believe. The post struck Wiechers as a lazy piece of writing filled with extracts from the work of others. The now suspicious Wiechers checked Cummings\u2019 blog on <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/\">the Wayback Machine</a>, a digital library that tracks changes to billions of web pages. It showed Cummings had added the reference to coronaviruses between 9 April and 3 May 2020. Further research showed Cummings\u2019 own site recorded that the post was edited at 8:55pm on 14 April precisely, the day Cummings told the public he had returned from his trip to Durham.</p> <p>The man\u2019s deviousness was breathtaking. His evidence that the media were running \u201cfalse stories\u201d against him was a false story. As striking was his ridiculous vanity: Cummings cared so neurotically about his reputation as a prophet that he forged the record so it appeared that he was warning of the \u201curgent need\u201d to plan for a corona pandemic while the minds of lesser men and women were elsewhere.</p> <p>The vanity is more than striking, it is essential to the right\u2019s attempt to maintain its power. Supporters of strongmen do not want populist leaders who are \u201cjust like us\u201d. They want to believe their heroes are smarter and better. The manufacture of the myth of exceptional talent is as important to the strongman as the ability to turn their voters against journalists, judges and any other independent group that might check them. Liberals should not laugh at Trump\u2019s boast that he is a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d. Trump has persuaded his core supporters to believe that he is a superman, who can master any problem and cut any deal, ever since he first ran for president.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now more than ever, Johnson wants Conservatives to believe in the illusion of his talent</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Boris Johnson spent years showing off his superficial understanding of the classics by picking up Latin phrases from his well-thumbed dictionary of quotations and dropping them into his articles. A little learning was not a dangerous thing for him but a smart career move. It convinced conservative-inclined voters that Johnson had enjoyed the education of the old imperial ruling class and was not the lightweight he appeared to be. The fact that hardly any educated person studies Latin and Greek today made it easier for Johnson to bluff his way to the top when so few could see the vacuity behind the pose.</p> <p>His administration has presided over thousands of needless deaths. It has never got on top of the virus. A terrible recession is all but upon us, and it\u2019s likely that Tory zealotry will destroy the chance of a decent deal with the European Union that a broken country needs. Now more than ever, Johnson wants Conservatives to believe in the illusion of his talent.</p> <p>Unlike Trump and Johnson, Cummings is not trying to fool the public but fool the fool who employs him \u2013 not the hardest of tasks, I grant you. He sinks to the level of the petty cheat because he must convince Johnson that he is a political mastermind.</p> <p>Don\u2019t be fooled as well. Too many liberals see Cummings as a manipulative demon with supernatural powers, when the most frightening thing about him, and Johnson, is their pathetic inability to control events. They are not evil geniuses but lazy, dogmatic and incompetent men, whose shabbiness is revealed as much by their little deceits as grand blunders. Don\u2019t inflate them into monsters, who can never be beaten. Draw courage from their littleness.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

That performance took about 18 hours and led to critics and audience members falling asleep.</p> <p>\u201cIt has always been a strong wish of mine to be able to perform Eric Satie\u2019s Vexations,\u201d Levit said. \u201cWhile it was written in the 19th century, this piece was revolutionary thanks to its atonal harmony. The few notes \u2013 a theme and two variations \u2013 fit on just one sheet. The repetitions heralded early on a future of aesthetic repetitiveness.\u201d</p> <p>Levit has said he does not expect people to listen to his entire performance.</p>",
  "<p>In addition to washing your hands while singing the first two verses of The Internationale, it might be a good time also to clean out your Twitter feed. According to a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/20/859814085/researchers-nearly-half-of-accounts-tweeting-about-coronavirus-are-likely-bots?t=1590582560153\">recent report</a> of a research study by Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/\">Center for Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems</a>, about 45% of the false narratives about Covid-19 on Twitter are sent by bots.</p> <p>The study examined more than 100 false Covid narratives (including the 5G conspiracy theories) pushed in over 200m tweets since January. If you\u2019re a reader of this newspaper, the likelihood is that you never saw any of these. But that\u2019s because you are \u2013 like me \u2013 cheerfully encased in your own filter bubble. I write with feeling on this matter, because on the morning after the Brexit referendum I went through the list of about 800 people whom I follow on Twitter, and I could not locate a single one who seemed to have been in favour of Brexit in the run-up to the vote. The shock felt by them after the vote was palpable. But it was also a salutary reminder that anyone who uses social media lives in a digital echo chamber.</p> <p>To those who study computational propaganda, the findings will come as no surprise. Philip Howard\u2019s group at the <a href=\"https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/working-papers/bots-strongerin-and-brexit-computational-propaganda-during-the-uk-eu-referendum/\">Oxford Internet Institute</a> has been doing great work in this field for several years. It would be nice to think that the mainstream media might have learned a thing or two from this work. If it had, it might have learned that just as you cannot believe anything you read in a British tabloid newspaper, you should never regard what\u2019s \u201ctrending\u201d on Twitter as anything other than an artefact of robotic amplification.</p> <p>But bots are not the only problem facing Twitter. An equally difficult challenge is that presented by Donald J Trump, currently the president of the US. Twitter was a medium made for Trump, and he has exploited it masterfully ever since he contemplated running for public office. Although his campaign adroitly exploited targeted advertising on Facebook, Twitter was always how Trump directly communicated with his base. He currently has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump\">80.3 million followers</a> and has tweeted over 52,000 times. And while nobody was surprised that he campaigned using Twitter, nobody in the liberal (or even the conservative) establishment dreamed that, once elected, he would <em>govern</em> by tweet. Which is why the ingenious <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealPressSecBot\">@RealPressSecBot</a> bot that transforms Trump tweets into the proper presidential White House statement format is both such a good joke, and so depressing.</p> <p>The fact that Twitter has allowed Trump to abuse the service by spreading lies, libels, conspiracy theories, nonsense and racist abuse continuously since he was elected has infuriated many people. Anyone else doing that kind of stuff would long ago have been banned from the platform. But to date, the company\u2019s executives have shrunk from doing anything about the tweeter-in-chief. They have two reasons for their forbearance, one good and one bad. The good reason is fear for their lives. There are <a href=\"http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/de/weapons-and-markets/tools/global-firearms-holdings.html\">an estimated 392m </a><a href=\"http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/de/weapons-and-markets/tools/global-firearms-holdings.html\">unregistered firearms</a> in the US, and my hunch is that banning Trump would eventually result in a <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/charlie-hebdo\">Charlie</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/charlie-hebdo\"> Hebdo</a></em>-type attack on the company by alt-right fanatics. The bad reason is that Trump is good for \u201cuser engagement\u201d, which is the holy grail of all social media platforms.</p> <p>This week, though, they took a baby step towards trying to rein him in. After <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255835124539392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1265255845358645254%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fmay%2F26%2Ftrump-twitter-fact-check-warning-label\">he tweeted</a>: \u201cThere is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.

The links led to a CNN story that said Trump\u2019s claims were unsubstantiated and to a list of bullet points that Twitter had compiled rebutting the inaccuracies.</p> <p>In any normally run polity, this would have been an unremarkable step for a platform to take.&nbsp;In the crazily polarised society that the US has become, though, it will be seen by Trump and his fans as an affront to his Supreme Leadership. Not quite on the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> scale of publishing cartoons of the Prophet, perhaps, but an affront nonetheless.&nbsp;At best, legions of bots will now be enlisted to pump abuse at the Twitter bosses and pump more misinformation about postal voting to ordinary users of the platform.&nbsp;More dangerous \u2013 not only to Twitter but to&nbsp;the business models of&nbsp;all social-media companies \u2013 would be a move by a vengeful Trump to use the nuclear option\u2019 of removing the shelter provided by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act\">Section 230 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act</a> which frees online platforms from legal liability for what users post on their platforms.&nbsp;Ironically, though, if Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/trump-draft-order-could-expose-twitter-and-facebook-to-more-lawsuits\">did deploy that weapon</a>, then the rest of us would be free to sue Twitter for what the president tweets!<br></p> <h2>What I\u2019ve been reading</h2> <p><strong>Bringing it all back home</strong><br>\u201cHow to fix globalisation \u2013 for Detroit, not Davos\u201d is a really <a href=\"https://www.the-american-interest.com/2020/05/22/how-to-fix-globalization-for-detroit-not-davos/\">fascinating interview</a> on the American Interest site with Lawrence Summers, a former US treasury secretary.</p> <p><strong>A time of loss</strong><br>There\u2019s an unexpectedly <a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/what-we-leave-behind\">moving post</a>, called \u201cWhat We Leave Behind\u201d, about the Covid-19 fallout by Scott Galloway on his blog.</p> <p><strong>No more robot overlords</strong><br>In a <em>New York Times</em> article, Ben Schneiderman lays out his view that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/technology/ben-shneiderman-automation-humans.html\">we need machines to augment human capabilities</a> rather than replace us.</p>",
  "<p>When Noopur Raje\u2019s husband fell critically ill with Covid-19 in mid-March, she did not suspect that she too was infected with the virus.</p> <p>Raje, an oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, had been caring for her sick husband for a week before driving him to an emergency centre with a persistently high fever. But after she herself had a diagnostic PCR test \u2013 which looks for traces of the Sars-CoV-2 virus DNA in saliva \u2013 she was astounded to find that the result was positive.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband ended up very sick,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was in intensive care for a day, and in hospital for 10 days. But while I was also infected, I had no symptoms at all. I have no idea why we responded so differently.\u201d</p> <p>It took two months for Raje\u2019s husband to recover. Repeated tests, done every five days, showed that Raje remained infected for the same length of time, all while remaining completely asymptomatic. In some ways it is unsurprising that the virus persisted in her body for so long, given that it appears her body did not even mount a detectable immune response against the infection.</p> <p>When they both took an antibody test earlier this month, Raje\u2019s husband showed a high level of antibodies to the virus, while Raje appeared to have no response at all, something she found hard to comprehend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a44884c483a130d1495e9bbbd11d6fa4e43164c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a44884c483a130d1495e9bbbd11d6fa4e43164c7/0_0_5208_3472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beachgoers in Brighton last weekend\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beachgoers in Brighton last weekend \u2013 if many of us are carrying the virus, mask-wearing in public may become mandatory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people are able to be colonised with the virus and not be symptomatic, while others end up with pretty severe illness. I think it\u2019s something to do with differences in immune regulation, but we still haven\u2019t figured out exactly how this is happening.\u201d</p> <p>Epidemiological studies are now revealing that the number of individuals who carry and can pass on the infection, yet remain completely asymptomatic, is larger than originally thought. Scientists believe these people have contributed to the spread of the virus in care homes, and they are central in the debate regarding face mask policies, as health officials attempt to avoid new waves of infections while societies reopen.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You don\u2019t need to be coughing to transmit a respiratory infection: talking, singing, even blowing a vuvuzela\u2026</p> <footer> <cite>Rein Houben</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the realisation that asymptomatic people can spread an infection is not completely surprising. For starters, there is the famous early 20th century case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/10/typhoid-mary-super-spreader-history\">\u201cTyphoid Mary\u201d,</a> a cook who infected 53 people in various households in the US with typhoid fever despite displaying no symptoms herself. In fact, all bacterial, viral and parasitic infections \u2013 ranging from malaria to HIV \u2013 have a certain proportion of asymptomatic carriers. Research has even shown that at any one time, all of us are infected <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X16302403#bib1\">with between eight and 12 viruses</a>, without showing any symptoms.</p> <p>From the microbe\u2019s perspective, this makes perfect evolutionary sense. \u201cFor any virus or bacteria, making people infectious but not ill is an excellent way to spread and persist in populations,\u201d says Rein Houben, an infectious diseases researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine.</p> <p>However, when Covid-19 was identified at the start of the year, many public health officials both in the UK and around the world failed to account for the threat posed by asymptomatic transmission. This is largely because they were working on models based on influenza, where some estimates suggest that only 5% of people infected are asymptomatic. As a result, the large scale diagnostic testing regimes required to pick up asymptomatic Covid-19 cases were not in place until too late.</p> <p>\u201cI warned on 24 January to <a href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-news-reports-that-the-china-coronavirus-may-spread-before-symptoms-show/\">consider asymptomatic cases</a> as a transmission vehicle for Covid-19, but this was ignored at the time,\u201d says Bill Keevil, professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton. \u201cSince then, many countries have reported asymptomatic cases, never showing obvious symptoms, but shedding virus.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Finding the real number of asymptomatic patients</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028\">first identified case</a> of asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 occurred in early January, when a traveller from Wuhan passed on the virus to five family members in different parts of the city of Anyang. After testing positive, she then remained asymptomatic for the entire 21-day follow-up period.</p> <p>While scientists still don\u2019t know whether asymptomatic people are as contagious as those who display symptoms, there are still many ways in which they can pass on Covid-19. \u201cWe know that you don\u2019t need to be coughing to transmit a respiratory infection like Sars-CoV-2,\u201d says Houben. \u201cTalking, singing, even <a href=\"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0020086\">blowing instruments like a vuvuzela</a> \u2013 in the past all of those have been shown to transmit respiratory viruses in some way.\u201d</p> <p>Since January, the race has been on to try and identify just how many asymptomatic cases are out there, with <a href=\"https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/about/news/sarc-cov-2-infection/\">varying findings</a>. <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20053157v1\">One study</a> in the Italian town of Vo reported that 43% of the town\u2019s cases of Covid-19 were asymptomatic, while initial reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigation into <a href=\"https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/about/news/sarc-cov-2-infection/\">the spread of Covid-19 </a>on the Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier in March, suggest that as many as 58% of cases were asymptomatic. Some 48% of the 1,046 cases of Covid-19 on the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier proved to be asymptomatic while, of the 712 people who tested positive for Covid-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 46% had no symptoms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ff4acdd93a9952c70ff07af74cb8b19cdb6fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45ff4acdd93a9952c70ff07af74cb8b19cdb6fbf/0_94_3887_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French navy sailors wearing face masks seen through a porthole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two thirds of the nearly 2,000 sailors on this French aircraft carrier tested positive, but 48% of those were asymptomatic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAlmost all evidence seems to point to a proportion of asymptomatic infections of around 40%, with a wide range,\u201d says Houben. \u201cThe proportion is also highly variable with age. Nearly all infected children seem to remain asymptomatic, whereas the reverse seems to hold for the elderly.\u201d</p> <p>Houben points out that, because most asymptomatic people have no idea they are infected, they are unlikely to be self-isolating, and studies have shown this has contributed to the rampant spread of the virus in facilities such as <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/14/coronavirus-boston-homeless-testing\">homeless shelters</a> and <a href=\"http://physiciansweekly.com/covid-19-asymptomatic-transmission-fueled-nursing-home-death-toll/\">care homes</a>. He says this means there is a need for regular diagnostic testing of almost all people in such closed environments, including prisons and psychiatric facilities.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to controlling Covid-19, this really shows that we cannot rely on self-isolation of symptomatic cases only,\u201d he says. \u201cGoing forwards we need trace and test approaches to account for individuals who are not reporting any symptoms.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Following Korea\u2019s example</strong></h2> <p>Since February, the country that has arguably had the greatest success in suppressing asymptomatic spread of Covid-19 is South Korea. Armed with a rigorous contact tracing and diagnostic testing regime, which involved dozens of drive-through testing centres across major cities enabling tests to be carried out at a rate of one every 10 minutes, they put specific policies in place to offset the threat of asymptomatic carriers from the moment the virus began to spread out of control in Daegu.</p> <p>\u201cOnce identified, all asymptomatic people are asked to self quarantine in their house until they test negative, with health service officials checking on them twice daily, and monitoring their symptoms,\u201d says Eunha Shim, an epidemiologist at Soongsil University in Seoul.</p> <p>As Korea attempts to prevent a second wave of infections while reopening schools and allowing people to return to offices, preventing asymptomatic spread is one of their main priorities. This is being done by a mass public health campaign advocating the wearing of masks at all times outside the home. In Seoul, it is not possible to access the subway without a mask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e970424f4acbcbeece7846768dd414c410488578\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e970424f4acbcbeece7846768dd414c410488578/0_47_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People queue at an outdoor clinic testing clinic in Bucheon, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People queue at an outdoor clinic testing clinic in Bucheon, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yonhap/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many scientists are increasingly calling for this policy to be officially introduced in the UK, especially as more and more people resume commuting in the coming months. Keevil says: \u201cThere is a strong case to be made for the public wearing appropriate face covers in confined areas such as stations, trains, metro carriages and buses, where it is extremely difficult to maintain the two-metre gap, considered essential to allow respiratory droplets from infected people to fall down before making contact with other people.</p> <p>\u201cThe argument is that face covers may not protect the wearer, but might significantly reduce transmission of virus particles to adjacent people in the closed environment. If there is any benefit to be gained, then everyone should wear a mask, which is why some countries are fining people who do not wear a mask and preventing them travelling.\u201d</p> <p>Some have argued that masks may pose a risk of harm to the wearer because of their potential to become an infectious surface, but Keevil says this can be avoided through proper cleaning.</p> <p>\u201cThere would need to be policies such as, when arriving at work, place the mask immediately in a plastic bag and wash your hands,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then, when returning home, carefully take off the mask and place it immediately in a washing machine for a 60C wash and wash your hands.\u201d</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the UK government endorses this as an official recommendation, but a <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/may/hospitals-are-safer-places-you-might-think-new-covid-19-research-finds\">recent study</a> across Barts NHS Trust hospitals in London has illustrated how regular testing and social distancing combined with use of facial protection \u2013 in this case PPE \u2013 can prevent asymptomatic spread of the virus. Researchers James Moon and Charlotte Manisty said they found that the rate of asymptomatic infection among hospital staff fell from 7% to 1% between the end of March and early May.</p> <p>For Raje, understanding why asymptomatic patients like her respond the way they do to the virus, will have some critical implications for all of us over the coming months, for example in determining whether vaccines turn out to be effective.</p> <p>\u201cThe big question I have after my experience, is whether a vaccine will really work in all people,\u201d she says. \u201cThe vaccination approach is to create an immune response, which then protects you. But if asymptomatic people are not producing a normal antibody response to the virus, what does that mean? Because it\u2019s these people who are the vectors and the carriers of this virus, I think we can\u2019t get away from social distancing until we have some of these answers out there.\u201d</p>",

But it has been exacerbated by coronavirus. People often don\u2019t have anywhere to go,\u201d added Crouch.</p> <p>Kate O\u2019Neill resorted to filling her own tooth twice this month at her home in Stockton-on-Tees. \u201cA filling came out and it was causing me a lot of discomfort,\u201d she said. \u201cI called my dentist in a panic and he left me some paste in a sealed bag outside the practice. I watched a YouTube video and then did it all myself. I was in tears.

  "<p>A look that brings to mind either William Shakespeare or Harry Hill is not one that immediately suggests sophisticated glamour. But big collars are having a resurgence, this time on women\u2019s dresses, tops and jumpsuits.</p> <p>The current look is less Renaissance bard and more pious puritan, and can be dramatic in scale, reaching the shoulders or even down to the belly button.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen a strong demand for the giant collar blouse this spring,\u201d says Elizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director of Net-a-Porter. In general, she says, cotton blouses with exaggerated collars have been its bestselling style for tops, with designers from It-brand Ganni to Miu Miu getting in on the trend. </p> <p>\u201cThe trend started on Instagram as a styling piece, often as a perfect contrast to something more masculine,\u201d says von der Goltz.</p> <p>Prime examples of the look are featured on the Instagram feed of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/double3xposure/\">Reese Blutstein, known as double3xposure to her 305,000 followers</a>, or Man Repeller\u2019s Leandra Medine. Both are recent champions of the big-collared designs of French label Maison Cl\u00e9o.</p> <p>Although expansive collars predate the pandemic, the fact that thousands of people are currently only being viewed from chest up on Zoom calls via laptops and phones has given the look a boost. <a href=\"https://www.amberbutchart.com/\"> Fashion historian Amber Butchart</a> finds a historical echo in the 1930s, as \u201cthe decade that we really start to see film costumes impacting on fashion\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At the moment, people really like getting back to the past</p> <footer> <cite>Marie Dewet</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Butchart cites the work of Adrian, a 1930s costume designer, who put \u201can emphasis above the table\u201d. His ethos for dressing leading ladies was, she explains, that \u201cthe most important details are those that are going to be seen when she\u2019s in close up\u201d. It\u2019s an idea that could have come from the handbook of modern-day social media stars.</p> <p>Butchart also looks to the less recent past, and says today\u2019s collars are reminiscent of the falling-band collars of the 17th century: \u201ca big wide collar that reached the shoulders\u201d and took over from the extravagant Tudor ruff. Often made of expensive lace, the ruff had to be laboriously \u201cstarched, reset and re-pinned every time it was worn\u201d, and was therefore condemned in Puritan pamphlets as \u201cmonstrous\u201d and starched with the \u201cdevil\u2019s liquor\u201d. The fallen-band was made of simpler stuff, often linen, and were \u201cassociated with groups like the Oliver Cromwell\u2019s Puritans.</p> <p>These were also sported by the pilgrims to America. And that, she says, is where \u201cwe get these associations with wholesomeness from\u201d. So, she suggests, these collars could now be part of a rose-tinted nostalgia for a rosy-cheeked past. </p> <p>At Maison Cl\u00e9o, which has been producing big-collared blouses for a few years, this year saw the introduction of vintage trims, in line with the trend for upcycling. Marie Dewet, one half of the team, says: \u201cI think at the moment people really like getting back to the past.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/may/08/how-to-dress-in-lockdown-jess-cartner-morley\">How to dress in lockdown | Jess Cartner-Morley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Blanca Mir\u00f3 and Mar\u00eda de la Orden, the team behind La Veste, who supply their (almost sold-out) collars with scalloped trimmings as separate items as well as on blouses, are&nbsp;inspired by a different kind of past: primary school.

The crowd swelled to about 200 throughout the afternoon, where a steady stream of speakers gave talks and led chants. </p> \n  <p>Kenney Daniels, 57, is African American and has lived in Minneapolis for most of his life, including 22 years in the city\u2019s southern neighborhoods. He expressed concern over the destruction and violence that took place during the last few nights of protests. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just terrible,\u201c he said, \u201cbut people are just fed up with it .. It just gets more intense every 20, 30 years.\u201d Aside from the general danger of destroying properties, he said he worried how the resulting increased presence of law enforcement would affect the conflict. \u201cI hope these officers can be held accountable so that this can stop,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could go a whole another ugly way, for everybody.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Aggie Heart, 59, has lived in south Minneapolis for 40 years. She came Friday with her 29-year-old daughter, Celia Thomas, and Thomas\u2019 four and 12-year-old daughters. Thomas said she hadn\u2019t attended the week\u2019s previous protests because of danger, but wanted to bring her children to the safe environment of the intersection. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think the charges were a little bit lenient,\u201d said Thomas, who is a person of color, \u201cand I just hope they stick.\u201d </p> \n  <p>She expressed dismay at the destruction over the past few days. \u201cI cried for the last few nights, just looking at this place I grew up in \u2013 it\u2019s ruined,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe if something is actually happening, maybe it\u2019s for good.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Brett Davis, 60, is African American and grew up in south Minneapolis, where he has lived for most of his life. He said he thought that the protests, including ones that became destructive, provided necessary pressure for a relatively swift charging decision compared to previous police misconduct cases. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat they did made this happen,\u201d he said, adding that some of the destruction was done by people simply taking a \u201cbadge of opportunity\u201d rather than for the cause. He knows young men involved with some of the destruction well, he said. A history of feeling discriminated against for jobs by area businesses, combined with anger over the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on people of color, contributed to their decisions, he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThey say, we\u2019re not going to do it your old way. We\u2019re not doing the peaceful marches. We\u2019re not going to do all that ...

In 2019, a Facebook spokesperson declined to clarify the company\u2019s policy around violence and hate speech by state actors on the record to the Guardian. The Guardian has contacted Facebook for comment. </p> \n  <p>This is not the first time that Facebook\u2019s exemption of state actors from content rules has been questioned. During the campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya in Myanmar, Facebook banned an insurgent group fighting to defend the Muslim minority while allowing Myanmar\u2019s military, the Tatmadaw, to continue using its platform to spread its propaganda. </p> \n  <p>Facebook subsequently banned a number of ethnic armed organizations in Myanmar, designating the officially recognized groups as the equivalent to terrorist organizations. The move prompted an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/07/facebook-myanmar-genocide-violence-hate-speech\">outcry from human rights experts</a> who said the company\u2019s decision to favor state actors over non-state actors in armed conflict was inconsistent with both international law and human rights. </p> \n  <p>In his lengthy post, Zuckerberg also appeared to suggest that if Facebook had decided Trump\u2019s post was intended to incite violence by civilians, they would have taken it down, writing, \u201cUnlike Twitter, we do not have a policy of putting a warning in front of posts that may incite violence because we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Zuckerberg also criticized Trump, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with how to respond to the President\u2019s tweets and posts all day. Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cI disagree strongly with how the President spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinized out in the open.\u201d </p>

reports on the criminal complaint against Derek Chauvin, which provides new details on the killing of George Floyd. </strong></p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin, the ex-Minneapolis police officer charged today with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with the killing of George Floyd, had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds total, according to the <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/read-the-complaint-charging-derek-chauvin-in-the-death-of-george-floyd/570870791/\">complaint</a>.</p> \n  <p>For two minutes and 53 seconds, Floyd was \u201cnon-responsive\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cPolice are trained that this type of restraint with a subject in a prone position is inherently dangerous,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>As captured in the now-viral video, Floyd repeatedly told the officers \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d before pleading with them, saying \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d. One of the officers responded, \u201cYou are talking fine\u201d as he struggled. </p> \n  <p>The other three officers, identified by authorities as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng, were also fired. According to the complaint, Lane had asked, \u201cShould we roll him on his side?\u201d </p> \n  <p>Chauvin responded, \u201cNo, staying put where we got him.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cI am worried about excited delirium or whatever,\u201d Lane said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we have him on his stomach,\u201d Chauvin said. </p> \n  <p>The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report is still pending, but preliminary findings have determined that a combination of the police hold on Floyd, his underlying health conditions of coronary artery disease and hypertensive heart disease, as well as \u201cany potential intoxicants\u201d likely contributed to his death. </p> \n  <p>Floyd ended up on the ground after Lane pointed his gun at him and instructed him to step out of a car. Lane and Kueng had been responding to a report that someone had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a nearby store, and the store owner identified the person as sitting in a parked car around the corner. There were three people in the car. </p> \n  <p>The officers had handcuffed Floyd and were walking him to their police cruiser when he \u201cstiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Chauvin and Thoa arrived at about 8:14pm. Within five minutes, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck.</p> \n  <p>At 8:25pm, the video \u201cappears to show Mr Floyd ceasing to breathe or speak\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWant to roll him on his side?\u201d Lane asked. Kueng then checked Floyds wrist for a pulse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find one.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cNone of the officers moved from their positions,\u201d the complaint states. </p> \n  <p>At 8:27pm, Chauvin removed his knee. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed192938f087122eca52364\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T23:05:02.715Z\">12.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>While the imagery of fires and broken windows have dominated the news, reporters in the Twin Cities have also been documenting acts of community, solidarity and mutual aid. </strong></p> \n  <p>Chris McGreal is in Minneapolis reporting for the Guardian, where he has spoken with community members volunteering to clean up the neighborhood or keep watch over their neighbors. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMcGreal/status/1266428976723111938\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ayanle Hashi who spent Thursday night guarding his Minneapolis apartment building as crowds looted shops below and neighbouring stores. \u201cThere are disabled and old people in this building.

  "<p>Donald Trump has gifted a record proportion of ambassadorial posts to political appointees, rewarding wealthy supporters with minimal experience at the expense of career diplomats, according to the latest figures.</p> <p>About <a href=\"http://www.afsa.org/appointments-donald-j-trump\">44% of US ambassadors</a> nominated by Trump have been political appointees, compared with a historical average of about 30%, according to the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA). That percentage is getting higher. Out of the ambassador nominations so far this year, 57% have gone to political appointees.</p> <p>The dramatic increase of top posts being given to wealthy entrepreneurs like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/02/lana-marks-trump-us-ambassador-south-africa\">Lana Marks</a> \u2013 a handbag designer made US ambassador to South Africa last year \u2013 could violate the law, which requires most ambassadorial posts to go to state department diplomats, and for ambassadors to have relevant experience.</p> <p>Brett Bruen, a former US diplomat and former head of global engagement in the White House, said the number of ambassadorial openings for career diplomats was even smaller in the list of job openings being circulated this summer.</p> <p>The Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, covering the Americas, has only one ambassadorship on the list, Nicaragua, open to foreign service officers, Bruen said. Citing state department sources, he said that though there were 20 vacancies in Africa this year, the number of ambassador posts in Europe and Asia open to career diplomats was \u201cdramatically down\u201d.</p> <p>The Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires that most ambassadors should be career foreign service officers, that political appointments should be a rarity, and that all appointees should be fully qualified for their positions.</p> <p>\u201cWe are concerned that the percentage of political appointees is higher than at any time in recent history, and also with the number of nominees who do not appear to be qualified for their positions,\u201d Eric Rubin, the AFSA president, said.</p> <p>He urged the US Senate to scrutinise the qualifications of nominees with the aim of returning to the historic norm of between 25% and 35% of posts being reserved for political appointees.</p> <p>\u201cThe current percentage of about 45% is way above historical norms and has a negative impact on our diplomacy and overseas operations,\u201d Rubin said. The Senate has so far overwhelmingly backed Trump\u2019s ambassadorial nominations.</p> <p>A state department spokesperson said: \u201cThis year, like every year, career employees have a number of posts for which they can indicate interest and compete,\u201d adding the number \u201cvaries from year to year\u201d.</p> <p>The practice of giving top diplomatic posts to rich backers came under particular scrutiny during the impeachment crisis, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/20/gordon-sondland-trump-impeachment-ukraine-quid-pro-quo\">Gordon Sondland</a>, a hotelier appointed by Trump as ambassador to the European Union, played a central role in establishing a parallel policy towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> run by Trump and his lawyer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rudygiuliani\">Rudy Giuliani</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/28/us-ambassador-appointments-are-destination-tourism-mega-rich/\">Washington Post</a> has described US ambassadorships as \u201cdestination tourism for the mega-rich\u201d. Ryan Scoville, an associate law professor at University of Marquette, published a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3333988\">study of political appointee ambassadors</a> last year. Comparing the Trump administration with the Ronald Reagan era, Scoville found the new appointees were \u201cinferior in terms of language abilities, prior experience in the receiving state and region, prior experience in foreign policy and prior experience in organizational leadership\u201d.</p> <p>On the other hand, Trump appointees paid 15 times more than their Reagan counterparts in campaign contributions.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an element of being in an election year, when political favours go a long way,\u201d Bruen said.</p> <p>He argued the steady rise in the political appointees getting top jobs \u201cdemonstrates a deep distrust on the seventh floor [the leadership] of the state department and at the White House, of career foreign service officers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey have been systematically shut out of the policy process, they\u2019ve been sidelined when issues arose and they had concerns, and they have also been forced to bear the brunt of the president\u2019s direct wrath,\u201d Bruen added.</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>India reports record daily jump of </strong><strong>7,964 </strong><strong>new coronavirus infections</strong></h2> <p>With the latest tally, India has reported 173,763 coronavirus cases and 4,971 deaths, making it the ninth most-affected country globally, according to Reuters. While the fatality rates in India have been lower than in worse-hit countries, experts fear the peak has not been reached. The latest numbers, showing mounting cases of new infections, would appear to confirm that grim prediction.</p> <h2><strong>Global death toll passes 365,000</strong></h2> <p>The global death toll has increased to 365,368, according to data compiled by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic. The number of cases currently stands at 5,945,737. The true number of infections is likely to be much higher, however, given the vast number of unrecorded and asymptomatic cases.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Mosques in Iran to resume daily prayers</strong></h2> <p>The president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, said mosques are to resume daily prayers throughout the country, despite some areas reporting continuing high levels of coronavirus infections. He added that physical distancing and other health protocols would be observed in mosques. He did not say when they were due to reopen.</p> <h2><strong>UK expert says easing lockdown could come too early</strong></h2> <p>A UK government adviser has warned that it is too early to lift lockdown restrictions as planned next month,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">because the number of new infections is still too high</a>. John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said he wanted the level of new cases to be \u201cdriven down further\u201d before larger gatherings are allowed.

Since that first show it\u2019s had a few different makeovers, from doing round-tables and covering news stories to speaking with authors and exploring a single scientific topic in depth. It\u2019s even done a (really spectacular) mini-series, exploring the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2019/may/03/oceans-of-noise-episode-one-science-weekly-podcast\">sonic environment of the ocean</a>. Under each new guise, the podcast is always trying to find the best format to share science and engage its listeners. That\u2019s why we changed things up a bit with Covid-19 \u2013 making our episodes shorter and bringing them out more frequently than usual, so we could delve into the rapidly developing pandemic and discuss the science as it was happening.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>How do you decide which topics and experts to include?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nicola </strong>When it comes to the Covid-19 outbreak, it\u2019s about being very specific. The story has different aspects, and is fast moving, so it can be hard for people to find answers to the questions they care about. With the podcast we wanted to zoom in on key issues in a concise way. Our listeners have been a huge help, sending in fantastic questions to steer our coverage. What I particularly like about that is that it means we as a team are delving into the things that really matter to our listeners, whether that\u2019s unpicking if Covid-19 poses a particular risk to pregnant women (happily the answer appears to be no), or delving into our understanding of immunity. We carefully research which scientists are leaders in the field, and can share not just what\u2019s known about Covid-19, but also what remains to be unpicked.</p> <h2><strong>What have been your highlights of the podcasts you\u2019ve produced so far \u2013 especially the ones launched during lockdown?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6e750f5324ce504c0ea3049a7ce908d051779dff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e750f5324ce504c0ea3049a7ce908d051779dff/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Science Weekly has been on air since 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Science Weekly has been on air since 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Egle Kazdailyte</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Nicola</strong><em> </em>I have so many favourite episodes. A golden oldie is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2018/apr/27/the-curious-case-of-the-dodo-science-weekly-podcast\">the mystery of the Oxford dodo</a> \u2013 a bird that seems to have been bumped off in peculiar circumstances \u2013 but I also loved taking listeners into the bowels of the Natural History Museum to explore some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2018/jul/06/did-dinosaurs-stop-to-smell-the-flowers-science-weekly-podcast\">fossilised dinosaur poo</a>. When it comes to Covid-19, my favourite episode, as a former chemist, has to be the one about why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/apr/01/covid-19-soap-or-hand-sanitiser\">soap and water helps to tackle coronavirus</a>. Hand washing is a simple action, but so effective.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Madeleine </strong>Of the podcasts I\u2019ve produced during lockdown, I particularly enjoyed the episode on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/may/12/covid-19-why-are-some-people-losing-their-taste-and-smell\">why people are losing their sense of taste and smell</a>. As soon as anecdotal reports started coming out that coronavirus was causing this, usually very sudden, sensory loss I was hooked. Was it really a symptom? How was the virus affecting people in this way? What were the biological mechanisms behind it? That exemplifies one of the best things about making these podcasts \u2013 following our (and our listeners\u2019) curiosity, and chasing down answers and insights from the experts.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>What have been the most interesting things you\u2019ve learned about Covid-19?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nicola </strong>As with any novel virus, scientists are discovering new things all the time \u2013 every day brings new revelations. A fundamental, and fascinating, discovery was how coronavirus enters human cells. Impressively early on, scientists found that it did this by attaching its surface proteins called \u201cspike proteins\u201d to a receptor called ACE2. Now, vaccines are already in development that hope to introduce these spike proteins to the body and trigger an immune response.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve had hundreds of interesting, surprising, and provocative questions from listeners</p> <footer> <cite>Madeleine Finlay</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I also think reports of people experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 for many weeks or even months are important \u2013 increasingly so as time goes on \u2013 as are the findings that men and BAME communities are at greater risk from the disease. Hopefully researchers will begin to understand these issues more in the coming months, and find ways to tackle them.</p> <h2><strong>What are the biggest challenges of producing the pods now?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><strong>Madeleine </strong>Initially I thought the biggest challenge might be technological - trying to get everyone online, able to hear each other, and recorded with a reasonable sound quality. I\u2019m sure most of us have suffered the endless back and forth of \u201cHello? Hello? Can you hear me?\u201d on Zoom calls over the past few months. Occasionally getting the tech right is tough, and there have had to be some rather quick workarounds, but thankfully on day one of working from home, Max Sanderson, the head producer, sent the presenters proper microphones and recorders.</p> <p>In fact, for me, what has been really challenging is the speed at which the science is evolving. For a while it felt as if each morning I\u2019d wake up to a new discovery, question, or mystery. Despite it making things more difficult for a producer, it\u2019s a real testament to how hard, and how fast, scientists have been working on understanding Covid-19 over the past few months.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then, of course, there\u2019s trying to make sure our presenters can find time on a busy news day. Their schedules were full even before the pandemic, so the effort they\u2019re putting in now is pretty heroic.&nbsp;</p> <h2>&nbsp;<br><strong>Do you get feedback from listeners? How have people responded?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Madeleine</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>When we first started the podcasts focusing on Covid-19, we put a call out to listeners asking for questions and feedback. I\u2019m not sure how many responses we were expecting, but we were shocked, and thrilled, to see our inboxes fill up every week. We\u2019ve had hundreds of interesting, surprising, and provocative questions that have really got us thinking, and guided which topics we look at each week. From the start there has been one consistent message in the feedback from listeners \u2013 they\u2019re grateful for the information. I think knowledge and understanding make a huge difference when everything is so uncertain and unpredictable. It can make us feel safer, calmer, and a little more in control. Seeing how much our listeners appreciate discovering more about the science of the outbreak never fails to brighten up a day and motivate me onto the next question!<br></p> <h2><strong>How does the pod complement the rest of our science coverage?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Nicola </strong>Working on the Science Weekly podcast is one of my favourite aspects of being a science reporter at the Guardian \u2013 it offers a different way of telling a story compared with writing a news article and it allows us to take listeners behind the scenes of how we delve into a story, from the kinds of questions we ask to the importance of challenging the answers we receive. It also allows us to give listeners a feel for how science works, and the people who are doing the science itself.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>To understand how wide Beijing now casts its security net in Hong Kong, consider the case of Martin Lee. Now in his 80s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/i-wont-allow-this-to-be-the-end-of-hong-kong-campaigner-on-his-long-fight-for-democracy\">Lee is a distinguished barrister</a>, a politician and a lifelong defender of civil liberties.&nbsp;He has never committed an act of violence or advocated that others do so.</p> <p>Last month, in an early sign of what was coming, Lee was arrested at his home.&nbsp;Fourteen other prominent Hong Kong citizens were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">taken into custody that day</a> and charged with taking part in illegal demonstrations. He has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/21/i-was-arrested-hong-kong-its-part-chinas-larger-plan/\">pointed out</a> that he was already facing 14 similar charges in mainland China, and had the extradition law that triggered last year\u2019s protests in Hong Kong been adopted he could have been sent for trial in China under a system that not even the Chinese Communist party\u2019s (CCP) most generous supporters could describe as adequate. The CCP regards rule of law and separation of powers as threats to its power. Law, for the party, is one instrument among many&nbsp;that can be used to eliminate opponents \u2013 who can be anyone from dissenting public intellectuals to prominent businessmen.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lee was a member of the drafting committee for the Basic Law, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution and the legal scaffolding of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">one </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">country, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">two </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">systems</a>\u201d formula promoted by the late paramount leader of China, Deng Xiaoping.&nbsp;Deng saw it as the means by which China could recover sovereignty over the British colony while preserving Hong Kong\u2019s&nbsp;civil liberties, rule of law, a relative lack of corruption and even an accountable government. He understood that these features had made Hong Kong a thriving centre of global finance and it was key to the economic renaissance of China that became his great legacy.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not only has&nbsp;Hong Kong been essential to huge volumes of investment into China, it has also been a place where information and ideas that are stifled on the mainland could flourish, a place where spies from all over the world could learn each other\u2019s secrets, civil society groups could organise and religious practice could thrive. Its media freedoms helped to save the world from the worst effects of the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/24/asia/china-sars-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html\">S</a><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/24/asia/china-sars-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html\">ars epidemic in 2003</a>: it was in Hong Kong that the CCP\u2019s months-long silence was broken.&nbsp;Without that, many more people would certainly have died.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hong Kong has also been a safety valve for a Chinese political system that has lurched too often between intense repression and violent convulsion. One reason the people of Hong Kong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/10/what-are-the-hong-kong-protests-about-explainer\">defend their freedoms so vigorously</a> is that so many of them are there because they, or their parents or grandparents risked their lives to escape from China.&nbsp;They learned the value of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms from personal experience.</p> <p>Deng, too,&nbsp;had experience of both the oppression and the convulsion and&nbsp;understood the value to China of Hong Kong as a place apart.&nbsp;He sent tanks to crush the students in Tiananmen Square in 1989, but he didn\u2019t prevent the people of Hong Kong gathering, as they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/tiananmen-square-massacre-marked-with-hong-kong-vigil\">every 4 June</a> since,&nbsp;to remember the dead.&nbsp;This is the first year that that gathering is in doubt.&nbsp;</p> <p>Speaking in New York in 2014, Lee pointed out that Deng\u2019s promises to Hong Kong included no interference in its affairs by any mainland institution and the introduction of universal suffrage. Without universal suffrage, Lee warned, Hong Kong people would mistrust their government and the region would not be stable.&nbsp;But Beijing had repeatedly postponed universal suffrage, and in June 2014 China\u2019s state council published a white paper that claimed government in <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/11/world/asia/hong-kong-beijing-two-systems-paper/index.html\">Beijing had comprehensive jurisdiction</a> over Hong Kong and Macau. As Lee predicted, Hong Kong has not been stable, Beijing has steadily lost support, and today a majority of people in the region identify as citizens of Hong Kong, but not of China.&nbsp;</p> <p>Every move to tighten control since 1997 has been met with resistance. Throughout last year\u2019s growing tumult provoked by a proposed extradition law, Carrie Lam, the latest in a line of disastrous chief executives, argued that Hong Kong\u2019s silent majority supported her government. In an exceptionally large turnout, that majority responded by giving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers\">90% support to democratic parties</a> in the local elections in November.&nbsp;Beijing is anxious to avoid another electoral humiliation in the legislative elections later this year.&nbsp;</p> <p>As resistance mounted, Beijing drew the lesson that only further repression would suffice, fatally undermining Deng\u2019s vision of a self-governing and stable Hong Kong. It has&nbsp;now effectively torn up the treaty it signed with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government and condemned Hong Kong to further unrest and decline.&nbsp;If Beijing\u2019s desired outcome was stability and security, it has disastrously mishandled it. Few doubt that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">Beijing\u2019s security law</a> will criminalise dissent, undermine the rule of law and target prominent activists such as the youth leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joshua-wong\">Joshua Wong</a>, as well as veterans such as Lee. Further turmoil is inevitable.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/china-foisting-anti-sedition-law-hong-kong-freedoms\">China is foisting an anti-sedition law that will change Hong Kong for ever | Ilaria Maria Sala and Louisa Lim</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK has been shamefully feeble in defence of Hong Kong, though the recent hardening of attitudes towards China within the Conservative party may produce something more than the usual pro-forma expression of concern.&nbsp;Hong Kong\u2019s best hopes of support, however, lie in Washington. Under the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act, the territory enjoys special trade status with the US, provided the secretary of state certifies annually to Congress that it retains its autonomous status. When, on Wednesday, Mike Pompeo notified Congress that Hong Kong could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-china-autonomous-us-pompeo-security-law\">no longer be considered autonomous</a>, the question left open is what will the Trump administration, already locked in angry confrontation with China, do about it?</p> <p>The nuclear option of revoking Hong Kong\u2019s US trade privileges would hurt Hong Kong more than China and could provoke direct retaliation on hundreds of US businesses in both regions.&nbsp;Other options, which include targeted sanctions on party officials, asset freezes and visa restrictions, carry similar risks. In other times, the US might have mobilised its allies to support a concerted rebuke in the upcoming G7 meeting and other high-level gatherings. But Trump is noted neither for effective nor skilful alliances, and his administration has been described as having an attitude to China but not a policy. As for the UK, the least it should do is to open its doors to those citizens of Hong Kong who hold British national (overseas) passports, something it should have done in 1997. This week, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, spoke of opening up a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">pathway to future citizenship</a>\u201d for BN(O)s, if China doesn\u2019t \u201cstep back\u201d from implementing the security bill. But, so far, these are just words.

Major departments in cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Oakland and Los Angeles have adopted more restrictive policies governing the use of force,&nbsp;a step research indicates is effective at reducing police violence, said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samswey/status/1180655701271732224\">Samuel Sinyangwe</a>, a data scientist and activist.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere have been some changes, in particularly the largest cities in America,\u201d Sinyangwe said. \u201cIn the departments that have begun to implement these changes, we\u2019ve seen reductions in police violence.

But six years ago, we were simply trying to make America aware of what we suffer.</p> \n<p>\u201cSix years later many more people \u2013 not enough, but many more people \u2013 are further along in their awareness, and they\u2019re able to step much more immediately into action.

About 8.4 million workers have been furloughed, tens of thousands have lost their jobs and many self-employed workers\u2019 incomes have taken a hit.</p> \n<p>Even the lives of those who are still in work may have changed dramatically. Working from home has become the norm for many, and employees at some firms have already been told this will carry on until at least the autumn. Meanwhile, physical distancing measures are likely to remain for many more months and a whole swathe of events, from holidays to festivals to weddings, have been cancelled. And behind all of this is a virus that can be deadly.</p> \n<p>With all of this in mind, it\u2019s possible your financial set-up no longer matches your lifestyle and needs. Guardian Money has put together a guide to getting everything in order as we all adapt to new ways of going about our daily lives.</p> \n<h2><strong>Reducing household costs</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Wholesale <strong>energy prices</strong> have dropped as a result of factories and businesses being closed and demand for fuel falling across the world. The very cheapest dual gas and electricity tariffs cost \u00a3750 a year for a medium-sized house with average consumption. Households on their supplier\u2019s capped standard tariff will typically save more than \u00a3300 a year by switching. Tonik Energy\u2019s green super power v4 tariff is arguably the pick of the cheapest deals and it\u2019s fixed for a year. Prices have fallen so much that those on fixed deals bought before March should consider moving supplier too and pay any exit fees. Use <a href=\"http://energyhelpline.com/\">Energyhelpline.com</a> to find out what your household can save. </li> \n <li>Housing is likely to be your biggest outlay. If you have a <strong>mortgage</strong> and have taken a three-month payment holiday, you may be aware that on 22 May the government said people can extend this for a further three months (the first ones were due to come to an end in June). Meanwhile, those who are struggling but have not yet taken a mortgage payment holiday will have until 31 October to apply. However, there are also other options available to borrowers, either now or at the end of the holiday. Two of the main ones are temporarily switching to interest-only payments and increasing the length of the mortgage term. Both will reduce your monthly payments but there\u2019s a price to pay. For example, increasing the mortgage term will ultimately mean paying a lot more interest. </li> \n <li>Most local authorities are offering <strong>council tax</strong> payment holidays to those struggling but you have to ask for one, and there is no guarantee the answer will be yes. Those on universal credit or low incomes may be able to get their bill reduced, or in some cases waived. The amount of reduction depends on your circumstances and the council. On top of the discount, in England, you may also get an extra \u00a3150 off your bill, backed by a \u00a3500m Covid-19 hardship fund. </li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Making up for lost income</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>You may be entitled to <strong>benefits</strong> to top up your earnings. Anna Stevenson from the advice charity Turn2Us says it is \u201cvery difficult to talk in specific sums because each household\u2019s claim is different, depending on the rent they pay and a host of other factors, including the number of children etc\u201d. The charity has <a href=\"https://benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk/AboutYou\">a benefits calculator</a> on its website, which will help you work out what you can claim.Households who receive working tax credits and whose annual income is expected to be more than \u00a32,500 different to the previous tax year should contact HM Revenue &amp; Customs and declare a change of circumstances, which should bring a change in payments. Stevenson says some people on working tax credits, which are typically no longer available to new claimants, may be better off switching to universal credit but they should use a calculator to check before they make a claim. </li> \n <li>Are you a higher earner with children who has suffered a drop in income due to the pandemic? If your income is set to be less than \u00a360,000, then get your <strong>child benefit</strong> restarted. It\u2019s worth \u00a31,820 a year for a family with two children. Under the high-income child benefit charge (HICBC), if you or your partner earn more than \u00a350,000 a year, the benefit is progressively clawed back through the tax system until it is worth nothing on incomes over \u00a360,000. Thousands of parents who opted out of receiving child benefit, or never started claiming in the first place, because they had to pay the HICBC will be eligible to claim or restart the payments. To restart child benefit, either fill in an online form or call <a href=\"tel:0300%20200%203100\">0300 200 3100</a>. For more information go to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge/restart-child-benefit\">gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge/restart-child-benefit</a>. </li> \n <li>If your salary has dropped below \u00a350,000 as a result of the crisis, there could be \u00a3250 with your name on it, courtesy of the <strong>marriage allowance</strong>. This tax break lets one partner transfer \u00a31,250 of his or her personal allowance to their other half, thereby reducing that person\u2019s tax by up to \u00a3250 in the current tax year. You can claim it provided all of the following apply: you are married or in a civil partnership; one partner\u2019s income is below \u00a312,500, or nothing; and the other partner\u2019s income is between \u00a312,501 and \u00a350,000, or \u00a343,430 in Scotland. HMRC will typically give the recipient partner their extra allowance either by changing their tax code or via the self-assessment system.

Insurers generally won\u2019t let you pause your car insurance but you can cancel it and take a refund of the remaining months. You can tell the DVLA you are taking the car off the road with a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/make-a-sorn\">statutory off road notification (Sorn)</a> and cancel the policy. Check the savings and fees you will have to pay before you go ahead. You will also save the car tax for any full months it is off the road. But be aware that the vehicle has to be physically off the highway, on a driveway or similar. The big downside, of course, is that it will not be covered if it is stolen. </li> \n <li>Even if you still need a car, you may be using it less than when you bought your policy. Churchill and Direct Line are among the <strong>insurers</strong> offering refunds to drivers who are in this position. You need to get in touch with your new mileage during lockdown and they will give you cash back based on the difference between that number and the figure you declared when you bought the policy. Check if your insurer is doing the same. If it isn\u2019t but your policy is coming to an end, don\u2019t let it renew without adjusting the mileage you are paying for. </li> \n <li>If you no longer need a car you are buying on <strong>finance</strong>, you can hand it back, provided you have paid back at least half the money owed on it. Section 99 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 sets out how you can voluntarily terminate a regulated hire purchase or personal contract purchase (PCP) agreement. With a PCP, the buyer puts down a deposit, makes perhaps three or four years\u2019 monthly payments, and then a final balloon payment at the end of the term if they wish to keep the car. If you have paid half the value of the vehicle, you can ask for a voluntary termination. If you are near 50%, you can opt to pay the difference to get you there. You hand the car back and escape the rest of the payments. Be aware that no refunds are given if you paid more than 50%. Those with HP agreements can hand the car back sooner, typically halfway through the term, as there are no balloon payments. The <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/cut-your-car-finance-hire-purchase-and-other-finance-costs#when-should-i-end-my-finance-deal-early\">Money Advice Service website</a> has some good advice on the process. A voluntary termination will show up on your credit file but should not negatively affect your <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-to-improve-your-credit-rating\">credit score</a>, it says.</li> \n <li><strong>Bike</strong> sales have been soaring during the pandemic. You may want to consider buying a bike through your employer\u2019s cycle to work scheme, which will allow you to save 25-39% of the cost. Employees who sign up get a voucher, which they take to their local bike shop and use to buy their chosen equipment, including lights and clothing. The savings come through the fact that you don\u2019t pay income tax or national insurance on the purchase price. In reality, your employer buys a bike for you, and you \u201chire\u201d it back, making monthly payments from your gross (pre-tax) salary, typically over four years. Basic-rate taxpayers save a quarter on the cost of the bike and accessories. Higher-rate taxpayers save about 40%. Technically, the bike belongs to your employer until the end of the four years, at which point there is an ownership fee payable. Buy a decent lock and insurance, as the payments must still be made even if the machine has been stolen. You don\u2019t have to ride the bike to work to use the scheme but most new applicants will be planning to do just that. </li> \n <li><strong>Rail</strong> commuters who expect to carry on working from home can still apply for a rail season ticket refund, backdated up to 56 days. Passengers have to go back to the rail company that sold them it, either in person at the ticket office or online. Be aware that you will not get the cost of the annual ticket divided by 12, with each unused month returned. Refunds are calculated as the difference between the season ticket\u2019s cost, and that of the cheapest way to make the same journeys without it, using monthly, weekly or daily tickets. Use a refund calculator, such as<a href=\"https://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/help-and-contact/get-in-touch/coronavirus-refund-information\"> the one</a> from Southeastern. Some passengers have received in excess of \u00a32,500 back. </li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"522231a534ff172aa32810c8555c92908639f5ef\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/522231a534ff172aa32810c8555c92908639f5ef/0_0_1359_2552/533.png\" alt=\"money\" width=\"533\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">money</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Change the way you pay</strong><br></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Millions of older people left trapped in their homes after the coronavirus struck found that without an online <strong>bank account</strong>, day-to-day banking has been near-impossible. Halifax said the numbers of over-65s signing up for online banking has jumped by 63% and their use of contactless has also soared. Santander says the over-55s have flocked online during the pandemic, with numbers up 54%. Signing up for an online bank account is relatively easy. You don\u2019t have to have a smartphone but it helps. If not, use a home computer instead. Either try your existing bank or set up an account with one of the app-based providers such as Monzo, Starling and Revolut. </li> \n <li>The pandemic and physical distancing have already forced many of us to adapt our <strong>payment</strong> habits. If you haven\u2019t already, check out <a href=\"https://paym.co.uk/\">Paym</a>, the free service launched in 2014 that allows you to send or receive money with any UK mobile phone number without sharing your bank details. Industry body Pay.UK says it is safe and efficient, with 15 banks and building societies offering the service, including all the big ones. Watch out for fake messages, which have recently been impersonating Paym and asking customers to follow a link to receive money.</li> \n <li>We are highly likely to see many businesses closing their doors for good because of the coronavirus. From a consumer point of view, remember that paying by <strong>credit card</strong> gives you added legal protection if the company you are buying from goes bust. If you use your credit card to buy something costing more than \u00a3100 and up to \u00a330,000, you are covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This means the card company has equal responsibility with the seller if the company you bought from fails. If you pay with a debit card, you might be able to make a claim later for a refund under the <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/how-youre-protected-when-you-pay-by-card\">chargeback</a> scheme. This is an agreement the likes of Visa and Mastercard have signed up to. The card company will try to claim your money back from the company you have paid by reversing the transaction. Be aware that time limits apply for making a claim.</li> \n <li>Even though the lockdown is easing (with outdoor markets and car showrooms in England reopening from 1 June, and other non-essential retailers from 15 June), going to the <strong>shops</strong> is likely to remain a rigmarole. Physical distancing rules will restrict the number of people who can be in a store at any one time and shoppers will have to contend with closed changing rooms, restrictions on touching merchandise and one-way systems. If there are things you buy every time you go and you can afford to pay slightly more for them, you could consider looking into a subscription from an independent retailer. You can arrange regular deliveries of all kinds of foods, including ground coffee, cheese, bacon and wine. Away from the kitchen, some small book stores are offering to send you a book a month for a year. This is not likely to be a way to save money but will prevent you having to visit a shop and could help save a small business. </li> \n <li>Similarly, a <strong>milkman</strong> can help you cut out trips to the shops. Many deliver non-dairy substitutes as well as the traditional pint. The website <a href=\"https://www.findmeamilkman.net/\">Findmeamilkman.net</a> can help you find one that covers your area but it doesn\u2019t seem to be exhaustive so ask neighbours or use Google. Some of the larger companies such as <a href=\"https://www.milkandmore.co.uk/\">Milk &amp; More</a> carry other products, including bread, vegetables and drinks. </li> \n <li>In terms of <strong>returns and refunds</strong>, retailers have generally updated their policies since the start of the outbreak, allowing customers to return items after physical stores reopen and extending online returns periods. This is typically between one and two months. The consumer group Which? put pressure on laggard retailers, which were not being quite so generous. Your consumer rights are not affected by the disruption to retail caused by the outbreak, although refunds are taking longer to process as stores and their customer services staff buckle under the strain. </li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc39d63feea95b7a65b3b0e6de10757b8075f1d0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc39d63feea95b7a65b3b0e6de10757b8075f1d0/0_0_1463_1508/970.png\" alt=\"hide\" width=\"970\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">hide</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Stashing your savings</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>While the coronavirus crisis has been a financial disaster for many people, the bald truth is that many others are feeling better off at the moment because they are spending so little. If that is you, now\u2019s the time to build a <strong>financial safety cushion</strong> with some of the money you have saved as a result of the lockdown. Financial planners typically suggest we need three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses as a <a href=\"https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/emergency-savings-how-much-is-enough\">rainy day fund</a> but a study in 2018 found 70% of the UK\u2019s workers were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jan/25/uk-workers-chronically-broke-study-economic-insecurity\">chronically broke</a>\u201d, with almost no proper savings. If you are lucky enough to have spare cash, channel it towards a savings account. The interest rate may not be great but by separating it from your everyday spending account, you will make it harder to access and force yourself to think twice before using the money. Check out <a href=\"https://moneyfacts.co.uk/savings-accounts/\">Moneyfacts.co.uk for the best rates on different types of accounts</a>. </li> \n <li>Rebuild your <strong>pension</strong> with some of that money you are not spending. According to adviser Kirsty Stone of The Private Office, if you are in your mid-40s and can afford to put an extra \u00a3100 a month into your pension, it could be worth an extra \u00a342,000 in terms of your pension pot by the time you are 65. If you can set aside an additional \u00a3250 a month, it could be worth an extra \u00a3100,000, using standard assumptions. You could also contact your HR department at work and ask them to increase the contributions that are taken from your pay. That way, you will receive either 20% or 40% tax relief, depending on your pay. If you are fortunate, you may find your company offers an additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme where it will match or partially match whatever you put in. But remember it\u2019s a pension so you can\u2019t access the money until you are at least 55. </li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>Catastrophe planning</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Make sure you have a <strong>will</strong> and it is up to date. Check in with older relatives too. The majority of Britons haven\u2019t made a will. However, some trade unions offer members free will-writing. So do several charities, including Cancer Research and the British Heart Foundation. These will work if your family setup is quite straightforward. If your financial or family situations are at all complicated, it will be worth paying for legal advice. Use the Law Society website <a href=\"https://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/\">solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk</a> to find a local solicitor. </li> \n <li>With foreign holidays and many other trips on hold, those lucky enough to have a garden will be spending a lot of time in it this year so it is not surprising that people are flocking to garden centres to invest in their outdoor space. But if you are splashing out on expensive barbecues, patio furniture and children\u2019s play equipment, dig out your <strong>home insurance</strong> to check you are covered. The average British garden contains \u00a31,457 worth of valuable items, according to MoneySuperMarket. But financial information firm Defaqto says about 10% of home insurance policies did not cover items left in the garden as standard. Of the policies that do offer cover, many have low limits for these items, typically \u00a31,000 or less, as outdoor space cannot be secured in the same way that a home is. Minimise the risk by bringing items inside or storing them in a locked shed or garage, where possible. If you have had to splash out on new technology to teach the kids, make sure your kit is covered by your home insurance policy. Lots of home insurance will cover all but the most expensive equipment as a matter of course but check the small print in case you need to increase your cover. If you are a renter and have never bothered to buy insurance for your belongings before, it may be worth doing so now. The price comparison sites will help you find a policy that suits you. </li> \n <li>The pandemic and its fallout have prompted many people to take another look at how much <strong>life insurance</strong> cover they have, with some companies saying many more younger people are buying it. Straightforward life insurance is still widely available and nearly all policies, even those taken out today, will pay out if the death is due to coronavirus. Note that the price rises steeply as you get older. We obtained a quote from Aviva this week where the cost was \u00a38.42 a month for a 37-year-old seeking a payout of \u00a3100,000 should they die in the next 15 years. But if the person was 57, the premium shot up to \u00a345.22 a month.</li> \n <li>If your concern is about losing your job and not being able to pay the monthly bills, things have become a lot tougher. Many of the big price comparison sites that sell insurance have stopped providing quotes for <strong>unemployment cover</strong>. You can in theory still obtain income protection cover that pays out if you become sick with coronavirus. We got quotes for an office worker aged in his mid- to late 30s, on an income of \u00a340,000 a year, which would pay an income of \u00a31,650 a month for the next 12 months. LV=, Royal London and Legal &amp; General all came back with quotes at about \u00a320-\u00a322 a month. It\u2019s crucial to check what the minimum amount of time is that you would have to be off sick to get a payout. Most policies don\u2019t cover short periods of illness \u2013 the minimum period can be a month, or a lot longer \u2013 so you would probably have to be ill with coronavirus for a very long time to get a payout.</li> \n</ul> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a1579f1bf1bca83376d6cf83d335f648f95e3ae\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a1579f1bf1bca83376d6cf83d335f648f95e3ae/0_0_959_2746/349.png\" alt=\"Coron\" width=\"349\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coron</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ryan Gillert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Other spending</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Review <strong>memberships and subscriptions</strong> to check you can still afford to pay them and are getting what you want. Some organisations, such as the Barbican arts complex in London, have already told their members they will be able to extend their membership by the length of the closure for free. Most gyms have frozen memberships while closed, with no fee to pay until the clubs reopen. With some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and no guarantee there will not be another lockdown later in the year, you may want to opt for monthly payments rather than paying for a year upfront. David Lloyd, which has 100 tennis and racquet clubs in the UK, is gradually reopening but only for outdoor tennis. It has decided to maintain its freeze on membership fees until its clubs are fully open but has not announced what will happen next. The National Trust is a charity and is keen for members to continue to donate to support its work. It says for a limited period only, it is letting members have a 25% discount when they renew their annual membership. </li> \n <li>Parents who use government schemes to get tax breaks on nurseries, childminders and after-school clubs will have been accruing money in their accounts while not being able to use those services. Insurer Royal London estimates \u00a318m could be sitting in tax-free <strong>childcare accounts</strong>. This is money parents can withdraw if they need it. The older childcare vouchers cannot be refunded but if you have this type of account, you can suspend payments while you are not using it. To stay in the scheme, you need to start them again within 52 weeks. </li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>The new workplace</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li>If you are going to be <strong>working from home</strong> for several more months, as seems to be the case for many of us, it\u2019s vital you have the right equipment, such as a suitable chair and desk, to ensure a healthy and productive work environment. <a href=\"https://www.iwfm.org.uk/resource/iwfm-research-hygiene-concerns-leave-thousands-anxious-about-return-to-the-office.html?parentId=8CBD03AD-C979-4553-AB9AAA1F0AB1081A\">Research</a> from the Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management earlier this month found just under a quarter (24%) of the employees it questioned had a separate home office, with almost two-thirds (64%) resorting to makeshift workstations on dining room tables, sofas and beds. Some employers are going as far as couriering a van full of kit to their home-working staff, while others are doing little or nothing. Royal Bank of Scotland said this month it will distribute additional gear such as office chairs, folding desks and screens to those who need it. Meanwhile, the BBC said staff can apply for an interest-free loan of up to \u00a3250 (with repayments deducted from net salary), which they can use to buy modest equipment to help them work from home more comfortably. Ask your employer what it can do to help you. Which? has <a href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/news/2020/04/coronavirus-9-tips-for-a-healthy-and-effective-lockdown-home-office/\">published a helpful list of tips</a>, which also includes recommendations for home office chairs and desks.</li> \n <li>You may be able to claim <strong>tax relief</strong> for your job expenses now that you are working from home. You can typically only claim for things that are solely related to your work \u2013 for example, business phone calls or the extra cost of gas and electricity for your \u201coffice\u201d area. You can\u2019t claim for things you use for both your work and in a private capacity, such as your broadband. Accountants Blick Rothenberg point out HMRC allows employees who don\u2019t already complete a self-assessment tax return to make claims of up to \u00a32,500 on employment-related expenses incurred in a tax year by using form P87. Check out HMRC\u2019s website for more information. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees\">gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees</a> page includes sections on working from home and buying substantial equipment that you have to have to do your work. This page on form P87 may also be useful.</li> \n <li>Is your home <strong>broadband</strong> up to scratch? Don\u2019t put up with a shoddy service. If yours is limping along at the moment, there are things you can do. You may want to ask your existing provider whether it can upgrade you to a faster fibre package without any loss of service or the need for an engineer visit. And there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/11/boost-broadband-speed-during-lockdown-wifi-internet\">various tips and gadgets</a> that might help. Switching broadband provider is of course an option, and may be the best bet for some. Most people won\u2019t require a home visit from an engineer. Comparethemarket.com recently said there had been considerable demand for faster broadband packages since the lockdown restrictions began.</li> \n <li>In terms of other homeworking costs, try to make use of the <strong>technology</strong> available for business calls and meetings \u2013 Zoom, Skype and so on \u2013 rather than racking up phone costs that, with all the chaos, you may never get around to claiming back.</li> \n <li>Strictly speaking, everyone should probably notify their <strong>buildings and contents insurer(s)</strong> if they are going to be working at home for a while \u2013 particularly if they have bought expensive new gear to help them do their job. Similarly, you are responsible for checking that working from home will not cause any problems with your mortgage or tenancy agreement.</li> \n</ul>",
  "<p>Poggio Mirteto, Cantalupo, Casperia, Vacone, Configni, Stroncone. Hilltop towns in the ancient land of Sabina, calling to each other across parched patchworks of vineyard and cornfield. Woods, orchards, olive groves. You could drive to these places, of course. But my experience is, when you arrive on foot they are different. They are better. And best of all in summer.</p> <p>You\u2019ll need water with you at all times for this adventure. A light backpack with just one change of clothes. Trekking shoes on your feet, poles in your hands, sweat-wicking shirts and shorts and underwear. Plus a broad-brimmed hat, shades and a big tube of sun cream. Then just surrender yourself to the heat and the cicadas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a38d2298367c6e1bb25edcd3d351df04bbcacba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a38d2298367c6e1bb25edcd3d351df04bbcacba/0_0_1478_1016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italy travel map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The start is simple enough. An hour\u2019s rattly train ride north-east beside the Tiber, from Rome\u2019s Tiburtina station to Poggio Mirteto Scalo. Then a four-mile climb, cross-country, to Poggio Mirteto proper. This will get you used to the idea that every place you\u2019re going to arrive at in the coming days is at the top of a long, steep slope. In fact, <em>poggio</em> means little hill. I remember a chalky track between dry thistles so tall their thistledown waved above our heads. You enter the town through a narrow stone arch perched above a sheer drop. Already you can look down and feel satisfied.</p> <p>The key to walking in heat is to start before dawn and ease into it. So check out Poggio the afternoon you arrive, then early to bed and wake at five. Piazza Martiri della Libert\u00e0 is dustily decorous, more an elongated, tree-lined oval than a square. Creamy baroque church at one end and austere brick cathedral at the other. Pretty facades, patches of green. A vigorous yucca tree thrusts out of 15th-century masonry. At the elegant tables of <a href=\"http://www.torrefazionecaffegentili.it/\">Caff\u00e9 Gentili</a> you can practise ordering a first <em>cedrata</em>. Made from Calabrian <em>cedro</em>, a large yellow citrus fruit, and served in a small bottle that you pour yourself on to crackling ice, this drink is sharp, thirst-quenching ecstasy. You\u2019ll be needing it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f31f05b9c99649531205ea5d6a83e6cc933226c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f31f05b9c99649531205ea5d6a83e6cc933226c2/780_209_4477_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poggio Mirteto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poggio Mirteto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerio Mei/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One last requirement. It\u2019s hard to find detailed paper maps in Italy. Nor is the countryside thick with fingerposts pointing the way. If you\u2019re going to avoid the roads, you need a hiking app to find the paths \u2013 they\u2019re easily available. And it\u2019s wise to plan at least the start of each day\u2019s route the night before; then, when you close the door of your B&amp;B at an ungodly hour, you\u2019ll know where you\u2019re going.</p> <p>There\u2019s a special intimacy to slipping out of medieval walls while it\u2019s still night. Thankfully, the day starts downhill. The deep shadows of the trees are furtive and fresh, the grass dewy, air balmy, and all around an atmosphere of quiet vegetable pressure toward the splendour of the rising sun.</p> <p>Which comes all too soon. Towards seven the light is suddenly sharp over a stand of feathery bamboo. It\u2019s warming fast. At a corner, an enormous agave plant waves grey-green tentacles. Sunflowers raise their heads. In the orchards the peaches begin to glow. Then around 8:30, as if a switch were tripped, the cicadas begin. One strikes up in a tree right above, a rasping rhythmic whir, then another and another and another, until a harsh, hypnotic chorus fuses with the now oven-hot air in one vast summery stupefaction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cf5c3dd5d6b99ff7f062984176d925a9eaabbb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cf5c3dd5d6b99ff7f062984176d925a9eaabbb4/53_0_5314_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The undulating terrain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The undulating terrain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Harris/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re walking north here, in a broad, undulating valley, through fields of scorched stubble watched from towers and castles on the hills each side. At the end of the valley is the larger town of Terni, two days away, offering the option of a train back to Rome. But if you have appetite and energy, it\u2019s just another two days north to Todi, taking in the grand Roman ruin of Carsulae and the pretty town of Acquasparta. Then perhaps another two west to Orvieto. Or north to Perugia and the upper Tiber valley. My partner and I did this walk as part of a longer trip, following in the footsteps of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi\">Garibaldi</a> when he tried to march an army from Rome to Venice after the collapse of the liberal Roman republic in 1849. This segment seemed the most intensely Italian, and the least known.</p> <p>But this morning\u2019s first goal is Cantalupo. You have to lift your head to see it, a mass of piled muddled stone rising from gnarled trees far above. The slope is scandalously steep. But the pleasure of these days lies in an intensity of contrasts: first the sweat and strain, then the solace each small town affords. The water fountain by the ancient gate. The coolness in dark churches and resiny smells under gnarled pines. Fortunately, it\u2019s rarely more than three hours\u2019 march between one settlement and the next. You\u2019ll be in Cantalupo\u2019s main square in ample time for freshly squeezed orange juice, cappuccino and croissant, under sunshades, surrounded by a blaze of potted oleanders. It would never have felt so good had you arrived by car.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Garibaldi passed this spring in 1849 it was dry, and his men, mules and horses went crazy with thirst</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We had set our sights on Vacone as a place to stay, taking time out for lunch in Casperia, another climb to another miracle of the middle ages paralysed in the day\u2019s blue dazzle. Then our app let us down: a path petered into nothing. We turned back. It was past evening when we tackled a rutted track that climbs a thousand feet. There\u2019s a stone trough here, set in the cliff beside the path, and the words of an ode that the poet Horace wrote, more than 2,000 years ago, in praise of the water that springs from the rock. \u201cO fountain of Bandusia!\u201d When Garibaldi passed in 1849 the spring was dry and his men, mules and horses went crazy with thirst.</p> <p>Our water was finished too. But we were almost there. The track turns into cobbled alleys, then a broad terrace beneath an ancient clock tower. Vacone. Two women were sitting on the parapet, a vast sunset panorama behind them. Was there anywhere to stay, we asked. No. Was there a cafe? No. Really, no cafe? There was a bar, they said, that opened after dinner, \u201cFor the men to play cards.\u201d And a tiny grocery.</p> <p>I mention this moment to warn you that you should decide before setting out whether you are up for a night in the open. Whether to take a light tent, perhaps. We had one, but Eleonora, my partner, had read that there were wolves in these hills. Of course no one has been killed by a wolf in Italy for more than 200 years. Wild boars and dogs are more likely encounters. But the imagination is a terrible thing. Wry and generous, the two women phoned all their friends and relatives. Did anyone know anyone who had a place to stay? Children ran back and forth. The grocery provided beer and mozzarella. Finally a B&amp;B was found, another 40 minutes\u2019 walking, in the dark.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b81d255182f3bcd7151c3ce61e590ee5d93f3f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b81d255182f3bcd7151c3ce61e590ee5d93f3f1/0_185_5890_3534/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casperia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casperia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerio Mei/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On arrival, every day, you must plunge your walking clothes in the sink and wash them at once. They\u2019ll dry in the night and be ready for the dawn. In bed you feel your body glowing, ripe with summer sun.</p> <p>Some towns offer evening entertainment. Carmina Burana on the steps of a Duomo. A beauty contest under a <em>loggiato</em>. In one village a magician. In another a one-man band. And yes, there are artworks to look at along the way. If you must. A fine San Sebastiano, for example, cheerfully resigned to his arrows above the altar of a tiny church on cobbled streets heading to Configni. But this holiday is not about frescoes and monuments; rather, it\u2019s about the pleasure of eating <em>cappellacci</em> with radicchio and <em>robiola</em> cheese behind bead curtains in Configni\u2019s one osteria. Then the fragrance of lavender and mint as we plunge back down to the valley; the elegance of the bulrushes and the blue of the cornflowers; the distant braying of a donkey.</p> <p>Vacone to Terni via Configni and the magnificent Stroncone is 27 breathtakingly beautiful, backbreakingly arduous kilometres. There\u2019s a stream to ford, with slimy stones under your toes. At burning midday, in a lane sunk between high banks of bush and bramble, near a place called Coppe, you may stumble upon the miracle of a <em>lavatoio</em>, two long stone basins for washing clothes, brimming with dark water. If you find it, take off your socks and shoes, sit on the edge and plunge in your burning feet. A plaque on the wall beside says that <em>per fatale disgrazia</em> \u2013 through fatal misfortune \u2013 Virgilio Giusti died here in 1948, aged 18, in the flower of youth. Italians love these sad memorials, flowers forever refreshed at the point where a foot slipped or lightning struck. There will be a name, a date, a few words. They spin a sticky web of sentiment across the landscape, and remind you, as this whole trip should, how lucky you are to be alive in a world where there is Italy and summer and freedom.</p>",
  "<p>Uniform washed, book bag filled, mask on? Then you\u2019re all set for Back To School! Actually, could you put that book bag in this bin for disinfection?</p> <p>Some \u2013 but not all \u2013 children in England will be trotting back to familiar playgrounds on Monday. Though several schools aren\u2019t opening and many parents don\u2019t want to send their children in, hundreds of primary schools will be welcoming reception, year 1 and year 6 students, plus the children of key workers. Social distancing will be \u201cencouraged\u201d.</p> <p>Vast tracts of government advice have been issued to schools about health and safety in this new coronavirus world: an online bible \u2013 or at least a fat gospel \u2013 of reorganisation. Some advice seems to require building entirely new rooms: \u201cIf anyone becomes unwell\u2026 they should be moved, where possible to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door\u2026 They should use a separate bathroom if possible.\u201d Even headteachers don\u2019t have a separate bathroom, so perhaps you could give a four-year-old a bucket and shut her in the lost property cupboard?</p> <p>If you don\u2019t have kids, or you\u2019re not too involved in the care of your own, because of your Important Job, then teaching can seem simple. Set the work; get them to do it. Source a red pen for marking (VG or See me!). But teaching is the nice part of being a teacher; it\u2019s all the other stuff that takes time. You try getting 30 children to hang up their coats on the right clothes hangers, then line up sensibly to walk to another room, carrying the correct bag, and sit down in front of the right equipment that someone (you) has already set out.</p> <p>Creating an environment in which you can actually teach is the difficult bit. I once spoke to a nursery teacher about getting his charges out into a local garden, to plant seeds and get mucky. It was about 20 steps away from the school. He was keen and wanted to make regular visits, but it took so much time and effort to get the kids into protective romper suits and wellies (which the school had to buy), and then out of them afterwards, that it meant any other activity wouldn\u2019t happen for the whole morning. And, as we all know, three- and four-year-olds have a curriculum to complete.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/british-schools-science-children-education-testing-tracing\">When should British schools reopen?

One of the biggest shocks to your system, once your offspring start moving around by themselves, is how much life admin you suddenly have to do. How many of your conversations with other adults, especially your beloved, revolve around regulating and facilitating your children\u2019s lives. You\u2019re not just a taxi driver, but a PA, cook, cleaner, butler. Organisation is 90% of your job, as a parent. What of love, you may cry. But love also means making sure they\u2019re there, on time, in shoes, with sandwiches.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been trying to teach my nine-year-old during lockdown, and my efforts have not been up to Ofsted standards. This is in no way due to my teaching skills, which are exemplary, but due to my pre-teaching prep, which is not. We do the work on the kitchen table, which isn\u2019t always completely clear. She needs to use my laptop. (No, she doesn\u2019t have her own computer. She\u2019s nine.) As I have to work, this can present problems, and as a result, my daughter has become very good at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/fortnite\" title=\"\">Fortnite</a>, which she can play on another screen. Still, she made a little book with pictures of flowers in it, labelled, of her own accord, so my non-organised approach is clearly working. So sweet! I thought. So Cath Kidston (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/cath-kidston-to-close-all-60-uk-stores-with-loss-of-900-jobs\" title=\"\">RIP</a>)! Who needs teachers? For her next homemade book, she announced, she is going to draw and label all the Fortnite guns. Hashtag cute.</p> <p>Her school will be open next week but, as it\u2019s an inner city school, with not much room, social distancing is not easy. Each year has two classes of 30, and the only way such numbers can be accommodated is for the classes to attend on alternate weeks. They\u2019ll be divided into groups of 15, each child sitting on a separate desk, with sterilised equipment and pens. Each year group will enter by a different entrance, and will move around the school separately, with different areas in the playground. Shared equipment will be disinfected, hand sanitisers provided, regular handwashing supervised. PPE has been sourced for situations \u2013 such as dealing with children with disabilities \u2013 where \u201csocial distancing cannot be guaranteed\u201d. Lunch will not be a bunfight.</p> <p>None of this has happened by magic. I hate to break it to you, but no fairies worked the overnight shift to help sort this out. I\u2019m a school governor, so I know the government issued its final guidance just 16 days before they wanted school doors to open, at a time when there were already key workers\u2019 children to teach, plus online work being set for all year groups. The organisation this has required is immense. Could it be that the big guys of government haven\u2019t quite grasped the scale of what they\u2019re asking schools to do?</p> <p>Though I understand why others aren\u2019t, I\u2019m happy for my nine-year-old to return to class, when she\u2019s allowed. I know the towering effort that has gone into making it possible. Like I said: the teaching is the nice bit.</p>",

Meanwhile in Scarborough, squawking gulls conjure an evocative British seaside soundscape.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe hope to encourage people, even from windows and balconies, to make and share recordings of the dawn chorus at this exceptional and challenging time, when human activity is drastically reduced,\u201d said Gorman.</p> \n<p>Dr Lisa Gill, who is analysing the results, said: \u201cSome are simply beautiful: the golden oriole, the peacefulness of raindrops and blackbird song.\u201d Listening to sound reveals a very different hierarchy to visual observation: \u201cThe blackbird and the great tit are the most frequent, but this is about where the similarity ends.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Europe, the cuckoo, blackcap, wren and chiffchaff fly up the list.</p> \n<p>\u201cLittle brown birds are relatively difficult to spot and distinguish visually, but easily detected by ear \u2013 and who doesn\u2019t know what the cuckoo sounds like?\u201d said Gill. \u201cI believe most people identify birds by vision, which, as we can see, really influences the outcome.\u201d</p> \n<p>The project to capture the dawn chorus will be repeated annually and made available to the public to use in the creation of art and to help scientists monitor long-term changes in habitat quality and wildlife populations.</p>",
  "<p>The Covid-19 crisis has transformed all our lives in ways we could barely have imagined just a few weeks ago. In so many areas, we will be desperate to go back to \u201cnormal life\u201d as soon as safely possible. But in others, however, what we have learned in this crisis will \u2013 and should \u2013 reshape our thinking for ever.</p> <p>Educating the nation\u2019s children is one of those areas. All of us have had to adapt to play our part \u2013 from the thousands of teachers who have been delivering lessons remotely, to the many organisations offering resources for free to the parents who have had to balance homework with homeworking. Society as a whole has stepped up like never before.</p> <p>At the BBC, we have done our best to contribute. Our core mission is to educate, as well as inform and entertain, which is why we pulled out all the stops to support pupils, parents, and teachers when schools closed. Our <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize\">Bitesize Daily</a> package has offered two hours of original broadcast programming for pupils in years 1-10 every single day. By the end of the summer term we will have published nearly 2,000 daily lessons online. All are designed to support pupils, to take a load off parents, and to offer structure and support for teachers coping with new realities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/12/like-the-open-university-we-now-need-an-open-school-for-the-whole-country\">Like the Open University, we now need an Open School for the whole country | Tim Brighouse and Bob Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bitesize Daily has had 5 million visitors online every week since term began on 20 April, more than three times our site\u2019s usual weekly traffic. And BBC Education is driving more young people to sign up for a BBC account than anything else we currently make. Let no one tell you our young people aren\u2019t keen to learn.</p> <p>Now the BBC is starting to consider what lessons we might learn from our role in helping to educate the nation during these past few months. None of us knows how education systems will adapt as a result of the global coronavirus crisis. It is still uncertain what we will need to do collectively to meet children\u2019s needs in both the short and the long term as we emerge from lockdown.</p> <p>That is why I read with particular interest the proposal by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/12/like-the-open-university-we-now-need-an-open-school-for-the-whole-country\">Tim Brighouse and Bob Moon</a>, in Education Guardian, for a virtual Open School in the tradition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/openuniversity\">Open University</a>. They sketched out a compelling vision of an independent institution supporting students and teachers in school and out, offering high-quality self-learning tutored courses and resources in every subject, capable of helping to raise educational standards for decades to come. They also suggested a role for the BBC. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/07/when-the-covid-19-crisis-finally-ends-uk-schools-must-never-return-to-normal\">When the Covid-19 crisis finally ends, schools must never return to normal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The BBC is prepared to pick up this gauntlet, in partnership with others.

We could plan for next year\u2019s inevitably disrupted learning and explore what might come after that.</p> <p>Schools will always be the best places for children to learn. We will continue to be led by the government on the future of schooling in the UK. But the BBC has shown that we can play a critical role in the UK\u2019s education infrastructure and I would like to see this continue as an even greater part of the corporation\u2019s contribution to the nation.</p> <p>Where could this discussion take us? How could we support teachers and parents? How might learning change, in and outside schools? Could we help the students who struggle the most, including those excluded from school? Could we deliver the dream of equal access to enrichment activities such as the arts and music? Overall, could we create a public infrastructure that would make it easier for all schools to benefit while growing the market for commercial providers?</p> <p>I don\u2019t know the answers. But I am sure these questions are worth discussing, and quickly. The BBC is keen to play a part.

In normal times, no one would expect a Conservative government to proactively care about a world that consistently rallies opposition to it, and which \u2013 up late, non-conformist, possibly on drugs \u2013 is the antithesis of middle England.

To raise money, they are hosting livestreamed gigs and DJ sets, selling merchandise and bar tabs or raffling-off vinyl, artwork and tickets, with some success.</p> <p>However, framing this as a heroic struggle between music fans and The Man feels delusional. Community activism will be necessary to save venues. If you care, have connections or skills, or can donate to help, there will be opportunity over the next year. But as Covid-19\u2019s economic fallout spreads, as furlough ends and unemployment spikes, how many people will be able to defer ticket refunds or buy charity compilations on Bandcamp?

People love the fact they don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the box, someone said to me today they feel like they have bought their future self a present,\u201d he says.</p> <p>A Lost Stock box costs \u00a335, plus \u00a33.99 postage, and will contain at least three tops with a recommended retail price of \u00a370.</p> <p>The clothing boxes will contain tops, T-shirts and shirts rather than trousers \u2013 because a perfect fit isn\u2019t necessary. <br><br>Over a third of the cost of each box (37%), almost \u00a313, is then directly donated to Bangladesh though the <a href=\"https://sajidafoundation.org/\">Sajida</a><a href=\"https://sajidafoundation.org/\"> Foundation</a>, which has been donating food and hygiene parcels in the country during the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>Lost Stock will pay $11 (\u00a39) for the garments in each box, but provides a <a href=\"https://loststock.com/pages/costs\">breakdown of the cost of each box</a> on its website, including logistics and marketing.</p> <p>Russell isn\u2019t saying exactly which high street retailers had ordered the items which will end up in the boxes. The brand labels will be removed in Bangladesh, before the items are shipped to Europe, to be picked, packed and sent to consumers in six to eight weeks.</p> <p>\u201cIt is all spring summer stock so we want it to get to people for summer. If you order a box now chances are you will have it towards the end of June or start of July, we are doing everything we can to make it as fast as possible.\u201d<br></p> <p>Shoppers returning goods bought online poses a logistical challenge even for established retailers. Under the UK\u2019s distance selling regulations, Lost Stock will have to refund any customers who are not satisfied with the contents of their box.</p> <p>However Russell hopes that shoppers will swap items they do not want to keep with other users, or donate them to charity.<br><br>Lost Stock says it is not certain if it will make a profit from the venture, but given the success so far, it is considering introducing boxes of childrenswear.</p> <p>Russell adds: \u201cWe are quite far from our upper limit, there is so much stock out there.\u201d</p>",

Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve witnessed from the inside.<br><br>In March, I was furloughed by my employer.&nbsp;The financial impact was huge, and I decided to look for some temporary work to help with the bills.&nbsp;I saw an online ad for a temporary \u201ccustomer service adviser\u201d, which said: \u201cYou must have your own computer and high-speed internet to download our software and communicate with our customers \u2026 Don\u2019t let lockdown stop you getting your dream job.\u201d</p> <p>I have some experience in customer service, so I applied, and was then telephoned by someone who asked me some basic questions about customer service.&nbsp;He said my answers were great, and proceeded to tell me the role was working on the government\u2019s new track-and-trace programme. They would like to offer me a role, and I could start training the following Sunday.</p> <p>On my first day, I logged in and was put into an online chatroom with my new colleagues. There were about 100 of us, and it was soon pretty clear that people were having problems accessing the system correctly.&nbsp;Our trainer dipped in now and then, saying the training would start in 10 mins \u2013 10 mins later, they would repeat the message.&nbsp; Nearly two hours later the training began, but people were still having problems \u2013 at which point they were told there was nothing more they could do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I checked my schedule and saw that I was due to start the next day at 9am. Panic set in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The training was very basic. We saw some slides about our role \u2013 the public health website we will use, and a script for what we had to say to people.&nbsp;We were told: do not go off-script, and if there was anything we could not answer, we should ask our supervisor.&nbsp;</p> <p>The training was wrapped up early, and we were asked if we felt prepared.&nbsp;There was a chorus of no from many people. Some said yes, but I didn\u2019t see how anyone could be prepared for something they\u2019d only found out about a couple of hours ago, plus we hadn\u2019t even accessed the specific programmes.&nbsp;I checked my schedule and saw that I was due to start the next day at 9am. Panic set in.&nbsp;</p> <p>The trainer told us there was a further seven and a half hours of self-led training that we had to complete before \u201cgoing live\u201d. This seemed a little unfair, if not impossible to achieve by the next morning. We were reassured that we could probably get through the training in two to three hours \u2013 but we would be paid for all seven and a half.</p> <p>The trainer declared the training over and was immediately inundated with more questions from those anxious about what to do and when. The chatroom was then closed by the trainer, and we were left on our own.</p> <p>The self-led courses were very basic \u2013 with some generic dos and don\u2019ts about customer data, security and so on.&nbsp;I completed it all in less than one and a half hours, with a score of 95%+.</p> <p>The next morning I was worried, and feeling very unprepared.&nbsp;I felt the job was an important thing to do.&nbsp;But it was essential to get this right, and I didn\u2019t really understand the role and how to use the systems.&nbsp;I logged in and saw a message saying I would be invited to a chatroom and to please wait.</p> <p>I waited seven and a half hours (my entire shift).&nbsp;I called the HR helpline after about one hour and was told to relax \u2013 everyone is waiting.</p> <p>The next day I was scheduled to work again. This time, I <em>was</em> invited to a chatroom. I recognised many of the names in the group from my training, so knew the other people were also new.&nbsp;Many people were writing, \u201cDid anyone do anything yesterday?\u201d \u201cDo we just wait?\u201d \u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d</p> <p>The questions quickly turned to complaint, and we were left unsupervised for hours.&nbsp;A message then appeared asking us to complete our online training \u2013 which was met with a chorus of \u201cI did the training\u201d. The day passed as we waited, re-attempted training, and wrote messages to supervisors and got no response.</p> <p>Wednesday came (day four) and we got a message assuring us that we were getting paid \u2013 and to please wait.&nbsp;The comments came in \u201cLOL getting paid by the government for this\u201d, and \u201cthey\u2019ll be clapping for us on Thursday\u201d. It went downhill from there, and people started writing derogatory remarks.&nbsp;Others suggested we use the company phone system to practise calling each other on our computers.&nbsp;Again, supervisors didn\u2019t interject or offer any guidance. One person set up a Facebook group (for the people in our chat) and called it Panic Room. </p> <p>That night I saw someone from the track-and-trace programme had spoken to the BBC, and noted that their group had spent the day watching Netflix or playing games online. Having spent days feeling frustrated, I started to feel dejected too. </p> <p>Two days later I logged in for my weekend shift and discovered nothing had changed \u2013 and that I had clocked up 40 hours of key worker pay for doing absolutely nothing.</p> <p>After the Dominic Cummings story broke I started hearing more media stories about the track-and-trace programme.&nbsp;Health secretary Matt Hancock claimed that \u201chighly trained track-and-trace staff\u201d were in place. I still had not seen the government system we were supposed to use.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/dominic-cummings-achieves-global-infamy-in-whirlwind-week\">Dominic Cummings achieves global infamy in whirlwind week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the next few days I learned more about my job from watching the news than I did from those who were supposed to supervise me.&nbsp;I still did not feel qualified to do it. Then it was announced by Hancock that we were going live the next day.&nbsp;On my chat there was a message from a supervisor asking the more experienced members of our chat to help those who needed help. The blind leading the blind! How were people who started the same day as me, and who had the same short and basic training as I had, supposed to help me do my job?</p> <p>On Thursday, according to the government, the system launched.&nbsp;But for me, nothing changed. It was a day of waiting, with no system access.&nbsp;Yet on TV at the daily briefing, Boris Johnson told&nbsp;the nation all was well.</p> <p>To this day I remain a \u201ckey worker\u201d, paid \u00a310 an hour to sit in a chatroom \u2013 alone, lost, without support or help. Despite what the government is saying, it seems the relentless problem \u201cwith the system\u201d is another pandemic without a cure. Motivated as I am to help out during this difficult time \u2013 and after two weeks of doing \u201cpretend\u201d work on the track-and-trace programme \u2013 I have decided to quit and try to find a real way to help people.&nbsp;</p> <p>If Boris Johnson or Matt Hancock are reading this, I\u2019d ask them to please go into the chatrooms you created and read what people are saying. You will see a lot of anger and confusion from a lot of people. And none of them have any faith that we\u2019re properly set up to fight any increase in infection rate from this pandemic.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/rio-tinto-blasts-46000-year-old-aboriginal-site-to-expand-iron-ore-mine\">46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site destroyed by Rio Tinto this month</a> is one of more than 463 sites that mining companies operating in Western Australia have applied for permission to destroy or disturb since 2010.</p> <p>None of those applications have been refused. And under the state\u2019s 48-year-old Aboriginal heritage laws, only the land- or leaseholder has the right to appeal \u2013 traditional owners do not.</p> <p>The figures show that the shocking destruction of the sites in the Juukan Gorge in the western Pilbara was not unique.</p> <p>The conflict between mining companies and Aboriginal heritage, particularly in mineral-rich areas such as the iron ore-rich Hamersley range of the Pilbara, has spawned a system of suffocating bureaucracy and lopsided agreement-making that privileges development over protecting sacred spaces and leaves traditional owners with no legislative power, and very little institutional power, to fight back.</p> <p>The Juukan one and two sites are listed on WA\u2019s Aboriginal heritage register as Brock-20 and Brock-21. They sit a short distance apart in Juukan Gorge, about 60km from the mining town of Tom Price, on the edge of the multibillion-dollar Brockman 4 iron ore mine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/rio-tinto-blasts-46000-year-old-aboriginal-site-to-expand-iron-ore-mine\">Rio Tinto blasts 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site to expand iron ore mine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Juukan two is one of the only sites on the Pilbara to show continual human occupation through the last ice age, and archeological records, including bone pits that catalogued changing fauna, dated back 46,000 years.</p> <p>The sites were drilled and set with explosives last week. Traditional owners the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) peoples don\u2019t yet know the full extent of the damage.</p> <p>The operation had been discussed at meetings with Rio Tinto over a number of years, but Burchell Hayes, one of the directors of the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation, says those meetings often conveyed technical information which PKKP elders found hard to interpret. He says the \u201cblunt details\u201d that would have helped them understand exactly what was being proposed, and when, was lacking.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe sadness and the loss of our country has been very distressing,\u201d Hayes said.</p> <p>Rio Tinto says the \u201cmining activity\u201d conducted this month was \u201cundertaken in accordance with all necessary approvals\u201d, which had been obtained following a decade of \u201cdetailed consultation\u201d with the PKKP.</p> <p>\u201cWe are sorry that the recently expressed concerns of the PKKP did not arise through the engagements that have taken place over many years under the agreement that governs our operations on their country,\u201d a company statement says.</p> <p>The PKKP Aboriginal Corporation rejected that statement on Saturday, saying they had told Rio Tinto of the importance of the site on a number of occasions since 2013, the last as recently as March.</p> <p>Hayes said the mining company did not advise the PKKP of its intention to blast, and they only found out \u201cby default\u201d on 15 May \u201cwhen we sought access to the area for Naidoc Week in July\u201d.</p> <p>On a site visit in October 2019, Hayes said, their cultural and heritage manager, Dr Heather Builth, told a senior manager from the mine that the rock shelters were significant.</p> <p>\u201c[He] advised Dr Builth that there were no plans to extend the mine and Rio Tinto had been monitoring Juukan Gorge for vibration effects of local blasting,\u201d Hayes said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cAt all times the PKKPAC has been direct and explicit in the archaeological and ethnographic significance of these rock shelters and the importance that they be preserved. For Rio Tinto to suggest otherwise is incorrect.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe Rio Tinto\u2019s outrageous statement is a bid to minimise the adverse public reaction and community outrage about Sunday\u2019s blast at Juukan Gorge; and the distress and upset caused to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people.\u201d</p> <p>The WA Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, says he is normally \u201ccontacted pretty rapidly by the relevant Aboriginal organisation\u201d when a heritage site is under imminent threat, but was not called in this case.</p> <p>\u201cThe first I heard about this was after the explosion,\u201d Wyatt told reporters in Perth.</p> <p>The federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, says he received an 11th hour call from lawyers for the PKKP advising him of the risk and asking for advice, and that he advised them to seek an injunction under federal heritage legislation.</p> <p>He did not take it further or intervene, but said in a statement after the blast that the \u201cdestruction should not have occurred\u201d.</p> <p>Even if Ben Wyatt had known, there are no legal levers under the current legislation that allow for ministerial intervention. Wyatt has promised to reform the laws but consultation on that reform has been slow and was put off again last month due to the coronavirus.</p> <p>It is now highly unlikely the WA government will have those new laws drafted and through parliament before the state election next March.</p> <p>Robin Chapple, a Greens MP who campaigned alongside Wyatt to reform the legislation when Labor was in opposition, says Wyatt has \u201cfound himself to be incredibly compromised\u201d by the conflicting responsibilities of protecting Aboriginal heritage, as Aboriginal affairs minister, and supporting its most significant industry as the state\u2019s treasurer.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot have one person who is pushing the state in the pursuit of mining \u2026 being the same person that has to represent the interests of Aboriginal people to protect the excesses of the mining industry from destroying their sites,\u201d Chapple says.</p> <p>In response, Wyatt says he acts \u201cin the interests of all Western Australians when carrying out my ministerial responsibilities\u201d and that his dual portfolios \u201conly elevates the significance of Aboriginal affairs within this government\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/19/fertiliser-plant-is-not-damaging-burrup-peninsula-rock-art-epa-says\">Fertiliser plant is not damaging Burrup Peninsula rock art, EPA says</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How did this happen?</h2> <p>Negotiations over the protection of Juukan Gorge began in 2003. In 2005, Hamersley Iron, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, applied for environmental approval to build a new iron ore mine dubbed Brockman 4.</p> <p>Documents submitted as part of that assessment process said it had found 27 archaeological sites within the project area: mostly rock shelters with some artefact scatters, water sources and scarred trees.</p> <p>It said that identified Aboriginal heritage sites \u201cmay need to be either disturbed or actively managed\u201d for the mine to proceed but that \u201cit is not anticipated that the project will adversely impact on any areas of ethnographic significance\u201d.</p> <p>In 2008, the archaeologist Dr Michael Slack was engaged to conduct a test dig in the large rock shelter known as Juukan two, and concluded it was a \u201cquite significant\u201d site that was about 20,000 years old.</p> <p>In 2013, Rio Tinto applied for and was granted ministerial consent under <a href=\"http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/aha1972164/s18.html\">section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972</a> to destroy Juukan one and two, as part of the expansion of its proposed Brockman 4 mine, which had become operational three years earlier.</p> <p>The minister who provided that consent was Peter Collier, a member of the Barnett Liberal government that was in power at the time. But it\u2019s unlikely he knew the details of what he signed off on, Chapple says.</p> <p>All applications are assessed by the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Committee, which then provides a recommendation with scant detail to the minister.</p> <p>There is no legislated requirement for the ACHC to consult traditional owners. In 2015, the committee was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/02/landmark-wa-judgement-on-aboriginal-sacred-sites-prompts-call-for-review\">chastised by the supreme court for using an invalid definition of sacred sites that explicitly excluded sites that were part of songlines</a>.</p> <p>In 2014, after permission to destroy the site had been granted, a salvage mission dated the Juukan two site at 46,000 years old and of very high archaeological and cultural significance. One year later the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura were granted native title over the area, and a 10,888sq km patch of the Hamersley range.</p> <p>That gave them the right to negotiate over any new developments, and to make financial agreements with mining companies profiting from their land. But it did not confer any legal ability to protect heritage sites, unless negotiated as part of a land use agreement.</p> <p>Those land use agreements are designed to foster closer relationships between industry and Aboriginal peoples, like the relationship that Rio says it has with the PKKP. The relationship is both financial and institutional, and can make it difficult to take a disagreement over a matter like the protection of a heritage site into a public arena.</p> <p>But because of the lack of power granted to traditional owners under the WA Aboriginal Heritage Act, a public fight is the only mechanism left to traditional owners to defend heritage if negotiation fails.</p> <p>Chapple says the financial ties between traditional owner corporations and the mining companies that threaten their heritage are well known, but rarely discussed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly corrupt, I just think we need to know that there are relationships that can be used to the benefit of the mining companies,\u201d Chapple says. \u201cYou get this in small communities, and Western Australia is a small community.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/apr/02/landmark-wa-judgement-on-aboriginal-sacred-sites-prompts-call-for-review\">Landmark WA judgment on Aboriginal sacred sites prompts call for review</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>An antiquated law</h2> <p>The Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 has been relatively unchanged for almost 50 years and does not give traditional owners any formal right of consultation or appeal.&nbsp;</p> <p>In his second reading speech in April 1972, the then minister for community welfare, Bill Willessee, said the legislation had been drafted because \u201cthe preservation of sites and objects of Aboriginal origin is now recognised throughout Australia as an important aspect of providing Aboriginal citizens with the social environment that they need when they still retain partly or wholly their traditional beliefs\u201d.</p> <p>This speech proved more enlightened than the resulting legislation, says Greg McIntyre SC, a leading expert on Aboriginal heritage cases.</p> <p>He says that had the legislation included a strong emphasis on spiritual value as a basis for heritage protection, he would be \u201creasonably happy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that the legislation doesn\u2019t even do that,\u201d he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>Under the current legislation, McIntyre says, the only legal option for traditional owners who oppose a decision allowing the destruction of their heritage lies in administrative law, an argument that due process has not been followed. That does not in itself halt a development, but it does cause delays.</p> <p>\u201cAdministrative relief is like guerrilla warfare in that you hope it will slow people down and they will be forced to rethink it, but it doesn\u2019t really get to the key issues of whether it\u2019s affecting Aboriginal heritage or the environment,\u201d McIntyre says.</p> <p>Even if the act is reformed, McIntyre says, the economic importance of the mining industry made it likely that the focus would remain on finding a compromise between heritage and industry.</p> <p>\u201cThe best legislation I think we\u2019re likely to get is legislation that has a heavy emphasis on involving Aboriginal people in the decision making, but with the understanding that ultimately they will be expected at best to go into partnership with those that wish to extract minerals rather than prevent that from happening,\u201d he says.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 4 June 2020 to correct the date&nbsp;the&nbsp;PKKP Aboriginal Corporation found out about the plan to blast the site, and the date of the site visit in which Rio Tinto was informed of its significance.</p></li> </ul>"
