  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Trump continues to push theory that virus came from lab</h2> <p>\u201cSomething happened,\u201d the US president told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p> <p>\u201cProbably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,\u201d he added during a meeting with the Texas governor.</p> <p>It comes after US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, claimed he had seen \u201cenormous evidence\u201d that the virus had originated at the lab. No evidence has been produced. China<strong> </strong>has denied the claims.</p> <h2>Global death toll nears 270,000</h2> <p>The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached 268,999, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic.</p> <p>The US death toll from coronavirus has now <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">surpassed 75,000 people</a>, the highest globally, followed by the UK with 30,689 deaths.</p> <p>The countries with the next highest numbers of deaths are Italy with 29,958 and Spain with 26,070.</p> <h2><strong>White House reportedly shelved guidance on reopening businesses</strong></h2> <p>A report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was shelved by the White House, according to AP News.</p> <p>The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal.</p> <p>The 17-page report was scheduled to be published on Friday but now the guidance \u201cwill never see the light of day\u201d, a CDC official told AP.</p> <p>It urges businesses to slowly reopen while continuing to observe social distancing. Trump has pushed for a rapid reopening despite fears of a surge in coronavirus cases.</p> <h2>Concerns over UK contact-tracing app</h2> <p>The UK\u2019s contact-tracing app<strong> </strong>must not be rolled out until the government has increased privacy and data protections, a parliamentary committee has said, as rights groups warn that the current trial is unlawful under the Data Protection Act.</p> <p>The joint committee on human rights said it was essential legislation was enacted to ensure the mass surveillance of personal data did not result in a violation before the trial was expanded.</p> <p>The app, which is being trialled on the Isle of Wight, logs users\u2019 movements and can alert people if they have had contact with someone who has developed symptoms.</p> <h2>Madrid health director resigns as region seeks to lift lockdown</h2> <p>The director of public health for the Madrid region, Yolanda Fuentes, has resigned, apparently in protest at the regional government\u2019s decision to seek to loosen lockdown restrictions in the area of Spain hardest hit by coronavirus.</p> <p>Fuentes stepped down as the Madrid regional government prepares to seek permission from the national health ministry to reopen small businesses, with restaurant and bar terraces opening at 30% capacity.</p> <p>Fuentes is understood to have had grave reservations about the move, as Madrid remains badly affected by the virus.</p> <h2>France\u2019s daily death total falls</h2> <p>France reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, a fall from 278 the previous day, and saw its number of patients in intensive care drop under 3,000 for the first time since late March.</p> <p>The health ministry said 25,987 people were now confirmed to have died from the virus in hospitals and nursing homes.</p> <h2>France reveals easing of lockdown measures</h2> <p>The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said the country\u2019s<strong> </strong>border will remain closed for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d except for absolutely essential professional or family reasons and trans-border workers, and they will still need to carry an international declaration.</p> <p>Although restrictions will be eased in some areas, in the capital and the four adjoining regions \u2013 Ile-de-France, Hauts-de-France, Grand Est Bourgogne-Franche-Comte \u2013 which comprise the \u201cred zone\u201d, public parks and gardens will remain shut.</p> <p>Anyone stopped by police or gendarmes making a journey of more than 100km will need a new sworn declaration stating the journey is absolutely essential.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil records further 610 deaths</strong></h2> <p>Brazil<strong> </strong>registers 9,888 new cases of coronavirus and 610 deaths on Thursday, the country\u2019s health ministry said. That brought the total to 135,106 confirmed cases in Brazil, with 9,146 deaths from Covid-19.</p> <h2>WHO study: 190,000 people in Africa could die from virus</h2> <p>Up to 190,000 people in Africa could die of Covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study by the World Health Organization.</p> <p>Algeria, South Africa and Cameroon are among the countries at high risk if containment measures are not prioritised, the study found.</p> <p>It also warned that health services would be overwhelmed with the number of people requiring treatment and recommends that hospitals increase their capacity.</p> <h2>Turkey records 57 further deaths</h2> <p>The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Turkey has risen by 57 in the last 24-hours to 3,641, Health Ministry data showed.</p> <p>The overall number of cases rose by 1,977 to 133,721, the highest total outside western Europe, the US and Russia.</p> <h2>Australian cabinet set to ease restrictions in stages</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s national cabinet is expected to ease some social distancing restrictions on Friday as the number of new coronavirus infections slows.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s minister for health, Greg Hunt, said he expected the cabinet to detail a timetable for easing those restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I expect is a clear roadmap out, with clear stages,\u201d Hunt told reporters.</p>",

  "<p>Along Plumas Street in Yuba City, California, diners on Tuesday sat in restaurants, sipping their drinks and enjoying their meals. Women relaxed in cushy spa chairs as pedicurists massaged their legs. A hair stylist fluffed and blow-dried a client\u2019s hair.</p> <p>Only the protective face masks on the food service workers \u2013 and the few shops that remained closed \u2013 hinted at the global pandemic gripping the rest of the state, which was still under the same stay-at-home order that has been in place since 19 March.</p> <p>California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, had begun the week with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/04/california-lockdown-business-reopen-coronavirus\">cautious concession</a> that after weeks under shutdown, some regions could begin to modify the order. Some retailers would be able to offer curbside pickup starting Friday \u2013 but for rural communities like Yuba and Sutter counties that have not seen the level of infection that other parts of the state have experienced, the governor\u2019s cautious approach simply was not enough.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.suttercounty.org/assets/pdf/2020-05-04_COVID-19_Limit_Activities_Order.pdf\">following the directive</a> of their bi-county public health officer, Dr Phuong Luu, businesses across both counties that were deemed \u201clower-risk\u201d reopened under certain modifications. After weeks of darkened windows and closed signs, residents were once again flocking to their favorite gyms, salons, tattoo parlors and sit-down eateries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/co-living-coronavirus-roommates-starcity\">Co-living in a pandemic: how I'm surviving life with 48 roommates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Newsom called the counties\u2019 move \u201ca big mistake\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re putting the public at risk, they\u2019re putting our progress at risk,\u201d he said at Tuesday\u2019s briefing. But the clash between the two reopening orders highlights the struggles that come with governing a state as large and as diverse as California, especially in a pandemic. Last week, officials from six rural northern California counties<a href=\"https://ad03.asmrc.org/sites/default/files/files-uploaded/Local%20Control%20COVID19.pdf\"> wrote to Newsom</a>, asking him to allow their localities to take charge of their own reopening.</p> <p>Many in these counties argue that a one-size-fits-all approach from Sacramento too often ignores the needs of rural communities in favor of<strong> </strong>population centers like Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t paint us with the same paintbrush that you\u2019re going to paint San Francisco and San Diego and Sacramento with,\u201d said the Sutter county lawmaker Mike Ziegenmeyer. \u201cThat\u2019s just not fair.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We cannot wait for a vaccine\u2019</h2> <p>Yuba and Sutter are located just north of Sacramento, but a few minutes\u2019 drive from the state capital, the region\u2019s agriculture overtakes the scenery. Miles of orchards, plowed fields, flooded rice paddies and cow pastures separate Sacramento and Yuba City, the county seat of Sutter, and Marysville, the county seat of Yuba, located just over the Feather River from Yuba City.</p> <p>Just more than 78,000 live in Yuba while almost 97,000 live in Sutter, with more than two-thirds of the county population residing in Yuba City. Since the pandemic reached California, the two counties have reported 50 cases and three deaths. California in total has seen 58,815 cases, with 2,412 deaths as of Thursday. The six Bay Area counties that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-bay-area\">were the first</a> in the country to issue a stay-at-home order have had more than 8,100 cases, while Los Angeles county\u2019s more than 28,000 cases have led to more than half of the state\u2019s deaths.</p> <p>For three weeks before Luu issued her reopening order, the rate of new cases in Yuba and Sutter plateaued, she said. In the more populated counties around Yuba and Sutter, the rate has plateaued for almost two weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a00d4b993abfe106881dcf54ec48abde9c19e37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a00d4b993abfe106881dcf54ec48abde9c19e37/0_169_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zhen Wan of YW Massage wears gloves and face masks as he massages a customer in Yuba City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zhen Wan of YW Massage wears gloves and face masks as he massages a customer in Yuba City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Kitagaki Jr/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many in the county have attributed the low rate of infection to rural living \u2013 with fewer people who live further away from one another, the chances of spreading the virus are lowered. But with rural living comes a different set of needs. There\u2019s more of a sense of isolation when sheltering in place. With fewer businesses open, fewer supplies are available. And perhaps most daunting in counties like Yuba and Sutter is the question of the economy.</p> <p>More than a third of the civilian labor force work farm jobs, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/regions/west/ca_yubacity_msa.htm#eag_ca_yubacity_msa.f.2\">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Of the remaining workforce, only about 3,600 work the information or professional and business services jobs that allow for telecommuting.</p> <p>Luu said as a public health official, she had to consider \u201cthe totality of health for the entire community\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCovid-19 is dangerous and scary but it is not the only health issue,\u201d Luu said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot wait for a vaccine without seeing extreme economic damage done to our community. The consequences of waiting will be additional health concerns brought on by stress and the very real dilemma for those with limited resources whether to buy life-saving food or life-saving medicines.\u201d</p> <p>By Wednesday, Luu was<a href=\"https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909776/2020/05/2020-05-06_Luu_Business_Letter.pdf\"> issuing a warning</a> to the Yuba and Sutter business community, warning them about not following the social distancing and protective gear guidelines she had put in place for the counties\u2019 reopening. \u201cIt has become clear a number of businesses are not enacting required protocols to ensure the safety of the community,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI understand that some of your customers may strongly object to a facial covering requirement, but the long-term safety of our community is at stake. We do not want to take any steps back in our phasing-in efforts.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re following the guidelines strictly\u2019</h2> <p>In Yuba City and Marysville on Tuesday, few customers wore masks when they entered stores or strolled along the sidewalks. But several businesses took Luu\u2019s guidelines to heart.</p> <p>The waitstaff at the Happy Viking sports bar wore face masks and gloves and were strict about how many people they allowed inside at a time. While diners sat at tables spaced feet apart from each other inside the restaurant, those waiting outside to be seated bunched up by the door.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still smoothing stuff out,\u201d said Sandy Drown, who has owned the Happy Viking with her husband for 12 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3f69ef31a4d16726fce006e426534d573320c6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3f69ef31a4d16726fce006e426534d573320c6c/0_185_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Restaurant owner Sandy Drown talks with a customer, Tim Schmidt, at the Happy Viking Sports Pub.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Restaurant owner Sandy Drown talks with a customer, Tim Schmidt, at the Happy Viking Sports Pub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharon Bernstein/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though they still offered takeout under the stay-at-home order, their business dropped 74% since March, Drown said. They burned through their savings and had to let go of 39 of their 47 employees.</p> <p>She rehired all of them this week.</p> <p>At the Training Zone in Marysville, staff stood at the front to remind entering gym members that they had wear face masks while working out. In addition to spacing out all the equipment and limiting capacity to 75 members at a time, the owner, Chris Gill, hired more cleaning staff and cut hours to fit in extra cleaning.</p> <p>\u201cWe really respect what the county did and kind of going out on a limb for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re taking the precautions and following the guidelines really, really strictly.\u201d</p> <p>In the past few days, his staff has taken a number of calls from prospective members wanting to sign up because their gym still wasn\u2019t open, Gill said. They have also taken a number from members who wanted to freeze their accounts because they were not comfortable returning just yet.</p> <p>Melissa Poma, owner of Melissa Poma Hair Salon in Yuba City, has been contacted nonstop by new clientele. On Monday, the first day of the reopening, she said it was like a scene out of a zombie movie, people coming up to her window just in shock to see someone cutting hair again. She received an inquiry from a woman who lived a few hours away but was so desperate for a haircut that she was willing to drive in.</p> <p>The problem is, Poma said, she needs to be careful. Even though she burned through her savings during the closure and could use the extra income, she is only taking clients that she knows and can be honest with when it comes to their health. \u201cI have a child,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my child is in the hospital, I\u2019m not going to be there with him. I have a mother, I have a grandmother. I\u2019m taking it very seriously.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We recognize one size does not fit all\u2019</h2> <p>Though she\u2019s getting in what work that she can, Poma doesn\u2019t think the counties\u2019 reopening will be long-term. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can go by the health regulations in this industry,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do a six-foot-away haircut.\u201d Like others, Poma is conflicted.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s rough,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country worships the money god so much that we will put our health on the back burner. But livelihoods, people are closing down. I can\u2019t imagine if you don\u2019t have any sort of anything to fall back on.\u201d</p> <p>She knows too that by operating while the state\u2019s order is still in effect, she risks the state taking away her license. Already this week, the state regulatory boards have begun flexing in the rural communities that reopened early. On Tuesday, state alcoholic beverage control officials were in Yuba and Sutter, asking licensed locations to shift to takeout dining, and to close in-house dining voluntarily. John Carr, a spokesman for the state agency, said while agents could discipline and file administrative action against businesses that do not comply with their requests, \u201cwe hope for voluntary compliance.\u201d</p> <p>Newsom could choose to enforce the state order more stringently in the coming days. Previously, he\u2019s leaned toward education rather than enforcement, but when photos of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/27/california-beaches-coronavirus-orange-county\">packed beaches in southern California</a> made headlines around the country, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/california-beaches-closed-coronavirus-risks-experts\">ordered</a> all beaches in Orange county closed for a weekend. Even then, however, law enforcement aimed not to arrest people violating the order.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a4efc8242aab0344ef0bc00c1e0e6a913031aba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a4efc8242aab0344ef0bc00c1e0e6a913031aba/0_81_5417_3252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Server Jonnie Overmire goes over the menu for customers at the Lambert House Cafe in Yuba City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Server Jonnie Overmire goes over the menu for customers at the Lambert House Cafe in Yuba City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the state, cases have continued to rise incrementally, but<strong> </strong>numbers have not reached the doomsday predictions initially projected by state experts. As of Thursday, only 3,334 patients with confirmed cases were hospitalized statewide, along with 1,347 with suspected cases. State health officials have repeatedly pleaded with Californians,<strong> </strong>however, not to become complacent with their efforts, and to recognize that it is because of their actions that the numbers are where they are.</p> <p>For some in communities like Yuba and Sutter, however, the state is taking it too far. \u201cI feel like the state\u2019s a little overdramatic,\u201d said Steve Lewis, a tattoo artist at Artistic Temple Social Club in Marysville. After weeks of no work, Lewis is just happy he can pay his bills again.</p> <p>\u201cI have a lot of friends in this industry in other parts of the state who are in the same boat I was in just last week, and they\u2019re just trying to get through, selling art, trying to do gift cards, doing GoFundMes,\u201d he said. \u201cI can work again. They can\u2019t. I see everyone else in that position, and it\u2019s a rough thing. I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/coronavirus-er-nurse-testing-swabs\">Six swabs a shift: hospital units battle over precious rapid Covid tests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Newsom often refers to California as a \u201cnation-state\u201d in his daily briefings, to give \u201ca sense of the scale and scope\u201d of a state with the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and a population of almost 40 million.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognize that one size does not fit all,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CAgovernor/status/1249773282309468165\">said</a>. \u201cYou can\u2019t manage a state this large, this diverse in every way, shape or form ethnically, racially, religiously, on the basis of geography, without recognizing a bottom-up construct.\u201d</p> <p>But he has repeatedly stressed that California must be united in its response against coronavirus.</p> <p>In that regard, the governor and Ziegenmeyer, the Sutter county lawmaker, are in agreement. \u201cThis is the way I look at it, and the way I hope he looks at it: we\u2019re all a team in this in the state of California,\u201d Ziegenmeyer said.

The government moved to manage expectations about how far restrictions would be loosened next week, stressing it would exercise \u201cmaximum caution\u201d with easing any measures. There is rising tension between the UK and devolved governments, with the prime minister yet to share details of his lockdown plan with the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, prompting devolved leaders to make pre-emptive announcements of their own (more below). The government also, unusually, did not formally extend the lockdown as required by law today.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Black men and women are four times more likely to die after contracting Covid-19 than white people,</strong> research from the ONS revealed. After taking into account age, measures of self-reported health and disability and other socio-demographic characteristics, black people were still 1.9 times more likely to die with coronavirus than their white counterparts. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities are also significantly more likely to die. Social factors including living in overcrowded, multifamily or intergenerational households, relative deprivation, and working in public-facing occupations may help explain why this is the case for BAME people, but there is much to still be explained, the ONS report said.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Unemployment could double and the economy could shrink by 14%</strong> as the coronavirus causes the deepest recession in modern history, the Bank of England forecast. In a warning over the mounting damage to the economy since the onset of the pandemic and the lockdown measures to contain it, the Bank said GDP could plunge by 25% in the second quarter. It could take a year for the economy to return to normal and there were risks of long-term damage, it added.</li> \n   <li><strong>Scotland\u2019s strict lockdown regulations \u201cmust be extended\u201d but Nicola Sturgeon will consider allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day </strong>if the scientific evidence permits, the Scottish government said. The first minister said she saw no case for relaxing the lockdown because the transmission rate was still too high.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The Welsh government said schools in Wales would not reopen on 1 June</strong>, regardless of what happens in England.</li> \n   <li><strong>Airports owned by MAG are to require passengers to cover faces and wear gloves and temperature screening trials are to begin in the coming weeks</strong>. The firm, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, said people needed to be able to travel safely when the time is right.

But he said Boris Johnson would set out a \u201croadmap\u201d for the way forward on Sunday, containing \u201cappropriate measures to be taken at appropriate milestones, subject to very clear conditions\u201d. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There will be detailed guidance to help inform, advise and reassure the public, businesses and other organisations. To get this right, we have set milestones. Some changes can confidently be introduced more quickly than others and some of those other ones will take longer to introduce.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Raab downplayed suggestions any early changes would be far-reaching. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any changes in the short term will be modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored.</p> \n   <p>If we find in the future the R level goes back up or that people aren\u2019t following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab conceded that Scotland and Wales might not proceed at exactly the same pace as England.</strong> He said the four nations of the UK were cooperating closely. But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Even if different parts may move at slightly different speeds, the key thing is those decisions are made based on the science and the circumstances for each nation.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that 30,615 people in the UK have now died from coronavirus, up 539 from yesterday\u2019s figure.</strong> This is the number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus and died.

shows.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Your probability of dying with Covid is made up of two things, firstly your probability of actually being infected in the first place and then secondly, your probability of dying once you have been infected.</p> \n   <p>Now those two things are influenced by your personal circumstances to a large degree, so the first thing we did is, we looked at adjusting for age, what the difference was of dying to these ethnic groups and that brought out some quite stark differences.</p> \n   <p>So just adjusting for age, we saw that the black ethnic grouping was just over four times more likely to die of Covid-related issues than the white group, the Bangladeshi and Pakistani grouping was about 3.5 times more likely and the Indian grouping about 2.5 times more likely.</p> \n   <p>Those figures are just when we adjust for age, but we know other circumstances matter, so we want to try and introduce those other circumstances, which we can do, because we have geographical location from the death certificate and the death registration.</p> \n   <p>So we know for example, big cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester have been more affected, we know from figures that we released last Friday that whether you\u2019re in an urban or rural area matters, your area\u2019s relative level of deprivation matters, so there\u2019s really a strong social gradient to mortality rates generally, and even more for Covid.</p> \n   <p>So we needed to adjust for those other factors as well, so geography is a key one and then other socio-economic factors, we could get data from the census records that we\u2019ve linked the deaths to, so things like people\u2019s qualifications, people\u2019s housing circumstances, what type of jobs or occupations they had and their self-reported health.</p> \n   <p>When we adjust for all those other things, then actually those rates come down significantly, a lot of the difference can be explained by these geographical and socio-economic factors.</p> \n   <p>Once we\u2019ve adjusted for that, the black ethnic group is now about 90% or 1.9 times more likely to die from Covid-related issues, Bangladeshi and Pakistani males are about 80% more likely, females about 60% more likely and Indian females are about 40% more likely and males about 30% more likely.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n

Therefore, the fully adjusted results show differences in risk between ethnic groups that are specific to those ethnic groups and are not caused by any of the factors listed on which members of the groups might differ.</p> \n   <p>Adjusting for these factors substantially reduces the odds of a death involving Covid-19 relative to those of white ethnicity for all ethnic groups.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, even making allowance for all these factors, black people are still almost twice as likely to die from coronavirus as white people.

Devised by the campaign-winning brains behind \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d and \u201cTake Back Control\u201d, it was a signal that the prime minister was serious about a lockdown after weeks of insisting that only handwashing was necessary to combat coronavirus.</p> <p>At first it seemed to be working, emblazoned across three physically distanced podiums every day for Downing Street\u2019s press conference. Additional hard-hitting social media adverts stressed that \u201cpeople will die\u201d if the advice was not followed.</p> <p>And the figures showed that people were indeed staying at home for the most part, with traffic and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/rail-journeys-at-5-of-normal-levels-as-uk-stays-home-due-to-coronavirus\">public transport usage down hugely</a> for weeks.</p> <p>However, the purity of the message began to fray as cabinet splits emerged on how to begin to ease the lockdown, and the pace it should be done. While Johnson was recovering from coronavirus in hospital and then at his Chequers country retreat, the first rumblings started to appear in the media from anonymous ministers pressing for schools to be reopened, less than three weeks after the lockdown was first imposed.</p> <p>Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Liz Truss, the trade secretary, have emerged as the most hawkish about a swift end to restrictions because of worries about the economy and its wider public health impacts on mental health, domestic violence and deaths from other missed illnesses.</p> <p>This reflects the wider mood of the party, according to one Conservative MP. \u201cI think it\u2019s an incredibly dangerous moment for No 10, because of the risk of getting it wrong. There is some real worry about this in party, about not having a decision and a clear message. We will fight for anything but this is not the way to do it. And there is widespread concern among backbenchers that without an end to the lockdown soon we\u2019ll destroy the economy further and not really save any extra lives,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Tory insiders say the tensions inside the cabinet and wider party have led to a battle over the right strategy, and hence some of the confusion.</p> <p>Alastair Campbell, the former director of communications in Downing Street under Tony Blair, who has been a <a href=\"https://members.tortoisemedia.com/2020/05/06/alastair-campbell-we-are-witnessing-a-national-catastrophe/content.html?sig=1IaM3HYQEvzm74zpF3f1flO-claAr-DkWAUtzfsjeuU&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=national-catastrophe&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=national_catastrophe\">consistent critic</a> of the government\u2019s messaging, said: \u201cI just think they are completely out of their depth and because most of the press is so slavish it makes them totally complacent.</p> <p>\u201cThey just don\u2019t think things through. I\u2019m afraid I think it\u2019s all of a pattern. The reason all this matters is that at some stage they are going to have to reset their strategy in a pretty big way and how they communicate with the public... they\u2019re not going to be able to do that until they admit they have made a lot of mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cAll they need to do is say these are the facts, these are the problems and this is how we will deal with them. They\u2019ve turned everything into: \u2018We\u2019re right, everybody\u2019s wrong, aren\u2019t we doing well?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c561db998061a124233fb88421f9cdf7ba93a749\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c561db998061a124233fb88421f9cdf7ba93a749/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Front pages on Thursday declare the end of the lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Front pages on Thursday declare the end of the lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Criticism of the government\u2019s approach is also coming from members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), with scientists increasingly frustrated about information being given out piecemeal in political briefings, rather than communicated factually at the right time.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really unhelpful to have bits and pieces of information leaked,\u201d one Sage adviser said. \u201cThey are going to have to undo, now, a lot of damage. The government needs to come out before Sunday. The sooner there is some damage limitation, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about, the better.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly damaging. If people are primed to look at things in a certain way, it will shape how they receive the information. So on Sunday they will be looking for the green lights and they won\u2019t notice the red lights. It\u2019s a really powerful way of influencing people.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a three-day sunny bank holiday weekend, and sections of society may take this as \u2018we\u2019ll do what we want\u2019 because it\u2019s all changing Sunday anyway. Once the lid is taken off and people break some rules, they will be much more likely to carry on breaking them.\u201d</p> <p>The scientist stressed that there was an urgent need for more focus on social distancing, hand hygiene, the use of tissues, and the nose, mouth and eyes messaging again. \u201cThis is an example of the dangers of trailing, rather than getting the whole message all in one go,\u201d they added.</p> <p>Speaking in a personal capacity, John Drury, professor of social psychology at the University of Sussex, expressed similar concerns. He is a member of an expert sub-group \u2013 the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviour (<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873732/07-role-of-behavioural-science-in-the-coronavirus-outbreak.pdf\">SPI-B</a>) \u2013 that feeds in to Sage.</p> <p>\u201cThe rightwing media\u2019s language and premature celebration of the supposed end of lockdown is dangerous and irresponsible framing of what might be about to happen,\u201d he said, warning that the messaging was at odds with the continued need to maintain the handwashing and physical distancing that will still be needed.</p> <p>\u201cThese headlines risk creating a normative climate where people think that we can all go straight back to the old \u2018normal\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 May 2020.

Shops will reopen but cafes and restaurants will stay shut, and people will be able to leave home without a form stating the reason.</p> \n<p>Some restrictions, however, will remain in place in four regions including the greater Paris area, where the virus is still circulating.

We will have to try to build this virus into our everyday lives, changing our behaviour to reduce its transmission.

Yolanda Fuentes was understood to have had grave reservations about moving to \u201cphase 1\u201d, which includes the reopening of small businesses, and restaurant and bar terraces at 30% capacity.</p> \n<p>The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> said alcohol and drug abuse had combined with close confinement during weeks of lockdown to fuel alarming levels of domestic violence in many countries. Its regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, cited reports from many countries including <strong>Belgium</strong>, <strong>Bulgaria</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Ireland</strong>, <strong>Russia</strong>, <strong>Spain</strong> and the<strong> UK</strong> of increases in violence against women, men and children.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough data is scarce, member states are reporting up to a 60% increase in emergency calls by women subjected to violence by their intimate partners in April this year compared to last\u201d and online inquiries had increased fivefold, Kluge said on Thursday. \u201cThe legacy of this pandemic could haunt us for years,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The <strong>World Tourism Organization,</strong> another UN agency, said international tourist arrivals could slump by between 60 and 80% in 2020.

  "<p>The decision to move the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48565417\" title=\"\">early May bank holiday of 2020</a> to a Friday was taken when Theresa May was prime minister. The primary intention was that the change would enable Britain to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day, 8 May 1945, more extensively. The secondary motive was that the Conservative party has also wanted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/04/may-day-bank-holiday-under-threat\" title=\"\">to get rid</a> of the May Day holiday for ideological reasons ever since it was first introduced in the 1970s.</p> <p>As things have turned out, however, many of the plans for a national VE Day celebration have had to be <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/10/ve-day-2020-planned-coronavirus-changed-12538903/\" title=\"\">scrapped or scaled back</a> because of the Covid-19 outbreak. There will still be events to mark the anniversary, as there should be, including another national broadcast by the Queen. But Britain is still in lockdown, the virus is still lethal, and most of us have more pressing issues on our minds right now. Street parties and march-pasts would be inappropriate \u2013 though some will still occur.</p> <p>The defeat of Germany in 1945 was without a shadow of doubt a historic event for Britain and its allies. Although the war with Japan was still raging in May 1945, the defeat of Hitler meant that war in Europe would now be replaced by the scarcely less difficult challenges of peace and reconstruction. The evidence of eyewitnesses in 1945, in Britain as elsewhere, is that although rejoicing was wholly justified, the mood was relieved and temperate. Few thought victory was in itself the solution or the end of all problems and difficulties. They were right.</p> <p>The issues in May 1945 were mainly about the future. The national mood was expressed in the words <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/548/54848/never-again/9780141016023.html\" title=\"\">\u201cnever again\u201d</a>. Europe lay in ruins for the second time in 30 years. Millions had died on the battlefield and in bombed cities. Europe\u2019s Jews had come close to extinction. Russia, which fought the decisive campaign against Hitler, also suffered many more military and civilian deaths than the other victorious allies. America was the decisive and richest victor in the west. The British empire was on its way into history.</p> <p>VE Day should continue to be remembered in the national and international calendar. But it is also right to ask ourselves how long the many anniversaries of the second world war should continue to be marked in the manner that, had it not been for the pandemic, we would have seen again this week. This question should be asked without prejudgment or the wish to provoke or divide. It is a deeply patriotic question for an evolving nation to pose to itself. The era in which Britain defined itself by the war against Hitler has been long and remarkable. But, just like the British empire 75 years ago, that exceptionalist Britain is on its way into history too. Brexit shows it is not going gently. But go it will.</p> <p>Britain, in the best possible way, still needs to get over the war. Were it not for the pandemic, Boris Johnson would have commandeered this holiday to elide the Britain of 1945 with that of Brexit. He would have offered a vision of renewed global greatness, with himself as the new Churchill. He may yet try. But events have made such claims immoral as well as preposterous. This is not a time for rejoicing or false pride. There is no British victory to celebrate today. Instead, there is a Britain whose state institutions were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong\" title=\"\">unprepared</a> and insufficiently resilient to minimise the Covid-19 crisis. As in May 1945, the real questions facing Britain are not about the past. They are about the future.</p>",

By and large the people who can work from home worked in offices and did most of their work on a computer ... and not exclusively but largely, they are professionals, managers and other specialist white-collar occupations who were already earning above average income to start with.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems doubly unfair that the people who had the most secure starting point are the ones who are able to keep their jobs and their income during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThe people who can\u2019t work from home have faced a devil\u2019s choice \u2013 do their jobs despite the risk of infection [and spreading it to others] or they have to leave their jobs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83841723363acb92672e1fb3156dfeb9a4a2e5af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83841723363acb92672e1fb3156dfeb9a4a2e5af/0_0_1638_1092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Stanford speaking at a summit in 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jim Stanford speaking at a summit in 2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who can\u2019t work from home include, among others, more highly paid and educated health professionals and first responders \u2013 people admired and respected during, as before, the pandemic. But there are also also hundreds of thousands of low-wage, poorly educated and often casually employed people \u2013 cleaners and delivery drivers, supermarket workers and those on factory lines producing essential items like toilet paper and hand sanitiser \u2013 whose work has been afforded little social capital and whose very presence and contributions had often gone unnoticed.</p> <p>Stanford says: \u201cWhat\u2019s striking is the shift in attitudes about some of the so-called menial, low-wage often casualised jobs, who, it turns out, are also changing our lives and allowing us to get through this pandemic ... occupations that have been treated like crap for decades and we assumed that they were menial, low-skilled, easily replaceable positions and we allowed the economy and businesses to cheapen and degrade and outsource that work into almost oblivion.</p> <p>\u201cRecognising the importance of those so-called menial jobs and the risks associated with doing them and putting in place adequate protections and supports for them I think is a very urgent priority.\u201d</p> <h2>Non-risky business</h2> <p>For many whose businesses are now in hibernation, the post-pandemic future looks bleak. Rebooting without government support (many are ineligible for jobkeeper or jobseeker benefits) and with only remote prospects of attaining pre-pandemic turnover, will be too daunting. Some will cut losses and take their skills elsewhere. Some will retire. Others will become permanently unemployed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://hwp.com.au/\">Hilary Wardhaugh</a> has run a successful commercial photography business in Canberra for 25 years. She was very busy over summer. But business slowed towards the end of February as the viral threat captivated the world.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I lost all my work ... I\u2019ve done only three headshots since then,\u201d says Wardhaugh, 56, a single parent who, with her 16-year-old son, had moved in with her elderly mother before the pandemic so she might pay down the mortgage on her own house. Her tenants are now unable to meet the rent.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in Canberra for a long time and the business is well-established. I think when this [isolation] is over the work will come back in dribs and drabs. But I don\u2019t think the business will get back to where it was \u2013 I think companies who spent on corporate photography may start doing their own to save money because everyone will be looking for savings wherever they can.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e1145e21d5c971e188a0dc9f407cc8a6791f1e6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1145e21d5c971e188a0dc9f407cc8a6791f1e6f/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photographer Hilary Wardhaugh at her home in Canberra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographer Hilary Wardhaugh at her home in Canberra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tracy Lee Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI need new equipment. But now I\u2019m thinking seriously about whether to invest in the business with new gear, if I want to retire at 60 or 65. I\u2019m not sure I want to take that risk. I\u2019m actually thinking about trying to get a full-time permanent job \u2013 of working for someone else instead of reinvesting in my own business with new gear.\u201d</p> <p>Reflecting Wardhaugh\u2019s caution about her future, Steve Koukoulas, managing director of Market Economics and an economic adviser to the former prime minister Julia Gillard, says the pandemic aftermath could see \u201ca crushing of entrepreneurship and economic risk-taking\u201d because \u201copportunity for gains has been swamped by an illustration of how bad things can get personally when things so wrong\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMany small business owners and sole traders have had financial catastrophe thrust on them,\u201d Koukoulas says. \u201cIn hospitalities in particular, revenue has fallen to near zero which feeds into their own salary in the first instance, and then into unmanageable problems with servicing debt. The fallout in many instances means that in future many may shun debt or overdraft on their business \u2013 the exposure to a shock is not worth it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unless people need it to live, you\u2019re going to struggle to sell it</p> <footer> <cite>Dylan Nichols</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnother more life-altering lesson is not to use your house as collateral against your small business loan. Unless there is the proverbial economic \u2018snapback\u2019 and the economy returns to full employment very soon, small business owners are likely to be forced to sell their houses to cover their business losses.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s problematic and emotionally fraught looking for silver linings in times of such misery and economic distress. But the reality is that some businesses are more likely than others to prosper and attract the dollars of cautious investors wary of sinking money into the stock market, real estate (risky given residential and commercial rents can\u2019t be guaranteed) or high-risk e-startups.</p> <p>The bioenergy consultant Dylan Nichols has been busier than before the pandemic because the crisis has created increased demand on essential services like waste management.</p> <p>\u201cMy industry is relatively pandemic-proof, so it has been interesting to see the increased level of [investor] interest in these services,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile these industries aren\u2019t the most glamorous, it\u2019s been an interesting reminder of what we want as a society and what we need.</p> <p>\u201cUnemployment is up and people are watching their shadows \u2013 whole industries have disappeared. Essential services will do well at this time and for [at least] the short term. I\u2019d be hoping that many essential services use this time to innovate, creating new industries and jobs. Many businesses simply won\u2019t recover. Investors are looking at businesses that are pandemic proof, which brings a whole new level of due diligence. The days of raising US$120m for a juicer are over for some time. Unless people need it to live, you\u2019re going to struggle to sell it.\u201d</p> <h2>From stigma to saviour</h2> <p>I\u2019ve long been conversant with the challenges of working in the place where I live. The upsides (flexibility, no commuting, no workplace politics, spending days with dogs instead of people) are considerable. I\u2019m privileged and beyond fortunate, especially at a time when so many people are trying to carve out a workspace in overcrowded or unsafe domestic situations. I have a dedicated, private home office, an ergonomic set-up in an inner-city house in the country\u2019s biggest city.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/04/my-desk-isnt-usually-as-messy-as-this-guardian-readers-share-their-work-from-home-setups\">'My desk isn\u2019t usually as messy as this': Guardian readers share their work-from-home setups</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The occasional negatives invariably relate to the flipside of the flexibility \u2013 usually the situational requirement to fill domestic gaps. Ill children can play particular havoc with deadlines. But when you work from home, sometimes practicalities mean you often pick up the care and try to make up the working time on weekends. This can undermine routine, if that is important to you.</p> <p>I sympathise with couples \u2013 and especially singles \u2013 who are trying to work from home while overseeing kids\u2019 primary school education. One thing I have learnt is that it\u2019s very difficult to get much meaningful work done at home, regardless of your setup, if you are caring for ill or very small children.</p> <p>Difficult. But not impossible.</p> <p>Among the revelations of the great Covid-19 disruption of 2020, will be the surprising levels of productivity and the capacity for multitasking of some employees working at home while overseeing the education of children. Many employees have long sought the flexibility to work part- or full-time from home. While some employers have resisted this (even stigmatised it as being for \u201cslackers\u201d or people not serious about career progression), they have had to accede to it for their businesses to survive isolation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.jpetriglieri.com/\">Jennifer Petriglieri</a>, an organisational behaviour academic, says post-isolation society will need to \u201cdeliberately work to bake this new capacity into the employment market permanently\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3f6f22e7899ee18be100270219805c80f271d2c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f6f22e7899ee18be100270219805c80f271d2c3/0_0_4536_3242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Petriglieri\" width=\"1000\" height=\"715\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Petriglieri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxence Torillioux</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBefore the forced confinement, home working was generally seen as a choice for people who are not particularly serious about their careers, and employees who took advantage of flexible working policies were sidelined when it came to promotions and pay increases,\u201d Petriglieri says. \u201cThis stigmatisation went against the research, which shows that flexible working (typically a mix of home and office working) is more productive than being in the office every day.</p> <p>\u201cNow, the bosses \u2026 who sidelined flexible workers previously, are themselves experiencing how productive home working can be and seeing that the technology exists such that we don\u2019t need to be in the office all the time, nor need to travel for work so much. I also think there will be pressure from workers to keep some of the flexibility they have now once the self-isolation has ended. So, I\u2019m hopeful, and I also believe that deliberate steps will need to switch the trend away from \u2018facetime\u2019 in the office to more flexible working.\u201d</p> <p>Employers will already be noting upsides of having more staff working from home, not least the massive cost transferral to the employee. The savings on city office-space and communications systems, for example, on utilities and data, will be significant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It could just be that after the pandemic we are going to have to actually fight to go back to an actual defined, formal workplace</p> <footer> <cite>Jim Stanford</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As one major lobbyist for employers says: \u201cWe have realised in this crisis that we don\u2019t need an elaborate traditional telephone comms system, for example, where everyone has a phone on their desk \u2013 a computer and a mobile phone for internal and external comms is obviously enough. We\u2019ve also learnt that Zoom meetings can be incredibly efficient and the cost-saving is massive, especially when the price of air travel will go through the roof.\u201d</p> <p>Employer organisations and unions have been attentive to the loud government message that it is time \u2013 despite the obvious health risks to those most vulnerable \u2013 to start cranking up the economy. Leading government figures are united in the message that this will require some people to return to their actual workplaces. But the office is unlikely to ever look like it did before the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>Starting times will be staggered to avoid crowding into lifts and foyers. Work-at-home rosters are likely to be implemented by some companies so employees only attend the office on alternate days. The communal lunchroom will be best avoided, large in-person meetings will go the same way as hotdesking in favour of in-house video conferencing.</p> <p>The office partition or cubicle \u2013 Perspex, perhaps, in place of felt covered chipboard \u2013 could become a fixture as employers attempt to pandemic-proof their offices.</p> <p>Other companies will opt for savings on office space, insisting most staff who want to can and should work from home.</p> <p>Employers looking for savings through cost transferral (to the employee but, perhaps, through tax deductions that are ultimately shifted to the state) have much else to consider too.

  "<p>Joe Root says England are ready to go into isolation to save this summer\u2019s Test series against the West Indies and Pakistan.

The public are desperate for some live sport and the guys are missing it.\u201d</p> <p>Root is concerned about safety for all those involved and is aware of the abnormal conditions that may apply.</p> <p>\u201cThe players would be sectioned off in one part of the hotel and would be in isolation together. There would be no interaction with the media, the TV crews or even the opposition when off the pitch. We would have separate lunchrooms.

Root, like one or two others in a likely squad who could extend to 25-30 players, is expecting a second child and would like to be at the birth but he acknowledges it would not be straightforward \u201cto move in and out of the bubble\u201d.</p> <p>There is no guarantee that West Indies will accept the proposals, given how the UK is the country most afflicted by Covid-19 in Europe. \u201cWe have just tried to present the likely environment to see if it\u2019s a possibility for them\u201a\u201d Root said.</p> <p>Root believes that the cricket should not be subjected to any unusual restrictions because of the pandemic: a wicketkeeper standing up and a crowded slip cordon, say, would have to be permitted. \u201cIf the game itself is to be compromised, then we shouldn\u2019t be going ahead,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The overriding impression is that the England players are keen on playing and this was also reflected by Mark Wood.

  "<p>International tourism faces its worst crisis since records began, with up to 1.1bn fewer people taking trips globally in 2020. The scale of the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s impact is outlined in a report by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), which predicts a decline in international arrivals of between 58% and 80% this year.</p> <p>This is due to widespread travel restrictions and the closure of airports and borders worldwide. The prediction of a 58% decline is based on the gradual reopening of international borders and easing of travel restrictions in early July; the 80% figure is based on early December.</p> <p>Globally, the crisis threatens the livelihood of up to 120 million people who directly rely on tourism for work - and millions more indirectly \u2013 while representing a financial loss in export revenues from tourism of between \u00a3736bn and \u00a3971bn. The predictions are based on UNWTO figures for the first three months of this year, which show a worldwide decline in international arrivals of 22%. Following the start of the lockdown in many countries, arrivals dropped by 57% for March alone. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The whole cycle of tourism is being wiped out by the pandemic</p> <footer> <cite>Gloria Guevara, CEO, World Travel and Tourism Council</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis,\u201d Zurab Pololikashvili, UNWTO secretary general said. \u201cTourism has been hit hard, with millions of jobs at risk in one of the most labour-intensive sectors of the economy.\u201d</p> <p>The figures are in line with the World Travel and Tourism Council\u2019s (WTTC) predictions of more than 100m job losses in the travel and tourism sector, with three quarters of these in G20 countries.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a staggering and deeply worrying change in such a short time,\u201d said Gloria Guevara, CEO of WTTC. \u201cIn just April alone, our research shows an increase of 25m in the number of job losses in travel and tourism. The whole cycle of tourism is being wiped out by the pandemic. Travel and tourism is the backbone of the global economy. Without it, global economies will struggle to recover in any meaningful way and hundreds of millions of people will suffer enormous financial and mental damage for years to come.\u201d</p> <p>The impact will vary in different regions at different times, with Asia and the Pacific expected to rebound first. According to the UNWTO Panel of Experts survey, some recovery is expected in the final quarter of 2020 and into early 2021, while domestic tourism is expected to recover faster than the demand for international travel.</p> <p>In the UK, Visit Britain has forecast a decline in inbound tourist numbers of 54% for 2020, which equates to 21.9m fewer arrivals and a loss of \u00a315.1bn in tourist revenue. This scenario assumes a recovery of international arrivals from August, and is subject to revision as the situation develops. In terms of domestic tourism in the UK, if the sector starts to open up in June, the annual loss will be an estimated \u00a322.1bn (\u00a314.1bn from day trips and \u00a37.9bn from overnights).</p> <p>Global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-outbreak-could-cost-worlds-airlines-up-to-314bn\">airline revenues are forecast to drop by more than half</a> \u2013 $314bn (\u00a3249bn) \u2013 in 2020, according to the latest estimates by the International Air Transport Association\u2019s (Iata). This is almost three times worse than its \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d in March.</p> <p>Last month, the WTTC outlined what the \u201cnew normal\u201d could look like as lockdown rules and travel restrictions are eased, pre-vaccine. New protocols and standards are being mapped out in collaboration with various associations \u2013 among them the UNWTO, the World Health Organization, European Travel Commission, and Iata \u2013 including global hygiene standards and intensive cleaning regimes in hotels, aircraft and cruise ships.</p>",

There is no indication that Putin has been infected with the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThis was supposed to be a grandiose political show,\u201d said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political analyst and former Kremlin adviser. \u201cThey had portrayed this as the central political event of this year, a culmination of his two decades in power. And none of it has gone as planned.\u201d</p> <p>Russia has the highest growth rate of infections in Europe and as of Thursday has the fifth highest number of cases in the world, surpassing Germany and France. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/russias-prime-minister-self-isolates-after-covid-19-diagnosis\">Mikhail Mishustin</a>, the Russian prime minister, and two other cabinet members have fallen ill.</p> <p>Putin\u2019s approval ratings have dropped to their nominal lowest in 20 years, the independent Levada Centre said, and the IMF has forecast that the country\u2019s economy will contract by 5.5% this year.

As his health minister discussed regional payouts on Wednesday, the president distractedly rolled a pen back and forth across his desk, lost in a moment of reverie broadcast nationwide.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/painful-to-see-rise-in-russian-medics-falling-prey-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-questioned\">'Painful to see': rise in Russian medics falling prey to Covid-19 as death toll questioned</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPutin not only doesn\u2019t control the situation but he cannot even plan how to change the agenda,\u201d said Nikolay Petrov, a senior research fellow at the British thinktank Chatham House. \u201cHe cannot adjust \u2026 I think partly Putin\u2019s lack of activism is connected to the fact that he is out of his normal position.\u201d</p> <p>He has sought to regain the initiative by holding televised briefings and promising economic stimulus to Russians hit by the economic downturn, while soliciting timetables for business to reopen. But the measures have been underwhelming and the virus\u2019s long horizon has meant Putin takes a back seat while local officials \u2013 such as Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin \u2013 lead the fight against the virus.</p> <p>\u201cPutin wants to become a ladder out of the crisis: Sobyanin makes rules and Putin will cancel them; that\u2019s a positive role,\u201d noted Pavlovsky. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way out of this crisis, this pandemic, yet. Things are still getting worse and more dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>The Kremlin\u2019s desire to carry out its political programme has appeared at odds with its response to the epidemic. Putin held off on cancelling the symbolic vote until late March and the Victory Day parade until mid-April, with thousands of soldiers being sent into quarantine as a preventive measure.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears the Kremlin was too focused on the constitutional and political reforms and not the epidemic,\u201d said Petrov. \u201cThe epidemic came later to Russia and it was possible to be better prepared.\u201d</p> <p>One thing is clear: this is not the time to hold a public vote that could backfire over the Kremlin\u2019s response to the epidemic. Analysts have suggested that it could be cancelled entirely, or delayed until the autumn when political conditions are more favourable.</p> <p>State television serves as a window on what could have been. On Sunday the <a href=\"https://www.1tv.ru/news/2020-05-03/385157-7_maya_ispolnitsya_20_let_so_dnya_pervoy_inauguratsii_vladimira_putina_na_post_prezidenta\">lead segment</a> on Channel One\u2019s flagship news programme, Vremya, was not an update on the country\u2019s battle with the virus but a 13-minute report marking 20 years since Putin\u2019s first inauguration on 7 May 2000. It felt like a time capsule from before the epidemic.</p> <p>\u201cThe very existence of the country was under threat,\u201d read Yekaterina Andreyeva, the well-known anchor. \u201cOver two decades, Russia has once again become a strong country that is once again reckoned with in the world and which is able to solve the hardest problems and overcome any obstacles.\u201d</p> <p>The political risk to the Kremlin is limited. Putin\u2019s approval ratings remain high, at 59%, and he has no true political rivals to present an alternative. The regional officials taking the lead in the fight against coronavirus owe their positions to him.</p> <p>But the Kremlin does closely follow its polling numbers, which have shown two years of sliding approval for Putin, mainly due to the economy. And the loss of this spring\u2019s political calendar has robbed the Kremlin of a chance to recharge his image as he begins a third decade in power.</p> <p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t so scared of coronavirus as its economic consequences, salaries, redundancies,\u201d said Denis Volkov, the deputy director of the Levada Centre. \u201cAnd secondly, it is exhaustion with Putin himself \u2026 there are no expectations of anything new from him.\u201d</p> <p>The next stage of the crisis will take place as the scale of the epidemic becomes clear in Russia\u2019s regions, indicating whether Russia may be looking at an extended health crisis and how much longer the economy will remain shuttered. Already, a number of coronavirus hotspots have appeared at far-flung oil and gas fields and at regional hospitals.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole management system looks inefficient,\u201d said Petrov. \u201cThe regions are far less prepared in general to face the crisis than Moscow \u2026 I am afraid that they will suffer more.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>When the going gets tough, most parents try to protect their offspring. But the warty comb jelly takes a different tack: it eats them.</p> <p>Despite initial appearances, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/17/helpless-blob-jelly-formidable-predator-country-diary-yorkshire\">comb jellies</a> are not jellyfish but belong to a different group of animals, ctenophora, which swim using tiny hair-like projections called cilia.</p> <p>While the warty comb jelly is native to the east coast of America, it has caused chaos in European waters where it eats fish larvae and the prey of fish. Indeed, the species caused a collapse of fisheries in the Black Sea in the late 1980s.</p> <p>\u201cThe Black Sea just became this gelatinous ocean,\u201d said Dr Thomas Larsen, an ecologist at Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.</p> <p>Now Larsen and colleagues say the discovery of cannibalistic tendencies among <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em> may help to explain why the creatures appear to thrive in European waters even when prey is scarce, and could shed light on how to tackle the invasive species.</p> <p>\u201cBy knowing the lifecycle and strategies of this species, we can more easily devise more efficient conservation strategies,\u201d Larsen said.</p> <p>The research team add that with comb jellies cropping up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/30/evolution-row-ends-as-scientists-declare-sponges-to-be-sister-of-all-animals\">early on the evolutionary tree of animals</a>, the discovery could also have wider implications, raising the question of whether the behaviour has cropped up independently multiple times among multicellular animals, or is a basic trait.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-0940-2\">Communications Biology</a>, the researchers report how they looked at the abundance of the warty comb jelly in the Kiel fjord in Germany on a daily basis from August to October 2008, hoping to unpick a puzzle. Why do they produce huge numbers of offspring in the late summer when larvae are unable to survive the winter?</p> <p>The team found the population of warty comb jellies reached a peak in early September. \u201cThey are very prolific. An adult lays up to 12,000 eggs in two weeks,\u201d said Larsen. But while their overall abundance fell after this point, the ratio of adults to larvae increased \u2013 despite the adults\u2019 prey plummeting from early September and the prey of the larvae becoming more abundant.</p> <p>The researchers say the results suggest an unexpected explanation: adult warty comb jellies eat their young. \u201cIf larvae were not taken by adults, they could also contribute to the pool, by producing new larvae,\u201d said Dr Jamileh Javidpour, the lead author of the study, from the University of Southern Denmark, adding that during the work the team discovered comb jelly larvae inside the stomach of an adult.</p> <p>Further experiments, in which adults and larvae were placed in a tank together, confirmed the grisly phenomenon, while additional analysis revealed that the nutrients obtained through cannibalism \u2013 although less than from eating typical prey \u2013 could sustain the adult comb jellies for an extra two or three weeks in the sea. That means the late summer bloom not only helps the comb jellies out-compete other creatures but also allows them to build up nutrient reserves to survive the winter ahead.</p> <p>Dr Sophie Pitois, a senior marine scientist at the UK\u2019s Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cThe authors present a new insight into how a non-native and invasive species can survive and become established in environment far away and with very different environmental conditions from its original conditions. </p> <p>\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, these findings are new and provide an opportunity to rethink and design appropriate conservation strategies in controlling the spread of non-native invasive species by taking into account the entire range of an animal behaviours that allow it to adapt and thrive in new environments.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/gas-leak-at-chemical-factory-in-india-kills-hospitalises-lg-polymers\">The gas leak at a chemical factory</a> in Visakhapatnam will immediately remind many in India and beyond of the 1984 Bhopal disaster, widely considered the world\u2019s worst industrial disaster.</p> <p>So far, the scale of the tragedies are very different. Eleven people are confirmed to have died in Visakhapatnam \u2013 but with hundreds hospitalised and thousands affected, there are fears the toll will rise. In Bhopal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/04/bhopal-25-years-indra-sinha\"> 4,000 people died within days</a> of the toxic gas leak from a pesticide plant in the central Indian city, and thousands more in the following years.</p> <p>But there are also startling parallels. The leak in Visakhapatnam, an industrial port city in Andhra Pradesh state on India\u2019s east coast, was from two 5,000-tonne tanks of liquid chemicals. According to a local police officer, it occurred as the plant was being restarted as coronavirus restrictions imposed in late March were eased.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/india-gasleakmap/giv-3902j4zy6FuTpYT4\" data-alt=\"India gas leak map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/india-gasleakmap/giv-3902j4zy6FuTpYT4\">India gas leak map</a> </figure>  <p>In Bhopal, a much bigger leak occurred, also from a tank full of chemical liquid \u2013 extremely hazardous methyl isocyanate \u2013 as parts of the complex were reactivated after a shutdown.</p> <p>In both cases, the leak occurred at night, releasing gas into the crowded homes of workers and their families living around the factories. And both plants had overseas owners: South Korea\u2019s biggest petrochemical maker, LG Chem, in the case of Visakhapatnam, and US-based Union Carbide the majority owner in the case of Bhopal.</p> <p>Both incidents are only the most high-profile of thousands, big and small, that happen every year in India.</p> <p>Quite how many industrial accidents occur in India annually is unknown, as many go unreported. Government statistics \u2013 which show <a href=\"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/3-workers-die-47-are-injured-every-day-in-factory-accidents/article26378544.ece\">54,000 killed or injured in factory accidents between 2014 and 2016 </a>\u2013 are thought to only represent a fraction of all casualties. Campaigners claim the true figure is <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/48000-die-due-to-occupational-accidents-yearly-study/articleshow/61725283.cms\">up to 15 times greater</a>.</p> <p>One problem is that few workers or their relatives are aware of their rights or have the resources to seek legal redress. Many are migrant workers from distant rural communities, a higher proportion are women, a significant number come from the most disadvantaged communities, and so are vulnerable to physical or other threats. Employers often pay compensation privately to ensure a bereaved family\u2019s silence.</p> <p>Though a profusion of laws exist to protect workers in India, few are enforced. Inspections are rare, and some officials are easily compromised. Last year a fire caused by a short circuit killed 43 people and injured 60 in a workshop in Delhi. The building <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/anaj-mandi-factory-fire-4-owners-are-prime-accused/articleshow/74701095.cms\">had been repeatedly inspected by local officials</a> but no alarms were raised despite its evidently poor condition. Police said they would investigate alleged corruption.</p> <p>Similarly, owners often escape sanction. The criminal justice system in India is slow, and scarce police resources are unlikely to be focused on the investigation of industrial accidents. Local political rivalries, or tensions between state-level and national-level governments can also complicate the search for justice. Pursuing multinationals or foreign owners is expensive, complicated, time-consuming and fraught with uncertainty.</p> <p>In the case of Bhopal, the then chairman of the company, a US citizen, refused to return to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/india\">India</a> to face charges, and Union Carbide paid only $470m (\u00a3282m) in 1989 to the Indian government in an out-of-court settlement. In 2010 a court <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/10267196\">sentenced eight Indians to two years in jail</a>. </p> <p>Finally, there is the profound problem of political will. Campaigners point to the example of traffic accidents. There are between 150,000 and 300,000 road deaths a year in India. Most of the casualties are poor people, with pedestrians and cyclists prominent among victims. Political decision-makers are significantly more likely to be among those being driven in large, safe cars on the chaotic roads than among those suffering most from the potholes, poor discipline and driving skills, or badly maintained vehicles.</p> <p>The same is true of air pollution, which<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/19/india-suffers-most-pollution-linked-deaths-in-world-study-finds\"> causes more than 2 million deaths each year, according to some estimates. </a>Once again, those who suffer most cannot afford air filters, sealed windows, homes with gardens or travel during acute periods.</p> <p>PV Ramesh, a senior official in the Andhra Pradesh government, said 10m rupees ($131,900) in compensation would be given to the families of those who died on Thursday at Visakhapatnam, and the causes of the accident investigated.</p> <p>\u201cObviously something has gone wrong,\u201d Ramesh said. \u201cNobody will be spared.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 May 2020 to make clear that Union Carbide was majority owner of the Bhopal pesticide plant. </p>",
  "<p>British Airways plans to resume a large number of flights in July, but Willie Walsh has said the Covid-19 crisis had made a third runway at Heathrow impossible.</p> <p>Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), said its airlines, which also include Ireland\u2019s Aer Lingus and Spain\u2019s Iberia and Vueling, intended to operate about 1,000 flights a day between July and September.</p> <p>That represents half of the schedule the airline had expected to fly before the crisis forced it to ground almost all of its flights.

He also said there would be no recovery in air traffic if the government introduced a 14-day quarantine on new arrivals, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/04/coronavirus-quarantine-precautions-around-the-world\">required in some countries</a>.</p> <p>Walsh also said he backed Gatwick to survive the crisis, despite many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/british-airways-to-cut-gatwick-operation-and-lay-off-1130-pilots\">British Airways job cuts falling </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/british-airways-to-cut-gatwick-operation-and-lay-off-1130-pilots\">at the airport</a>.

  "<p>A cabinet minister has confirmed that 400,000 gowns from Turkey to protect medics from coronavirus have been impounded because they were poor quality, but he insisted \u201cstrong supplies\u201d were now coming through to the frontline.</p> \n<p>The personal protective equipment (PPE) from Turkey was heralded by ministers several weeks ago as \u201ca very significant\u201d shipment that would ease a shortage of gowns in the NHS, but the delivery turned into a shambles after it was repeatedly delayed.</p> \n<p>In a final blow to the government, Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, acknowledged on Thursday that the gowns had in fact been useless for medical purposes.</p> \n<p>Downing Street said the NHS was now in negotiations to get new gowns sent, or it would ask for a refund from the supplier. It would not give any details on the cost of sending an RAF plane to fetch the items.</p> \n<p>Lewis said: \u201cThere was a view that it was good enough PPE. It is only when it has got here that teams have looked at it again and taken a view that it is not up to the right standard and they\u2019ve decided not to use it.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it is right that if we have got particular standards for what we want our frontline staff to be able to have access to, we make sure we stick to that.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf something isn\u2019t right, if we\u2019re not even sure about it then I think it is better to be safe and not use that product and stick with products we are confident are the right products and the right standards.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking on Sky News, he attempted to downplay the significance of the Turkish shipment, saying it was just one delivery.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got some really strong supplies now coming through but we\u2019re always looking to ensure they are good enough,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>However, he was unable to say whether the Department of Health and Social Care would be able to get its money back, and why samples of the equipment were not checked before the transaction happened.</p> \n<p>The items are being held in a facility near Heathrow airport and sources said the DHSC intended to seek a refund, as it has done in similar situations in the past.</p> \n<p>The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cAll deliveries of PPE are checked to ensure the equipment meets the safety and quality standards our frontline staff need. If equipment does not meet our specifications or pass the assurances processes, it is not issued to the frontline.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked why the gowns were not checked before the RAF was sent to collect it, he said: \u201cAll items are checked when they get to the UK and before they are sent on to the NHS and I think that\u2019s the right approach to ensure that on the ground in the UK, proper checks are carried out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Turkish sources told the Guardian they were urgently trying to clarify the situation \u2013 but added that nobody had approached the country\u2019s embassy in London or appeared to have tried to claim replacements or a refund from the supplier, Selegna.</p> \n<p>They pointed out that the company had issued a statement to the BBC\u2019s Turkish service saying that nobody from the NHS had mentioned a problem when they were in contact earlier in the week and it stood ready to deal with any problems as needed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe fabric of the aprons is certified.

  "<h2>30. Expo 2000 (1999)</h2> <p>Kraftwerk\u2019s first new and original music since 1986, this single started as a commissioned jingle for the Hanover Expo 2000 world\u2019s fair, but returned Ralf H\u00fctter and Florian Schneider to the UK Top 30. The trademark mix of subtle techno grooves and melody find them \u2013 of course \u2013 peering into the 21st century.</p> <h2>29. Elektro Kardiogramm (2003)</h2> <p>After paving the way for so many others, and with percussionists Karl Bartos and Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr having departed after the Electric Caf\u00e9 album, the band\u2019s later material started to sound recognisably contemporary. This track from 2003\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/aug/01/popandrock.shopping4\">Tour de France Soundtracks</a>, their first album in 17 years, subtly assimilates modern clubland and minimalist house.</p> <h2>28. Franz Schubert (1977)</h2> <p>Kraftwerk would pose with gramophones as well as synthesisers; a deep vein of classical music tradition underpinned their futurism. This gorgeously dreamy track from the Trans-Europe Express album uses electronic melody and a synthesised vocal to sweetly and delicately pay homage to the 19th-century Austrian composer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"50a32e23d3abb53e266ef0d60f60cf44ff347405\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50a32e23d3abb53e266ef0d60f60cf44ff347405/0_208_3474_2084/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kraftwerk playing in Brussels in 1981\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kraftwerk playing in Brussels in 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gie Knaeps/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>27. Vitamin (2003)</h2> <p>A keen cyclist who thought nothing of riding between concerts (and had a bad bike crash, too), H\u00fctter delved deep into his hobby\u2019s minutiae for Tour De France Soundtracks. There is a hint of Kraftwerk fans Orbital in this groovily melodic electronic ode to pre-ride proteins and nutrition.</p> <h2>26. Metropolis (1978)</h2> <p>The Man-Machine (Die Mensch-Machine) album doesn\u2019t sound as futuristic now as 1981\u2019s Computer World, but on release it trailblazed what the music press briefly dubbed \u201cmachine rock\u201d. This track is typical of the kind of synthetic pop that enthralled Gary Numan, David Bowie, Ultravox, Depeche Mode and countless others.</p> <h2>25. Antenna (1975)</h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the antenna, catching vibration, you\u2019re the transmitter, give information,\u201d begins this sweet hymn to radio from Radio-Activity. By now, the entirely electronic band had built their famous Kling-Klang studio and were using Micromoog synths, the <a href=\"https://www.synthtopia.com/content/2017/04/10/the-vako-orchestron-kraftwerks-secret-weapon/\">Orchestron</a> (a primitive sampler) and their own custom-built electronic percussion, played with what looked like knitting needles.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp8Sv7WCcI0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pp8Sv7WCcI0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>24. The Man-Machine (1978)</h2> <p>A highlight of Kraftwerk\u2019s concerts, the eponymous album\u2019s title track uses banks of synthesised voices and ticking rhythms as Kraftwerk sing about their synergetic bond with their instruments. The previous year, they told the incredulous rock critic Lester Bangs that \u201cwhen it gets to a certain stage, the machines start playing us\u201d.</p> <h2>23. The Hall of Mirrors (1977)</h2> <p>From Trans-Europe Express, this is Kraftwerk at their most mesmerically disturbing. To sounds like echoed footsteps, this is the narrated story of a young man who ventures into a hall of mirrors and loses himself in his own reflection. Lines such as \u201ceven the greatest stars live their lives in the looking glass\u201d eerily contemplate celebrity, narcissism and insecurity.</p> <h2>22. Spacelab (1978)</h2> <p>Pop music inspired by space travel doesn\u2019t always date well. For every timeless curio such as Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity, there are a dozen astronaut-suited forgotten synth groups. From The Man-Machine, Spacelab\u2019s thin and whirry synths now sound slightly too reminiscent of 70s sci-fi programmes \u2013 but the tune is as earworming as they come.</p> <h2>21. It\u2019s More Fun to Compute (1981)</h2> <p>Computer World\u2019s second anthem to home computing, although the music is rather different to Home Computer. The banks of stark, metallic sound give things a more ominous feel, more funny-peculiar than fun, fun, fun.</p> <h2>20. Numbers (1981)</h2> <p>This Computer World cracker features the numbers one to four recited in a range of global languages, hinting at the interconnected world of finance and business that digital technology would supercharge. The clanging backdrop is stark and sinister, suggesting all might not be well with the free market.</p> <h2>19. Musique Non Stop (1986)</h2> <p>By the time of the underrated Electric Caf\u00e9 album, Dusseldorf\u2019s finest had gone digital, creating what they called techno pop. New Order \u2013 who were huge Kraftwerk fans \u2013 sampled 1975\u2019s Uranium on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/feb/11/how-we-made-blue-Monday\">Blue Monday</a>, and were so taken by this much later Kraftwerk track that they played it as they left the stage (music non-stop, geddit?).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"db3bc203c683d570887ab4a0f13e37cf376eaffb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db3bc203c683d570887ab4a0f13e37cf376eaffb/0_73_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kraftwerk in concert in New York in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kraftwerk in concert in New York in 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Debra L Rothenberg/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>18. Tanzmusik (1973)</h2> <p>From the Ralf und Florian (ie H\u00fctter and Schneider) album, this was a favourite of Sheffield\u2019s own electronic pioneers, Cabaret Voltaire, who started out soon after this was released. The lovely gurgling synths and gently motorik rhythms point to what we now know as electronica.</p> <h2>17. The Model (1978)</h2> <p>Implausibly but brilliantly covered by both <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7__b9d8Sow\">Big Black</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDvUzqn5FaI\">Rammstein</a>, The Man-Machine\u2019s best-known track gave Kraftwerk a surprise UK No 1 in 1982 after it was re-released at the height of the Kraftwerk-inspired Human League/OMD synth-pop boom. The track explores postmodern disconnection, as the melancholy singer eulogises someone he has barely met.</p> <h2>16. Kometenmelodie 2 (1974)</h2> <p>This beautiful, gently pulsating gem from the Autobahn album shows where Kraftwerk were headed as they started to dispense with acoustic instruments and longer hair to become a sharply-coiffured, neo-uniformed, fully electronic pop group. The influence on \u201cthe Wirral Kraftwerk\u201d, OMD, is audible.</p> <h2>15. Showroom Dummies (1977)</h2> <p>The third track on Trans-Europe Express is simultaneously one of the German group\u2019s most sinister tracks and best attempts at storytelling. Window-display mannequins come to life, starting to \u201cmove and break the glass\u201d, before heading for the nearest club to start dancing, presumably robotically.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgf7Uz7Xxek\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pgf7Uz7Xxek?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>14. Computer World (1981)</h2> <p>Kraftwerk\u2019s best album\u2019s title track peers into the future for a sinister and inviting glimpse of today\u2019s information age. \u201cInterpol and Deutsche Bank, FBI and Scotland Yard\u201d are dispassionately referenced alongside \u201ctime, travel, communication\u201d. The beat is the Kling-Klangers\u2019 funkiest.</p> <h2>13. The Telephone Call (1987)</h2> <p>Although The Model is probably Kraftwerk\u2019s best-known pop hit, this sublime Karl Bartos-sung single, edited from 1986\u2019s Electric Caf\u00e9, is arguably their poppiest song. It\u2019s a brilliant combination of unrequited love (\u201cYou\u2019re so close but far away\u201d), bleeping dial tones, kitsch and the everyday irritation of not being able to get through on the phone.</p> <h2>12. Home Computer (1981)</h2> <p>\u201cI program my home computer, beam myself into the future,\u201d Kraftwerk sang when the idea of family laptops was still the stuff of science fiction. The proto-techno grooves of such tracks were a huge influence on Detroit techno. Juan Atkins both sampled this and 1977\u2019s Hall Of Mirrors for Cybotron\u2019s 1983 electro classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGqiBFqWCTU\">Clear</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"70e05988822ecf94d06b3c6f4a859317971ada26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70e05988822ecf94d06b3c6f4a859317971ada26/0_0_3004_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kraftwerk in 1977\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kraftwerk have a train to catch \u2026 the band in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kraftwerk/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>11. Europe Endless (1977)</h2> <p>Trans-Europe Express\u2019s minimalist 10-minute opener employs just two alternating electronic melodies and a simple, fizzing rhythm but gloriously evokes and eulogises Europe\u2019s vast expanses as old wartime rivalries and divisions healed. H\u00fctter and Schneider\u2019s human and vocoder voices celebrate a European union of landscape, mankind and machine.</p> <h2>10. Ruckzuck (1970)</h2> <p>It is not that widely known that when they formed in Dusseldorf in 1970, Kraftwerk (meaning \u201cpower plant\u201d) used traditional instruments. The first track on their debut (<em>ruckzuck</em> means \u201cright now\u201d) uses guitars, organ, violin and drums. H\u00fctter plays the main riff on a flute, but the driving repetitive rhythms are almost proto-techno.</p> <h2>9. Sex Object (1986)</h2> <p>Kraftwerk\u2019s inscrutability somehow makes it harder to imagine them as hot-blooded young men, but they certainly weren\u2019t averse to sauce. With cheekily darting string sounds, this hilarious track from Electric Caf\u00e9 brings bone-dry humour to the traumas of being an object of pleasure (\u201cYou turn me on, then you forget\u201d). A retort, perhaps, from The Model of their biggest hit.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=invtIKKl2Hw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/invtIKKl2Hw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>8. Tour de France (1983)</h2> <p>A hit in 1983 and again in remixed versions in 1984 and 1999, then rerecorded for the 2003 album Tour de France Soundtracks. This is the best known of Kraftwerk\u2019s many odes to the joys of cycling: beautifully symphonic synthesiser melodies find sweet harmony with the sounds of deep breathing and whirring bicycle chains.</p> <h2>7. Pocket Calculator (1981)</h2> <p>Electronic calculators were still relatively new technology when Kraftwerk paid enraptured homage to them on Computer World. Today, as with so many of the group\u2019s best, this charming pop single sounds simultaneously quaint (\u201cBy pressing down a special key, it plays a little melody\u201d) yet still somehow futuristic.</p> <h2>6. The Robots (1978)</h2> <p>Kraftwerk\u2019s fantasy of watching their own music performed by automatons became reality. One of the highlights of their concerts is still the moment when this song is \u201cperformed\u201d by increasingly sophisticated robot replicants (\u201cdancing mechanik\u201d), which, amusingly, have been ageing during the passing years like their human counterparts.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkOZNJYAZ7c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vkOZNJYAZ7c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>5. Autobahn (1974)</h2> <p>It is impossible to overstate how radical and plain odd Kraftwerk seemed in the 1970s, when they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ2goij2J94\">appeared on the BBC science programme Tomorrow\u2019s World</a> and landed at No 11 in a chart full of fading glam rock bands and moustached MOR singer-songwriters. They described their signature hit\u2019s motor engines and Beach Boy harmonies (\u201cWir fahren, fahren, fahren auf der Autobahn\u201d) as \u201cthe sound of cars singing\u201d.</p> <h2>4. Computer Love (1981)</h2> <p>Kraftwerk\u2019s problem in the 1980s was how to possibly top Computer World, an album of perfect music that heralded the future with near-pinpoint accuracy. This synth-pop single finds a lonely H\u00fctter seeking a \u201cdata date\u201d, effectively predicting online dating. Coldplay repurposed the sublime melody for their 2005 smash <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH9meoWmAOM\">Talk</a>.</p> <h2>3. Neon Lights (1978)</h2> <p>Recognition of Kraftwerk\u2019s electronic invention and innovation can sometimes overshadow their almost equally formidable prowess as songwriters and melodists. This sublime H\u00fctter-crooned homage to the city after dark has been covered by U2 and Simple Minds, but would have been worthy of Frank Sinatra.</p> <h2>2. Radioactivity (1991 version)</h2> <p>Kraftwerk\u2019s best music both embraced and feared the future. On 1975\u2019s Radio-Activity album, the song features Geiger counters, radio signals and \u201cradioactivity, discovered by Madame Curie\u201d. By the time of the supremely techno-retooled version on The Mix, the song has become anti-nuclear, with references to the Chernobyl and Harrisburg disasters and a hook of \u201cStop radioactivity\u201d as the line \u201cRadioactivity is in the air for you and me\u201d now oozes with foreboding.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_85fUIRlmU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i_85fUIRlmU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>1. Trans-Europe Express (1977)</h2> <p>The quintessential example of why Kraftwerk are the most influential pop group since the Beatles. Keen to establish a post-war German musical identity, they assimilated classical music, Weimar folk, the Beach Boys and the Velvet Underground but gradually became a unique, electronic pop group. Afrika Bambaataa &amp; Soul Sonic Force repurposed Trans-Europe Express\u2019s hypnotic melody for the pioneering hip-hop single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J3lwZjHenA\">Planet Rock</a>; the danceable machine rhythms laid the foundations for electro, techno, house, dubstep and beyond, and influenced artists from Joy Division to Daft Punk. The song eulogises intercontinental train travel, encounters \u201cIggy Pop and David Bowie\u201d, and heralds a dazzling future where pop is made electronically \u2013 one that Kraftwerk, and the late Schneider, very much created for themselves.</p>",
  "<p>One of Europe\u2019s leading engineering universities is being investigated over claims of gender discrimination after it increased its cohort of female academics by 25% by opening vacancies exclusively to women.</p> <p>Eindhoven University of Technology has been asked by the Dutch Institute for Human Rights to justify a policy under which only women may apply for posts in the faculty in the first six months that they are advertised.</p> <p>The university\u2019s rector, Frank Baaijens, said a second meeting with the human rights organisation would take place next Friday following an anonymous complaint, with a ruling expected in June or July.</p> <p>Baaijens added that about a third of staff in the faculty were opposed to the initiative but he believed there was a vital need to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/aug/10/female-scientists-urge-research-grants-reform-tackle-gender-bias\">improve the representation</a> among his staff.</p> <p>The Netherlands has one of the lowest proportions of female professors in the EU, and Eindhoven University of Technology has long had the lowest proportion of any university in the country.</p> <p>Since the hiring policy was implemented last July, the university has hired 35 female scientists \u2013 29 assistant professors, two associate professors and four full professors. Each new female employee is allocated \u20ac100,000 (\u00a390,000) to be spent on their mentoring and their research.</p> <p>\u201cWe will have to see if we have to adjust the programme,\u201d Baaijens said. \u201cBut I think all in all people are positive and we are making the change that we are looking for.\u201d</p> <p>Baaijens said other recruitment policies, including an appointments committee having to nominate at least one suitable male and female candidate, had failed.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe feel that we can become a better university if we have a better representation of scientists in the university. We have had all sorts of measures over 10 to 15 years but they don\u2019t seem to have been particularly successful because the growth rate was very small. We had a growth rate of about 1% a year in our faculty, so it would take a long time to get something appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Baaijens said he was aware of only two cases where posts had gone to men due to a lack of suitable female candidates.</p> <p>The university plans to retain the policy for five years, with the aim that by the end of the programme at least 30% of tenured academic staff are female.</p> <p>The university says the <a href=\"https://www.tue.nl/en/working-at-tue/scientific-staff/irene-curie-fellowship/\">Ir\u00e8ne Curie Fellowship</a> is permitted under law due to the shortfall of female academics and the failure of all other routes tried.</p> <p>Baaijens said: \u201cThere is a significant indication that there is an implicit gender bias in science, so that may have inhibited the number of females we have been able to recruit. And if you are facing a male-dominated environment it might not be that attractive for females to apply for a position, so you have to do something to get change.\u201d</p>",

The effects of the relaxation of rules are expected to be visible in infection rates around two to three weeks after their implementation.</p> \n<p>Schaade said testing and tracing remained essential to tackling the virus. Although Germany has maintained a capacity to carry out 964,000 tests a week, only 317,000 tests were carried out last week. Schaade said this was a reflection of the fact that the number of infections had fallen, but owing to a global shortage of items such as reagents \u201cit is not bad to have a certain remaining capacity\u201d in expectation of a second wave. </p>",
  "<p>Every April, Washington DC plays host to the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank. But last month, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva addressed her colleagues on video. The world was facing, she declared, a \u201ccrisis like no other\u201d. For the first time since records began, the entire world economy is contracting, rich and poor countries alike.</p> <p>But it is not just the immediate impact that makes this economic crisis unprecedented. It is its genesis. This isn\u2019t 2008, which was triggered by a meltdown of North Atlantic banking. And it isn\u2019t the 1930s; an earthquake that originated in the fault lines left by the first world war. The Covid-19 economic emergency of 2020 is the result of a massive global effort to contain an unknown and lethal disease. It is both a surprising demonstration of our collective power to stop the economy and a shocking reminder that our control of nature, on which modern life rests, is more fragile than we like to think. What we are living through is the first economic crisis of the Anthropocene.</p> <p>This is the era in which humanity\u2019s impact on nature has begun to blow back on us in unpredictable and disastrous ways. The great acceleration that defined the Anthropocene may have begun in 1945, but in 2020 we are facing the first crisis in which the blowback destabilises our entire economy. It is a reminder of how encompassing and immediate that challenge is. While the timeline of the climate emergency tends to be measured in years, Covid-19 circled the globe in a matter of weeks. And the shock goes deep. By calling into question our mastery over life and death the disease shakes the psychological basis of our social and economic order. It poses fundamental questions about priorities; it upends the terms of debate. Neither in the 1930s nor after 2008 was there any question that getting people back to work was the right thing to do.</p> <p>Stressing the unprecedented nature of the Covid-19 shock is not to say that the problems exposed by the financial crisis of 2008 are not still with us today. As the pandemic surged in March 2020, the fragility of financial markets was only too apparent. If the lockdowns are followed by a prolonged recession, as is more than likely, the banks will suffer severe damage. Nor does a stress on the uniqueness of the Covid shock imply that geopolitical tensions between China and the US do not matter. They do. The Sino-American conflict puts the future of the world economy in question and this is all the more alarming as tensions over the politics of the virus mount every day.</p> <p>But the crucial point is that financial stability and geopolitics are now entwined with a challenge, which, as the French president Emmanuel Macron has put it, is anthropological: what is at stake is the trade-off between economic activity and death. A chance mutation in the environmental pressure cooker of central China has put in jeopardy all our ability to go about our daily business. It is a malign version of the butterfly effect. Call it the bat effect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c71956f3ccc8e021a58b0a26affc4cfddeed2fc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c71956f3ccc8e021a58b0a26affc4cfddeed2fc5/0_0_3572_2144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"healthcare workers protesting in the Piedmont region of Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despair \u2026 healthcare workers protesting in the Piedmont region of Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Ramella/AGF/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it has circulated around the world, Covid-19 has scrambled the timeline of progress. Sophisticated hospitals in China, Italy and the US have been reduced to chaotic, impotent despair. Nurses in New York resorted to swaddling themselves in rubbish bags. Face masks were hand-fabricated on sewing machines. We stack the dead in refrigerator trucks.</p> <p>We have to face the possibility that we have been living in a charmed interval. In the century since the Spanish flu of 1918-19, the intertwined rise of globalisation and national welfare states took place against the background of relatively benign disease conditions. Thanks to improved nutrition, sanitation and housing, public health, pharmacology and high-tech medicine we have seen remarkable progress in human life expectancy. The conquest of smallpox in 1977 was emblematic. The sense that infectious diseases were a thing of the past underwrote a promise of protection. With Covid-19 the cost of that protection has gone way up. In a horrific mind-warp, advanced economies suddenly find themselves facing the kinds of dilemma habitually faced by poor countries. We don\u2019t have the tools. In the poor world, the everyday result is that children are stunted and families are impoverished. Millions die for lack of treatment. Covid-19 has delivered a taste of that to the rich world.</p> <p>We cannot say we were not warned. Since the famous<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/19/why-limits-to-growths-forecasts-are-still-relevant-today\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/19/why-limits-to-growths-forecasts-are-still-relevant-today\">Limits to Growth </a></em>report by the Club of Rome thinktank in 1972, experts have been highlighting the natural forces that could interrupt the triumphant path of economic growth. In the wake of the oil shocks of the 1970s, resource depletion was a big concern. In the 1980s the climate crisis took over. But at the same moment, the shock of HIV/Aids sparked awareness of a different type of blowback from nature: the threat of \u201cemerging infectious diseases\u201d and specifically those generated by zoonotic mutation.</p> <p>Starting from a famous conference at Rockefeller University in 1989, it has been argued again and again that this is no coincidence. It is the result of humanity\u2019s relentless incorporation of animal life into our food chain. HIV/Aids, Sars, avian flu, swine flu and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/15/mers-next-global-pandemic\">Mers</a> could all be attributed to that dangerous appetite. Like the climate crisis, epidemics are not merely accidents of nature. They have anthropogenic drivers.</p> <p>The implications of this analysis are radical. But the doctors and epidemiologists who make it are not revolutionaries. What they have insistently called for is a global public health infrastructure commensurate with the risks that globalisation entails. If we are going to keep huge stocks of domesticated animals and intrude ever more deeply into the last remaining reservoirs of wildlife; if we are going to concentrate in giant cities and travel in ever larger numbers, this comes with viral risks. If we wish to avoid disasters we should invest in research, in monitoring, in basic public health, in the production and stockpiling of vaccines and essential equipment for our hospitals. Of course, that would require considerable political coordination and some investment. But it has always been clear that the payoff would be huge. The flu pandemic of 1918 which is thought to have killed 50 million people sets a high bar. If a pandemic erupted and had to be contained by quarantine it was always obvious that the costs would run into the trillions of dollars.</p> <p>With the climate crisis we know what stands in the way of an adequate reaction. Fossil fuels are essential to our way of life. Powerful business interests have a huge stake in climate denial. The strategic interests of the US, Saudi Arabia and Russia are all invested in oil. Decarbonising is expensive, technically complicated and the benefits are diffuse and longterm.</p> <p>In regard to global health policy there are bureaucratic rivalries between different national and global agencies. There are differences in approach between hawkish experts in global health security and biomedical humanitarians. The pharmaceutical industry will not invest in drugs unless it sees a profit. Cost-conscious hospitals want to minimise spending on beds. But all this seems small beer compared to the risks involved. Whereas one can reasonably say that giant structures such as capitalism and geopolitics stand in the way of addressing the climate crisis, the same is not true of Covid-19. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd28d79f-8a0a-44c6-ac74-1abb17344c5b\">cost of vaccinating the entire world</a> is estimated at around $20bn. That is the equivalent of roughly two hours of global GDP, a tiny fraction of the trillions that the crisis is costing. The fact that this virus was allowed to become a global crisis is not explicable in terms of massive opposed interests. It is first and foremost a failure of government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It turns out that we can pause the world economy. But we now face the awesome responsibility of reopening it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because they are relatively cheap and the scale of the risk is huge, all major countries in fact had pandemic preparations in place. None were as ample as we might now wish. But in places including South Korea, Taiwan and Germany they have worked. Making good plans, following through on them and doing the basic things right turns out to matter. Addressing the climate crisis poses the daunting challenge of slowing the entire system down. What Covid-19 teaches is that it is not just the big picture that matters. So tightly knit is our global system that small failures of governance in a few crucial nodes can affect everyone on the planet.</p> <p>The remarkable thing about Covid-19 is that it brings the risks of the Anthropocene home to each and every one one of us individually. The lockdowns have not simply been a top-down government measure. It has been people themselves who have en masse decided on their own response to the threat, often ahead of their governments. That was most dramatically reflected in the financial markets, which began a global run to safety. It was that which triggered first the central banks and then parliaments and governments into action. It turns out that we are capable of pausing the world economy. But we now face the awesome responsibility of reopening. If Georgieva is right that this is a crisis like no other, so too is the problem of the restart. The stakes could hardly be higher. On the one hand are the huge medical risks; on the other is a disastrous economic crisis. How can we make the trade-off? It is tempting to reject the choice as impossible or false. Not only is that not true, it also denies the fact that, under normal circumstances, we routinely engage in life and death trade-offs. Even in the most affluent societies, financially motivated decisions are made every day that decide the chances of death due to workplace accidents, pollution, car crashes, hospital funding, drug procurement and health insurance.</p> <p>But never before has the question been put in such direct terms for entire nations. The result is predictably divisive. The US is currently embarked on a crash test, with southern Republican states such as Georgia ploughing ahead despite inadequate testing or medical backup. Incited by the president himself, armed militia occupied the Michigan state capitol demanding \u201cliberation\u201d from the lockdown. Meanwhile in Germany Angela Merkel reprised her role in the eurozone crisis by trying to stifle any discussion. This was not a moment for \u201corgies of debate about reopening\u201d, she insisted. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d was, once again, the order of the day.</p> <p>The magic bullet would be a medical solution \u2013 antibody tests, effective treatments, a vaccine. It took five years to develop a vaccine for Ebola, though vastly greater resources are being thrown at this problem. But what we are counting on should not be confused with business as usual. We have never successfully developed a corona vaccine. We are betting not on normal science, but on a modern wonder, a \u201cscientific miracle\u201d. And, even in the best case, if a vaccine is rolled out in 2021, we cannot escape the logic of risk society. We now know what this kind of threat can do. We know we lost a big chunk of 2020. How do we move on from here?</p> <p>The obvious solution is to make the investments in global public health that experts have been calling for since the 1990s. There will be political and commercial obstacles to overcome. China and the US are at odds and seem determined to politicise the pandemic. On top of that the vast financial cost of the crisis will hang over us. Huge debts are likely to encourage talk of austerity. Since the 1990s, market-focused politics of economy in the public sector have weakened health systems around the world. Ultimately politics will be decisive, and the last six months have brought crushing defeats for the left on both sides of the Atlantic. The prevailing political tenor of the crisis, so far, has been conservative and nationalist.</p> <p>Faced with the crisis, Jair Bolsonaro and Donald Trump have cut ludicrous figures. But they express a deep desire to deny the significance of the shock. Who would not rather think that this was simply the flu? Given this temptation, what we should guard against is not open displays of denial but the soft alternative. Covid-19, like the unprecedented hurricanes and devastating fires of 2019, will be dismissed as a freak of nature. That is comforting. It will be good for business in the short run. But it sets us up for another crisis. If it is right that Covid-19 is a crisis like no other, what is to be feared is that there will be more like it to come \u2022</p>",

  "<p>A secret government report that said the UK was not prepared for a pandemic and forewarned of the Covid-19 crisis in care homes is being published by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The report is based on the findings of a government simulation of an influenza pandemic, codenamed Exercise Cygnus. It concluded starkly that Britain was not adequately prepared for a flu-like pandemic\u2019s \u201cextreme demands\u201d.</p> \n<p>The 2017 report is likely to raise questions over whether ministers ever implemented key recommendations pertaining to the care home sector.</p> \n<p>It contained 26 key recommendations, including boosting the capacity of care homes and the numbers of staff available to work in them. It also warned of the challenge facing homes asked to take in patients from hospitals.<br><br>Asked recently about the report on Exercise Cygnus, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he had been assured by officials at the Department of Health that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/matt-hancock-urged-to-publish-secret-review-of-pandemic-plans\">everything that was recommended was done\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>However, Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, which represents the largest independent care home providers, said concerns raised by the exercise about the social care system\u2019s ability to handle patients discharged from hospitals and the need for the largest private care providers to increase capacity were not raised by government agencies with his members.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f4aea0dd-e562-4291-8701-6fe26391d891\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What was Exercise Cygnus?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Exercise Cygnus was a government simulation of a flu pandemic, carried out to wargame the UK\u2019s pandemic preparedness. It was carried out in 2016 and involved 950 officials from central and local government, as well as emergency response planners, responding to an imaginary outbreak of \u201cswan flu\u201d. A report of the exercise was compiled the following year.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taking place over three days in October, participants were asked to imagine a fictitious \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d flu pandemic, affecting up to 50% of the population and causing up to 400,000 excess deaths.</p>\n    <p>Officials were told to assume they were managing week 7 of the government\u2019s response. The objective of such simulations is to test how existing plans would hold up under strain, while acclimatising ministers and officials to the kind of decisions they would be forced to make.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it find?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The report warned that the government\u2019s flu plans, at least in 2016, were \u201ccurrently not sufficient\u201d to tackle a severe flu pandemic. Some organisations\u2019 plans were out of date and referred to cooperation with other bodies that no longer existed.</p>\n    <p>In other instances plans were in place, but were found to be lacking or required elaborating. Warnings were made about the inability of the social care sector to struggle with the serious pressure that a pandemic would cause.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it recommend?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Cygnus makes 26 recommendations to the department of health and other bodies. Among them were the suggestion that further modelling be done to understand the capacity of the care sector, the creation of a joint-level tactical plan to ensure different organisations could interact more effectively, and that more work needed to be done to understand how the public would respond to interventions by the government.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What does the government say?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The government has claimed to have implemented the recommendations of the Cygnus report in full. In an interview with LBC the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said that after media reports of the simulation emerged, health officials assured him that its recommendations were followed. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the UK was among the countries of the world best prepared for a flu pandemic, and that the government tested its flu plans regularly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt beggars belief,\u201d Green told the Guardian. \u201cThis is a report that made some really clear recommendations that haven\u2019t been implemented. If they had put in place a response to every one, we would have been in a much better place at the start of this pandemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>Covid-19 has swept through the UK\u2019s care homes, killing 6,686 people up to 1 May in England and Wales, in some cases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/without-a-plan-its-not-going-to-stop-care-homes-fear-worst-yet-to-come-covid-19\">claiming dozens of lives</a> in a single facility. Operators have been beset by shortages of essential personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect staff and limit the spread of the virus among residents who are by definition the most vulnerable to the disease.</p> \n<p>With a third of all Covid-19 deaths so far being recorded in care homes, Boris Johnson told parliament on Wednesday: \u201cThere is an epidemic going on in care homes, which is something I bitterly regret.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government has kept the Exercise Cygnus report secret since it was first circulated in Whitehall three years ago, and has resisted growing calls for more transparency, which culminated in the announcement of a legal case to force ministers to release the findings. However a copy was leaked to the Guardian, which is publishing the document in the public interest.</p> \n<p>The report, marked \u201cOfficial \u2013 Sensitive\u201d, is being published in full, although names and email addresses of government officials have been redacted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Exercise Cygnus report\"> \n <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Cygnus Redacted Annex 01scribd Redactedv3\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/460161101/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-mOIwokYnykuy5ezDYrzq\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7068965517241379\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Public Health England ran the Cygnus exercise in October 2016, coordinating more than 950 people, from Department of Health ministers to teams of local emergency planners and prison officers, to test the UK\u2019s response to a new global pandemic, envisaged to be influenza.</p> \n<p>The exercise included four dummy meetings of Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency response system, over three days, as ministers and officials were tasked with imagining the UK was facing the peak of infections.</p> \n<p>A report on Exercise Cygnus was produced in July 2017 and sent to all major government departments, NHS England, and the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> \n<p>It stated as its \u201ckey learning\u201d that \u201cthe UK\u2019s preparedness and response, in terms of its plans, policies and capability, is currently not sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic that will have a nationwide impact across all sectors\u201d.</p> \n<p>The report recommended that a comprehensive \u201cpandemic concept of operations\u201d be created and that NHS England should conduct further work to prepare \u201csurge capacity\u201d in the health service.</p> \n<p>It explicitly recommended that the social care system needed to be able to expand if it were to cope with a \u201cworst-case scenario pandemic\u201d, and that money should be ringfenced to provide extra capacity and support to the NHS.</p> \n<p>It also said the Department of Health should consider bringing back \u201crecently retired nurses and care workers to deal with the extra strain on the system\u201d.

They might have done this planning behind the scenes, but they haven\u2019t involved the care providers.\u201d</p> \n<p>The report states that the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, whose members commission care services, should be involved in developing a way to assess surge capacity in social care during a pandemic. However, the Guardian understands the association was not asked to do so.</p> \n<p>Care England\u2019s Green said the recommendations for expanding capacity and staff levels were not discussed with providers following the 2017 report.</p> \n<p>\u201cNobody has ever had that conversation with us,\u201d he said. \u201cCare England has been talking about providing extra capacity for years. We have been telling them that we have capacity and people don\u2019t need to be in hospital. But we have got nowhere.\u201d</p> \n<p>In response to a freedom of information request by the Guardian last month, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) refused to publish the report on Exercise Cygnus, claiming that it would \u201cprohibitively impact the ability of ministers to meet with officials and external stakeholders to discuss ongoing policy development\u201d.</p> \n<p>The report on at least one similar previous exercise, Winter Willow, has been published without controversy. Last month solicitors at Leigh Day announced that an NHS doctor had instructed them to pursue legal action against the DHSC to try to force the release of the report.</p> \n<p>Moosa Qureshi, whose case is being crowdfunded, argued there was an \u201cexceptionally strong public interest in the publication of the report given the lessons and recommendations are directly relevant to the system and procedures that have been developed\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

We can positively contribute by representing the views of doctors, nurses and carers with no PPE, or health workers saying \u2018I\u2019m not being tested\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>A survey by <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news-media-broadly-trusted-source-coronavirus-information-views-uk-government-response-highly\">YouGov for the University of Oxford\u2019s Reuters Institute </a>found that 54% of the 2,823 people polled thought that the UK government was doing a good job of responding to the pandemic, while a quarter felt the media had exaggerated the crisis, indicating criticism could be eroding trust.</p> <p>Similarly, the Sky News survey found the public are putting their faith in government and officials \u2013 \u201crallying around the flag\u201d \u2013 with strong support for officials including Boris Johnson, boosted by his personal experience of contracting the virus, and the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty. The issue of trust may also be being impacted by political leanings: Reuters Institute found 82% of those on the right thought the government was doing a good job, but the figure was only 14% for those on the left.</p> <p>\u201cPeople think you are either with us or against us,\u201d says Richard Sambrook, a former director of global news at the BBC and the director of the Centre for Journalism at Cardiff University. \u201cPeople trust media less when they don\u2019t see it supporting their point of view and instincts. You have the camp that\u2019s saying we must rally around Boris in this moment of national crisis. And another camp saying that the government must be held to account on important questions.\u201d</p> <p>A significant factor at play is in the wording of survey questions. For example, the Sky News survey simply asked the public about trust in journalists per se. A very different picture of public trust emerges when looking at specific media and organisations.</p> <p>Polls by YouGov, the Reuters Institute, and <a href=\"https://www.survation.com/survation-covid-19-public-attitude-tracker/\">Survation</a>, which asked 3,029 people, Ipsos MORI and weekly research by Ofcom, the broadcasting and media regulator, of 2,000 people, have all found that broadcasters and newspapers are widely considered to be the most trusted sources of information on the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThere simply has been no collapse in public trust in news media during the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/media/articles-reports/2020/04/29/no-trust-media-has-not-collapsed-because-coronavir\"> YouGov concluded</a> after examining trust levels recorded in its polls of 1,643 people from during last year\u2019s general election up until last week.</p> <p>Broadcasters are the most trusted source of news during the crisis, led by the BBC, with levels running from 72% to 82% across the corporation, ITV, Sky, Channel 4 and Channel 5, <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/tv-radio-and-on-demand/news-media/coronavirus-news-consumption-attitudes-behaviour\">according to Ofcom.</a> The BBC is widely considered to have handled coverage of the crisis well, no mean feat after being accused during the general election of bias from all sides of the political spectrum.</p> <p>\u201cPublic service broadcasting is having a good crisis in terrible circumstances,\u201d says Roger Mosey, former editorial director at the BBC and master of Selwyn College, Cambridge. \u201cThe factual information from the BBC, ITV and Sky has been good. Anecdotally and from what I see in public surveys people respect what is being said.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to newspapers, there is a significant divergence in perceptions of public trust.</p> <p> The Guardian, Financial Times, the Telegraph and the Times have trust levels in some cases close to TV news broadcasters. Survation and the Reuters Institute have the Guardian as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/28/guardian-tops-poll-of-national-papers-for-coronavirus-coverage\">most trusted newspaper doing the best job of covering the pandemic</a>. YouGov found in an examination of six months of data that public trust in what it calls these \u201cupmarket\u201d newspaper titles has remained completely stable.</p> <p>Mid-market and tabloid titles, such as the Daily Mirror, Daily Mail and the Sun have historically had much lower levels of public trust. There has been no erosion of these lower levels of trust during the coronavirus pandemic, YouGov found.<em><strong><br></strong></em></p> <p>While news outlets continue to see record audiences there are signs that the public is beginning to tire of wave after wave of coronavirus news. The Reuters Institute found that 47% of respondents say they now sometimes try to avoid the news. Separate research published by Ofcom on Tuesday found that more than a third of people are now actively seeking to avoid news about the pandemic, up from about a fifth in the first week of lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cThere is an element of shoot the messenger to this,\u201d says Austin. \u201cCriticism comes from all sides, it\u2019s an interesting place to be. The other day Richard Littlejohn [Daily Mail columnist] wrote <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-8275559/RICHARD-LITTLEJOHN-TV-news-stop-scaring-death-coronavirus-crisis.html\">\u2018When will TV news stop scaring us to death over the coronavirus crisis?\u2019</a> My answer to that is when it stops being true.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>I made my first million the year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/28/greece-crisis-protest-against-austerity-drive\">Greece went under</a>. I was 24 years old at the time.</p> <p>I\u2019d attended a presentation given by one of Citibank\u2019s senior economists, in which he explained that government debts of the world\u2019s major economies had grown to dangerous levels, and were continuing to grow. He warned that markets could stop lending to some of these governments, forcing a devastating round of austerity on to already battered economies.</p> <p>These governments were just like the majority of their citizens \u2013 reliant on debt to get by. But who were all these debts owed to? I didn\u2019t have to look far to find the answer. On the Citibank floor millionaires to my left and right stared hungrily at the green and red numbers flashing on their six computer screens. They bought stocks and lent money to governments and banks. It was these people, and the people whose money they managed, to whom all of these debts were owed. As governments and workers accumulated debts, these people accumulated property, stocks, bonds and gold. This money would not cycle back through the system, pushing up wages; instead it pushed up the prices of these assets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we repeat 2008, buying a house with one\u2019s own wages will be a thing of the past</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since governments were doing nothing to stop this cycle of growing inequality, this problem would not end, it would only get worse. So, I placed a bet on the future of the global economy. I bet that over the next three years global central banks would be unable to normalise interest rates from emergency levels because economies permanently weakened by rising inequality would not be able to survive doing so. By the end of that year, 2011, I was Citibank\u2019s most profitable trader globally, and a millionaire. I made that same bet again in 2012. In 2014 I retired.</p> <p>Each year since 2008, central banks and economists have incorrectly predicted a raise in interest rates. They continually fail to recognise that mounting debt and growing inequality is the new normal from which the economy will not recover. All the signs are that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> will increase inequality even further. The government is accumulating debt to subsidise the wages of the employed and self-employed unable to work because of the lockdown. Businesses are taking out loans to keep afloat. This debt is being used to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/following-coronavirus-money-trail/\">pay bills and rent to those who own assets</a>.</p> <p>I cannot tell you whether governments will again resort to austerity to try to pay these debts off, but I can tell you what the rich will do with their new piles of cash. <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/i-made-a-fortune-from-predicting-the-last-crisis-i-fear-for-whats-about-to-unfold/\">They will buy more stocks, bonds, gold, land and houses</a>. I know this because they did exactly that when they received large amounts of newly printed money after the 2008 and 2011 crises.

The level of the players\u2019 fitness and form would be a pinprick compared to other considerations and in any case \u201cthe same for both sides\u201d mantra applies. We are in extreme circumstances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b0977b59586d506e3cb4df300d338747ce5b33be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0977b59586d506e3cb4df300d338747ce5b33be/336_17_2070_2584/801.jpg\" alt=\"Wally Hammond batting for England during the 1945 Victory Test series against Australia\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wally Hammond batting for England during the 1945 Victory Test series against Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did Wally Hammond and Lindsay Hassett insist upon a delay to the start of the Victory Test series in 1945 to allow both sides to complete their physical and mental preparations? I don\u2019t think so.</p> <p>The crowds flocked to those matches as a visible sign of national relief and an expression of hope that life was returning to normal. That will not be possible in 2020 and there is no victory to celebrate, but there is an appetite for some live sport even if all the seats at the grounds (presumably Old Trafford and the Ageas Bowl) are empty.</p> <p>With safeguards satisfied and permission granted, the players are obliged to put on a show but the matches will be hard-pressed to emulate the joyous, fraternal contests between England and the Australian Services of 75 years ago (bear in mind Don Bradman was in Australia at the time).</p> <p>In fact the idea that the only way to prepare for an international is by playing several matches beforehand is now outmoded. Admittedly Sir Geoffrey Boycott has always been keen to point out the imperative of playing proper cricket before any Test, and before him Fred Trueman would not take much prompting to point out that he bowled 1,200 first-class overs every season. Playing cricket probably <em>is</em> the best way to prepare for an international match, but this has rarely been the way over the past couple of decades.</p> <p>Modern players are not spooked by a lack of match practice. Prince among these is surely England\u2019s white-ball captain, Eoin Morgan of Middlesex \u2013 notionally. In 2019 he played two Championship matches for his county, which was two more than he managed in 2018, 2017 and 2016.</p> <p>Morgan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/16/eoin-morgan-england-captain-future-chris-woakes-cricket\">is a national treasure after</a> last summer\u2019s World Cup triumph but one should also admire how he has cracked the system. He has proven that it is possible to flourish playing the odd game around the globe \u2013 his latest non-international venture was for the Delhi Bulls in the T10 Super League in Abu Dhabi \u2013 in between captaining England. He still manages to deliver at regular intervals as a batsman on the international stage. That is neat.</p> <p>Before the virus took hold two more unlikely characters demonstrated how it was possible to excel after being pitchforked into a Test without playing beforehand. Mark Wood played no Championship cricket for Durham last summer when he only appeared in ODI cricket for England until the World Cup final.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet when selected for two Test matches in South Africa in January he prospered, such was the diligence and determination of his preparations. Dom Bess did not have to deal with the constant threat of injury like Wood yet when he suddenly appeared in South Africa, a novice in Test cricket, he had not played a match since the previous September. Yet he also performed remarkably well.</p> <p>It is easier for bowlers to survive without match practice. They can enhance their fitness and tune the appropriate muscles by bowling in the nets or on the square, which can be a solitary, lonely pursuit. With dedication and a carefully planned routine it is clearly possible to prepare effectively for a Test match in this way. Wood keeps proving that. It is even possible to do so and keep within the physical-distancing guidelines.</p> <p>It is tougher for batsmen; it is more difficult for them to ease back into form in the middle of a Test. One mistake and they can be back in the pavilion. More than bowlers they need the rhythm of batting in a match. The magic touch has to return. But let\u2019s not be too precious about this. The logistical challenge of playing a Test in the time of coronavirus is a massive undertaking; by comparison remembering how to bat, bowl and field is a doddle.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s hard to be all that cheerful when you are bracing yourself for the biggest annual contraction in the economy since before the South Sea Bubble crisis of 1720, but somehow or other the <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\">Bank of England</a> has managed to find some nuggets of hope amid all the gloom.</p> \n<p>To be sure, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/may/07/bank-of-england-interest-rates-covid-19-downturn-us-job-losses-business-live\">short-term news from Threadneedle Street</a> was as grim as everybody had expected. Having fallen by 3% in the first three months of 2020, activity is projected to drop by a further 25% in the second quarter and by 14% over the calendar year.</p> \n<p>Yet the Bank is assuming that lockdown restrictions start to be lifted from the start of next month and that the economy then starts to recover, that it expands by 15% in 2021 and by the end of next year is almost back to where it would have been had the pandemic never happened.</p> \n<p>Just how realistic this proves to be remains to be seen. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008-09, the Bank consistently over-estimated the pace at which the economy would bounce back and productivity would recover.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/snapback-uk-economy-lockdown-recession-coronavirus\">Don't expect a snapback for the UK economy after lockdown is lifted | Larry Elliott</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This time it thinks things are different. One of the problems during the financial crisis was that the damage caused to the banking system impeded the flow of credit to firms and reduced productivity-enhancing investment. Today, the banks are in far better shape to help businesses through short-term cashflow problems caused by the lockdown.</p> \n<p>Indeed, one of the key messages from the Bank to the high-street lenders was that they stand to lose more by not lending than they will by lending freely, because there will be more long-term scarring of the economy, more companies going bust and more losses for them to swallow. At his press conference, the Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, said he was ramming home this point to lenders at every opportunity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0c200f0d-cdb0-408d-a119-9c973cced423\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>One of the two main definitions of recession in the UK is at least two quarters of negative economic growth. Judged by this&nbsp;yardstick, the UK was last in recession in 2008-09, when there were&nbsp;six consecutive quarters of negative growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Some economists believe this definition of recession is flawed, since an economy would not be in recession if it contracted by 5% in the first quarter, expanded by 0.1% in each of the following two quarters and then contracted again by 5% in the fourth quarter. It would, however, be deemed to be in recession if it grew by 5% in each of the first and fourth quarters but contracted by 0.1% in each of the second and third quarters.</p>\n    <p>An alternative \u2013 and tougher definition \u2013 is a full calendar year of negative output. Given the UK economy has grown on average by 2.5% over many decades, it is rare for gross domestic product (GDP) to fall on an annual basis. There have been only five such years since the end of the second world war: 1974, 1975, 1980, 1981 and 1991.</p>\n    <p>The United States has its own method of assessing recession, with the National Bureau of Economic Research's business cycle-dating committee making a judgment.</p>\n    <p>The NBER defines recession as \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production and wholesale-retail sales\".</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That said, the Bank is still working on the assumption that there is a V-shaped pattern to the economy, albeit with the downward part of the V taking six months and the upward part taking 18 months. Some voluntary physical distancing will continue even after formal government curbs have been removed, it suspects.</p> \n<p>The Bank was at pains to point out that it has produced an illustrative scenario rather than a forecast, and that\u2019s a reasonable point. Forecasting is tough at the best of times: in the current circumstances \u2013 where there is uncertainty about how fast restrictions will be lifted, how consumers will behave, and whether there will be a second wave of infection \u2013 it is all but impossible.</p> \n<p>All that can really be said is that the risks to the Bank\u2019s scenario are skewed heavily to the downside. Threadneedle Street decided against providing more stimulus at this week\u2019s meeting, but it is only a question of time.</p> \n<p>In the event that the pandemic does return, Bailey said the Bank would find new tools from somewhere. That might sound a bit like Mr Micawber saying \u201csomething will turn up\u201d, but it broadly sums up current thinking: this is bad, but somehow or other we will get through it.</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Virus exposes shortages across Africa\u2019s healthcare systems</h2> <p>African nations are facing a surge of Covid-19 cases with less than one intensive care bed and one ventilator per 100,000 people, a Reuters survey has found. Even in a best-case scenario, the continent could need at least 10 times the numbers it has now as the outbreak peaks, an analysis of researchers\u2019 projections showed.</p> <h2>UN warns pandemic could cause \u2018multiple famines\u2019</h2> <p>The United Nations has warned that the global pandemic could cause \u201cmultiple famines\u201d, as it appealed for a further $4.7bn in funding to help more than 50 vulnerable countries. The comments came as the UN appealed for a further $4.7bn (\u00a33.8bn) in funding for its global humanitarian response plan.</p> <h2>India cases rise above 50,000</h2> <p>Coronavirus cases in India have risen past 50,000 according to the country\u2019s health ministry, with the pace of infection showing no sign of abating.</p> <h2>More than 150,000 people have died of Covid-19 in Europe</h2> <p>The number of people who have died after contracting Covid-19 in Europe has surpassed 150,000, with most in the UK, Italy, Spain and France, a tally of official figures by the AFP news agency showed.</p> <h2>China exports show surprise rise in April</h2> <p>China\u2019s exports saw a shock 3.5% rise in April despite a hit to external demand from the coronavirus pandemic, official figures showed on Thursday. But imports fell 14.2% from a year ago, a steeper drop from last month, according to the Customs Administration. A forecast of analysts by Bloomberg had predicted an 11% dive in exports and a 10% plunge in imports.</p> <h2>City mayors warn over climate crisis after pandemic</h2> <p>Mayors in many of the world\u2019s leading cities have warned there can be no return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis if humanity is to escape catastrophic climate breakdown.</p> <h2>Poland puts brakes on presidential election</h2> <p>Poland has postponed Sunday\u2019s presidential election amid the outbreak. The postal-only ballot will now take place \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, but is likely to not happen until at least June.</p> <h2>400,000 Turkish gowns delivered to NHS not usable</h2> <p>A cabinet minister has confirmed that 400,000 gowns from Turkey to protect medics from coronavirus have been impounded because they were poor quality, but he insisted \u201cstrong supplies\u201d were now coming through to the frontline.

  "<p>The federal agency providing oversight of the commercial nuclear sector is attempting to push through a rule change critics say could allow dangerous amounts of radioactive material to be disposed of in places like municipal landfills, with potentially serious consequences to human health and the environment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/22/coca-cola-pepsi-falling-short-pledges-over-plastic-tearfund-report\">Coca-Cola and Pepsi falling short on pledges over plastic \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis would be the most massive deregulation of radioactive waste in American history,\u201d said Dan Hirsch, president of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a nuclear industry watchdog non-profit, about a proposal that would permit \u201cvery low-level\u201d radioactive waste to be disposed of by \u201cland burial\u201d.</p> <p>Currently, low-level radioactive waste is primarily disposed of in highly regulated sites in Texas, Washington, South Carolina and Utah. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) also provides exemptions allowing \u201clow-level waste\u201d to be dumped in unlicensed disposal sites, but these exemptions are given only rarely, and are conducted with strict case-by-case protocols in place.</p> <p>The proposed \u201cinterpretive\u201d rule change relaxes the rules surrounding how radioactive materials would be disposed of in unlicensed disposal sites \u201csignificantly\u201d, said Hirsch.</p> <p>\u201cIf you dump radioactive waste in places that aren\u2019t designed to deal with it, it comes back to haunt you. It\u2019s in the air you breathe, the food that you eat, the water you drink,\u201d he added.</p> <p>In an email, David McIntyre, an NRC spokesperson, explained that the rule would apply only to a \u201csmall subset\u201d of very low-level waste, and that the agency would not allow such disposals \u201cif we felt public health and safety and the environment would not be protected\u201d.</p> <p>But major sticking point, say experts, concerns how the term \u201cvery low-level waste\u201d is not defined by statute or in the NRC\u2019s own regulations.</p> <p>The NRC describes low-level wastes as contaminated materials like clothing, tools, and medical equipment. According to McIntyre, the radioactivity of \u201cvery low-level waste\u201d is just above background. \u201cThe radioactivity level of very low-level waste is so low that it may be safely disposed of in hazardous or municipal solid waste landfills,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>Nevertheless, \u201cbackground doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s safe,\u201d said Diane D\u2019Arrigo, radioactive waste project director for the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, who added that the interpretive rule\u2019s loose language \u201copens the floodgates\u201d for nuclear waste to be disposed of \u201cas if not radioactive\u201d.</p> <p>The proposal caps the maximum annual \u201ccumulative dose\u201d to a person from the radioactive wastes dumped into unlicensed sites to 25 millirems \u2013 the same limit the NRC uses for highly regulated waste disposal sites. That measurement, said D\u2019Arrigo, is a \u201cprojected\u201d amount that can be manipulated through modeling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you dump radioactive waste in places that aren\u2019t designed to deal with it, it comes back to haunt you</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Hirsch</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Experts point out that the nuclear industry has long sought cheaper ways to dispose of its wastes.

There are real issues and real conflicts to be explored in seeking to prevent the collapse of our life support systems. But they are handled so clumsily and incoherently by this film that watching it is like seeing someone start a drunken brawl over a spilled pint, then lamping his friends when they try to restrain him. It stumbles so blindly into toxic issues that Moore, former champion of the underdog, unwittingly aligns himself with white supremacists and the extreme right.</p> <p>Occasionally, the film lands a punch on the right nose. It is right to attack the burning of trees to make electricity. But when the film\u2019s presenter and director, Jeff Gibbs, claims, \u201cI found only one environmental leader willing to reject biomass and biofuels\u201d, he can\u2019t have been looking very far. Some people have been speaking out against them ever since they became a serious proposition (since 2004 <a href=\"https://www.monbiot.com/2004/11/23/feeding-cars-not-people/\">in my case</a>). Almost every environmental leader I know opposes the burning of fresh materials to generate power.</p> <p>There are also some genuine and difficult problems with renewable energy, particularly the mining of the <a href=\"https://logicmag.io/nature/what-green-costs/\">necessary materials</a>. But the film\u2019s attacks on solar and wind power rely on a series of blatant falsehoods. It claims that, in producing electricity from renewables, \u201cYou use more fossil fuels to do this than you\u2019re getting benefit from it. You would have been better off just burning fossil fuels in the first place\u201d. This is flat wrong. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-017-0032-9\">On average</a>, a solar panel generates 26 units of solar energy for every unit of fossil energy required to build and install it. For wind turbines the ratio is 44 to one.</p> <p>Planet of the Humans also claims that you can\u2019t reduce fossil fuel use through renewable energy: coal is instead being replaced by gas. Well, in the third quarter of 2019, renewables in the UK generated more electricity than coal, oil and gas plants <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-renewables-generate-more-electricity-than-fossil-fuels-for-first-time\">put together</a>. As a result of the switch to renewables in this country, the amount of fossil fuel used for power generation has halved since 2010. <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-half-uks-electricity-to-be-renewable-by-2025\">By 2025</a>, the government forecasts, roughly half our electricity will come from renewables, while gas burning will drop by a further 40%. To hammer home its point, the film shows footage of a \u201clarge terminal to import natural gas from the United States\u201d that \u201cGermany just built\u201d. Germany has no such terminal. The footage was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sustainable2050/status/1255398544770568195\">shot in Turkey</a>.</p> <p>There is also a real story to be told about the co-option and capture of some environmental groups by the industries they should hold to account. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/26/shell-not-green-saviour-death-machine-greenwash-oil-gas\">A remarkable number</a> of large conservation organisations take money from fossil fuel companies. This is a disgrace. But rather than pinning the blame where it lies, Planet of the Humans concentrates its attacks on Bill McKibben, the co-founder of <a href=\"http://350.org/\">350.org</a>, who takes no money from any of his campaigning work. It\u2019s an almost comic exercise in misdirection, but unfortunately it has horrible, real-world consequences, as McKibben now faces <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/bill-mckibben-climate-movement-michael-moore-993073/\">even more threats</a> and attacks than he confronted before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/03/once-again-michael-moore-stirs-the-environmental-pot-but-conservationists-turn-up-the-heat-on-him\">Once again Michael Moore stirs the environmental pot \u2013 but conservationists turn up the heat on him</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But this is by no means the worst of it. The film offers only one concrete solution to our predicament: the most toxic of all possible answers. \u201cWe really have got to start dealing with the issue of population \u2026 without seeing some sort of major die-off in population, there\u2019s no turning back.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, population growth does contribute to the pressures on the natural world.

High consumption is concentrated in countries where population growth is low.

The group calls itself \u201cgroup of mothers\u201d in Burmese. </p> <p>Her village is in an area that was partially controlled by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) until 2011, when a 17-year ceasefire between the group and Myanmar\u2019s military <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/16/china-burma-hydropower-clashes\">broke down</a>.</p> <p>Fighting between a patchwork of militias broke out across Shan state, and the area has since become the centre of the global methamphetamine trade. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that meth made in labs in south-east Asia could be worth more than $60bn (\u00a348bn) a year, and that <a href=\"https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/world/2019-07-18-southeast-asias-meth-gangs-making-60bn-a-year-says-un-report/\">much of it originates in Shan state</a>.</p> <p>The area around Mone Paw village is controlled partly by government troops, partly by the KIA, and partly by an ethnic Palaung armed group called the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/apr/2020-04-15T15:58:07.html\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/apr/2020-04-15T15:58:07.html\">map</a> </figure>  <p>The local economy is traditionally based on farming, including maize and rice crops which are sold to Chinese brokers. But with fighting intensifying in recent years, agricultural trade has been eclipsed by meth production.</p> <p>\u201cThe drug problem is growing very fast,\u201d says Ester.</p> <p>According to the UNODC Myanmar is also the world\u2019s second-largest producer of opium, with poppy cultivation centred in Shan. But opium cultivation is declining as regional demand for heroin is overtaken by a booming market for synthetic drugs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/24/the-new-drug-highway-pacific-islands-at-centre-of-cocaine-trafficking-boom\">The new drug highway: Pacific islands at centre of cocaine trafficking boom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back in 2012, Ester estimates that most of the men in Mone Paw village \u2013 which has a population of almost 3,000 \u2013 used drugs.</p> <p>Her husband was among them.</p> <p>\u201cI tried very hard to help him. I even locked him in a room for several days. Unfortunately, I failed to help,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The couple divorced in 2012. Soon afterwards, Ester formed the anti-drug group, initiating an informal movement in cooperation with other village women.</p> <p>Some of the men in the village had joined armed groups, while others were away working in China. With the police, the military and rebel armed groups among local authorities involved in the drugs industry to some extent, the women felt they needed to fill the gap.</p> <p>Lashi Htan, the group\u2019s vice-chair, was one of the first to join.

It conducts surprise checks on vehicles passing through the area, and raids dealers\u2019 houses. The women issue fines and the money funds the group\u2019s operations.</p> <p>\u201cIf they refuse to pay the fine, we destroy their property,\u201d Htan says, explaining that they set it on fire.</p> <p>Sometimes the group sells seized goods at the local market.</p> <p>\u201cAt first, we were not so effective, but we became the last straw for drowning people to grasp,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Armed groups in the area provide the women with security and information about drug production in areas controlled by rivals. The Myanmar military, for example, feeds them information about drug production in areas controlled by the KIA, and vice versa.</p> <p>The women say that to some extent they are being exploited, but that the arrangement helps them on their mission to eradicate drugs.</p> <p>\u201cHalf a loaf is better than none,\u201d says Ester. \u201cWe need to have good relations with armed groups for our safety.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f153c77dca3325b4513bb949e6cf4f7682d6b6db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f153c77dca3325b4513bb949e6cf4f7682d6b6db/0_0_3308_2202/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Internally displaced people and local villagers attend a church service in Myitkyina, Kachin state.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Internally displaced people and local villagers attend a church service in Myitkyina, Kachin state.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ye Aung Thu/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even so, the women often receive threats. A bomb was left outside the front door of Ester\u2019s home in 2014. It was defused and handed to the Mone Paw Militia, who are aligned with Myanmar\u2019s military. \u201cThe father of the drug addict responsible for the bomb came and apologised to me [and said] that this would never happen again,\u201d says Ester. .</p> <p>The government-appointed administrator of Mone Paw village says local authorities and armed groups face limitations in enforcing law. For example, government troops can\u2019t access rebel-held territory.</p> <p>\u201cBut the \u2018Women Pat Jasan\u2019 group can do it freely. They go wherever they want to go,\u201d he says over the phone. The group is informally referred to by this name, because they are believed to have inspired the Christian anti-drug movement Pat Jasan, whose vigilante methods in Kachin State have drawn criticism.</p> <p>In early 2014, the Kachin Baptist Church invited Ester and her group to share their experiences in several towns, including the state capital Myitkyina. A few months later, Pat Jasan was formed. It has since become the largest civilian anti-drug campaign in Myanmar. Its methods include arresting and beating drug users, forcing them into treatment camps and sending teams out to destroy poppy fields of subsistence farmers.</p> <p>Ester\u2019s approach is more flexible, but she says she was, \u201cvery happy to see what they are doing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSome might say that their way is a bit violent.

  "<p>BT has scrapped its dividend for the first time in more than a decade to free up billions to invest in building 5G and next-generation full-fibre broadband across the UK.</p> <p>BT, which is facing a new rival after the owners of Virgin Media and O2 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/virgin-media-and-o2-owners-confirm-31bn-mega-merger-in-uk\">announced a \u00a331bn merger on Thursday</a>, reported a 12% fall in pre-tax profits to \u00a32.3bn for the year to the end of March.</p> <p>The company said profits had been affected by a \u00a395m charge due to Covid-19, \u201cmainly reflecting increased debtor provisions\u201d.</p> <p>Philip Jansen, the chief executive, said: \u201cOf course, Covid-19 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/business-bosses-coronavirus-effect-staff-outlook\">affecting our business</a>. But the full impact will only become clearer as the economic consequences unfold over the next 12 months.\u201d</p> <p>The company said it had suspended the \u00a31bn final dividend for last year and the estimated \u00a31.5bn in dividends for the coming financial year to the end of March 2021. When the dividend is re-introduced in 2022 it will be at half the previous annual amount, saving another \u00a3750m for BT. The company last moved to cut or suspend its dividend during the financial crisis in 2008-09. Shares fell 8% on Thursday to 105p.</p> <p>Jansen said the money would form part of a \u00a312bn investment to accelerate the process of getting \u201cgold-standard\u201d full-fibre broadband to 20m UK homes by the mid- to late 2020s.

  "<p>Times are truly strange when a man dressed in a grim reaper\u2019s costume in 90F (32C) heat is the most sane person around. But last week, as people flocked to Florida\u2019s recently reopened beaches, Daniel Uhlfelder had a message for beachgoers.</p> <p>\u201cThe grim reaper represents death. This is a deadly virus. It\u2019s a global pandemic,\u201d he said in a televised news broadcast.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/florida-grim-reaper-beach-video-coronavirus\">Florida man stalks beach as Grim Reaper to protest reopening amid pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not in Uhlfelder\u2019s nature to want to keep beaches closed \u2013 as a lawyer, he has <a href=\"https://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20191209/huckabee-files-florida-bar-complaint-against-customary-use-foe\">campaigned to keep beaches publicly accessible in the past</a>. But as the coronavirus death toll reaches 75,000 in the US and global shutdowns help to slow the spread of the deadly virus, Uhlfelder felt he had to say something.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about the pandemic getting out of control and killing a lot of people \u2026 I couldn\u2019t sleep at night [if I just did nothing],\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1256287520775639041\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">holy shit <a href=\"https://t.co/rVw24plXTp\">pic.twitter.com/rVw24plXTp</a></p>&mdash; Adam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1256287520775639041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And so, he came up with an idea to dress up with a cloak and scythe, and take a Grim Reaper tour of Florida\u2019s beaches.</p> <p>The protest has garnered national attention: Uhlfelder has appeared on Saturday Night Live, the Daily Show and CNN, and has raised thousands of dollars, which he will donate to Democrats who run for Congress.</p> <p>But when he came up with the idea, his wife warned him not to do it. He was even told by people online not to partake in the stunt \u2013 some laughed and wished heatstroke upon him. In the end, their unkind words turned out to be pretty useful.</p> <p>\u201cI thought, maybe they have a point,\u201d he says. And so, Uhlfelder took heed of his enemies\u2019 advice and swapped out the $20 Walmart costume he originally intended to wear and called a friend to see if she might have something better.</p> <p>\u201cShe was like, \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea \u2013 let\u2019s make [the costume] out of linen.\u2019 I had a bathing suit on underneath and flip-flops, so I felt great,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"799ffc07414d35acb0a37009f918243b09a61b7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/799ffc07414d35acb0a37009f918243b09a61b7c/0_0_3696_2456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cIf by dressing up as the \u201cGrim Reaper\u201d and walking our beaches I can make people think and potentially help save a life \u2013 that is the right thing to do.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If by dressing up as the Grim Reaper and walking our beaches I can make people think and potentially help save a life \u2013 that is the right thing to do.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Devon Ravine/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Needless to say, the experience was not entirely pleasant. Uhlfelder says he was heckled on the beach: people took photos of him, called him a jerk and some other, more unpleasant names too.</p> <p>Still, Uhlfelder says the comments don\u2019t bother him \u2013 in fact, he\u2019s not even particularly mad at the beachgoers. Uhlfelder empathizes with people who want the economy to reopen and life to go back to normal \u2013 particularly when the president doesn\u2019t take shutdown seriously.</p> <p>\u201cWe have beautiful beaches, I\u2019d love to go to the beach \u2013 that\u2019s why people come to Florida. We don\u2019t have anything else,\u201d he jokes. But he asks why the US has made the offer of staying at home so unappealing for ordinary Americans.</p> <p>\u201cWe are the wealthiest country on the planet. Why can\u2019t we have people taken care of for two, three, four months, instead of being put in these situations? They are perfectly comfortable starving out or killing people,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Most people have reacted positively to the stunt \u2013 and Uhlfelder says he is happy that his dry sense of humor has cut through in landscape when some of the loudest voices have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">anti-shutdown protest</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">ers carrying guns</a>. He just hopes his protest empowers others to do the same.</p> <p>\u201cIf people don\u2019t agree with what the government is doing, and [are able], you have to do something about it. People died for that right,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone has to stand up to these people \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I want others to do it too. It gets tiring being the only one.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/02/bill-beaumont-beats-agustin-pichot-in-battle-for-control-of-world-rugby\">Bill Beaumont\u2019s re-election as World Rugby\u2019s chairman</a> was not an end but a new beginning. The former England captain faced several hurdles as a player, but nothing compared to what he faces in his final administrative stint. His narrow victory over Agust\u00edn Pichot shows there is a danger of the international game splitting unless the next few years spawn meaningful change and an end to self-interest.</p> <p>Beaumont was backed by the Six Nations while Pichot harvested the votes of the four Rugby Championship countries: had the former Argentina scrum-half persuaded one of the European unions to back him, he would have won. His failure gave the incumbent a majority of five, but Pichot did not secure enough votes from the countries and associations representing the nations below what is called tier one to bring what had been a stealthy campaign to a successful conclusion.</p> <p>There was little to choose between Beaumont and Pichot in terms of policies, but the Rugby Championship countries have become frustrated at the ability of their European rivals to thwart projects, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\">such as the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\">Nations </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\">Championship</a> which Beaumont floated last year only to see it torpedoed by Ireland and Scotland, although Pichot\u2019s Argentina ended up not voting for it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/05/rfu-government-bailout-england-summer-2021-coronavirus\">RFU will need government bailout if England do not play until summer 2021</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A central plank of Beaumont\u2019s campaign was an independent governance review, but even when he delivers it, there is no guarantee of its recommendations being approved. Some campaigning for Pichot argued only he could drag World Rugby into the professional era, failing to point out the governing body is like the United Nations where the major powers are armed with the weight of veto. Beaumont\u2019s diplomatic skills will be needed and he was the candidate best qualified to deliver change.</p> <p>The sports lawyer Darren Bailey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/30/rugby-needs-a-command-economy-ex-world-rugby-directors-remedy\">argued in last week\u2019s Breakdown</a> that the current crisis gave rugby the opportunity to address three faultlines that had bedevilled it since 1995: north versus south, club versus country and developed versus developing. For all the talk of the need for a global calendar and greater harmonisation between the hemispheres, nothing radical will happen until the primacy of international rugby is established in all countries, which means the systems in France and England mirroring the other eight championship nations.</p> <p>Few clubs in France and England are sustainable, as the last two months have shown, but they have used borrowing and the largesse of backers to tempt players from the southern hemisphere at salaries inflated to more than compensate for either putting a Test career on hold or ending it. The Sanzaar unions responded by expanding Super Rugby to entice more out of broadcasters and help them to compete financially, but they were never able to catch up and diluted what had been the premier tournament below Test level.</p> <p>Australia \u2013 a country that, unlike New Zealand and South Africa, does not have a strong base \u2013 overextended itself and had no slack when the virus led to sport shutting down. Its union is looking for a new chief executive and this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/06/rugby-australia-director-peter-wiggs-resigns\">appointed Rob Clarke</a>, who filled the role for the Brumbies and the Rebels, on an interim basis. \u201cThe game is facing some unprecedented challenges,\u201d he said before going off to find some answers.</p> <p>Australia, like the other southern hemisphere unions, cannot afford for the game to muddle on as before, driven not by a common goal or an executive with the authority to govern in the interest of the game rather than self-interest, but application of sticking plasters that are lacking in adhesive.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still a level of governance reform that is overdue,\u201d said New Zealand Rugby\u2019s chief executive, Brent Impey. \u201cIt would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally, not just for a limited number of unions and regions.\u201d</p> <p>The south will not, because they cannot afford to, endure another four years of muddle and fudge. The slickness of Pichot\u2019s campaign suggested it was not one that was hastily put together, and if Beaumont\u2019s governance review, which will be set up under the former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson by the end of the month, comes to nothing the four Rugby Championship countries will have a choice to make: either carry on and let the Six Nations hold sway, or declare that if nothing changes they will no longer be bound by World Rugby\u2019s tour schedule.</p> <p>The ultimate threat would be to break away, but where would they go? They would be out of the World Cup and have no more Lions tours. If Europe continues to oppose the plan for a Nations Championship, something that would offer emerging nations a route to tournament rugby, and with it any form of revenue sharing, a meaningful tactic would be to pull out of the July and November Test windows and negotiate matches on an individual basis.</p> <p>They may be helped, in the short term at least, by the lack of liquidity of clubs in France and England. The upward curve of salaries will be checked and there will be a review of salary cap levels and, in England, the dispensation that allows two marquee players to be registered outside the cap with no limits on their wages.</p> <p>World Rugby has the opportunity to lead from the front, but Beaumont can do no more than advise and help formulate policies. A transformative plan such as the Nations Championship should not have its fate dependent on the unanimous assent of the Six Nations or Rugby Championship. It is the old amateur way of operating, for the benefit of the few.</p> <p>Those days are gone, as Beaumont appreciates every bit as much as Pichot. If the last couple of months have shown anything, it is that the game needs to expand globally. Its footprint is too small. That did not matter once, but it does now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

When he was poking around the internet several years ago and stumbled on a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theonlycritic.com%2Fsingle-post%2F2020%2F05%2F05%2FReview-Insightful-Spaceship-Earth-documents-1991-Biosphere-2-experiment&amp;psig=AOvVaw0vhneEuCe-UxTE0zh8T1ac&amp;ust=1588874836534000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCJD0u5Xqn-kCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD\">photo</a> of the jump-suited Biospherians in their glass-paned habitat, he assumed it was from a science fiction movie. He soon realized the project was indeed real, and that many of its participants remained at a commune-style ranch in New Mexico.</p> <p>\u201cI became determined to tell their story,\u201d Wolf told the Guardian, particularly once he witnessed the cache of archival footage \u2013 reels of tape in a temperature-controlled room \u2013 kept by those involved in Biosphere 2. \u201cI was just astounded that they recognized the historical significance of what they were doing and were so rigorous in documenting it,\u201d he said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGvYFB6GHRY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mGvYFB6GHRY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Biosphere 2 was an ambitious endeavor, to say the least \u2013 a collection of sealed-off biomes under a glass pyramid in the Arizona desert, intended to demonstrate the viability of self-sustaining microsystems on an inhospitable planet (or, as many participants warned, an inhospitable Earth). Biosphere 2, named as such because participants believed Earth to be Biosphere 1, featured a desert, a mangrove forest, a 9,000 square-foot ocean with its own coral reef, and a savannah grassland; its eight inhabitants were expected to cultivate their own food and drink, and to maintain livable atmospheric conditions of oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p> <p>Spaceship Earth reveals how this idealistic ambition \u2013 funded, in this case, by Ed Bass, a philanthropic billionaire from Texas oil money \u2013 stemmed from decades of challenging, idiosyncratic work by a counter-cultural group known as the Synergia Ranch. Wolf pieces together early footage of the so-called Synergists, founded in 1969 by ecologist and certified metallurgist John Allen in the height of San Francisco\u2019s hippy days. The Synergists, as the film\u2019s genuinely remarkable archival footage illustrates, thrived on the convivial and industrious energy of their collective, morphing from Jester-style theater to communal ranch to building their own ship (!) on which to sail around the world.</p> <p>Synergist projects ranged from theater to ecology to architecture and science, \u201cbut at the end of the day, they were experimental people, they were adventurers\u201d, said Wolf, who \u201cdefy the typical categories of hippies because they\u2019re counter-cultural people who identify as capitalists\u201d. Allen, in particular, cultivated powerful financial interests such as Bass to fund their increasingly ambitious, science-fiction inspired projects. (The name \u201cSpaceship Earth\u201d comes from the Buckminster Fuller book Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, which partially inspired Biosphere 2, as well as the futurist ride at Disneyworld\u2019s Epcot theme park).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"58ef458ca919fae6a1045eaadd19d2ed8fa7ccc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ef458ca919fae6a1045eaadd19d2ed8fa7ccc9/0_0_1996_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In the mid-80s, when sustainability and the pressing threat of global warming were far from mainstream concepts, Synergists found in Bass a partner in their mission to build a self-sustaining, miniature world. (Wolf, who said he intended for the film to focus on the Biospherians and not later conflicts over management of the Biosphere, did not invite Bass to participate; he does, however, interview John Allen, who served as executive chairman of Biosphere 2 during the early 90s). The $200m-plus investigation into self-sufficiency recalled, Biospherians say in the film, the frontier explorers of the past.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very intoxicating, that kind of idealism and rhetoric,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cAnd it proved not to translate in the mainstream media context.\u201d Wolf incorporates news clips from the early 90s, which reveal a fixation on the project\u2019s utopian ideals and counter-cultural background. Several reports from the time presented a duality for the project \u2013 science or spectacle? \u2013 as if the project couldn\u2019t be both, or a harbinger of future scientific attention grabs such as Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. One former researcher on the project called Biosphere 2, in an television interview, \u201ctrendy ecological entertainment\u201d (to prove the point, Wolf includes footage of two Biospherians mud wrestling before a crowd, peering through the glass with their home cameras).</p> <p>\u201cI think one of the fatal flaws of the project is that they called it an experiment, and that comes with the baggage of academic expectations for science,\u201d Wolf said. Biosphere 2, he believes, was \u201ca different kind of science, a whole-systems or total system approach\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/06/spaceship-earth-biosphere-2-documentary\">Spaceship Earth review \u2013 intriguing Biosphere 2 documentary lacks insight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the time, the conversation around Biosphere 2\u2019s work was \u201clargely dismissive\u201d, said Wolf. \u201cThey had been dubbed failures and in most senses their life\u2019s work had been discounted.\u201d The fact that people often associated Biosphere 2 with the 1996 comedy Biodome with Paulie Shore, \u201cis in some senses a tragedy, given the scope and the ambition of this project\u201d. Still, \u201cwhat\u2019s appealing about Biosphere 2 is the spectacle and theatricality of it,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cThis is a futurist project, and that is outside the realm of traditional science. We see it more in the dotcom sector now, in people like Elon Musk and others who are \u2018disruptors\u2019 outside of conventional or mainstream institutions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"301e87a63437ade50017b06dc61a377045319dc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/301e87a63437ade50017b06dc61a377045319dc7/0_0_6577_4530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"689\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The final third of the film, in which the Biosphere 2 experiment encounters public criticism for its management\u2019s unnecessary secrecy, fracturing management relations and financial hemorrhaging, introduces a surprising new leader: a famous figure from the Trump administration who wrings Biosphere\u2019s idealism for profit, in one of several uneasy seedlings of the present. (It goes without saying that a film primarily about eight people trapped, albeit voluntarily, in a confined space for months on end has some \u2026 parallels to spring 2020). \u201cThe takeover of Biosphere 2 is analogous to what you could call the takeover of Biosphere 1,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cWe live in a time in which the political powers that be are sabotaging our ability to live sustainably on the planet through insidious policies.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s environmental deregulation, the (pre-corona) booming fossil fuel industries, but also the American gospel of profit maximization, which the Synergists could only escape for so long. The group\u2019s goal to make economically and ecologically viable projects was \u201cnot economically sustainable\u201d, said Wolf, who sees Biosphere 2 as a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d of \u201cthis fantasy of industry and environmentalism coming together to protect our future\u201d.</p> <p>Cautionary tale and imperfect experiment it may be, Wolf said he still hopes viewers \u201cfeel inspired by a group of people who literally reimagined a world\u201d, and whose personal transformation in isolation \u201cwill be useful for viewers today who are now, like the Biospherians, quarantined\u201d.</p> <p>Biosphere 2 demonstrates that \u201cthe model of small groups coalescing around common goals is viable,\u201d said Wolf, but with a balance: \u201cAs we re-enter the world with a certain determination to take new approaches, there are limitations to that idealism because of pervasive forces of capitalism and politics.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Spaceship Earth is available on Hulu and to rent elsewhere from 8 May in the US with a UK date yet to be announced</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>In a way, Britain should have been the country best prepared for the devastating impact of Covid-19 on the economy, because throughout 2019 barely a day went past without someone popping up to warn of the dangers of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/11/brexit-ultras-triumph-neoliberalism\">cliff-edge Brexit</a>.</p> <p>But there are cliff edges and then there\u2019s falling off the cliff, and not even the most pessimistic remainer would have been willing to predict what has happened since the UK went into lockdown at the end of March. While most of the attention has been focused \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 on the medical emergency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/blindsided-how-coronavirus-felled-the-global-economy-in-100-days\">the economy has collapsed</a>.</p> <p>This week, figures released by HM Revenue and Customs showed that more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/04/over-a-fifth-of-british-employees-furloughed-in-last-fortnight\">six million jobs</a> had been furloughed under the government\u2019s wage subsidy scheme, getting on for a quarter of all British employees. In April 2019, there were 67,873 sales of cars to private buyers; last month <a href=\"https://www.pistonheads.com/news/general-pistonheads/uk-new-car-registrations-down-97-3-per-cent/42366\">there were 871</a>, a drop of 99% to a level last seen in 1946.

Parts of the country with relatively few cases of Covid-19 tend to be among the prettiest and attract the highest numbers of tourists. It is going to be an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-tourism-hotspots-could-face-worst-of-post-lockdown-job-losses\">anxious summer</a> for the hoteliers and restaurateurs of Cornwall, the Lake District and the Scottish Highlands.</p> <p>In the past, recessions have tended to be concentrated in one part of the economy. In the early 1980s it was manufacturing; in the early 1990s it was housing; and in 2008 it was the financial sector. This time it is everything at once, which is why the current slump is, by some distance, the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/07/britain-recessions-history\">severe in recent history</a>.</p> <p>If a full lockdown is kept in place until the end of June, national output is likely to fall by a third between the first and second quarters of 2020. If, as expected, there is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/05/longer-lockdown-for-over-70s-would-allow-fewer-restrictions-for-rest-of-uk-scientists-suggest\">modest relaxation of the rules</a> later this month, the reduction in activity may be limited to the 25% reduction being pencilled in by the Bank.

The tentative evidence from <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/road-traffic-rise-london-coronavirus-lockdown-orders-a4425471.html\">traffic congestion</a> and job listings suggests that the economy hit the foot of the cliff in the middle of last month. April truly was the cruellest month.</p> <p>That said, there is little sign that the economy is going to bounce back rapidly. Most people can notice that there is a bit more going on: a few more cars on the streets; a construction site that has reopened; a bar doing off sales. But there is going to be no snapback of the sort that <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/03/26/coronavirus-may-end-reinvigorating-economy-not-destroying/\">some were predicting</a> back in March.</p> <p>The risk of a second wave of infection means that the lockdown restrictions will only be lifted gradually, and that process will prove too slow for hundreds of thousands of businesses that are burning through their cash and will go bust within a few months.</p> <p>Some of the biggest sectors of the economy \u2013 hospitality, retail, transport and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/02/can-i-get-a-refund-is-travels-biggest-issue-coronavirus-travel-questions-answered\">travel</a> among them \u2013 are going to be affected for a long time to come.

The government has spent the past couple of months warning people of the dangers of leaving their homes and it is going to be a while before they can be persuaded it is safe to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/19/will-britains-restaurants-survive-coronavirus\">have a meal in a restaurant</a>, even if the tables are kept two metres apart. A snapback in the economy would require consumers to blow all the cash they have been unable to spend for the past two months, and that seems improbable.</p> <p>Since late March, the government has been injecting vast amounts of stimulus into the economy. Interest rates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/19/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-to-all-time-low-of-01\">have been cut</a>, money has been created, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/uk-triples-coronavirus-response-fund-for-nhs-and-public-services\">spending on the NHS</a> has been increased, wages <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">have been subsidised</a>, incomes of the self-employed have been topped up, loans to businesses have been underwritten. The speed at which the package was put together has meant that it is far from perfect, but two things are absolutely certain: without action by the state, Britain would be on course for an unemployment rate of 15% or so htis year rather than the 9% the Bank is projecting; and the cost would have to be met one way or another.</p> <p>Rishi Sunak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/rishi-sunak-preparing-to-wind-down-furlough-scheme-from-july\">is already worried</a> about how much he is having to borrow to subsidise 80% of wages up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month, which the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates costs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e77d3267-21f5-4369-bf08-0cf0f31ae3ff\">\u00a314bn for every month</a> it is in operation. The chancellor says the UK can\u2019t indefinitely spend as much each month on wage subsidies as on the NHS.</p> <p>Yet these are strong drugs the Treasury has been administering \u2013 and weaning businesses off them is not going to be easy. Sunak will announce his plans for the phase-out of wage subsidies next week but imagine he says that from July the government will only pay 60% of the wages for furloughed workers and that the cap is being reduced from \u00a32,500 to \u00a32,000 a month. Some businesses will benefit from a sugar rush of spending as the public celebrates being released from lockdown, but many will not and will start to lay off workers who have previously been furloughed. Those that remain on the top-up scheme at the reduced rate will experience a cut in their pay, reducing their spending power.</p> <p>As the dole queues inevitably start to lengthen, even those fortunate enough to have escaped a cut in wages will get anxious. They will save more and spend less for fear that they could soon lose their jobs as well.</p> <p>All of which means that the government needs to act with extreme care. One of the lessons of the last recession was that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/budget-2010-vat-austerity-plan\">austerity measures</a> were imposed too quickly and recovery was choked off, and the stakes are much higher this time. Whether or not there is a second wave of infections there is certainly the risk of a second wave of acute economic distress starting in the autumn. The psychological impact of Covid-19 on consumer behaviour meant it was never realistic for the UK to have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/prepare-for-the-coronavirus-global-recession\">V-shaped recession</a>.

  "<p>Rashid Khalidi\u2019s account of Jewish settlers\u2019 conquest of Palestine is informed and passionate. It pulls no punches in its critique of Jewish-Israeli policies (policies that have had wholehearted US support after 1967), but it also lays out the failings of the Palestinian leadership. Khalidi participated in this history as an activist scion of a leading Palestinian family: in Beirut during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and as part of the Palestinian negotiating team prior to the 1995 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. He slams Israel but his is also an elegy for the Palestinians, for their dispossession, for their failure to resist conquest. It is a relentless story of Jewish-Israeli bad faith, alongside one of Palestinian corruption and political short-sightedness.<br><br>Khalidi sets out his stall early on: the Palestine-Israel war was never one between two national movements contesting equally over the same land but was always a \u201csettler colonial conquest\u201d by Europe-based Zionists whose founding father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/apr/05/antisemitic-attacks-hungary-israel\">Theodor Herzl</a>, laid bare the project to Khalidi\u2019s great-great-great uncle in 1899: Palestine\u2019s indigenous population did not matter and would anyway benefit from the modernising effects of Jewish \u201cpioneers\u201d, such as America with its westward Manifest Destiny. For Khalidi, Jewish settlers, aided by Britain from 1917, and by the US later on, colonised Palestine, creating and securing Israel through six \u201cwars\u201d:<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/01/arthur-balfour-declaration-100-years-of-suffering-britain-palestine-israel\"> the Balfour declaration</a> of 1917; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/27/guardian190-partition-palestine-alistair-cooke-1947\">1947 UN partition plan</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/26/israel-resolution-242\">1967 UN security council resolution 242</a>; the 1982 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2013/jan/04/lebanon-israel-palestinians-thatcher-reagan\">Israeli invasion of Lebanon</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine\">1993 Oslo peace accords</a>; and Israeli leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/29/israel\">Ariel Sharon\u2019s Temple Mount visit </a>in 2000.<br><br>Palestinian leaders from elite notables in the 1930s to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/yasser-arafat\"> Yasser Arafat and PLO-Fatah</a> in the 60s to Hamas never successfully channelled the people\u2019s passion to resist. This is not to \u201cblame the victim\u201d. Khalidi points to the huge obstacles in the way: in Britain and later the US, Protestant Christians bought into this \u201ccolonial war\u201d to \u201ccivilise\u201d the native population. There is a useful tension here between colonial superstructure and the patriarchal hierarchy and cronyism underpinning Palestinian elite leadership.

The Jews needed an \u201ciron wall\u201d of bayonets. British rule after the first world war supported settlement until 1939 when, on the eve of another global conflict, London changed tack to garner wider Arab support. The British defeated a widespread revolt by Palestinians in 1936, in which their elites emblematically fought among themselves as they did against external enemies. There was no Irish-style D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, no nascent branches of government, and no centralised military forces to outwit the British. Britain crushed Palestinian resistance, doing the Jewish state-builders\u2019 work for them. As Israel came into being in 1948, the Palestinian negotiator with the UN didn\u2019t even have a secretary. Many senior Israeli leaders came from America, knew the place, and spoke its language. In 1947, no senior Palestinian leader had lived in or visited the US.<br><br>Khalidi takes the reader through the long, hard years after 1948 when Israel (and neighbouring Arab states) screwed down the Palestinians. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/30/israel-six-day-war-film-censored-voices\">The six-day war</a>, as America struggled in Vietnam, was a hinge event, turning the US to Israel as its prime ally against Soviet-backed Arab regimes. While presidents such as Eisenhower and Kennedy were willing to stand up to Israel, after 1967 \u2013 except Bush Snr and secretary of state James Baker \u2013 the rest fell into line. Khalidi lays out remarkable exchanges between US and Israeli officials (including a thrusting young Benjamin Netanyahu) in which the US rolled over. <br><br>Palestinian resistance endured, helped by the law of unintended consequences: Israel\u2019s crushing of Egypt in 1967 boosted the PLO, while the 1982 Lebanon invasion prompted the 1987 intifada. Israel unintentionally resurrected Palestinian resistance by its heavy-handed actions. Arafat looms large in the book\u2019s final chapters, and not to his credit. He started as he meant to continue, by cheating in student elections as a young man in Cairo. The peace after 1993 brought Arafat into Israel, where it monitored and controlled him. Nothing changed. Fatah militants who had spent time in Israeli jails tortured Hamas detainees. The Greater Israel settlement project on the West Bank continued apace, Israel arguing that Palestinians neither wanted peace nor accepted Israel, a point Khalidi contests.<br><br>The Palestinians have belied David Ben Gurion\u2019s reputed comment that \u201cthe old will die and the young will forget\u201d. Short of another bout of ethnic cleansing, Israel is burdened with a resentful, growing, non-Jewish population. The solution is meaningful dialogue, but this requires political will.

  "<p>Ryan Gauld wasn\u2019t short of suitors when seeking a transfer from Sporting Lisbon last summer, proving reputations such as his linger. The Scot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/07/dundee-united-ryan-gauld-messi\" title=\"\">dubbed \u201cMini Messi\u201d as a teenager</a> might have been expected to board the first flight out of Portugal but he had other ideas. Gauld took the path to Farense, a little-fancied club in the second tier who have defied consensus by earning promotion courtesy of a season abandonment confirmed on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cI felt like I hadn\u2019t accomplished everything I wanted to here,\u201d Gauld says from his home in Vilamoura. \u201cI would have been leaving without showing to everyone what I can do. I wanted to stick around and prove myself.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m looked at as a player who had talent but hasn\u2019t really shown it yet. They have reason to think that because there were high expectations when I went to Sporting; I was destined for great things. I have always done all I could to make things work out but they didn\u2019t go as planned. I\u2019m a bit young yet to write myself off \u2013 there is still time. I wanted to get back to the first division here to prove a point.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, Gauld sounds comfortable in his own skin and happy. \u201cI\u2019ve managed 23-24 games on the trot without injury. It\u2019s my longest spell of consecutive 90 minutes, most goals, longest time with no injuries and that\u2019s exactly what I was needing.\u201d</p> <p>Gauld\u2019s earlier rise makes \u201crapid\u201d appear an understatement. The Messi comparisons came after he broke through at Dundee United as a 16-year-old in 2012. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/02/ryan-gauld-sporting-lisbon-60m-buy-out-clause\" title=\"\">Sporting</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/02/ryan-gauld-sporting-lisbon-60m-buy-out-clause\" title=\"\">paid \u00a33m for</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/02/ryan-gauld-sporting-lisbon-60m-buy-out-clause\" title=\"\">him two years later</a> on a six\u2011year deal with a \u20ac60m exit clause.

The actual name didn\u2019t bother me, it was just when people read that they judged me a little quicker and expected more.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time I read it I was laughing; John and Andy cut it out the paper and stuck it in my room. I was 17, delighted to be playing football every day and in such a good United team. I had nothing to complain about.\u201d</p> <p>Of those flatmates John is Souttar, now of Hearts; Andy is a certain Robertson, who needs no introduction. Gauld laughs when contemplating whether he envisaged Robertson\u2019s journey to Champions League winner with Liverpool. \u201cTo begin with probably not because he was this wee quiet boy who came in for a pre-season. We didn\u2019t have a left-back, Barry Douglas had just left, so [United manager] Jackie McNamara took in Andy and Graham Carey on trial.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9f6f800190b7b0ed9b31b3d110775fa990046c91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f6f800190b7b0ed9b31b3d110775fa990046c91/342_0_1938_3512/552.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Gauld in action for Dundee United in 2013.\" width=\"552\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Gauld in action for Dundee United in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Holmes/PA Archive/Press Association Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe all thought: \u2018Graham Carey is quite a well-known player in the SPL, as long as he does well he\u2019ll be signing.\u2019 Graham had a good pre\u2011season but we went to Germany, played a couple of games and Jackie told Andy he would be our left-back. He developed incredibly from the start of that season to the end and has just kept rising. It\u2019s as if he will never stop developing. There isn\u2019t much else for him to accomplish in his career but nothing would change the boy he is. We still keep in touch.\u201d</p> <p>Gauld\u2019s experience doesn\u2019t look especially unusual: injuries, competition for places, changes of coach and ineffectual loans hampered his development. The difference with him was simple; people in Scotland, desperate for a global star, noted every setback.</p> <p>\u201cThere was still a lot of expectation over here because it wasn\u2019t often Sporting would pay a lot of money for a young player. So people expected big things. I soon realised the B team and junior team was full of brilliant 17\u2011 and 18\u2011year\u2011olds. They already have that level of in-house talent.</p> <p>\u201cThe hardest thing was people in Scotland and England expected things to happen straight away, that I would walk into the team. Sporting\u2019s midfield three at the time all won the 2016 Euros with Portugal \u2013 Adrien Silva, William Carvalho, Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio \u2013 and played big parts in that. I don\u2019t think people understood how hard it would be for me but I gave it all I could; I have no regrets.</p> <p>\u201cMy first season was my best. At 18 I was playing the League Cup games, got a few goals, coming off the bench. At the time I thought it was a great start but there was a change of manager that summer and the new one didn\u2019t fancy me.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a gradual thing. I spent two years in the B team, then was out on loan but got called back because Sporting took the huff with the team I was at. Then I was chucked back into the B team and started thinking: \u2018It\u2019s maybe not going to work here.\u2019 The next pre\u2011season, I was quickly sent to the group that wasn\u2019t needed or wanted by the manager.\u201d</p> <p>If Messi was Gauld\u2019s supposed parallel, Cristiano Ronaldo is the Lisbon poster boy. Sporting developed the forward before his sale to Manchester United. \u201cAny time a young boy breaks into the first team, they don\u2019t want to say anything but they are hoping it can happen again,\u201d Gauld says. \u201cYou can\u2019t put that pressure on a kid \u2013 trying to play catch-up with a guy like Ronaldo won\u2019t do you much good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nowadays Gauld can typically be found as a narrow left-sided midfielder \u2013 \u201cnot a winger\u201d \u2013 in a 4-4-2. Lockdown has afforded him a chance to assess how his game has improved since leaving Scotland. \u201cI\u2019m more of a complete player, certainly without the ball. United have been putting up old games on YouTube and I\u2019ve been watching. I feel sorry for John Rankin and Paul Paton, having to do all my defending.\u201d</p> <p>Farense, now defined as runners-up in LigaPro, have enjoyed the benefits of Gauld\u2019s maturity and hunger. He finished the season as their top scorer. \u201cPersonally and collectively this [stoppage] came at a bad time. Not that it was a good time for anyone, but it was frustrating,\u201d he says.

But once land is converted to human use, the probability increases of contact and viruses jumping zoonotically from one species to another.</p> \n<p>As natural habitats shrink, wild animals concentrate in ever smaller territories or migrate to anthropogenic areas, such as homes, sheds and barns. This is particularly true of bats, which feed on the large number of insects drawn to lamplight or fruit in orchards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Two years ago, scientists <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5904276/\">predicted</a> a new coronavirus would emerge from bats in Asia, partly because this was the area most affected by deforestation and other environmental pressures.</p> \n<p>One of the authors, Roger Frutos, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Montpellier, said multiple studies have confirmed the density and variety of bat-borne viruses is higher near human habitation.</p> \n<p>\u201cHumans destroy the bats\u2019 natural environment and then we offer them alternatives.

Bats also need to pass the disease on to humans. There is no evidence of this being done directly for coronaviruses. Until now there has been an intermediary \u2013 either a domesticated animal or a wild animal which humans came into contact with for food, trade, pets or medicine. In the 2003 Sars outbreak in China, it was a civet cat. In the Mers outbreak in the Middle East in 2012, it was a camel. Scientists are not yet certain of the animal for Covid-19, though Frutos said initial theories that a pangolin was the intermediary now seem less likely.</p> \n<p>In a soon-to-be-published paper in <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.00223/full\">Frontiers in Medicine</a>, Frutos and his co-authors argue the key to containing future epidemics is not to fear the wild, but to recognise that human activities are responsible for the emergence and propagation of the zoonosis. \u201cThe focus must be on these human activities because they can be properly organised,\u201d notes the paper titled, the Conjunction of Events Leading to the Pandemic and Lessons to Learn for Future Threats.</p> \n<p>Scientists have detected about 3,200 different strains of coronavirus in bats. Most are harmless to humans, but two very closely related sarbecoviruses found in east Asia were responsible for Sars and Covid-19. The paper says future sarbecovirus emergence will certainly take place in east Asia, but epidemics of other new diseases could be triggered elsewhere.</p> \n<p>South America is a key area of concern due to the rapid clearance of the Amazon and other forests. Scientists in Brazil have found viral prevalence was 9.3% among bats near deforested sites, compared to 3.7% in pristine woodland. \u201cWith deforestation and land-use change, you open a door,\u201d said Alessandra Nava, of the Manaus-based Biobank research centre.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5051874133066b8a1e2898f5231c456d8233c3fd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5051874133066b8a1e2898f5231c456d8233c3fd/7_0_1639_2048/800.jpg\" alt=\"Civet cat in a cage\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The virus that caused the 2003 Sars outbreak in China came from bats via a civet cat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hilton/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She said diseases were naturally diluted in the wild, but this broke down when humans rapidly disrupted the ecological balance. As a local example, she pointed to Lyme disease, which has spread to humans through capybaras. Some municipalities are culling the giant rodents to prevent contagion, but Nava said this was not necessary in pristine forests that still had jaguars. \u201cYou don\u2019t find Lyme disease in areas with jaguars because they keep the capybara numbers in check,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe problem is when you put different species that aren\u2019t naturally close to one another in the same environment. That allows virus mutations to jump to other species,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to think about how we treat wild animals and nature. Right now we deal with them far too promiscuously.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her conclusions were echoed by Tierra Smiley Evans, an epidemiologist at the University of California who studies virus distributions in the rapidly degrading forests of Myanmar. She has found that endangered or threatened species are more likely to have viruses than animals at lower risk of habitat loss and hunting. She said the connection between environmental stress and human health had been made more apparent by Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that one of the most positive things to come out of horrible tragedy will be the realisation that there is a link between how we treat the forest and our wellbeing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really impacts our health.

A recent Greenpeace <a href=\"https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/04/24/deforestation-amazon-next-pandemic-covid-coronavirus/\">report </a>warned the Amazon could see the next spillover of zoonotic viruses because the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, is putting a higher priority on opening up the forest than protecting people\u2019s health.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable.

  "<p>When lockdown started, I was confused by bodies on television. Why weren\u2019t they socially distancing? Didn\u2019t they know not to be so close? The injunction to be separate was unfamiliar and irregular, and for me, self-isolating alone, following this government directive was peculiar. It made watching dramas and programmes produced under normal filming conditions feel jarring.</p> <p>Seven weeks in, the disjuncture has passed. I, like all of us, am accommodating to multiple corporeal realities: bodies alone, bodies distant, bodies in the park to be avoided, bodies of disobedient youths hanging out in groups, bodies in lines outside shops, bodies and voices flattened on screens and above all, bodies of dead health workers and carers. Black bodies, brown bodies. Working-class bodies. Bodies not normally praised, now being celebrated.</p> <p>We are learning a whole new etiquette of bodies. We swerve around each other, hop into the near-empty street, calculate distances at entrances to parks, avoid body contact, even eye contact, and keep a look out for those obliviously glued to their phones, whose lack of attention threatens to breach the two-metre rule. It\u2019s odd and disconcerting and isn\u2019t quite second nature.</p> <p>Until the pandemic arrived, many of us were finding texting, email and Whatsapp more suitable to our speeded-up lives. But now we are coming to reuse the telephone, and to enjoy the sounds in our ears and the rhythm of conversation, instead of feeling rushed and interrupted. A few of my sessions as a psychoanalyst are now conducted on the phone but, for the most part, I am spending my time looking into a screen, and seeing faces rather than whole bodies. Until I learned to turn off the view of myself, I, like others, was disconcerted by the oddness of catching sight of myself \u2013 a view I don\u2019t think we are meant to see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee3ce8ae73dc3e0c4a544cc42f6030d59f87154f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee3ce8ae73dc3e0c4a544cc42f6030d59f87154f/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neighbours social distancing in Syracuse, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neighbours social distancing in Syracuse, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maranie Staab/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conversations in therapy defy many of the customs of social intercourse. There are silences, repetitions, reframings, links across time, reminiscences of fragments, rushes of emotion, shards of dreams, things told and then disavowed. There can be fidgeting or absolute stillness. These form the idiosyncratic and personal ambience between each therapeutic couple. As a therapist, I am also alert to how the dilemmas that beset the person or the couple I am seeing are brought to our relationship.</p> <p>The conundrums that brought the person to seek therapy in the first place can be replayed right here. For example, a person fearful of intimacy can experience the therapy relationship or the therapist as too close. Someone else who worries they are too needy may be reluctant to show their longings directly to the therapist, although well able to talk about how things go wrong for them in other relationships. The therapy relationship and the sessions are our petri dish. The field of study is the human subject (and her, his or their ways of being able to develop and change).</p> <p>The therapist works to understand an individual\u2019s personal psychological grammar \u2013 to help the person take the risk of unlearning and then learning anew, finding ways to not be in so much hurt. So too with the body. Those with troubled bodies bring them to the session. They may sit too close, for example, or seem to be concave, or dress incongruously, as though presenting a different persona in each session. In the course of therapy, such an abject body experience can be addressed, and, in unlearning and then learning anew, the person finds a more comfortable way to sit in their body.</p> <p>How is the dematerialisation of bodies affecting us and going to affect us? Me, my patients, you \u2013 all of us? For some of my patients, their screen or home is a prison. Their experience is full of woe and worry. Therapy keeps them just about on the border of sane, but it\u2019s a sanity that hurts: isolation can maraud all of us as we miss the interactions, intimate or casual, that confirm our sense of our value, our place in our community, our work and the world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Some of my clinical preoccupations centre on how we acquire a physical, corporeal sense of self. Although psychoanalysis is a theory of mind and body, its main emphasis has drifted to the development of the mind and its structures: what we call defences, and the relationship patterns we have absorbed. Bodies have been very much the bit player to the main drama of the mind, even when mental processes or disturbance have resulted in bodily symptoms such as eczema or a non-biologically induced paralysis. As therapists, we traditionally read back into the mind the troubles visited on the body, seeing them as the result of mental conflicts. And of course, they often are, but I have long been keen to understand body troubles and body difficulties in their own terms, and to build a theory about the development of the body.</p> <p>Bodies have always been bound and marked by social rules. Different societies make different sense out of similar bodily actions or gestures. The variety of body adornment and transformations around the world, from rings around the neck to the recent upsurge in labial reductions and penis enlargements, has made it ever more apparent that the body is not simply the product of DNA. The body we inhabit develops within relationships to other bodies. Usually it is within the maternal orbit where, to take an obvious example, we first apprehend gender-based forms of comportment. When I grew up, being told to sit like a girl and not to climb trees were some of the ways we were treated differently to boys. Research across many cultures show that baby girls are weaned and potty-trained earlier, fed less at each feed, and held less, than boys. There may be no biological basis to this, but rather a social, unconscious basis that then informs how we personally experience our particular embodiment.</p> <p>We have very few verified reports of humans growing up outside of human culture but the feral child Victor of Aveyron, who was discovered living wild in the woods of southern France in 1800, did not have body movements that were recognisably human. The body-to-body relationship that was foundational for him was with the bodies of the wolves he apparently grew up among. He seemingly mimicked their gait and moves, their posture and their vocalisations. Of course, we know this more familiarly, and less dramatically, from when youngsters develop their group identities by adopting the mannerisms of film actors or musicians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"147b2555952e97f1b55a6ddbb4ed6162dcd0d1f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/147b2555952e97f1b55a6ddbb4ed6162dcd0d1f3/540_836_4605_2594/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Social distancing during the opening of the Dragon\u2019s Heart hospital in Cardiff last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Social distancing during the opening of the Dragon\u2019s Heart hospital in Cardiff last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Through screens, billboards and photoshopped images, we reduce the wide variety of bodily expression.

The digitised, westernised body image predominates, and in the last two decades has spawned a cosmetic surgery industry worldwide \u2013 from leg-lengthening surgery using steel rods in China (now banned), to rhinoplasty in Iran (which has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/mar/01/beauty-obsession-iran-cosmetic-surgery?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">highest rate</a> of nose surgery per capita in the world) to double-eyelid surgery and jawbone reduction in South Korea. In the west, surgeons resculpt cheekbones, breasts and calves, and offer day procedures for facial \u2018thread lifts\u2019. Cosmetic surgery tourism hubs in Hungary, South Korea and Singapore were thriving until the lockdown.</p> <p>One Chinese smartphone app allows the selfie-taker to adjust their portrait to bring it closer to a very specific standard of beauty known as <em>wang hon lian,</em> or \u201cinternet celebrity face\u201d. It\u2019s very popular: billions of wang hon lian images are uploaded every month.</p> <p>The richest Europeans are not in tech, but in the business of beautifying bodies \u2013 the owners of fashion, luxury and cosmetics brands such as LVMH, L\u2019Oreal and Zara. Increasing automation has led us to move from using our bodies to make things to turning our bodies the site and the product of our labour, through diet and exercise regimes, clothing and cosmetics. The surface body is meant to be on display.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the sweating, smelling, holding, stroking body of the other becomes, for those socially distancing, too distant \u2013 while for others, such as those sharing a house with teenage boys, it\u2019s all too present. All is on show for families and housemates, while all is hidden for those living alone during lockdown.</p> <p>The experience of the body on FaceTime or Zoom contrasts with the pulsing, breathing, weeping, sighing, tired, achy or indeed springy and enthusiastic bodies we inhabit. We no longer have social communion in the flesh, the handshake or the hug, the pleasure of eating in a restaurant with a friend or lover while seated near strangers. Afraid of infection, for our protection, we collapse our social space.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>During the second world war, the psychiatrist Ren\u00e9 Spitz studied orphan babies in care. He discovered that those closest to the nurses\u2019 station thrived, while those at the end of the ward did not do so well. The difference was touch: the nurses would casually touch and interact with those closest to them, and this gave those infants the essential food for physical and psychological development. They absorbed the will to live. A decade later \u2013 in research now considered controversial for the way in which he removed baby monkeys from their mothers \u2013 the American psychologist <a href=\"https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/harlows-classic-studies-revealed-the-importance-of-maternal-contact.html\" title=\"\">Harry Harlow discovered</a> that baby monkeys given ersatz mothers in the form of basic cloth puppets would find some crucial security and comfort even in this simulation of maternal touch; those baby monkeys deprived of any kind of maternal touch at all became highly disturbed, and many died.</p> <p>Touch, feel and proximity are central to survival. Consider the genius of premature infants\u2019 capacity to regulate their own and, extraordinarily, their parent\u2019s body temperature, if they are <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/12578-kangaroo-care\" title=\"\">held skin-to-skin in a pouch</a>. The gaze \u2013 the search to be seen, to recognise and to influence the other \u2013 is also crucial to human subjectivity. In <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/ed-tronick-and-the-8220-still-face-experiment-8221/\" title=\"\">a fascinating video</a> made by the developmental psychologist Edward Tronick, he instructs a mother playing with her baby to keep a still face and refrain from interacting with her infant for a minute or two. We observe as the infant girl seeks to engage the mother. When she is unable to, the baby collapses psychologically and physically until contact is restored. What is so shocking is how fast the collapse is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been thinking of how impossibly difficult and challenging our quasi-dematerialised life through the Zoom screen is, whether chatting with friends or being in a meeting. Conflict and harmony become cartoonish as subtle gestures collapse and the conversations we have with our eyes are shut down.</p> <p>Reading each other well enough is a new skill in the therapy room, too, for both people. By now we are used to the screens and the telephone, and the occasional technical blips. We are seeing a physical interior \u2013 a study, bedroom, shed or kitchen, and being surprised by an occasional child that floats in. We hear the suddenly hushed voice of someone not wanting their partner to get a drift of the conversation we are having. It illuminates aspects we didn\u2019t see before. Is it better? No. Is it worse? Marginally. I miss noticing how people enter the therapy room \u2013 the subtle difference from the session before, or the way they may hold their face and body; above all, the animate body in the room. I suspect that I am more animated to make up for the loss of that precious physicality.</p> <p>Former hostages Terry Waite, John McCarthy and Brian Keenan have all written and spoken eloquently about solitary confinement and their struggles to find a way through and back \u2013 or should I say forward \u2013 to familial and social life. It was tough. And although many of us are not self-isolating alone, unless one is able to do interesting or valued work during this period, or have enough people to hang out with, we can expect considerable psychological difficulties to follow as we come out of lockdown. How will we re-establish social interaction with other bodies? What kind of rhythms will we want and be able to have going forward?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f7f6e5510591fc2fed7372dbecabfaf0b09a152\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f7f6e5510591fc2fed7372dbecabfaf0b09a152/0_0_4860_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seating regulations inside a courtroom in Belgium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seating regulations inside a courtroom in Belgium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many have been ultra-busy with home schooling, working from home, managing three generations and so on. Time has bent and contracted in perplexing ways. Busyness has increased for some, while others, for whom slowing down is a foreign concept, have had idleness forced on them. Empty time feels alien \u2013 or at least did at the beginning. For many it has been an unexpected pleasure. No need to rush to social occasions. No need to dress. No need to get everything done and more. Being wanted, being needed, being in demand have been psychological supports that have melted away. Finding new ways to nourish one\u2019s needs in this new reality \u2013 especially in the absence of touch and gaze, which we unknowingly rely upon to recognise ourselves \u2013 can be tricky.</p> <p>Today, there is a frightened, wary, social body. A body that is tense, in which avoidance is the watchword. The covered face, whether by a hoodie or a veil, which formerly some found challenging, now offers reassurance. Indeed, many public places \u2013 from Eurostar trains to the streets of New York, Prague, Dubai, Havana and many more \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/countries-wearing-face-masks-compulsory-200423094510867.html\" title=\"\">now demand it</a>. Meanwhile, much of society is now paying attention to bodies that had been scandalously overlooked. The bodies of working women, the carers who go in and out of the houses and homes of the people they look after. The faces of vast numbers of black, Asian and minority-ethnic bodies, particularly in the health service, who are finally being recognised for their value, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\" title=\"\">shockingly disproportionate</a> number of their losses. </p> <p>Before Covid-19, the ruling party were happy to slash social and health funding, to put money into management in the NHS, and not into professional carers, doctors and nurses. Now society is waking up to the value of care and medical expertise that comes from the hospital floor \u2013 that is to say, from the doctors and nurses who are reorganising what occurs there. The people keeping society going in every sector \u2013 transport workers, small shopkeepers, workers in food production and delivery \u2013 are often first-generation immigrants. More people are seeing a more nuanced social landscape. The opportunity is here for reframing how we represent the social body. It is of necessity differently hued, and that needs acknowledging, as does the shame of our previous marginalising. Covid-19 is cleaning the lens, so we can see more clearly.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>From the individual to the social body, and how it is being challenged by the pandemic, we turn to the corporate body \u2013 the body of state \u2013 and what we have been learning about how it has functioned. On 17 April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anthony-costello\" title=\"\">Prof </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anthony-costello\" title=\"\">Anthony Costello</a>, a former director of the Institute for Global Health at UCL, told the select committee on health and social care that he feared Britain might have the highest number of deaths in Europe, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\" title=\"\">now been confirmed</a>. Costello had estimated 40,000 deaths; on 5 May the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\" title=\"\">official UK death toll</a> was just over 32,000, but the Financial Times reported the same day that the true figure had likely <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e32ddbf7-0826-4cf7-9a73-18611eb29c23\" title=\"\">already surpassed</a> Costello\u2019s estimate. London and the north-west of England are showing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/north-west-overtakes-london-for-number-of-covid-19-hospital-cases-coronavirus\" title=\"\">higher rates</a> of death than other regions, while according to the ONS, people in the most deprived areas of England and Wales are dying at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/covid-19-deaths-twice-as-high-in-poorest-areas-in-england-and-wales\" title=\"\">twice the rate</a> of the most affluent areas.</p> <p>Costello argued for this figure because we were slow off the mark to take precautionary moves early on. He spoke to the chair of the committee, Jeremy Hunt, who has spent this period appearing to stress about the lack of testing, ventilators and PPE equipment. This is the same Hunt who, as the longest serving health secretary in British history, also had social care in his portfolio, and the pay of doctors, nurses and social care workers. Even more damningly, he was the minister in charge during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/matt-hancock-urged-to-publish-secret-review-of-pandemic-plans\" title=\"\">Exercise Cygnus</a>, the UK government\u2019s drill to test our preparedness for a pandemic, carried out in 2016.</p> <p>The full review of Exercise Cygnus has never been officially published, but leaks have revealed that it showed the UK\u2019s health system and local authorities were woefully unprepared for such an eventuality. The <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/exercise-cygnus-uncovered-pandemic-warnings-buried-government/\" title=\"\">exercise showed</a> hospitals and mortuaries being quickly overwhelmed, and shortages of critical care beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment for hospital staff. </p> <p>Cygnus, and other such exercises, are meant to show the government what they need to do to be prepared \u2013 which was not, as Hunt was doing, cutting beds. On 28 March of this year, when the Cygnus debacle came to light, we were told that the projections were not remedied because of worries that beds, ventilators and PPE would become outmoded or obsolete and that the government had worked on securing reliable supply chains. (As we have seen, in a pandemic, reliable supply chains become very quickly overwhelmed.) A 2018 Red Cross <a href=\"file:///Users/tomhughes/Downloads/NMCG-conference-report-2018.pdf\" title=\"\">conference report</a> on Cygnus and infectious diseases stated: \u201cThe financial and human cost of an outbreak can be staggering and early response reduces the cost.\u201d Our government chose not to act.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"82157f566147091157ba3fe6bf90b5cd147a8665\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82157f566147091157ba3fe6bf90b5cd147a8665/0_137_3303_1982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nursing staff applaud at a window inside the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nursing staff applaud at a window inside the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Fund for Peace, the Washington-based NGO that publishes the annual <a href=\"https://fragilestatesindex.org/\" title=\"\">Fragile States Index</a>, lists criteria for a failed state. I think we have come dangerously close to fulfilling two of their criteria: the inability to provide public services for the poor, and the inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community.</p> <p>As these last months\u2019 farcical developments show \u2013 the question about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/no-10-facing-fresh-calls-for-transparency-over-sage-pandemic-advice\" title=\"\">the independence</a> of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the alleged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/22/uk-government-accused-of-cover-up-over-eu-scheme-to-buy-ppe\" title=\"\">missing communications</a> with the EU on PPE, the political decision not to cooperate with the EU, the posting out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/north-west-overtakes-london-for-number-of-covid-19-hospital-cases-coronavirus\" title=\"\">tests</a> without return envelopes, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/not-fit-for-purpose-uk-medics-condemn-covid-19-protection\" title=\"\">expired dates</a> on PPE equipment \u2013 the government is in Fawlty Towers territory.</p> <p>Plans for British companies to design new ventilator machines, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f393d77-8e5b-4a85-b647-416efbc575ec\">detailed by the Financial Times</a>, went belly up. Our government chose to source new ideas rather build to the existing plan under licence. Why, one must ask? Could it be Brexit hubris?</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to contrast the UK\u2019s response with that of the EU, because the latter has not always <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\" title=\"\">covered itself in glory</a> during the pandemic. The ethics of cooperation in Europe and the ethics of transparency and honesty have been mightily tested in the past months. Perhaps now though we can be encouraged by the joint project of the European Investment Banks and WHO to bolster global healthcare systems. Will the UK state be contributing? I think not. So much depends on the actions of citizens now to move things forward. In this light, it is encouraging to see the formation of a new independent panel of experts \u2013 a \u201crival\u201d to Sage \u2013 led by the former UK government chief scientific adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/davidking\" title=\"\">David King</a>, whose deliberations are on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isnl93fvReY\" title=\"\">YouTube for us to watch</a>.</p> <p>I am not sure how we characterise the following failure of the state, because it is in part the expression of public good: of the 750,000 people who signed up to volunteer to help the NHS, invited by the government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/nhs-coronavirus-crisis-volunteers-frustrated-at-lack-of-tasks\" title=\"\">fewer than 100,000</a> have been deployed. As citizens, we want to contribute. This squandering of people\u2019s generosity is disturbing. Fortunately, people such as Capt Tom Moore or the many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/the-volunteers-making-ppe-on-the-homefront-for-uk-healthworkers-coronavirus\" title=\"\">making masks</a> and contributing 3D printers keep on going. And the programme <a href=\"https://www.feednhs.com/\" title=\"\">Feed NHS</a>, in which the restaurant chain Leon and other chefs are prepping to feed patients, doctors, nurses, hospital porters and ambulance workers, is now in train. This voluntary work, in which groups of people self-organise, is outstanding, and yet it is in contrast to the inability of our state to mobilise those who wanted to help.</p> <p>The Gates Foundation\u2019s contributions to seven different vaccine programmes, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey\u2019s donation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/twitter-chief-to-donate-quarter-of-his-fortune-to-coronavirus-fight\" title=\"\">$1bn</a>, are impressive. Will hedge funds in the UK such as Ruffer investment, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/hedge-funds-raking-in-billions-during-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">pocketed</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/hedge-funds-raking-in-billions-during-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">\u00a32.4bn in March</a>, or Somerset Capital (the fund Jacob Rees Mogg used to run) who see Covid-19 as a \u201conce or twice in a generation\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/05/rees-mogg-firm-accused-of-cashing-in-on-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">opportunity</a> for investment, make a contribution, too?</p> <p>There are several dozen UK-based hedge funds managing assets worth \u00a31bn or more. Could the mood of the country be such that hedge fund investors and managers might be persuaded to donate some of their obscene profits to the coronavirus response or to sponsor migrants from beyond Europe (who work here as cleaners, carers, drivers), who do not earn the \u00a330,000 currently demandedfor a work permit?</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Covid is a sad story. It is also a story of resilience. The body of state has failed us. We need to grow up and recognise that. Covid-19 has exposed unforgivable systemic failure. In the years leading up to this, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in the status of civil servants and a downgrading of health workers. We have seen teachers, doctors and academics hidebound in a managerial economy. At least it seems that micromanagement has been temporarily overturned in hospitals, thank goodness, because right now doctors and nurses need to be running the show.</p> <p>And to return to our bodies \u2013 the live ones, so many devoid of touch and gaze, facing a long period of isolation, and frightened. How can I conclude?</p> <p>In a way, I can\u2019t. We are far from the other side of this crisis. Psychological therapies are going to have a huge part to play in the remaking of body and soul. I don\u2019t much like the word trauma, because it has become so overused, but we are a society that is in trauma. A societal trauma gives opportunities for people to go through things together, rather than suffer alone, as long as we don\u2019t bury or make light of what we have experienced and continue to experience. We will have to find new ways to live with our fears and discomforts, to overcome Covid-minted social phobias, with what we project on to other people\u2019s bodies and the fears we have about our own vulnerabilities. We will need all the help we can get in reshaping our relationship to our own and each other\u2019s bodies, to find a way to build bonds of attachment and respect.</p> <p>What started with the dematerialisation of the individual body has now morphed into the dematerialisation of the body of state. The economist Joseph Stiglitz reminds us that, with the stripping back of the state under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, we lost capacity. This needs to be addressed. </p> <p>There is a lively debate from a range of economists on how to get to a more equitable economy. Moneyweek editor-in-chief Merryn Somerset Webb\u2019s call for a <a href=\"https://moneyweek.com/economy/uk-economy/601261/turn-the-covid-19-bailout-into-a-sovereign-wealth-fund\" title=\"\">sovereign</a> <a href=\"https://moneyweek.com/economy/uk-economy/601261/turn-the-covid-19-bailout-into-a-sovereign-wealth-fund\" title=\"\">wealth</a> <a href=\"https://moneyweek.com/economy/uk-economy/601261/turn-the-covid-19-bailout-into-a-sovereign-wealth-fund\" title=\"\">fund</a>, with the government owning shares in bailed-out companies, is interesting, as is political economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/the-promise-of-an-oxford-vaccine-reveals-how-a-new-britain-could-thrive\" title=\"\">Will Hutton\u2019s idea</a> of expanding the British Business Bank and the Future Fund.

We will have to do that again. Principally, we will need to recognise the contributions and the losses of the UK\u2019s minority and working-class people, above all. Our governments have shamed themselves through creating divisions in society, particularly since austerity was imposed under David Cameron\u2019s government. Now we have an unexpected chance to redress the divisive fallout of Brexit.</p> <p>The impact of remote working and the need to balance domestic and work life, allied with dire warnings on mass unemployment, gives us an opportunity to write a social contract in which we divide work more fairly. At both ends of the pay scale, people overwork. The evidence for a more balanced relationship between work and home is compelling.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, the outpourings of artists, musicians, programmers, cultural and scientific workers at all levels has been outstanding. The talent, the will, the desire is there to remake our world. The urgency is not in question. Globalism can\u2019t simply be a celebration of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d deliveries. It will need to be recast as mutuality \u2013 local and global mutuality \u2013 so that we learn from each other, including those who\u2019ve been in lockdown in war zones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/23/therapy-during-coronavirus-pandemic-lockdown-psychoanalysis-freud\">Therapy under lockdown: 'I\u2019m just as terrified as my patients are'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our institutions will need to be rebuilt with transparency, with heart and by learning from the people who have been staffing them, not just the managers and owners.

  "<p>It must be painful to be racist right now. Knowing that if you become sick, a black or brown person is highly likely to be involved in the hard, dangerous service of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/nhs-bosses-say-bame-staff-should-be-risk-assessed-to-cut-covid-19\">trying to save you</a>.

But we <em>have</em> been conditioned to erase the contribution of ethnic minorities to our national identity.</p> <p>The last time we were in a period of national crisis, a settlement \u2013 a social contract \u2013 was reached between the state and the British people. In 1945, in exchange for subjecting the civilian population to total war, the government offered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education\">the welfare state</a>.</p> <p>We eulogise this as the offer of housing, welfare and unemployment benefits, healthcare and legal aid. The British people had earned their entitlement to these benefits, which formed a foundational part of what it meant to be a citizen of this country.</p> <p>But there was one fundamental problem. The millions of Africans, Asians and other people who came to be regarded as \u201cethnic minorities\u201d (though they weren\u2019t a minority in the empire) \u2013 and who made both this wartime victory, and the new welfare state institutions possible \u2013 were not part of the story.</p> <p>And what followed shows that when you exclude people from the narrative, they become excluded in real life. The idea of being entitled to a share in Britishness, and its national wealth, erased the contribution of black, Asian and ethnic minority people. And, over the decades that followed, the breakdown of the social contract \u2013 as the state remorselessly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/08/austerity-kills-life-expectancy-standstill-britain\">cut back its spending</a> and stopped fulfilling its side of the bargain \u2013 was blamed on the presence of those visible, allegedly unentitled \u201coutsiders\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s beyond ironic that black and Asian people in Britain underpinned the creation of the institutions that so often define Britishness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jun/18/nhs60.nhs2\">not least the NHS</a>. Yet that same postwar era also laid the foundations for the inadequate access to healthcare, housing and secure labour that must be part of the reason why minorities are so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/01/why-bame-people-may-be-more-at-risk-from-coronavirus-video-explainer\">disproportionately affected</a> by today\u2019s coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Britain has long needed a new social contract, a new consensual agreement between the government and the governed, that sets out updated values and expectations. Maybe now \u2013 as even a Conservative government is forced to be radically redistributive, with conditional bailouts offering the prospect of more fiscally and socially responsible business, and the NHS becoming an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/pots-pans-passion-britons-clap-their-support-for-nhs-workers-again\">emotional part of Britain\u2019s identity</a> once more \u2013 we might get one.</p> <p>The difference between this moment and the social contract of 75 years ago, is that this time the service and sacrifice of ethnic minority people in Britain is impossible to ignore. It\u2019s clear that racial injustice deserves a central place in our new settlement.</p> <p>Yet despite this, black and Asian individuals with questionable positions on racial justice have suddenly found themselves promoted. Munira Mirza \u2013 who opposed Theresa May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/theresa-may-s-phoney-race-war-is-dangerous-and-divisive\">racial disparities audit</a> \u2013 is now <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/03/whos-charge-inside-no-10-maverick-advisers-running-britain\">head of policy</a> at No 10. And Trevor Phillips, the former equalities chief who was suspended from the Labour party over <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51797316\">accusations of Islamophobia</a>, was appointed to the Covid-19 inquiry \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-medics-condemn-trevor-phillips-role-investigating-uk-ethnic-minority-deaths\">provoking </a><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-medics-condemn-trevor-phillips-role-investigating-uk-ethnic-minority-deaths\">protests</a> from many of the black and minority NHS workers whose trust the inquiry most needs. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the government steadfastly refuses to revisit the utterly <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/uk-migrant-workers-desperate-need-crucial-financial-support-during-covid-19-pandemic\">draconian ban on migrant workers</a> \u2013 including those serving the public on the coronavirus frontline \u2013 accessing public funds, leading to warnings of a new epidemic of destitution.</p> <p>And we now witness the remarkable full circle of Britain recruiting foreigners to carry out essential work, whether in agriculture or the NHS. It\u2019s just like the last time \u2013 when Enoch Powell was among the first to ask Caribbean nurses to come and work in the NHS before turning to race hate. But this time it\u2019s taking place quietly, so we can continue the national pastime of deluding ourselves that Britain can survive without immigrants, while our very survival depends on their labour.</p> <p>Before the virus hit, Britishness as an identity had drifted into a dark place of dishonesty and cognitive dissonance, where we correctly identified that something had broken down, but blamed minorities and outsiders, rather than the betrayal of a promise.</p> <p>Now we have an opportunity to correct that wrong, by acknowledging that we will all be worse off, whatever our colour, unless racial justice and equality lies at the heart of our shared future.</p> <p>\u2022 Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Eighteen linnets chased us up the steep, stony track. They had been feeding down on the roadside dandelion clocks, but now they seemed as keen to get up to the heath as we were. The hilltop is wild with heather and rough grass, the slope below tame with quiet pastures. The flock danced ahead, their calls as spiky as the gorse they come from.</p> <p>Through the gate the landscape sprang to life. A stonechat made his pebble-tapping call; a skylark flew up, bubbled a few notes and dropped down again.

The grey sallows were living up to their name but down in the old winter grass the upside-down-pansy faces of the common dog violets, <em>Viola riviniana,</em> were earning theirs, in shades from pale lilac to bold purple. Down in a miry crevice the first marsh violet, <em>Viola palustris</em> \u2013 which has rounded rather than heart-shaped leaves \u2013 had opened its strange little puckered and dark-veined eye. And on the north side of the hill, high above the green valley that had turned to shades of smoke and slate in the haze, we reached the bluebells.</p> <p>It is said that almost half the world\u2019s bluebells live in Britain and their woodland strongholds are rightly treasured. But up here, on the north face of Black Down, they march across the open hillside, encouraged by the light soil, maintained by the damp climate, and protected from the summer heat by a forest of bracken. Despite two hot weeks of sunshine, they were only just beginning to bloom, so we had to search the crumpled flanks of the hill for the sheltered places. South-facing banks, slopes protected from cold winds by barricades of hawthorn; in these harbours they were in full sail, impossibly blue under such a grey sky. Furry, black St Mark\u2019s flies, legs dangling, drifted through tranquil air that was full of the scent and light of bluebells.

  "<p>Victory in Europe was made possible by a remarkable military collaboration between the main anti-Axis powers \u2013 the US, Russia and Britain. But the three-way relationship, between Franklin D Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill, was never easy, and it set a pattern of national rivalry, suspicion, fear and distrust that persists to this day.</p> <p>A row over a top-secret message, known as SCAF-252, sent to Stalin in late March 1945 by Gen Dwight Eisenhower, the supreme allied commander, shows how <a href=\"http://www.stalkerzone.org/unconditional-surrender-west-cant-forgive-red-armys-capture-berlin/\">fraught the relationship could be</a>. In it, Eisenhower detailed his plans for the final defeat of Nazi Germany \u2013 but omitted to first consult or inform his British allies.</p> <p>Stalin was determined the Red Army would be the first to get to Berlin and topple Adolf Hitler, attaching great symbolic importance to capturing the capital of the Third Reich and its implications for the future European order. Churchill took a similar view, but Eisenhower and a distracted, ailing FDR were not thinking politically.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/ve-day-churchill-feared-de-gaulle-would-declare-victory-early\">VE Day: Churchill feared De Gaulle would declare victory early</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stalin, replying to the SCAF-252 signal on 1 April, encouraged the Americans\u2019 belief, which he did not share, that Hitler would make a last-ditch stand in the Alps in May. He approved Eisenhower\u2019s plan to send US forces south, away from Berlin, telling his trusting ally that \u201cBerlin has lost its former strategic importance\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he secretly ordered Marshal Georgy Zhukov, his top commander, to immediately encircle the city with 2.5 million troops to ensure the Americans and British did not enter, and to launch an assault \u201cno later than 16 April\u201d. As the historian <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/1945-the-race-for-berlin/\">Antony Beevor has noted</a>, \u201cit was the greatest April Fool in modern history\u201d.</p> <p>The British, in particular Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, were furious at being bypassed. Churchill worried, rightly as it turned out, that Stalin was intent on bringing as much of Europe as possible under Soviet communist rule, and was already breaking his Yalta conference pledge to respect Poland\u2019s independence.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that he [Eisenhower] is a most attractive personality and at the same time [has] a very, very limited brain from a strategic point of view,\u201d snarled Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, quoted by Beevor in his 2002 book, Berlin: The Downfall 1945. But Churchill could only fume impotently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0515355b0a4bfa5a689b1ce75191cf70df96a316\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0515355b0a4bfa5a689b1ce75191cf70df96a316/0_292_3476_2087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street fighting in Berlin during the battle to gain control of the German capital in April 1945\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street fighting in Berlin during the battle to gain control of the German capital in April 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAlthough I have tried in every way to put myself in sympathy with these communist leaders, I cannot feel the slightest trust or confidence in them. Force and facts are their only realities,\u201d Churchill said. By 8 May, Berlin had fallen to the Red Army, Hitler was dead, and Stalin had his victory.</p> <p>Tensions between the emerging US superpower and a weakened, indebted Britain clinging to its empire, continued through the postwar period. As the author Robert Worth has argued, the idea that Britain was happily content to pass the baton of global leadership to Washington after 1945 is a myth. \u201cThe British did all they could to maintain their overseas empire and deeply resented American efforts to displace them,\u201d Worth wrote.</p> <p>The Americans opposed British colonialism. But, the British said, the US merely replaced it with a de facto colonialism of their own. This rivalry produced <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/10/24/end-show-britain-united-states-middle-east/\">myriad overt and covert tussles for power and influence</a>, particularly in the Middle East.</p> <p>The US, for example, initially backed Iran\u2019s nationalist prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, who, during a 1951 US speaking tour, likened himself to a patriot from the American war of independence fighting British imperialism. Washington, fearful Iran might turn communist, changed tack two years later and backed a British coup plot against Mosaddegh that led ultimately to the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p> <p>In another cloak-and-dagger episode, an American spy masquerading as a foreign correspondent attempted to recruit Egypt\u2019s King Farouk, a British client. The mission was known within the CIA as Operation Fat Fucker. Farouk was later overthrown in a 1952 coup led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom US agents had befriended, which, in turn, led to Britain\u2019s 1956 Suez humiliation.</p> <p>Churchill hated Britain\u2019s new-found subservience, but urged his successors to stick to his maxim: \u201cNever be separated from the Americans\u201d. To a large degree, they have. With the exception of Harold Wilson, who broke with Washington over the Vietnam war, later British prime ministers have followed America\u2019s lead on most international issues.</p> <p>And concerning relations with Russia, British and US policy became largely indistinguishable during the cold war. Stalin\u2019s fear in 1945 that western powers would cut a \u201csecret deal\u201d and unite to oppose the Soviet Union came true, exemplified in later years by a Nato alliance that included West Germany.</p> <p>Today\u2019s world bears some uncanny similarities to the world of 1945. Post-Soviet Russia under Vladimir Putin is again on the offensive, employing asymmetrical means such as info-wars and cyberhacks instead of armoured divisions to project its influence across Europe.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s post-Brexit Britain, having rejected the concept of a common European home, stands alone in ways not seen since 1940. Brexiters\u2019 calls for a stronger US security, economic and trade relationship, to offset the EU rupture, are the modern-day equivalent of Churchill\u2019s desperate \u201cdarkest hour\u201d appeals for Roosevelt\u2019s help.</p> <p>As for the US, Donald Trump\u2019s collusion with Putin\u2019s Russia, and disdain for America\u2019s European allies, is reminiscent of Roosevelt\u2019s and Eisenhower\u2019s naivety in 1945. Not for nothing is Stalin one of Putin\u2019s great heroes.</p>",

Now the acute shock of the Covid-19 pandemic has also taken lives and left many more living in fear, while throwing hundreds of thousands out of paid work, shattering businesses and leaving us facing an unstable new world.</p> <p>The impact of both continues and will ultimately leave scars on our nation. But we can be proud that as our 2020 challenges have mounted we have seen a remarkable and growing willingness across our community to drop old grievances, listen to the science, experts and evidence, and look after each other, including people most at risk, with united purpose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/australian-businesses-call-for-climate-crisis-and-virus-economic-recovery-to-be-tackled-together\">Australian businesses call for climate crisis and virus economic recovery to be tackled together</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And we should take some confidence that we can meet other significant challenges for our economy, people and the environment, in particular the systemic threat of climate change, if we build on this momentum and common purpose.</p> <p>These crises have demonstrated the importance of trusting expert advice and scientific evidence. We took heed of the epidemiologists and other medical professionals, and embraced physical distancing, quarantining and good hygiene measures.</p> <p>We also took action early to prevent worse outcomes in the future. We started physical distancing and quarantining while caseloads were low, rather than waiting until our health system was overrun.</p> <p>We built stronger, albeit still imperfect, safety nets for people without paid work and businesses facing dire circumstances. We gave targeted financial support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/jobkeeper-payment-when-paid-eligibility-ato-tax-for-sole-traders-start-date-faq-application-jobseeker-payments\">by lifting the jobseeker </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/jobkeeper-payment-when-paid-eligibility-ato-tax-for-sole-traders-start-date-faq-application-jobseeker-payments\"> payment and providing a wage backstop for hundreds of thousands of people who would have otherwise been thrown out of work.</a></p> <p>We criticise ourselves and our institutions a lot. That is not without cause and is part of how we get better. But our society and our institutions have been tested this year and have shown great underlying strengths.</p> <p>We are an educated society, with a strong democratic foundation and robust public institutions such as our healthcare system and public service. Our financial sector and private enterprises increasingly recognise their important stewardship role in our society, including helping deliver more equitable and environmentally sustainable outcomes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These crises have demonstrated the importance of trusting expert advice and scientific evidence</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Australia still has a long path to recovery from the bushfires and Covid-19. At the same time climate change remains an enormous and growing threat to our wellbeing and prosperity.</p> <p>It is frustrating that after decades of trying we still don\u2019t have political consensus on durable energy and climate change policies that look after workers and people experiencing disadvantage, support investment and drive down emissions. Partly as a result, we have an increasingly desperate need to protect lives and livelihoods with greater resilience to the impacts of global heating already locked in.</p> <p>But, as with our emergency responses to the bushfires and Covid-19, we have a solid foundation to establish an effective climate change response that will create a more sustainable and prosperous future for all.</p> <p>Bodies such as the Australian Climate Roundtable are continuing to bring different groups like ours into forums where we are finding common ground on the path forward. Many actors in our community \u2013 businesses, investors, civil society and unions \u2013 have consulted with the scientists and experts, and are together advocating for stronger action and coalescing around science-based targets such as reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p>That is an arduous ascent, but we also have guides on hand with the expert advice to help us get there. Australian climate scientists are globally recognised; strong public institutions are in place, such as the Climate Change Authority, financial regulators and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, to help guide the private sector and community through the transition; and we have considerable policy expertise in the development of effective measures to reduce emissions while supporting trade exposed industries and their employees. The Australian Climate Roundtable is currently bringing our constituencies together with climate change experts to explore the risks of climate change and find solutions for a just and successful transition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/reckoning-with-climate-change-will-support-the-strongest-possible-economic-recovery-after-coronavirus\">Tackling climate change is vital for the strongest economic recovery after coronavirus | Patrick Suckling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If we can couple these solid foundations with the other main characteristics of our recent emergency responses \u2013 prioritising immediate preventative action and ensuring workers, business and people on low-incomes or experiencing disadvantage are not left behind \u2013 then finding that elusive, bipartisan resolution to the political dispute over climate policy is possible.</p> <p>Australian governments are now turning to economic recovery after the bushfires and immediate shock of Covid-19.</p> <p>Our recovery will be stronger and more enduring if we invest in measures that simultaneously cut greenhouse gas emission and build resilience, while creating secure sustainable jobs.</p> <p>If Australia and the world don\u2019t take seriously the climate change challenge facing us, then the physical and transitional impacts of a warming planet will continue to cause escalating damage and disruption to our lives, businesses and environment. Damage that expert scientists tell us will ultimately be worse than what we\u2019ve already seen this year.</p> <p>For years, Australians have argued about estimates of the cost of climate action that ranged from fractions of a percent of GDP growth to fractions of a fraction. This year, faced with a pandemic, Australians have \u2013 rightly, but painfully \u2013 chosen to halt much of our economy to save lives.

  "<p>Film-makers like it when critics use the word \u201crestrained\u201d to describe their work because it implies an intellectual rigour mostly absent in the excessive spectacles of mainstream cinema. Audiences who are looking for something more substantial like it too, for the same reasons. So for what it\u2019s worth, let me say this right off the bat: director Ben Lawrence\u2019s Sydney-set drama Hearts and Bones, which revolves around the relationship between a war photographer and a South Sudanese refugee, is certainly restrained.</p> <p>It is a human-oriented drama that builds a thoughtful and contemplative space, empathising with characters grappling with difficult circumstances outside the common experience. It is also the kind of drama you sometimes want to grab and shake to life. Get the lens a little dirty; knock the camera around a bit; bring a sense of urgency to the edit; get the script (by Lawrence and Beatrix Christian) to draw bold conclusions to the ethical questions it raises rather than pussyfoot around with vague ruminative responses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/28/desperately-seeking-susan-and-she-devil-absurd-80s-comedies-ripe-for-redemption\">Desperately Seeking Susan and She-Devil: absurd 80s comedies ripe for redemption</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One thing you never want to mess with is the performances. The protagonist is played by Hugo Weaving, an actor who expresses pathos as if it were a weight constantly pulling him down. The most intense moments in Weaving\u2019s performances, in this film and more generally speaking, tend to occur when he feigns losing control; when the performer\u2019s trademark stoicism gives away to a volcanic inner force.</p> <p>Weaving plays Dan Fisher, a famous photographer who suffers panic attacks in increasing frequency. This is partly to do with angst concerning his pregnant partner Josie \u2013 played by an affecting Hayley McElhinney, whose performance balances assurance with tenderness. The nature of Dan\u2019s trepidation towards their impending baby is best left for the film to disclose. Mostly, however, his PTSD-like panic attacks connect to terrible things he has seen during wartime, one of which we witness in the film\u2019s opening moments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4388653eb77f2a9a7da5c38fb0f826fee0a452a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4388653eb77f2a9a7da5c38fb0f826fee0a452a5/0_0_3543_2363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"two men playing instruments\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahead of an upcoming exhibition, a South Sudanese cab driver arrives on Dan\u2019s door with a special request.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That moment, which involves Dan prioritising the duties of being a photographer over intervening in a dangerous situation and potentially saving a life, casts a pall that hangs over the rest of the film. Yet it remains unexplored: just left there, hanging, as a way to make the point that the protagonist Has Seen Things. By the end of it we have no idea whether Dan subscribes to the bogus, outdated idea that a professional photographer (or documentarian) should never interact with the environment around them, but only capture it. That used to be a badge of honour certain photographers wore, as if <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/images-of-suffering-can-bring-about-change-but-are-they-ethical-100809\">capturing suffering</a> were a more noble pursuit than helping another human in front of them.</p> <p>Ahead of an upcoming exhibition, Dan is approached by a South Sudanese cab driver, Sebastian (Andrew Luri), who arrives on his door with a special request: that Dan photograph an African community choir he belongs to. My first thought was that this would lead to the broken Dan becoming whole again by belting out a few uplifting songs with the choristers. But Sebastian has an ulterior motive: he doesn\u2019t want Dan to exhibit photographs of a massacre at the village where he lived 15 years ago. He has his own reasons for this, which are explored over the course of the running time and are points of tension between the two characters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15b1085902fbef50390fabd63d3f3d04d11b8ac0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15b1085902fbef50390fabd63d3f3d04d11b8ac0/575_0_1429_858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seb and Dan looking at photos in dim light\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An ulterior motive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Madman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the drama involves dealing with deep-seated emotional wounds and growing tensions between the two men. Newcomer Andrew Luri is terrific opposite Weaving, more than holding his own against the seasoned veteran. Luri plays Sebastian as a determined but deeply conflicted man whose solutions often exacerbate his problems. Every once in a while he responds to a stressful situation with violence, creating a sense of untrustworthiness that agitates an otherwise pleasant demeanour. At times you want to give him a hug; at times you want to stay well clear of him.</p> <p>The tone, temperament and pacing of Hearts and Bones is certainly consistent, though visually there is nothing particularly rich or cinematic about it. Lawrence and his cinematographer Hugh Miller conjured a more interesting, and much moodier look in the director\u2019s previous film, Ghosthunter, an atmospheric documentary investigating a Sydney security guard who claims to chase spirits in his spare time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/03/from-hannah-gadsbys-douglas-to-the-great-whats-new-to-streaming-in-australia-in-may\">From Hannah Gadsby's Douglas to The Great: what's new to streaming in Australia in May</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ghosthunter similarly explores themes of long-standing trauma, and the inability for any of us to escape our past. Both of Lawrence\u2019s films ruminate on one of the greatest lines uttered so far in 21st century cinema, spoken by, of all people, the protagonist of the 2009 family film Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs: \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from your own feet.\u201d</p> <p>It took deep thought to come up with a line like that, and terrific efficiency to distill such profound sentiments into so few words. Hearts and Bones makes profound statements also but is not a work of narrative economy, that\u2019s for sure. Dramatically, it has a vague, lingering quality, at times meditative (another critic-deployed word film-makers tend to like) and sometimes a little inert. On the plus side, the performances are very strong and have plenty of space to breathe. The tone is measured, contemplative and, yes, restrained.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Hearts and Bones is out now through iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, Sony PlayStation, Telstra and Fetch TV, and will be available on DVD on 3 June</em></p>",

How long it will take to rebound, nobody knows, Newsom said at his daily briefing.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt will take longer than most people think,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cIt\u2019s Depression-era numbers. These numbers are jaw-dropping, and it\u2019s alarming. I hope people are preparing themselves for the effort we all need to undertake to get back on our feet.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Since March, a record <strong>4.2 million</strong> Californians have applied for <strong>unemployment insurance</strong>. And many out-of-work employees are not yet fully reflected in state and national unemployment rates. As the economic impacts trickle down, local governments will face tough budget decisions. </p> \n  <p>California has already distributed $10.6 billion in aide to workers \u2014 $2 billion just since Sunday, Newsom said. </p> \n  <p>But some relief could be around the corner. Expected Thursday are clearer guidelines on which businesses will be allowed to open \u2014 and how they\u2019re expected to operate \u2014 as the state enters phase 2 of its plan to reopen. The next phase will see florists, book stores, retailers reopen for curbside pick up. Reopening will be guided by data, Newsom said, and health and safety guidelines will continue to be a priority. </p> \n  <p>Meantime, Newsom reported 95 Californians died in the past 24 hours \u2014 numbers that have ticked up, even while hospitalizations and ICU admissions have improved modestly.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI have all the confidence in the world we\u2019ll recover and be a stronger, smarter society and a more resilient state. But it will take a while. The next few years, we\u2019ll have to work through these challenges.
