The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap.

The company pays only for hours they have actually worked and the government makes up the difference.

And when faced with a pandemic, the government sprung into action earlier than anywhere else in India.</p> \n  <p>Health minister, KK Shailaja, who swiftly earned the nickname \u201cCoronavirus Slayer\u201d, was the first in the country to assemble a taskforce in mid-February to begin aggressively contact tracing, testing and quarantining any possible cases. The state also closed all schools, restaurants and banned gatherings before any other and began setting up public sinks and hand sanitiser dispensers in public places, even at bus stops. The state has one of the highest testing rates in India, though it has also faced a shortage of testing kits.</p> \n  <p>And when prime minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24 with four hours notice, causing havoc for the millions of migrant workers stuck thousands of miles from home. The Kerala authorities set up camps and provided provisions for their three million \u201cguest workers\u201d, preventing the dangerous exodus of people trying to get back home. A total of almost 19,000 relief camps have since been set up in Kerala, providing three meals a day. In comparison, in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state which has one of the highest numbers of migrant workers, just 2,000 camps have been set up.</p> \n  <p>Those in the camps are being given regular health checks and they even made arrangements to charge migrant workers phones, set up a helpline call centre which speaks five Indian languages. They also established a counselling service and when protests broke out in the camps by the migrant workers from northern states that they were only being fed rice, their diet was adapted to suit northern India tastes, including chapati, dal and pickle. In one camp, a Bengali kitchen was established. Across the state, mobile health workers are visiting the elderly and vulnerable.</p> \n  <p>Nonetheless, experts are warning against celebrating the state\u2019s success too early, especially as cases nationwide continue to steeply increase, and Kerala reported two new cases on Monday. On Sunday the Ministry of Home affairs also issued a rebuke to the Kerala state government for easing restrictions, with Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla issuing a thinly veiled warning against states that were \u201cdiluting\u201d the lockdown.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d8a9a8f08b7689b031b05\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:52:17.138Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>China\u2019s</strong> health authority called for a stronger and more rigorous testing regime to ensure that the new coronavirus does not escape detection, whether in travellers arriving from abroad or from other parts of the country. </p> \n  <p>All localities must improve their testing capabilities, including those at border crossings, and report any epidemic information in a timely manner, the National Health Commission cited its director Ma Xiaowei as saying.

It is the first known case in Borno, the epicentre of jihadist conflict that ravaged the region for over a decade. <br><br>According to a statement by MSF this morning, the aid worker, whose identity has not been revealed, tested positive in a post-mortem test. MSF said its teams \u201chave strengthened infection prevention measures, hygiene facilities, infection control and isolation spaces.\u201d<br><br>Authorities are now working to trace the worker\u2019s contacts and abate a spread of the virus within one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. <br><br>Almost two million people are displaced in northeast Nigeria, with almost 3 million in urgent need of food aid according to the World Food Programme. Several humanitarian organisations operate in the region, providing essential help. The insurgency has decimated the key services millions in the region rely on, including its health system.<br><br>On Sunday night, the UN said a major priority is to decongest refugee camps, where hundreds of thousands live in squalid conditions, unable to return to their homes. Yet it is a huge challenge as many areas across Borno and the north-east remain unsafe, exacerbated by a recent withdrawal of soldiers into so called super-camps. After relentless attacks by jihadists, soldiers have redeployed to better defend their positions but NGOs in the region say it has left many towns more vulnerable to insurgents.<br><br>There are 627 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country of 200 million people. Yet the daily rise in cases is gradually accelerating, with 86 new cases confirmed yesterday. Nigerian authorities have only tested about 7,000 people, and whilst countries around the world are struggling to boost testing capacity, many West African countries have tested more per million people. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d80ef8f08b7689b031aba\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:01:19.677Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">US scuppers G20 coronavirus statement on strengthening WHO</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>US hostility to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> scuppered the publication of a communique by G20 health ministers on Sunday that committed to strengthening the WHO\u2019s mandate in coordinating a response to the global coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>In place of a lengthy statement with paragraphs of detail, the leaders instead issued a brief statement saying that gaps existed in the way the world handled pandemics.</p> \n  <p>The failure to agree on a statement will underline the extent to which the pandemic has become a theatre for a wider global disagreement between the US and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> in which other nation states are finding themselves increasingly forced to take sides.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has suspended US payments to the WHO in protest at what he regards as the body\u2019s China-centric approach, reflected \u2013 in his view \u2013 by its failure to challenge China sufficiently over the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> \n  <p>Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, the health minister for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>, which was hosting the virtual summit, abruptly cancelled a planned press conference on Sunday, saying he urgently needed to attend a domestic coronavirus taskforce meeting.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/us-scuppers-g20-coronavirus-statement-on-strengthening-who\">Read more here.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:28:11.285Z\">at 12.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d71c78f08b7689b031a0e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:00:48.220Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a quick rundown of all the latest developments around the world on the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government is to propose that the European Union create a \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) fund to aid recovery in countries worst-hit by the coronavirus crisis, Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper reported</strong>.

He said Japan\u2019s initial approach \u2013 to identify and contain infection clusters \u2013 had worked well until major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka started reporting significant rises in cases from the second half of March.</p> \n  <p>\u201cJapan\u2019s government should have changed strategy earlier,\u201d Iwata said, referring to the shift to wider testing combined with social distancing. \u201cThere was a tremendous delay and that has caused huge problems,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Hospitals initially designated to treat patients with the illness had become unable to deal with the growing number of cases, leaving other hospitals unprepared to fill the treatment gap. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t prepared and your staff aren\u2019t trained, you can\u2019t just admit Covid-19 patients,\u201d Iwata said. \u201cMany hospitals are not ready to fight against Covid-19. That\u2019s why [there have been reports] of ambulances going from one hospital to another\u201d in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe and other cities.</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cWe needed to change strategy immediately, but traditionally, Japan isn\u2019t good at doing that. When we have a plan A we are poor at converting it into a plan B.

Local governors can request that people stay home and that nonessential businesses close, but there are no fines or other penalties for non-compliance. In Tokyo, many places have closed their doors, but some bars, restaurants and cafes remain open, with many of the city\u2019s streets far from empty.<br><br>Iwata said the lack of urgency implicit in the measures meant people still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/clash-looms-in-japan-as-tokyo-governor-says-abes-covid-19-measures-not-enough\">hadn\u2019t understood the importance of staying home and social distancing</a>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe government didn\u2019t send the right message to people \u2013 that you need to distance yourself from others to block the route of transmission.

It also supports eradication of existing diseases such as malaria and polio and promotes global public health.</p>\n    <p>While its role on emerging diseases is most familiar in the developed world, its practical involvement is far more marked in the global south, where it has been working to expand basic healthcare, support vaccination and sustain weak and often stressed health systems through its emergencies programmes.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is the WHO under fire from Trump?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Trump has presented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/trump-who-china-white-house-us\">withdrawing funding and cutting ties with WHO</a> as a direct response to what he claims was its slow reaction in raising the alarm over the global threat from the coronavirus and being too \u201cChina-centric\u201d in its response. The allegation that the WHO was slow to warn of the risk of human-to-human transmission, and that it failed to cross-examine Chinese transparency early on, is largely not borne out by the evidence. And the organisation\u2019s funding was already in his sights on 7 February,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/10/trump-world-health-organization-funding-coronavirus-state-department-usaid-budget-cuts/\">when his administration was suggesting cutting the US contribution</a>&nbsp;by half.</p>\n    <p>The WHO, to whom the US theoretically contributes roughly 10-15% of its budget as its largest contributor, has been appealing for an extra $1bn to help fight the coronavirus. While the suspension of funding by the US for 60-90 days is relatively small \u2013 not least because the US is so far in arrears in its annual payments \u2013 a general US withdrawal from global health funding under the cover of this announcement would be very serious and felt most profoundly in places that need the most support.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a>&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Friday, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/antibody-study-suggests-coronavirus-is-far-more-widespread-than-previously-thought\">study carried out in Santa Clara, California</a> by Stanford University and released as a \u201cpre-print\u201d without peer review, found that 50 to 85 times more people had been infected with the virus than official figures showed.</p> \n<p>Santa Clara county had 1,094 confirmed cases of Covid-19 at the time the study was carried out, but antibody tests suggest that between 48,000 and 81,000 people had been infected by early April, most of whom did not develop symptoms.</p> \n<p>But even those high figures mean that within the whole population of the county, only 3% have been infected and have antibodies to the virus. A study in the Netherlands of 7,000 blood donors also found that just 3% had antibodies.</p> \n<p>Van Kerkhove said they needed to look carefully at the way the studies were being carried out. \u201cA number of studies we are aware of in pre-print have suggested that small proportions of the population [have antibodies],\u201d she said.

  "<p>US oil prices turned negative for the first time in history on Monday amid the deepest fall in demand in 25 years. A flood of unwanted oil in the market caused the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark price for US oil, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund\">plummet to almost </a>\u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund\">$40 a barrel after the fastest plunge in history</a>. That meant producers were paying buyers to take oil off their hands.</p> <h2>1. Why have US oil prices turned negative?</h2> <p>The price of oil has been steadily falling across global markets since coronavirus<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-economy-shrinks-record-wuhan-covid-19-death-toll-rises-50-percent\"> first broke out in China</a> at the end of 2019. Since then, the shutdown of major economies and travel routes to curb the spread of the virus has wiped out oil demand as transport has ground to a halt. But oil producers have continued to pump crude from their wells, causing a catastrophic imbalance between oversupplied oil and the biggest slump in demand for 25 years.</p> <h2>2. What do \u2018negative prices\u2019 mean?</h2> <p>In short: oil producers are paying buyers to take the barrels of oil off their hands because storage facilities are full to the brim. At the market\u2019s lowest point on Monday, an oil company might have paid about $40 for every barrel of oil someone was willing to take. A buyer would need to factor in the cost of transporting oil from the well to a shipping port, or a storage facility, where it may need to be held for up to six months, at significant cost. They would also need to bet that oil prices will rise later this year to make a return on the \u201cinvestment\u201d. No oil company wants to \u201csell\u201d their crude at a loss, so many producers are likely to shut their wells until the market recovers.</p> <h2>3. Why are oil prices in other countries still above zero?</h2> <p>The world\u2019s oversupply of oil is particularly acute in the US, which produces around 10m barrels of oil every day, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/19/supertankers-drafted-in-to-store-glut-of-crude-oil-coronavirus\">oil storage tanks have filled up</a>, leaving oil companies desperate to sell their surplus barrels. In other regions, including the UK, oil prices are still above zero in part because theyface lower transport costs and easier access to ports. Still, no oil market has remained unscathed. The international benchmark oil price, known as Brent crude, is still above $20 a barrel, but has fallen by two-thirds since January to 18-year lows.</p> <h2>4. What does this mean for petrol prices?</h2> <p>Petrol prices are likely to fall sharply this year due to the sudden collapse of oil prices and the long road to market recovery that probably lies ahead. But it is worth keeping in mind that the price paid at the pump is not a perfect reflection of the oil markets because petrol and diesel prices include government taxes and a profit margin for the seller. The negative oil prices seen in the US will be short-lived, so no one should expect to be paid for filling up their car.</p> <h2>5. Are prices likely to recover?</h2> <p>Yes, and quite quickly. The negative US oil price referred specifically to the price for crude delivered in May, the month in which oil demand is expected to be lowest and supplies are expected to be highest. From Tuesday, oil traders will begin trading barrels for delivery in June in earnest, and these are expected to fetch far higher prices. A meaningful recovery of oil market prices will depend on how quickly demand for transport fuels increases \u2013 a speedy end to lockdown would accelerate a market price recovery, but a slow emergence from the Covid-19 crisis could mean further financial pain for oil producers until 2021.</p>",

  "<p>A massive deepwater oil spill is nearly as likely today as it was in 2010, experts warn, 10 years after the disastrous explosion of BP\u2019s rig in the Gulf of Mexico that caused an environmental catastrophe.</p> <p>The blowout killed 11 workers and spewed 4m barrels of petroleum into the ocean for 87 days before it could be capped, devastating marine life and polluting 1,300 miles of shoreline. Thousands were put out of work in oil, fisheries and tourism.</p> <p>But experts say an incident of similar scale could happen again and has been made more likely by the Trump administration\u2019s decision to loosen Obama-era safety rules. Those standards had grown from an independent commission\u2019s damning findings of corporate and regulatory failures leading up to the spill.</p> <p>Frances Ulmer, who served on the commission and is a visiting fellow at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, said the government and industry have not made sufficient changes to prevent or respond to another mammoth spill.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/deepwater-horizon-mexico-10-years-on\">\u2018We\u2019ve been abandoned\u2019: a decade later, Deepwater Horizon still haunts Mexico</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDisasters like oil spills will happen again because this is an extremely high-risk operation, particularly when you\u2019re talking about drilling for oil over a mile of water and then a couple miles down under the sea floor,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that can go wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Frances Beinecke, another commission member and the former president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, echoed those worries.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it could happen again, and I think one of the things of most concern is that our ability to control a spill is pretty much the same as it was 10 years prior,\u201d Beinecke said. </p> <p>Richard Sears, the commission\u2019s senior science and engineering adviser, who formerly worked for Shell and is now an adjunct professor at Stanford University, said an accident like Deepwater Horizon was less likely now but \u201cthere are a lot worse scenarios that could happen in deep water\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b7b69307a4b482e1ea84c6ade9ccad7311ac02b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7b69307a4b482e1ea84c6ade9ccad7311ac02b/8_32_2021_1213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Engineers from the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement inspect an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Engineers from the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement inspect an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEverybody has to stay vigilant,\u201d Sears said. He believes the Trump rule changes do not significantly weaken well safety but the government could do more to limit industry risk.</p> <p>Outside of safety concerns, the scientific community is also increasingly encouraging world leaders to consider that any new oil development is unwise, as emissions from fossil fuels exacerbate global heating, threatening human civilization.</p> <p>In the wake of the BP disaster, the US interior department restructured in an effort to allow a new division of the agency, the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (BSEE), to focus on safety. The move was meant to separate safety regulators from government officials who might be more incentivized by the money coming in from taxes on drilling.</p> <p>The Obama administration beefed up safety rules, including checks on blowout preventers like the one that failed on BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon rig.</p> <p>Now Trump has weakened those standards at the behest of the industry\u2019s trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, including allowing inspections by non-government-accredited contractors<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Trump has pushed an agenda of \u201cenergy dominance\u201d, which critics say encourages industry to take risks.</p> <p>A constant ally of fossil fuels, Trump has sought to allow drilling in nearly all coastal waters in the US \u2013 more than 1bn acres in the Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic and Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>His officials have been accommodating to the corporations they regulate, with BSEE\u2019s director repeatedly calling them \u201cpartners\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBSEE is transitioning from an era of isolation to cooperation, from creating hardships to creating partnerships,\u201d the bureau director, Scott Angelle, said at an industry symposium in August 2017.</p> <p>Internal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-safety-rules-on-oil-drilling-were-changed-some-staff-objected-those-notes-were-cut-11582731559\">emails</a> suggest expert agency staffers have disagreed with the rollbacks to drilling safety rules and Angelle has refused to document their concerns.

Low oil prices \u2013 from a boom in production on land following the discovery of fracking \u2013 haven\u2019t kept them out of the water. Most of the $93m in leases sold by the US in the Gulf last month were in <a href=\"https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/government/article/14170058/gulf-of-mexico-lease-sale-yields-93-million-in-winning-bids\">deep water</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOffshore drilling is going after bigger and bigger wells that have more and more oil,\u201d said Bob Deans, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council who co-wrote a book on the BP disaster. \u201cThese are being drilled in deep water and they\u2019re being drilled in high pressure wells that are harder to control. And they\u2019re being drilled in more complex geology.\u201d</p> <p>One study found that for every 100ft deeper a well is drilled, documented incidents <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030142151201141X?via%3Dihub\">increase 8.5%</a>.</p> <p>The Deepwater Horizon rig reached about 5,000ft, or close to a mile, down. Other platforms still operating in the Gulf are as deep or deeper. One drilled in 2001, called \u201cBlind Faith\u201d, is still producing, according to 2019 documents from Chevron. It reaches 7,000ft to the Gulf floor.</p> <p>Deans called the current regulatory approach \u201can honor system\u201d that \u201csmacks of exactly the kind of self-enforcement that the independent commission found to be a fatal flaw\u201d in the BP blowout.</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely, it could happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot make these operations safe. All you can do is try to reduce the risk.\u201d</p> <p>Smaller-scale incidents that don\u2019t make the news occur frequently in the Gulf. Between 2007 and 2018, there were an average of 115 fires and explosions in federal waters annually, about one every three days, according to government data <a href=\"https://usa.oceana.org/publications/reports/hindsight-2020-lessons-we-cannot-ignore-bp-disaster?_ga=2.77377884.815579413.1587658951-544184516.1586886135#\">reviewed by the environment campaign Oceana</a>. There were also nearly 50 fatalities over that time.</p> <p>Donald Boesch, a biological oceanographer and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, who was also on the commission, said Trump\u2019s changes have undermined offshore safety.</p> <p>\u201cMany steps have been taken by both government and industry since the accident 10 years ago \u2026 I felt comfortable \u2013 not that the risk was reduced to negligible \u2013 but that we were in better shape now than we were,\u201d Boesch said. \u201cI\u2019ve frankly been made more concerned about how the safety issues are being treated under the Trump administration.\u201d</p> <p>Still, sources familiar with industry say the big companies learned a lesson as they watched BP suffer huge reputational damage and pay $65bn for its mistakes.</p> <p>Wesley Williams, a petroleum engineering professor at Louisiana State University, who was awarded a nearly $5m research grant from a fund BP was forced to pay into, said the \u201creal motivator\u201d for industry was \u201cthe image issue that happened and the financial cost of what happened to BP\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/gulf-coast-deepwater-horizon-oil-industry-louisiana\">'I pray to God it never happens again': US gulf coast bears scars of historic oil spill 10 years on</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFrom the large operators, I\u2019ve seen a big change in safety culture,\u201d Williams said.</p> <p>But the sector consists of more than just the brands most people can identify, like BP, Shell and Exxon. Those companies work with large networks of contractors, and smaller independent operators are active in the Gulf of Mexico too. Williams said they did not always have the resources for extensive safety training.</p> <p>John Amos, president of SkyTruth, a not-for-profit conservation technology organization, said:</p> <p>\u201cThe next major oil spill, when it happens, will catch us off guard \u2026 like every previous one has, unless we decide that this time it\u2019s going to be different,\u201d Amos said.</p>",
  "<p>These are the weirdest of times. Oil prices, which during the last crisis hit $147 a barrel, have just turned negative. That\u2019s right. Crude is so cheap they are giving it away.</p> <p>So much for the idea of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/10/opec-russia-reduce-oil-production-prop-up-prices\">top</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/10/opec-russia-reduce-oil-production-prop-up-prices\">-level deal</a> to put a floor under oil prices. Little more than a week ago, all the talk from Donald Trump was of how he had banged heads together and forced Russia and Saudi Arabia into production curbs that would bring global supplies of crude more into line with demand. On Monday night, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund\">price of US benchmark crude </a>was -$38 a barrel.</p> <p>The reason for an unprecedented one-day collapse in the price is partly technical. Crude for June delivery is trading at more than $20 a barrel. That said, the chances of a binding deal always looked fanciful. The oil cartel Opec does not have the power it once wielded, even when the group is expanded to include Russia. </p> <p>The west\u2019s shutdown means oil demand has plummeted. There are supertankers out at sea full to the brim with crude at a time when storage facilities \u2013 especially in the US \u2013 are close to capacity. The number of active US rigs has fallen by 35% in the past month, because many are now uneconomic.</p> <p>The cost of crude will eventually start to rise again, but not because of Trump\u2019s browbeating, nor because of a Moscow-Riyadh deal, but because there is a more powerful force at work: the price mechanism.</p> <h2>Sunak\u2019s startup support scheme responds to a real threat</h2> <p>Rishi Sunak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-offers-fast-growing-uk-companies-125bn-in-loans\">decision to support innovative start</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-offers-fast-growing-uk-companies-125bn-in-loans\">up companies</a> is the latest example of political cross-dressing by the government. First it was higher public spending, then it was stepping in to subsidise jobs. Now it is the ultimate throwback to the 1970s: picking winners.</p> <p>Under the chancellor\u2019s new scheme, the government will provide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-offers-fast-growing-uk-companies-125bn-in-loans\">loans to companies</a> in which private investors have already put money. If the loans can\u2019t be repaid, the Treasury will pick up an equity stake at a knockdown price, providing a potential upside for the taxpayer if the company does \u2013 let\u2019s say \u2013 come up with the latest big thing in artificial intelligence or a treatment for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19.</a></p> <p>The evidence from the flurry of Treasury action since the UK went into lockdown suggests it is wise to study the detail before making a judgment on a scheme\u2019s merit. But notwithstanding the need to study the small print, Sunak\u2019s decision to intervene is welcome.</p> <p>For decades the idea that the government could second-guess the markets and identify companies with growth potential has been a term of political abuse in the UK, but what happened 40 or 50 years ago was not really about picking winners so much as bailing out losers.</p> <p>The case for providing financial support for innovative firms is strong, not least because many of them are startups, and so don\u2019t qualify for help under the other packages the chancellor has announced.</p> <p>Even in the best of times, companies that tend to burn through cash quickly and are some distance away from making a profit can find life challenging. There are plenty of reasons for that: banks that are unwilling to lend; a much less developed venture capital industry than in the US; a longstanding difficulty in turning ideas into commercial products.</p> <p>Sunak, with his background in the hedge fund industry, has taken personal interest in the package for innovative firms, and it is right that the chancellor is responding to the very real threat that the firms of the future will be decimated by the pandemic.</p> <p>This is a high-risk sector and there will be companies that go bust, taking the state\u2019s money with them. Sunak has sought to guard against that by insisting government money be matched by private investment. If there is a quibble, it is about the fact that he has initially only pledged \u00a3250m to the Future Fund, and that may not be enough.</p>",
  "<p>Doctors and nurses must urgently be deployed to fight coronavirus in care homes, care bosses have said, as the largest operators announced sharp rises in their death tolls.</p> <p>Care UK, which runs 122 homes in England and Scotland, revealed a 65% increase in deaths in just four days and said the virus had reached 70% of its homes. Four Seasons Health Care, which operates 190 homes, said fatalities had increased by 60% in six days, with nearly two in three of its homes affected.</p> <p>Ministers have continued to cite a figure of 217 care home deaths across England and Wales, which was published last week by the Office for National Statistics with a three-week time lag. But five of the largest providers contacted by the Guardian have now recorded at least 1,052 deaths between them from confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19.</p> <p>By Friday, 412 people had died in homes operated by HC-One, Britain\u2019s largest care home provider, an increase of a third in four days.</p> <p>\u201cSocial care is clearly on the frontline, yet we haven\u2019t drawn up a fully fledged battle plan,\u201d said Vic Rayner, executive director of the National Care Forum, which represents charitable care home networks. The forum wants medical staff and clinical equipment urgently targeted at care homes.</p> <p>Rayner said homes had been forced to \u201csecond guess\u201d how to treat the disease. \u201cWe are not focusing enough attention at a medical level on how best to keep people safe in these environments. We always knew these were the most at-risk groups, but we haven\u2019t responded to an unprecedented situation with an unprecedented plan as we did in hospitals.\u201d</p> <p>UK care homes are not typically staffed by doctors or registered nurses. Residents\u2019 health is overseen by GPs, who have been restricting consultations to phone or video calls to avoid contagion.</p> <p>Doctors say this is sufficient to draw up a treatment plan in most cases, but it has left some care staff feeling isolated as the virus sweeps through homes. In the largest networks, 50% to 70% of properties are affected \u2013 many times higher than the 13.5% estimated by England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, last week.</p> <p>MHA, the largest charitable provider of care homes, has recorded at least 251 deaths, an increase of 20% in three days. Barchester reported 130 Covid-19 deaths, with a further 66 dying after hospital admission, and cases in half of its 230 homes. Bupa, one of the largest providers, with more than 120 homes, declined to reveal its death toll but said it was updating residents, relatives and the sector\u2019s regulator.</p> <p>Care England, which represents some of the largest providers, estimated last week that the number of deaths across all care homes could already be as high as 7,500, while a National Care Forum survey suggested more than 4,000 had died from Covid-19 in UK residential and nursing services by 13 April.</p> <p>Such are the rising tolls that some bereaved relatives have complained of pressure from care home operators to arrange the rapid removal of the dead.</p> <p>\u201cWhere there have been several deaths, care homes are applying pressure to families to remove [bodies] quickly,\u201d said Helen Wildbore, the director of the Relative and Residents Association. \u201cAt a time when you are grieving and emotional, it is the last thing you want to think about.\u201d She added that many funeral directors lacked the capacity to help at short notice.</p> <p>Research by London School of Economics academics suggests that if the UK follows international trends, care homes could ultimately account for around half of all deaths from Covid-19.</p> <p>Updated <a href=\"https://ltccovid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mortality-associated-with-COVID-17-April-1.pdf\">figures from the Long Term Care Policy Network</a> show that in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, France, Belgium, Norway and Canada, the proportion of all Covid-19 deaths that occurred in care homes ranged from 33% to 64%. </p> <p>Dr Richard Vautrey, chair of the British Medical Association\u2019s GP committee, said: \u201cWe do need to identify the patients in our care homes that would benefit from hospital admission. The worry that hospitals would be overwhelmed has not been the case in most parts of the country.\u201d</p> <p>Some care homes were told by doctors early in the crisis that they should not expect to send any Covid-19 patients to hospitals, which were expected to face extreme pressures on their capacity from the wider population.

  "<p>Of all the enduring images from Inter\u2019s triumph in the 2010 Champions League final, one stands apart from the rest. Inside the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/22/inter-champions-league-final-bayern\">a 2-0 win over Bayern Munich</a> provoked scenes of joyous release: Diego Milito sprinting toward the fans with arms outstretched; Esteban Cambiasso doing laps of honour in Giacinto Facchetti\u2019s old shirt; Javier Zanetti balancing the trophy on his head.</p> <p>Outside, however, a different story would be told. As Inter\u2019s players bounded on to the team bus later that evening, their manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, slipped into a separate car of his own. And then he jumped straight out again, running over to hug Marco Materazzi. The two men folded into one another, and wept.</p> <p>Inter had just made history, becoming the first Italian side ever to win a treble of Serie A, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League. And now we knew that it was exactly that: history. Mourinho\u2019s time with the club was over, he was not coming back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab0defb6bd4847ed219ec421ff1a048d07309865\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab0defb6bd4847ed219ec421ff1a048d07309865/0_0_2704_3264/828.jpg\" alt=\"Javier Zanetti and Esteban Cambiasso, wearing Giacinto Facchetti\u2019s old shirt, celebrate at the end of the Champions League final.\" width=\"828\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Javier Zanetti and Esteban Cambiasso, wearing Giacinto Facchetti\u2019s old shirt, celebrate at the end of the Champions League final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To examine a great club side through the lens of an individual season can feel like an arbitrary exercise. There is always evolution in any team sport, always carry-over from one year to the next.</p> <p>Yet Inter\u2019s treble winners of 2009-10 do feel like an exception: less a glorious chapter in their team\u2019s record book than a sensational short story. One that has a clearly defined ending, with Mourinho riding off into the sunset (well, technically staying exactly where he was that night in Madrid), and the <em>Nerazzurri</em> never crowned as domestic or European champions again since.</p> <p>There is an obvious beginning, too, in the summer transfer window of 2009. Inter signed a host of players who would lead their charge to the treble: most prominently Milito, Thiago Motta, Samuel Eto\u2019o, L\u00facio and Wesley Sneijder.</p> <p>Mourinho arrived a year earlier, steering them to a Serie A title in his first season in charge, but that was a minimum requirement. Domestic success had come easy for Inter ever since the Calciopoli scandal of 2006, which saw Juventus relegated from the top flight, and further punishments handed out to Milan, Fiorentina and Lazio.</p> <p>There was little evidence in that first season that Mourinho could take this team higher. Inter finished behind Panathinaikos in the Champions League group stage and crashed out in the last 16. He had asked the club for two wingers to recreate the 4-3-3 that served him so brilliantly at Porto and Chelsea, but Mancini and Ricardo Quaresma both failed to live up to billing.</p> <p>How much of the tactical evolution that came next was planned, and how much a product of circumstance? Mourinho was determined to get Inter pressing higher up the pitch, telling <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcfRjlR3lXg\">The Coaches\u2019 Voice last year</a> that his goal had been to bring the defensive line forward by 20 metres. The signing of Lucio, a mobile centre-back, was a deliberate step, but elsewhere Inter\u2019s transfer policy appeared to be driven by opportunity.</p> <p>The <em>Nerazzurri</em> were not eager to sell Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Serie A\u2019s top scorer in 2008-09, but Barcelona made an offer \u2013 \u20ac46m plus Samuel Eto\u2019o \u2013 they could not refuse. With Milito inbound from Genoa, Mourinho now had two prolific strikers instead of one, with money left over for a further headline reinforcement.</p> <p>Sneijder arrived on 28 August and walked straight into the starting XI to help Inter demolish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/aug/29/milan-internazionale-minute-by-minute\">Milan 4-0 a day later</a>. In a roundabout way, Inter might once again have had Barcelona to thank. The Catalans\u2019 2009 treble provoked Real Madrid to go out and sign the previous two Ballon d\u2019Or winners \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo and Kak\u00e1 \u2013 leaving Sneijder and Arjen Robben surplus to requirements.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c6a6cf8e11375e23b6ce3ca059dcf96a3cde12b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c6a6cf8e11375e23b6ce3ca059dcf96a3cde12b/0_29_3000_1989/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wesley Sneijder holds off Milan\u2019s Andrea Pirlo on his Inter debut on 29 August 2009\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wesley Sneijder holds off Milan\u2019s Andrea Pirlo on his Inter debut on 29 August 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valerio Pennicino/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>World-class players had fallen into Inter\u2019s lap, arriving for a fraction of their true value. This context mattered as much as their talent. These were players who arrived with chips on their shoulders: motivated to prove their former employers wrong.</p> <p>Tactically, Mourinho made missteps. Inter began with a 4-3-1-2 centred on Sneijder\u2019s individual creativity. It was a triumph at home and almost a disaster in Europe, where its narrowness was repeatedly exposed. They drew their first three Champions League group games and looked to be heading out before five minutes of brilliance from the Dutchman \u2013 plus one lucky Milito miskick \u2013 turned a 1-0 deficit into a last-gasp win away at Dynamo Kyiv.</p> <p>Emotionally, though, Mourinho understood how to get under the skin of his players. Eto\u2019o had fallen out of favour at Barcelona in part because he resisted Pep Guardiola\u2019s instruction to give up the centre of the attack to Leo Messi. Yet Mourinho was able to persuade the Cameroonian to do exactly that: moving out to the left wing as Inter adapted mid-season into a 4-2-3-1.</p> <p>Even then, there were growing pains. For significant stretches of their greatest-ever season, Inter weren\u2019t actually very good. Between 16 January and 10 April, they won five out of 14 Serie A games, with Roma leapfrogging them into first place.</p> <p>Yet there was a spirit of defiance that overcame any deficiencies. Mourinho was the right manager at the right moment for the likes of Sneijder, Eto\u2019o and Goran Pandev \u2013 an inspired January pickup, who freed himself from his Lazio contract after being frozen out by the club\u2019s owner. If these players arrived feeling slighted, then Mourinho reaffirmed that emotion, making out that Inter \u2013 winners of the past four Serie A titles \u2013 were fighting against nebulous forces of establishment prejudice.</p> <p>He railed against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/03/jose-mourinho-internazionale-serie-a\">\u201cintellectual prostitution\u201d</a> in the Italian media, and gestured handcuffs on his wrists as decisions went against Inter in a draw with Sampdoria. So relentless were his attacks on Serie A officials that reports circulated of referees threatening to boycott Inter\u2019s games altogether.</p> <p>It was all nonsense, transparent distraction, but what mattered was that his players bought in. Sneijder said that he would \u201ckill and die\u201d for Mourinho; Dejan Stankovic said that he \u201cwould have thrown myself into a fire\u201d. Eto\u2019o spoke with his actions, filling in as an auxiliary full-back for more than an hour after Thiago Motta was sent off in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final away to Barcelona.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8033921103d6bdbbb81751a05437203ac654274c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8033921103d6bdbbb81751a05437203ac654274c/0_0_3703_2541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thiago Motta clashes with Barcelona\u2019s Sergio Busquets after being sent off in the Champions League semi-final at Camp Nou.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thiago Motta clashes with Barcelona\u2019s Sergio Busquets after being sent off in the Champions League semi-final at Camp Nou.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasper Juinen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inter had their share of luck. The eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull had obliged Barcelona to travel to Milan by bus for the first leg of that tie, where the Catalans slumped to a disjointed 3-1 defeat.</p> <p>Yet to focus on that would be to ignore what made this Inter team special. The modern history of the <em>Nerazzurri</em> had been one of underachievement, of becoming brittle when pressure was raised. Inter were the team that threw away the league title on the final day in 2002, and who had never threatened to win Europe\u2019s top club competition during Massimo Moratti\u2019s 15-year presidency to date, despite lavish transfer spending.</p> <p>Mourinho\u2019s Inter upended the stereotype: a side that delivered its best football in the tightest spots. They had Sneijder sent off after 26 minutes of January\u2019s returning meeting with Milan, then their closest rivals in the standings, but still won 2-0.</p> <p>In April, just when the wheels were threatening to come off their title challenge, they found themselves locked at 0-0 after 75 minutes against a Juventus side that had retreated into a defensive bunker formed of Fabio Cannavaro, Giorgio Chiellini and Gigi Buffon. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz6WrHIcKzI\">Maicon smashed the door down</a> with one of the best goals scored anywhere all season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChampionsLeague/status/1252148272363450369\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"tl\" dir=\"ltr\">\u26ab\ufe0f\ud83d\udd35 Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&#39;s Inter beat holders Barcelona at the San Siro <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OTD?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#OTD</a> in 2010...<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UCL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UCL</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Inter_en?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Inter_en</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Cfyo1wWR3Z\">pic.twitter.com/Cfyo1wWR3Z</a></p>&mdash; UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChampionsLeague/status/1252148272363450369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 20, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Then came Camp Nou, Thiago Motta\u2019s red card and Sergio Busquets peeking out between his fingers. How many other teams could have resisted, even with a two-goal advantage, for 62 minutes away at the best attacking side in the world? Things got a little hairy at the end, but J\u00falio C\u00e9sar had only made one noteworthy save before Gerard Piqu\u00e9 broke the deadlock with six minutes remaining. Even then, was he offside in the buildup?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"251a1f46bf3120b172e0b6de0b9d963c172e3bac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/251a1f46bf3120b172e0b6de0b9d963c172e3bac/0_0_4029_2802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diego Milito scores his second goal in the Champions League final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diego Milito scores his second goal in the Champions League final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The final against Bayern was more straightforward. Milito scored the decisive goals, just as he had in the Coppa Italia final and Inter\u2019s Scudetto-sealing win over Siena on the final day of the Serie A season. Sneijder provided the assist on the opener \u2013 his sixth of the tournament, more than any other player \u2013 and launched the counter that led to the second as well. He subsequently carried the Netherlands to a World Cup final, and somehow still finished fourth in the voting for the Ballon d\u2019Or.</p> <p>Perhaps that was a fitting epilogue \u2013 further evidence that nobody gave this team and these players the respect they merited. If Mourinho had returned, he might have used it to reinforce that us-against-the-world mentality. Instead, he never even went back to Milan to celebrate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"464c889b41e85966bd0ed66cf0ba8ac485ca7214\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/464c889b41e85966bd0ed66cf0ba8ac485ca7214/0_0_2390_1338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tearful Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Marco Materazzi embrace after the Champions League triumph.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"560\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tearful Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Marco Materazzi embrace after the Champions League triumph.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had not signed a contract [with Real Madrid] yet,\u201d he explained some years later, \u201cbut I had already decided.

The deadline triggered a collapse in prices as desperate oil traders with more crude than storage space were forced to take action.</p> \n<p>Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer-winning oil historian, said: \u201cThe May crude oil contract is going out not with a whimper, but a primal scream.\u201d</p> \n<p>The price of oil from the US shale heartlands has been declining steadily in recent weeks following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/oil-prices-slump-as-market-faces-lowest-demand-in-25-years-covid-19\">the biggest slump in oil demand for 25 years</a> steps due to restrictions on travel to curb the spread of Covid-19. The fall accelerated amid rising fears that the global economy may be facing its deepest downturn since the Great Depression.</p> \n<p>Oil producers have continued to pump near-record levels of crude into the global market even as analysts warned that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak would drive oil demand to its lowest levels since 1995. The emergence of negative oil prices is expected to prompt some oil companies to hasten the shutdown of their rigs and oil wells to avoid plunging deeper into debt or bankruptcy.</p> \n<p>The collapse will come as a blow to US President Donald Trump who took credit for brokering a historic deal between the Opec oil cartel and the world\u2019s largest oil producing nations to limit the flood of oil production into the market. The pact to cut between 10 million and 20 million barrels of oil from the market from next month was dismissed by many within the market as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d to avoid a market crash.</p> \n<p>At his daily White House briefing, Trump described the negative price as a \u201cshort-term problem\u201d. He said the US was filling up its strategic reserves: \u201cIf we could buy it for nothing, we\u2019re gonna take everything we can get,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8d3b7c2a-3328-472b-bf78-e277fe57ac8a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DbP_LVSZl2g?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-20T19:18:52/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph: US oil prices since 1983\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-20T19:18:52/embed.html\">Graph: US oil prices since 1983</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian reported over the weekend that a record 160m barrels of oil was being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/19/supertankers-drafted-in-to-store-glut-of-crude-oil-coronavirus\">stored in \u201csupergiant\u201d oil tankers outside the world\u2019s largest shipping ports</a>, including in the US Gulf. The last time floating storage reached levels close to this was in the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, when traders stored more than 100m barrels at sea before offloading stocks when the economy began to recover.</p> \n<p>Historically weak oil markets are likely to bring lower prices for drivers at service station forecourts, but the price collapse will also hurt pension savings which are often invested in major oil companies through funds which track equity markets. The oil price crisis has already wiped billions from the market value of the largest oil companies, many of which will not be able to pay dividends if the market rout drags on.</p> \n<p>Brett Fleishman, from climate campaign group at 350.org, said the collapse of oil prices is \u201canother powerful example of how fossil fuels are too volatile to be the basis of a resilient economy\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are experiencing an unparalleled upending in our economies.

The international oil price benchmark, known as Brent crude, is trading at around $26 a barrel.</p> \n<p>The recovery is expected to pick up over the second half of the year as tight restrictions on travel to help curb the spread of the virus are lifted, raising demand for fuels and oil.

  "<h2><strong>Doves</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Boris Johnson, prime minister</strong><br>Johnson is cautious about the idea the UK should be rushing to lift lockdown measures, as he fears a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/will-there-be-second-wave-of-coronavirus-\">second wave of the pandemic</a> could cripple the country. From the Chequers estate, where he is recovering from coronavirus, Johnson held discussions with the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and his director of communications, Lee Cain, last Friday. During the meeting he let it be known he was deeply concerned about the cost of a second peak to both the economy and people\u2019s health. Cummings is also understood to be on the side of caution while so little is known about the consequences of lifting the lockdown.</p> \n<p><strong>Matt Hancock, health secretary</strong><br>Hancock has been an active proponent of continued lockdown to try to relieve pressure on the NHS and get the transmission rate as low as possible before easing restrictions. He has been vocal about the government not giving away its lockdown exit strategy as it might lead to people starting to disobey the rules. However, in virtual meetings involving some cabinet ministers he has been coming up against their concerns about the health and social impact of a sharp economic downturn and other consequences of lockdown such as escalating domestic abuse levels.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/axis_of_lockdown/giv-390236tpW1mvX23L/\" data-alt=\"graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/axis_of_lockdown/giv-390236tpW1mvX23L/\">graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>In the middle</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Dominic Raab, foreign secretary, deputising as prime minister </strong><br>Raab is known to be instinctively in favour of a swift end to the lockdown but is also keeping his position close to that of the prime minister. He was leading the government at the time the decision was taken to extend lockdown measures by three weeks to 7 May, and was clear about the risks to the economy and the health of the nation if it was lifted too quickly. When pressed for a timeline, Raab pointed to Johnson\u2019s remark of 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to \u201cturn the tide\u201d of the virus, saying that was still \u201cbroadly the outline\u201d.</p> \n<p><strong>Alok Sharma</strong><strong>, business secretary</strong><br>Originally considered to be part of the cabinet\u2019s lockdown hawks, keen to get business back on its feet, Sharma has pivoted towards a more cautious stance, telling more than 1,000 business leaders in a webinar last Friday that he shared the PM\u2019s concerns about a second wave. In his call, hosted by the Confederation of British Industry, he said lifting the lockdown too early could bring further setbacks to business because of a second peak of the illness and said \u201cthat\u2019s the worst possible thing you could do\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Gavin Williamson, education secretary</strong><br>Williamson is another cabinet member who appears to have rowed back from an initial keenness to end lockdown.

However, a government source said the secretary of state totally dismissed suggestions he was part of the hawks group, and in a press conference on Sunday he did not give a date when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/the-guardian-view-on-reopening-schools-safety-must-come-first\">schools would re</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/the-guardian-view-on-reopening-schools-safety-must-come-first\">open</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>Hawks</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Rishi Sunak, </strong><strong>chancellor</strong></p> \n<p>Sunak has privately been making the case for as quick an end to the lockdown as possible to limit damage to the economy, viewing it as part of his job to speak up about the financial risks of a lengthy shutdown. Internal Treasury projections about the scale of business bankruptcies, unemployment and the depth of the recession to come have caused worries among cabinet ministers. He hinted at this last week in a No 10 press conference, saying he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the effect on the economy. However, sources close to him have also been keen to stress that his first priority is saving lives and protecting the NHS in line with the government\u2019s overarching message. </p> \n<p><strong>Michael Gove, Cabinet Office minister</strong></p> \n<p>Gove has been growing increasingly concerned about the economic impact of the lockdown and knock-on consequences for the health of the nation, according to Whitehall sources. He is one of the most outspoken of the four decision-makers in the so-called Quad \u2013 along with Raab, Sunak and Hancock \u2013 about finding ways to relax restrictions, and is leading a strategic unit in the Cabinet Office to look at ways to get the country moving again. Last week, he was reported by the Sunday Times to have told a meeting of the Quad that he wanted to \u201crun things quite hot\u201d \u2013 meaning he would be prepared to lift restrictions as soon as the transmission rate had lowered. One person close to him said they did not recognise the idea of different camps within cabinet and stressed he was supportive of the scientific advice.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Liz Truss, international trade secretary</strong><br>Truss believes that restoring global trade as quickly as possible could be a key way to support the country economically and she would be keen to see lockdown restrictions lifted incrementally sooner rather than later.

Broadly he has been trying to avoid criticising the government, but in an interview with the BBC\u2019s <strong>Victoria Derbyshire</strong> he got sucked into the argument about whether Boris Johnson was at fault for missing five meetings of the Cobra emergency committee on coronavirus in the early weeks of the crisis.</p> \n  <p>This was the central allegation in <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\">a Sunday Times Insight investigation published yesterday (paywall).</a> That prompted the government to publish <a href=\"https://healthmedia.blog.gov.uk/2020/04/19/response-to-sunday-times-insight-article/\">a 2,000-word rebuttal last night</a> that said, among other things, that the Sunday Times was wrong to say Cobra was normally chaired by the PM.</p> \n  <p>Asked if Johnson should have attended those Cobra meetings, Blair largely avoided the invitation to criticise the PM - although he did insinuate that Johnson might have been somewhat negligent. Blair said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I just don\u2019t want to be in that game because I know how difficult it is for all of them.</p> \n   <p>People ask me: were there any Cobra meetings you missed? The frank answer is I can\u2019t remember at this distance of time. Obviously if you have Cobra it\u2019s because it is a serious emergency.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m sure the people in government have been doing everything they possibly can. I think the most important thing is not who\u2019s doing their job well and who\u2019s doing it badly, it\u2019s whether you have the right combination of skill at the centre of government to handle some of these things.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Derbyshire came back to the topic towards the end of what was a long interview, and this time she did get Blair to come out with a more direct criticism. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you talk to people in government themselves, I think what they would say is in the period of the initial start of the disease, in the period in other words between the start of the disease and the suppression, I think most people would accept the government was somewhat behind the curve. It is easy to say that with hindsight, but I think people probably accept that, even in government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf954d82195629d78ca19a68b9fcd506151eaa03\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf954d82195629d78ca19a68b9fcd506151eaa03/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophy Ridge | Sky</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T09:08:18.388Z\">at 10.08am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d60318f08b7689b031945\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T08:43:07.791Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Scotland\u2019s emergency hospital for Covid-19 patients, the NHS Louisa Jordan, will be ready to receive patients from today after construction on the \u00a343m facility was finished.</p> \n  <p>The facility was built in around 18 days in exhibition halls at the Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow, and will initially offer 300 beds with the potential to expand capacity to 1,036 beds.</p> \n  <p>Although the majority of emergency coronavirus hospitals in the UK are named after Florence Nightingale, a pioneer of professional nursing who ran field hospitals in the Crimean War, the Scottish site is named after a nurse who died treating troops in Serbia in 1915, during a typhus outbreak.</p> \n  <p>Its completion comes amid growing confidence the facility will not be needed as the number of critical cases in Scotland shows signs of plateauing.</p> \n  <p>Although weekend data does not cover all fatalities, it emerged yesterday that 10 more people had died in hospital in Scotland from Covid-19, bringing the death toll to 903.</p> \n  <p>There has been a further drop in the numbers being treated in intensive care, down by eight, to a total yesterday of 174.

  "<p>Hundreds of doctors have reported having to go without masks, eye protection and gowns in the last week, according to data seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>Doctors short of protective kit include those carrying out high-risk \u201caerosol-generating procedures\u201d with coronavirus patients.</p> <p>The findings are drawn from research by <a href=\"https://www.dauk.org/\">the Doctors\u2019 Association UK</a>, which has launched an app allowing doctors to report shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) in their workplace.</p> <p>Since it was launched a fortnight ago, 1,598 doctors have signed up from 257 NHS trusts and practices, and 1,095 have reported problems.</p> <p>The Guardian has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">recorded</a> 81 deaths of healthcare workers reported in the news, but the true figure is likely to be higher. On Monday, Nursing Notes, a platform run by nurses for others in the profession, said it was aware of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/at-least-100-uk-health-workers-have-died-from-coronavirus-figures-show\">100 deaths</a> of NHS staff and social care workers.</p> <p>The figures on PPE shortages do not necessarily imply that the same proportion of doctors as a whole are experiencing problems, since those facing an issue may be more likely to make a report.</p> <p>Of the doctors reporting problems via the app, 766 said they had no access to the higher-grade FFP3 masks. Some 416 doctors without access to these masks were involved in aerosol-generating procedures such as suctioning Covid-19 patients in ICUs.</p> <p>Gowns have been a particular problem, with 821 doctors reporting not being able to access one. For aerosol-generating procedures the number was 514.</p> <p>While the gown and mask situation has deteriorated since the system was launched on 2 April, the availability of eye protection has improved slightly, with 416 doctors reporting no access to eye protection, including 252 doctors involved with aerosol-generating procedures.</p> <p>Doctors are able to provide comments when they submit their data via the app. One said: \u201cWe\u2019re running short of gowns, visors and masks and we have been asked to reuse single use masks and visors unless visibly contaminated with blood or vomit.\u201d</p> <p>Another said: \u201cI was given a patient gown with plastic sleeves taped on to wear whilst performing a tracheostomy.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, Martin Barkley, the chief executive of the Mid Yorkshire hospitals NHS trust, said his staff had bought 6,000 sets of coveralls owing to very low stocks of long-sleeved gowns.</p> <p>\u201cThe trust, along with many other trusts across the country, has very low stocks of the long-sleeved gowns required for use when staff are working in wards or departments where higher-risk procedures (ie aerosol-generating procedures) are carried out,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe fully recognise these coveralls are not ideal: they are more uncomfortable for staff and are more laborious to take on and off. However, our first priority is to keep our staff safe, and these coveralls will do so in the absence of certainty about the next delivery of long-sleeved gowns.\u201d</p> <p>Doctors and others are setting up new organisations to try to source desperately needed PPE. Jasmine Ho, of <a href=\"https://www.medsupplydrive.org.uk/\">MedSupplyDrive UK</a>, which appeals for unused medical supplies from places such as research laboratories and redirects them to the NHS frontline, said: \u201cWe need contingency plans during this pandemic to ensure that we are suitably prepared for inevitable global PPE shortages.\u201d</p> <p>She said some forms of PPE could be safely decontaminated using hydrogen peroxide vapour and reused, and one British company had designed technology to do this but had no licence to use the technology in the UK.</p> <p>Instead the company had exported its decontamination techniques to the US having been granted a licence by the Food and Drug Administration.</p> <p>Megan Phillips, a partner at Bhatt Murphy, is helping to source PPE and get it to frontline NHS workers via another organisation, <a href=\"https://faceprotectionhub.org/\">Scrub and Face Protection Hub</a>. \u201cWe are trying to coordinate the many efforts to help meet the needs of healthcare staff on the frontline. The present situation is deeply concerning,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Dr Jenny Vaughan, of the Doctors Association, said: \u201cWe are concerned about the real disconnect between the government and the daily experiences of frontline staff who have been reporting their PPE status in droves via our <a href=\"http://nhsppe.com/\">NHSppe.com</a>. Doctors are risking their lives on the frontline and deserve nothing less than the correct levels of PPE.</p> <p>\u201cA more sustainable solution will need to be found in the coming weeks and months to ensure a constant supply of PPE. The science behind any decontamination must be robust in order to keep frontline staff safe. Any evidence based decontamination process chosen should not and cannot offer inferior protection to frontline staff or cause degradation of equipment.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.</p>",
  "<p>The frontline role of local convenience stores during the coronavirus pandemic and the heightened risk to their workers have come into the spotlight as tributes were paid to a popular staff member at a south London corner shop.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"92dbe2ce-3e33-44fd-8eee-cd4b6c6c4225\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>UK data from the Office for National Statistics has revealed that men are almost twice as likely to die from the disease as women. The trend was first seen in China, where <a href=\"http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51\">one analysis</a> found a fatality rate of 2.8% in men compared with 1.7% in women. Since then, the pattern has been mirrored in France, Germany, Iran, South Korea and Italy, where men have accounted for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjgh/2020/03/24/sex-gender-and-covid-19-disaggregated-data-and-health-disparities/\">71% of deaths</a>.</p>\n    <p>So why are men more vulnerable?</p>\n    <p>\u201cThe honest answer is none of us know what\u2019s causing the difference,\u201d said Prof Sarah Hawkes, director of the UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.</p>\n    <p>Early on, smoking was suggested as a likely explanation. In China, nearly 50% of men but only about 2% of women smoke, and so underlying differences in lung health were assumed to contribute to the difference. Smoking might also act as an avenue for getting infected in the first place: smokers touch their lips more and may share contaminated cigarettes.</p>\n    <p>Behavioural factors that differ across genders may also have a role. Some studies have shown that men are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/sites/default/files/assets/1/AssetManager/2010%20Hand%20Washing%20Findings.pdf\">less likely to wash their hands</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2020/01/30/hand-washing-soap-poll-survey\">less likely to use soap</a>, less likely to seek medical care and more likely to ignore public health advice. These are sweeping generalisations, but across a population could place men at greater risk.</p>\n    <p>However, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries, the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\"><b>Hannah Devlin</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Science correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The man, identified for now only as Kumar, had worked at the Freshgo store in Gipsy Hill for more than 10 years.

Then to stay open and working in such a close environment for the sake of the community was the ultimate sacrifice.\u201d</p> \n<p>His death is the latest in a sector providing employment to a significant number of middle-aged men, a group regarded as being at a higher risk than some others, and which also has a large component of people from BAME backgrounds, a demographic that is already bearing a disproportionate brunt of the impact of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>It comes days after another death, that of Raj Aggarwal, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Spar_Wigston/status/1243567758983548929?s=20\">whose last Facebook post </a>showed him dropping off a carload of tea, coffee and biscuits to hospital workers, and who was a board member of the the Association of Convenience Stores.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The ACS\u2019s chief executive, James Lowman, <a href=\"https://www.acs.org.uk/acsblog/raj-aggarwal\">wrote on his blog</a>: \u201cThis is a terrible loss that will be felt personally by many people in our industry, and it should also remind us: there are people putting themselves in harm\u2019s way to help the country through these difficult times, and to lose one of them in Raj is a hard thing to comprehend and accept.\u201d</p> \n<p>He told the Guardian that challenges facing the sector included issues around sourcing and using personal protective equipment (PPE). While public health experts are currently not recommending the use of face coverings, shop owners have been improvising masks of different types, as well as dipping into their own funds to erect screens.</p> \n<p>Some shops have received government support, but others, such as those on petrol station forecourts, have seen sales collapse \u2013 although in the main there had been an big increase in sales, he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a sustained growth in sales, though the pandemic has changed how people have been using our shops,\u201d said Lowman. \u201cIndividuals are tending to make fewer visits, but are loading bigger baskets. While the average spend in \u2018peacetime\u2019, if you want to call it that, might be on average \u00a36.50, that has now doubled. People are also buying different things, so less confectionery perhaps and more household supplies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite this, he added, extraordinary costs were mounting, including for PPE and the cost of employing an extra person in some cases to act as a marshal at the doors.</p>",

  "<p>Your article (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/data-on-bame-deaths-from-covid-19-must-be-published-politicians-warn\" title=\"\">Failure to publish data on BAME deaths could put more lives at risk, MPs warn</a>, 16 April) reports on a government inquiry into the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on black and minority ethnic communities. The article draws attention to what data, if any, will be published. Although important, if this is the only focus of the inquiry, it will distract attention from the real issues.</p> <p>While we have been alarmed by the emerging picture, we have not been surprised. We published an analysis shortly after the start of lockdown, which noted that while the majority of BAME communities were comparatively younger, the impact of discrimination (higher rates of poverty, overcrowding and poorer access to healthcare) increased the risk of the impact of Covid-19. We also highlighted the higher risk faced by healthcare workers from these communities. But what has been shocking \u2013 and should be the focus of any inquiry \u2013 is the lack of action to address the greater risks identified by us and others.</p> <p>The limited focus of the inquiry, combined with news that it is to be conducted by the very organisations that should have been leading action to address disproportionality, does not fill us with confidence. We fear this will end up being an exercise in obfuscation rather than action.<br><strong>Jabeer Butt</strong><br><em>Chief executive, Race Equality Foundation</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a GP working in a large BAME community, I am concerned by the unsupported assumption that low levels of vitamin D in BAME communities is contributing to the disproportionately high numbers affected by Covid-19.</p> <p>Dr Colin Bannon\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/role-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-in-bame-medic-deaths\" title=\"\">letter</a> (15 April) fails to cite a single source of evidence. I\u2019m in support of encouraging all communities to take vitamin D supplements when needed, but without measured vitamin D levels in those admitted to hospital with Covid-19, his assumption is misleading. Without evidential support, Dr Bannon\u2019s conjecture distracts from the overriding issue of health inequality, a topic that many politicians and health authorities would rather not address. </p> <p>In the light of this pandemic, health inequality needs to be investigated. Public Health England must release data on ethnicity and Covid-19 infection rates immediately. The proposed review is only beneficial if the government instructs the National Institute for Health Research, which funds research into healthcare matters, to make an urgent call for research into why BAME groups are disproportionately affected.<br><strong>Dr Grace Okoli</strong><br><em>GP, Lambeth; clinical lecturer at Barts and The London medical school</em></p> <p>\u2022 The tragic deaths of BAME NHS staff cannot go on unchecked. As a second-generation BAME consultant, I know only too well of my genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease. I rarely find any BAME doctor of my age or older who is not being treated for high blood pressure. But that\u2019s not all. Some years ago, I found myself on the point of virtual collapse and diagnosed with a severe vitamin D deficiency. This vitamin is key to the body\u2019s immunity, including to chest infections, and is also likely to be lower in BAME populations.</p> <p>With the combination of a Covid-exposed environment, compounded by high levels of stress and long working hours, it is not surprising that Covid-19 has taken its toll on BAME doctors. Apart from looking after our own health, we also need to be aware that Covid-19 infection is less likely to be mild than in other ethnicities.

  "<p>British applicants for jobs harvesting crops have said farmers have made it virtually impossible for them to secure the work despite a national appeal for a \u201cland army\u201d to save the UK\u2019s fruit and vegetables.</p> <p>Dozens of workers have expressed anger at claims they are too lazy or picky to take the jobs, alleging that farmers are favouring cheap migrant labour.</p> <p>Offers of on-site accommodation in which three or four workers share a caravan were among the most frequent complaints on social media and in emails to the Guardian, after reports that thousands of British workers had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/british-workers-reject-fruit-picking-jobs-as-romanians-flown-in-coronavirus\">turned down jobs</a> and Romanians were being flown in to pick salad.</p> <p>Chay Honey, in Bristol, whose work on festivals has disappeared, said the pay and conditions of the farm work were difficult to justify. \u201cI live with my fiance and to live on site would mean I would only have one day a week for friends and family. They also said you can\u2019t use your own vehicle, which makes getting out to the shops difficult. Very quickly the romance of going to work for a farm to help provide food for the nation has become very unattractive,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems it is very much geared up for migrant labour. We are not looking for special treatment, but the whole system needs to have some flexibility and not just have this blanket approach.\u201d</p> <p>Genevieve Black, in south Wales, said she had been unsuccessful in applications for 10 jobs despite being willing to live on site in Kent, Hampshire or Scotland. \u201cThe idea that Brits are just too lazy to work on farms is just not true,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She is part of a Facebook group, Jobs for Camper Nomads, which is awash with criticism of the farming industry. One poster suggested that farmers could allow applicants with their own camper vans to live on site. \u201cWe are forever being told these are unprecedented times and we are all in it together. UK berry farmers not so much! I am sure with a bit of thought a workable solution can be found.\u201d</p> <p>Alison Harrow, an England Athletics running coach seeking farm work, said she was feeling \u201creally discouraged\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve applied for 200 jobs and you either get \u2018We\u2019ve got enough people now\u2019 or you don\u2019t hear anything back,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, if they have jobs coming up at the end of May or June, why don\u2019t they just allocate those now and just confirm a job?</p> <p>\u201cI get an email from one farm worker recruitment agency saying I have not been shortlisted. How can this be? There seems to be a mismatch between demand for workers and matching workers to farm work.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Marston, the chair of British Summer Fruits, said the business model of fruit farming had been \u201cstructured around a non-UK workforce for many years\u201d because UK workers had shunned the work: \u201cFarms are receiving large numbers of applications and I think it would be unfair to say the industry is not accommodating local workforce.\u201d</p> <p>He appealed for patience among the army of would-be-pickers, saying the season had barely started and that there would be surge in job opportunities at the end of May and June.</p> <p>Tom Bradshaw, vice-president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union ,said he could understand why people felt frustrated over the lack of job offers. \u201cIn a way, the media publicity has come a bit too soon, because the jobs don\u2019t peak until the end of May and June,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He added that a national website that \u201cwould act as a centralised hub for all recruiters\u201d was expected to launch later this week, which would make it easier to match supply to demand. </p>",
  "<p>The cheerful, singing voice inside your musical \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d card is enough to strike horror in the heart of your local recycler.</p> <p>The musical cards, which play a recording when opened, look like plain cardboard, making them easy to accidentally throw in the recycling bin.

Plastic products designed to be used for a few minutes can take decades or longer to decompose.</p> <p>Studies have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/15/single-use-plastics-a-serious-climate-change-hazard-study-warns\">shown</a> the proliferation of single-use plastic is accelerating climate change through greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of its lifecycle. While environmental groups fighting to reduce the use of throwaway plastics have gained visibility in the last few years, the oil industry is investing heavily in a huge surge of plastic production \u2013 which the industry expects to grow by 40% by 2030. The increase in plastics production is to be fueled by the ultra-cheap shale gas flowing from the US fracking boom. The petro-chemical industry has already invested $200bn to build new cracking plants that separate ethane from gas to produce the ethylene needed to make plastics. Another $100bn in investments is planned.</p> <p>Industry often points to recycling as the solution to all those new plastics. Yet only a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/27/how-to-shrink-plastic-footprint-recycling\">fraction</a> of plastic products end up recycled, a problem that was exacerbated when China shut its doors in 2018 to the deluge of plastics from other countries that it had previously been recycling.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2020/03/13/fix-recycling-america/\">US municipalities and recyclers are scrambling</a> to increase the amount of recycling they can do domestically. But these new formulations of hybrid packaging \u2013 items mixing materials like foil, paper and sometimes multiple types of plastics \u2013 stymie recycling solutions and mostly just end up in the trash.</p> <p>Examples include shoes and clothing embedded with electronics; the increasingly popular flexible plastic pouches used to package things like detergent pods, rice and baby food; and recyclable bottles and cans tightly wrapped in extra plastic labeling.</p> <h2><strong>Tiny batteries</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"10cb8e5e2fb41cd24f532d11fd64a7307d6d338f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10cb8e5e2fb41cd24f532d11fd64a7307d6d338f/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Singing cards include toxic electronic waste.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Singing cards include toxic electronic waste.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Cat Finnie/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Singing cards and other products with tiny electronics inside them are especially vexing to recyclers. Not only do they include toxic electronic waste, but when the small batteries get crushed in the machinery inside recycling plants, they have been frequently known to cause fires.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the biggest problems for recyclers right now is all the products containing lithium ion batteries, such as the singing cards, balloons and other novelty products,\u201d said Kate Bailey, the director of research at Eco-Cycle, a Boulder, Colorado, recycler. \u201cThese batteries can spark easily when they get caught in the processing equipment or run over by a front-end loader, and these sparks can lead to disastrous fires in the recycling center.\u201d</p> <p>Recyclers are urging manufacturers to simplify the products they make to make it easy to recycle them.

And they are apt to end up in the ocean and take decades to biodegrade. When choosing laundry detergent, they say, consumers might look for products in unlined boxes or try new formulations such as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LIFE-LDS40-Dissolving-Laundry-Detergent/dp/B06X19KJSY/ref=sr_1_12?dchild=1&amp;keywords=dissolve+eco+strips&amp;qid=1586111040&amp;sr=8-12%20http://lifewithoutplasticblog.com/dizolving-the-laundry-detergent-eco-disaster-while-cleaning-your-clothes/\">concentrated detergent strips</a>, which require no plastic packaging.</p> <p><strong>Bad: </strong>detergent pods packaged in film plastic bag<br><strong>Better: </strong>detergent in recyclable see-thru plastic jugs or cardboard box<br><strong>Best: </strong>laundry detergent strips</p> <p><strong>Bad: </strong>Baby food sold in plastic pouches<br><strong>Better: </strong>The old recyclable glass jars<br><strong>Best: </strong>Make your own from fresh fruits and vegetables</p> <h2>Plastic labels</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1d75a8ca6cf7389198cbc98f8583c53376419efe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d75a8ca6cf7389198cbc98f8583c53376419efe/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Another bugaboo for recyclers is the increasing use of non-recyclable wrappers around perfectly recyclable bottles and cans. For instance most spray cleaners come in bottles made of high-density polyethylene, which can be readily recycled. But first consumers must remove the spraytops, as they are made from different plastics and are not recyclable. Then consumers must find a way to pry off the brightly-colored, printed plastic wraps that packagers are increasingly wrapping around bottles to make the labeling more attractive.</p> <p>\u201cWho does all that? Nobody,\u201d said Sanborn. \u201cWe\u2019ve made recycling too complicated. Who has the time to read a manual for everything they get rid of?\u201d</p> <p>Instead consumers can look for clear-colored or white bottles with the labeling printed on the bottle itself. It\u2019s even better if they choose brands committed to using recycled plastic to make these bottles, such as <a href=\"https://methodhome.com/products/all-purpose-cleaner-french-lavender/\">Method cleaning products</a>. Another great option is for customers to <a href=\"https://housewifehowtos.com/clean/homemade-bathroom-disinfectant-spray-and-scrub/\">mix their own cleaners</a> and reuse the plastic bottles.</p> <p><strong>Bad: </strong>plastic spray bottle wrapped with an extra layer of printed plastic<br><strong>Better</strong>: white or transparent bottle without the extra wrap<br><strong>Best</strong>: make your own cleaner and refill the bottles</p> <p><strong>Bad:</strong> beer cans with plastic wraps or vinyl stickers<br><strong>Better:</strong> regular, very recyclable cans</p> <p>Sanborn says that the best recycling outcomes happen when companies pay to create programs to make sure the waste from their products gets recycled in the end. Such programs are often mandatory in other countries. In the US, a few companies are promoting this type of effort voluntarily, such as <a href=\"https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/gillette#@40.77027075200147:-95.93705549677736zoom:4\">a program to recycle plastic disposable razors </a>coordinated by the company Gillete in partnership with the recycling enterprise, Terracycle. The program allows consumers to mail in their razors to be recycled.</p> <p>\u201cWe should have it so these companies have to have an end-of-life system for all their products,\u201d said Sanborn. \u201cThat\u2019s producer responsibility.\u201d</p> <p><em>This story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on Climate Solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

She has been venturing to Waikiki to surf almost daily, which is still allowed, but beaches are being patrolled on foot and by drone by law enforcement. Every so often, a voice rings out from the drone: <em>Aloha. The stay-at-home order is in effect. Please do not gather or sit on the beach. Water activities are permitted, but please leave immediately after.</em></p> <p>In an effort to gauge intentions of non-locals, other residents who have been surfing in Waikiki said they have talked to travelers out on the water who claimed they were coming to the islands for an extended stay upon arriving at the airport.</p> <p>\u201cPeople from Hawaii have always had this underlying tension with people coming in,\u201d said Bruhl. \u201cPeople here see themselves as a collective considering the whole rather than \u2018I\u2019.

The state also instituted a<a href=\"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/04/11/hawaii-news/arriving-visitors-spur-local-5-to-push-for-hotel-safety/\"> program</a> that is financing return flights for travelers who arrive without accommodations.</p> <p>The state is supposed to be following up with tourists on their whereabouts, but limited resources make it difficult to keep tabs on thousands of new arrivals. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re doing is notifying the hotels, and hotel staff check,\u201d the state adjutant general, Kenneth Hara, told a special legislative committee last week. I spoke with eight individuals who arrived in Hawaii from four US cities in the last week and none have received a follow-up call.</p> <p>The mayors of Honolulu, Kauai and Maui county asked the White House to stop all non-essential travel to Hawaii. Governor Ige rebuked the request, saying it would be up to the airlines and they could not discriminate among essential and non-essential passengers.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a situation where the majority of those who are ordered to quarantine are not obeying,\u201d Ige said. \u201cBut we are continuing to look at improving the system as we go.\u201d</p> <p>Other representatives have <a href=\"https://www.civilbeat.org/2020/04/make-hawaiis-tourist-quarantine-actually-work/?fbclid=IwAR0digUxQlI31pj7fs2zW3e4QE7WM-aQEpgHWM4c68Fjuq9KlgDSKbQ6fwA\">called for stricter responses</a>, similar to that of New Zealand, while hundreds of residents signed a petition demanding shuttered hotels be used to isolate all travelers.</p> <p>Kane has been volunteering with organizations and local chefs to help source and deliver products and meals to multi-family homes and the elderly in Waim\u0101nalo.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/climate-change-waterfront-living-wealthy-boston\">Will climate change end waterfront living?

In the Edwardian times people stayed home in the evenings and didn\u2019t spend money outside the house, didn\u2019t go on holiday very much, the streets had little traffic, you could hear all the church bells ringing, dogs barking, the absolute silence of Sundays, and so on.</p> <p>I suddenly remembered reading this years back and thinking it would be interesting to experience the great Edwardian silence she described, and then of course I realised that we are living in that right now.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tessa Hadley\u2019s Accidents in the Home has also provoked reflections from<em> </em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3663222\">reenimus</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It might not be an ideal time to read a novel about domestic ennui if you are not feeling your usual levels of passion and regard for the partner you are holed up with 24-7 but it\u2019s a very readable book and the worst it could do (all other options being off the table) is make you look up that fellow you knew in the early 90s on LinkedIn.</p> </blockquote> <p>On an entirely different tack, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13121203\">paulburns</a> has enjoyed Jonathan Bardill\u2019s Constantine, Divine Emperor of the Christian Golden Age:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Probably one of the best books you\u2019ll read on Late Antiquity; the equal of the best of Peter Brown. Especially good on archaeology, art history and numismatics. Has nothing in it about Covid-19.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019m about to embark upon the final 25 pages of The Overstory by Richard Powers,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101634258\">Helpmeet</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Destined to become the bible of environment activists, guerilla gardeners, and tree huggers, if it isn\u2019t already a cult book. (I wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019m so far out of the loop that I\u2019m solar-windsurfing on Oumuamua!) I have no hesitation in recommending this novel to anyone who enjoys reading, or being read to.</p> </blockquote> <p>A Hundred Million Years And A Day, written by Jean-Baptiste Andrea and translated by Sam Taylor, has appealed to <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16060838\">TomMooney</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Really enjoyable literary adventure novel. A great book for climbers, dreamers, those with an interest in paleontology. Or, really, anyone whose ever had that burning sense of adventure but never done anything about it \u2026 Well written and beautifully translated (as always, by the excellent Sam Taylor) it is a great story that appealed to the little kid inside me.</p> </blockquote> <p>Enter The Aardvark by Jessica Anthony has been a \u201cgratifying digression\u201d for <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4813196\">safereturndoubtful</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Split between contemporary Washington and Victorian England, this is a whole lot of fun, and as cross genres go, it covers many, contemporary, historical, ghost, horror and even some political satire\u2026</p> <p>It takes a while to pick-up the author\u2019s style, and for that time I felt that I may be chuckling in the wrong places. But that\u2019s credit to her. It\u2019s crisp, refreshing and sharp; a commentary on some key issues in today\u2019s society, abortion, identity and power, blended with Blackadder-esque flashbacks to the 19th century.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2439109\">LeoToadstool</a> is reading Alan Moore\u2019s Watchmen:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not really a comics/graphic novels man myself, but this alternate history of 20th century America, in which masked superheroes take part in the Cold War - and cope with their all-too-human frailties - is absorbing reading and incredibly-well constructed. The early scenes of a deserted New York City, its residents taking shelter from an impending disaster, are quite resonant at this time. Being a fan of postmodernist fiction, I\u2019m also liking the little faux-documentary/encyclopaedic touches throughout the book.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100090602\">GELBuck</a> reports that Jean Rhys\u2019 Wide Sargasso Sea is \u201cindeed brilliant\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t know how Rhys manages to make it so dense with colour and imagery, allusions, secrets, foreshadows of the future but at the same time to be so spare in her language. Poor Antoinette - the Mrs Rochester in Jane Eyre - can almost see her miserable future in England with her new husband. And how do we judge him - grasping, predatory, misunderstood, gullible? This really reminded me of books by and about other dispossessed ruling classes - Elizabeth Bowen, Molly Keane, JG Farrell, Paul Scott and others. Excellent.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is indeed a marvel.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>The women <a href=\"https://crimereads.com/the-women-who-edited-crime-fiction/\">who edited crime fiction</a>.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/education/about-rsc-education/home-learning-with-the-rsc\">Home learning</a> with the Royal Shakespeare Comapny.</p></li> <li><p>April reading: the British Library <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/presences-in-the-waste-land\">look at some of the references in The Waste Land</a>.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v22/n11/edward-said/diary\">When Edward Said met Jean-Paul Sartre</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Publishers grit their teeth and start treading <a href=\"https://www.mhpbooks.com/book-industry-grits-collective-teeth-hard-road-seen-ahead/\">the hard road that lies ahead</a>.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://lithub.com/remember-when-doris-lessing-absolutely-did-not-care-that-she-won-the-nobel-prize/\">Remembering how little Doris Lessing cared about winning the Nobel Prize</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/guardianbooks/\">#GuardianBooks</a>, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.

  "<p>The body of photographer Peter Beard has been found, three weeks after he was reported missing.</p> <p>The 82-year-old, famous for his images of African wildlife, had disappeared from his cliffside compound in Montauk at the tip of Long Island, New York, on 31 March. He had been suffering from dementia. His remains were found in a \u201cdensely wooded area\u201d of Camp Hero State Park, according to the East Hampton police department.</p> <p>Beard rose to fame during the 60s and 70s as he worked from Hog Ranch, a 45-acre property in Kenya he purchased after falling in love with Africa. His work, which could sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars, is often credited with sounding the alarm about human beings\u2019 impact on our environment, years before it became a mainstream concern. His first book, <a href=\"https://www.bjp-online.com/2015/11/peter-beard-the-end-of-the-game/\">The End of the Game</a>, looked at the big game elephant poachers who changed the face of Africa.</p> <p>Beard was also the archetypal American socialite. Born into high society, he mixed with Andy Warhol, Truman Capote, Francis Bacon, Salvador Dal\u00ed and the Rolling Stones, and became a fixture at Studio 54 during its heyday. He sought out adventure. He narrowly escaped death in 1996 when he was charged by an elephant and gored in the right leg. This was far from his only brush with death from venturing in the wild.</p> <p>In a statement, his family said: \u201cWe are all heartbroken by the confirmation of our beloved Peter\u2019s death. Peter was an extraordinary man who led an exceptional life. He lived life to the fullest; he squeezed every drop out of every day.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>It continued: \u201cHis visual acuity and elemental understanding of the natural environment was fostered by his long stays in the bush and the \u2018wild-deer-ness\u2019 he loved and defended. He died where he lived: in nature.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>High levels of air pollution may be \u201cone of the most important contributors\u201d to deaths from Covid-19, according to research.</p> \n<p>The analysis shows that of the coronavirus deaths across 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany, 78% of them occurred in just five regions, and these were the most polluted.</p> \n<p>The research examined levels of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant produced mostly by diesel vehicles, and weather conditions that can prevent dirty air from dispersing away from a city. Many studies have linked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/04/thousands-of-british-children-exposed-to-illegal-levels-of-air-pollution\">NO<sub>2</sub> exposure</a> to health damage, and particularly lung disease, which could make people more likely to die if they contract Covid-19.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe results indicate that long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the Covid-19 virus in these regions and maybe across the whole world,\u201d said Yaron Ogen, at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany, who conducted the research. \u201cPoisoning our environment means poisoning our own body, and when it experiences chronic respiratory stress its ability to defend itself from infections is limited.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The analysis is only able to show a strong correlation, not a causal link. \u201cIt is now necessary to examine whether the presence of an initial inflammatory condition is related to the response of the immune system to the coronavirus,\u201d Ogen said.</p> \n<p>A separate study published on 7 April looked at fine particle pollution in the US and found that even small increases in levels in the years before the pandemic were associated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/air-pollution-linked-to-far-higher-covid-19-death-rates-study-finds\">far higher Covid-19 death rates</a>. Another recent paper noted that the high death rates seen in the north of Italy <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120320601?via%3Dihub=\">correlated with the highest levels of air pollution</a>.</p> \n<p>The new research, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720321215\">published in the journal Science of the Total Environment</a>, compared NO<sub>2</sub> levels in January and February in 66 administrative regions with Covid-19 deaths recorded up to 19 March. Ogen also assessed the atmospheric conditions to see where pollution was being trapped over the regions.</p> \n<p>He found that 78% of the 4,443 deaths were in four regions in northern Italy and one around Madrid in Spain. These five regions had the worst combination of NO<sub>2</sub> levels and airflow conditions that prevented dispersal of air pollution.</p> \n<p>Ogen noted that the Po Valley in Italy and Madrid were surrounded by mountains, which helps trap pollution, as is Hubei province in China, where the pandemic began. \u201cHowever, my research is only an initial indication that there might be a correlation between the level of air pollution, air movement and the severity of the course of the corona outbreaks,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Prof Jonathan Grigg, from Queen Mary University of London, said the study showed an association between Covid-19 deaths and NO<sub>2</sub> levels. \u201cThis association could reflect a causal link between exposure to air pollution and increased vulnerability to fatal Covid infection, but other factors cannot be ruled out at this stage. For example, the study does not adjust for differences in age distribution in different areas.\u201d</p> \n<p>Widespread lockdowns around the world have led to reduced vehicle traffic and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/11/positively-alpine-disbelief-air-pollution-falls-lockdown-coronavirus\">air pollution</a>. However, long-term exposure to dirty air before the pandemic may be more important than current levels of pollution.</p> \n<p>In the UK, NO<sub>2</sub> has been at illegal levels in most urban areas for the last decade. A key policy to reduce NO<sub>2</sub> levels is the introduction of clean air zones, where charges are imposed to deter the most polluting vehicles from city centres. But the introduction of some CAZs has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-cities-postpone-clean-air-zone-plans-due-to-covid-19-crisis\">postponed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-cities-postpone-clean-air-zone-plans-due-to-covid-19-crisis\"> because of the coronavirus crisis</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Jenny Bates, an air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis new study is worrying. We know NO<sub>2</sub> is a toxic gas that inflames the lining of the lungs and reduces immunity to lung infections, so it may not be surprising that people who have suffered in areas with high levels of NO<sub>2</sub> could be more susceptible to coronavirus.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is all the more reason to keep traffic and pollution levels down as much as possible now and get out of this terrible situation with a view to fewer but cleaner vehicles on the road.\u201d </p>",
  "<p>Several European countries took preliminary steps on Monday towards a return to normal pre-virus life, with some shops reopening in Germany and a resumption of school for pupils slotted to take place next month.</p> <p>Bookshops, florists, fashion stores, bike and car outlets and other shops smaller than 800 sq m were permitted to reopen on Monday morning. In Berlin a few schools allowed final-year students to sit exams. Pupils arrived wearing face-masks and took their seats at widely spaced desks.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, however, warned of a possible second wave of coronavirus infection if lockdown measures were abandoned too rapidly. The chancellor urged citizens to stay \u201cdetermined\u201d and said it would be a \u201ccrying shame\u201d if the country which has been praised for its deft handling of the crisis fell into a \u201crelapse\u201d.</p> <p>In a video call with party colleagues Merkel said the \u201cdiscussion orgies\u201d taking place in some German federal states on relaxing curbs on were unhelpful. She said she was \u201cgreatly concerned\u201d the public might let its guard down.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the clear trend across Europe is now towards some form of normalisation. Norway\u2019s government reopened nurseries on Monday after a month-long closure.</p> <p>It said this was possible because children were less affected by Covid-19, adding that the virus was under control. \u201cGoing to pre-school is safe,\u201d Norway\u2019s education minister, Guri Melby, declared.</p> <p>Some parents, however, have criticised the move \u2013 a sentiment also seen in Denmark, where primary schools reopened last week. A Norwegian Facebook group called \u201cMy child should not be a guinea pig for Covid-19\u201d has gathered nearly 30,000 signatures.</p> <p>Polls suggest around a quarter of Norwegian parents do not want to send their children back to pre-school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/lockdownexit-zip/giv-3902MP5ItExoBXF9/\" data-alt=\"lockdown map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/lockdownexit-zip/giv-3902MP5ItExoBXF9/\">lockdown map</a> </figure>  <p>In Poland parks and forests returned to normal on Monday, while in the Czech Republic open-air markets were allowed to resume as part of a six-week strategy to gradually lift restrictions. \u201cThis is relief from the stress that we will have to throw away the harvest,\u201d vegetable grower Milan Vystejn told Reuters, at his stand in Prague\u2019s Tylovo Square.</p> <p>Austria has already reopened some shops. It plans to reopen museums and libraries from mid-May. All three countries have seen significantly fewer coronavirus deaths than the worst affected countries in Europe: Italy, Spain, France and the UK.</p> <p>All European leaders are battling with the same dilemma: how to prevent a renewed outbreak of the virus while at the same time maintaining public confidence, as poorer citizens run out of cash and national economies nosedive.</p> <p>There are growing signs of unrest. Over the weekend police in Berlin struggled with several hundred protesters campaigning against the lockdown. Among them were anti-vaxxers, well known conspiracy theorists and right wing extremists, some of whom accused the government of using the coronavirus crisis to create a dictatorship.</p> <p>In France, meanwhile, there was unrest in the Paris suburb of Villeneuve-La-Garenne, after a motorcyclist collided with the open door of an unmarked police car during a pursuit. Skirmishes lasted into the early hours of Sunday and resumed again on Monday. Protesters burned cars and hurled fireworks at police, whom they accuse of heavy-handed behaviour. In the Russian city of Vladikavkaz, meanwhile, demonstrators protested against the local authorities and the country\u2019s continuing lockdown. Video posted to social media appeared to show protesters pelting the police with rocks, and police making several arrests.</p> <p>On Monday France\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said nurseries, primary and secondary schools would reopen on 11 May.</p> <p>Philippe said the French government was considering options to implement the policy, including having half a class in rotation, or first opening schools in areas where there had been few or no Covid-19 cases. However, he warned the French not to plan too far ahead, saying weddings, parties, and travel outside of France were not immediately on the cards.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have answers today \u2026 given the barrier rules, it doesn\u2019t seem reasonable that a marriage of say 200 people gathered in a confined place is to be envisaged. For how long I don\u2019t know,\u201d Philippe admitted.</p> <p>In Spain, with nearly 200,000 confirmed cases and more than 20,000 deaths, the authorities have said they will hold off lifting restrictions. The rate of infection appears to be going down. The country reported 399 coronavirus deaths over the past 48 hours, lower than Sunday\u2019s figure of 410.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is expected to ask parliament on Tuesday to extend a national lockdown until 11 May. He has proposed that from 27 April children under the age of 12 should be allowed out for exercise \u2013 but not teenagers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p>The global number of deaths topped 165,000 with more than 2.4 million confirmed cases, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University.</p></li> <li><p>Australia reopened three of Sydney\u2019s beaches but only for exercise. \u201cActivities such as sitting on the sand, sun-baking or gathering in groups will not be permitted,\u201d said Danny Said, a local mayor.</p></li> <li><p>India <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-live-news-us-deaths-pass-40000-as-italy-records-lowest-fatalities-in-a-week-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9d43438f08b7689b031872#block-5e9d43438f08b7689b031872\">allowed</a> some industrial and agricultural work to resume, even as the country recorded its single biggest-day rise in coronavirus cases.</p></li> <li><p>In Iran, where the outbreak has killed at least 5,000 people, some major shopping centres opened, including Tehran\u2019s historic grand bazaar.

  "<p>The number of footballers reporting symptoms of depression has doubled since the sport shut down because of Covid-19, a survey by the global players\u2019 union, Fifpro, has found. Anxiety symptoms have also risen amid significant concerns about the long-term impact that coronavirus may have on the football community.</p> <p>Fifpro\u2019s study of 1,602 professional players, conducted between 22 March and 14 April, discovered that 22% of 468 female players and 13% of 1,134 male players reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of depression. It also found that 18% of the women and 16% of men reported markers of generalised anxiety. England, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland were among 16 countries \u2013 all of which have implemented drastic measures to contain Covid-19, such as home confinement \u2013 whose footballers were surveyed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/20/dexter-blackstock-supplying-ppe-former-striker-equipment-to-frontline-staff-coronavirus\">Dexter Blackstock's journey from scoring goals to supplying PPE | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a troubling rise when set along another Fifpro study, conducted in December and January while football seasons were still active in most locations globally, involving a smaller set of 307 players. Back then, 11% of the women and 6% of the men reported symptoms characteristic of depression. Scientific research generally finds women report depression and anxiety in higher numbers than men.</p> <p>Fifpro said that players who felt worried about their future in football were significantly more likely to report depression or anxiety symptoms. Although footballers at the very top level may find themselves financially secure, the average contract length globally is less than two years and the majority experience the same financial considerations as those in other walks of life.</p> <p>Economic uncertainty may partly explain the rise in depression symptoms but other factors are thought to be involved. The mean age of those surveyed was 26, among the male players, and 23 among the female players. Many footballers are young adults who are living, in many cases alone, in foreign countries without families in close proximity. Such an uncertain time appears to be taking a toll on mental health.</p> <p>\u201cIn football, suddenly young men and women athletes are having to cope with social isolation, a suspension of their working lives and doubts about their future,\u201d the Fifpro chief medical officer, Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, said. \u201cSome may not be well equipped to confront these changes and we encourage them to seek help from a person they trust or a mental health professional.\u201d</p> <p>More than 75% of those surveyed said they had access to sufficient resources and support to aid their mental health. Fifpro is developing a mental health toolkit to provide basic primary care for footballers.</p> <p>There is no suggestion from Fifpro that its members\u2019 concerns are more severe than those of people in other areas. Rather, it believes the results of the survey \u2013 conducted with Amsterdam University Medical Centres \u2013 is a reflection of problems in broader society and confirms that a vast number of footballers are affected similarly. </p> <p>The union wants to stress the social responsibility that comes hand in hand with economic decisions made on the nature of football\u2019s continuation, and that it is far more than a question of an entertainment industry returning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThese findings ... underline how important it is that football stakeholders work together during these uncertain times by making collective agreements that maintain social stability and relieve pressure for all employees in the industry, including the players,\u201d the Fifpro general secretary, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, said.</p> <p>Baer-Hoffmann emphasised that Fifpro was not using the survey\u2019s findings as an argument to rush into resuming the football season. Only a resumption in a safe environment in which players felt comfortable and secure would reduce the number of stressors that can contribute to depression and anxiety, he said.</p> <p><em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

  "<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve deliberated, cogitated and digested.\u201d That used to be MasterChef\u2019s quaint catchphrase, way back when it was a 90s teatime oddity, hosted by vowel-mangling saucemonger Loyd Grossman. Few suspected the cult curio had potential as a global giga-franchise. They reckoned without the Simon Cowellification of cookery TV.</p> <p>In 2005, mere months after The X Factor launched, rights to the amateur cook-off were snapped up by Elisabeth Murdoch\u2019s Shine TV. Out went Bostonian brainiac Grossman and in came two shouty presenters-cum-judges: Aussie restaurateur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jul/07/masterchef-john-torode-why-i-love-syndey-australia\" title=\"\">John Torode</a> and Sarf London greengrocer Gregg Wallace, with his job title poshed up to \u201cingredients expert\u201d.

The contest became less about hobby home-cooks and more about ambitious foodies with their eyes on a Michelin-starred career switch. This was gladiatorial gastro-combat in a glinting steel kitchen against a tensely ticking clock. Sob stories were wheeled out. John\u2019n\u2019Gregg left long \u2026 dramatic \u2026 pauses before delivering verdicts.

At its peak, it was crowned the \u201cMost Successful TV Cookery Format\u201d by Guinness World Records.</p> <p>The rot set in around 2011, when Wallace-sampling mash-up \u201cButtery Biscuit Base\u201d went viral and the pud-shoveller decided that calling out a list of ingredients was enough to be considered judging: \u201cYou get the beefiness of mushroom, then the nuttiness of butter, then the sweetness of chilli, then comes cleansing lime.\u201d Stop reading out your Ocado substitutions and form a proper sentence.</p> <p>Torode \u2013 always the more agreeable of the pair \u2013 copped off with Celebrity MasterChef winner Lisa Faulkner, like a curse-of-Strictly showmance with spatulas instead of sequins. Meanwhile, Wallace posted shirtless selfies and got arsey if anyone spelt his name \u201cGreg\u201d. Fatally, the judges became bigger than the show. During the 2015 series, Wallace leered lovingly at Torode: \u201cTen years, three wives, but only one co-judge.\u201d Oh Christ, I\u2019m going to hurl. Can you remember a single winner since Thomasina \u201cWahaca\u201d Miers? No you can\u2019t, despite all those \u201cbiiiiig flavours\u201d and rollercoaster journeys\u2122.</p> <p>It\u2019s now a self-parody on autopilot, where everyone cooks scallops with minted pea puree, followed by chocolate fondant for pud; where Instagram food bores \u201cdeconstruct\u201d dishes that were just fine before, while Wallace and Torode yell into their faces like a wine-flushed Jeremy Clarkson in a Cotswolds carvery. On screen over half the year in various incarnations \u2013 main show, juniors, pros, celebs \u2013 its ubiquity makes Ant and Dec look reclusive. MasterChef has curdled like milk left out on a warm day. This cheese belongs on, yep, a buttery biscuit base. </p>",

Kaine says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The airline has two decades of providing decent jobs, a safe working environment and excellent service for the travelling public. It is a viable and much needed business and without it Australia will struggle to get its economy back on track once the crisis abates. There is still time for the federal government to work on an investment plan to get through this period of crisis and taxpayers will get a double benefit. </p> \n   <p>The government will retain a competitive aviation market and they will get a return on their equity stake.</p> \n   <p>The prime minister has promoted the concept of hibernation, of keeping viable businesses afloat through this crisis. That must include Virgin and the only way to do that is a government equity stake in this business.</p> \n   <p>Countries around the world have recognised the extraordinary circumstances that the aviation is in and where they have stepped in and saved jobs. If the federal government does not move to save Virgin the prime minister must explain why Virgin workers don\u2019t matter? Why don\u2019t their families who depend on them matter?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The union said it had urged the Victorian, NSW and Federal Governments to financially assist Virgin, following a pledge by the Queensland Premier for $200m aid for the airline.</p> \n  <p>A letter from the union read:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While all of Australia is experiencing the stresses of altered life, with many people stood down from their jobs, the anxiety among Virgin staff is heightened given the airline\u2019s difficulties and the fact that they worsen in a very public way on a daily basis. </p> \n   <p>We ask that you consider these workers and to examine your state\u2019s capacity to give them and their families the certainty they need about their future. We believe it is also in the interest of the travelling public that Virgin remains a viable airline to ensure an efficient, reliable service right across Australia.

We\u2019ve invested millions of dollars locally to support Australian publishers through content arrangements, partnerships and training for the industry and hope the code will protect the interests of millions of Australians and small businesses that use our services every day.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

chief executive <strong>Cassandra Goldie</strong> says today\u2019s Grattan Institute report warning of widespread unemployment shows the government must avoid \u201cthrowing up barriers to income support\u201d in the future. </p> \n  <p>Goldie welcomed the temporary boost to welfare payments, but said: \u201c... we can never go back to the low rate of the old Newstart payment of just $40 a day or the punitive approaches that punished and demonised people locked out of paid work.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>This included what <strong>Acoss</strong> considered past approaches such as \u201cdenying payments to people with a small amount of savings, or imposing Work for the Dole and unrealistic job search requirements; the government should meet its own obligations to secure employment for people\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe need to raise the rate for good so those without paid work can cover the basics \u2013 food, housing, electricity \u2013 and they can make the most of job opportunities as the economy rebuilds,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <p>Acoss also wants an expansion in infrastructure investment, such as social housing and improvements in the energy efficiency of homes, to restore growth in employment as the lockdowns are eased. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe need to fix our employment services system to create pathways to jobs for people who are unemployed long term and those at greatest risk, including people leaving education without Year 12 qualifications, older people, people with disability and people with caring responsibilities,\u201d she said. </p> \n

The FSIS pointed out to the Guardian that the number of establishments in category three [it has a rating system to encourage improvement] has been halved since 2017.

  "<p>Boston has endured several tumultuous eras, from being the birthplace of the American revolution to its seesawing fortunes as power and influence was wrested away by other US cities.</p> <p>Now Boston faces its most existential threat yet \u2013 the rising seas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\" data-alt=\"covering climate now series linker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902biaigqdp2WsL/index.html\">covering climate now series linker</a> </figure>  <p>Ironically, Boston is experiencing a surge in waterfront development at the very moment its growing risk to disastrous flooding becomes clear. The refashioning of Boston\u2019s waterfront holds valuable lessons to other cities threatened by sea level rise \u2013 in terms of innovation but also wrenching concerns over displaced communities.</p> <p>The economics are now optimal for developers to repurpose the post-industrial landscape of East Boston and other neighbourhoods in the city but this epoch also comes comes with the added costs of the climate crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIt is an unfortunate quirk of timing,\u201d admitted Nick Iselin, the general manager of development at Lendlease. Last summer, the property company completed the first phase of its <a href=\"https://www.clippershipwharf.com/\">Clippership Wharf development</a> in East Boston, on the Boston Harbor waterfront. Nearly all of the 284 apartments have already been snapped up, with a second site in the same project set to be completed this year. In all, there will be 478 residencies on the seven-acre site.</p> <p>City authorities are planning around a contingency of 40 inches of sea level rise by 2070 \u2013 a scenario that would inundate large swathes of Boston.</p> <h2>Historical risk</h2> <p>The seeds of Boston\u2019s vulnerability to the climate crisis was unknowingly sown as the city became a bustling trading port in the 1800s. The booming city tripled in geographic land area by filling in tidal flats and marshland with rocks and dirt, using this land for residential housing as well as sights such as Faneuil Hall and the New England Aquarium. Planes landing at Boston\u2019s Logan international airport rumble along filled-in land that was once a string of islands.</p> <p>The core of the city is perched on low-lying land along a lengthy artificial shoreline \u2013 a perilous situation in an era when seawater is piling up along the US east coast from the heating-up of the seas and the melting of glaciers. Boston is now the world\u2019s eighth most vulnerable coastal city to potential damages from sea level rise, <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/08/19/coastal-cities-at-highest-risk-floods\">according to the World Bank</a>.</p> <p>The sea that laps at Boston rose by nine inches over the past century, with diverse districts such as Dorchester facing the prospect of being drowned by the end of the century. Already, some Boston streets flood even on sunny days, just with the high tide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ad31a53676a004685947dc54b76b09fe4aae7a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ad31a53676a004685947dc54b76b09fe4aae7a4/0_151_3782_2270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Boston firefighter wades through flood waters on the Long Wharf.

Clippership Wharf is flanked by two other expensive developments in varying stages of construction, both using standard forms of reinforced seawalls and barriers to stop their investments becoming inundated.</p> <p>But Lendlease is embracing an approach more attuned to nature, one that leans upon the idea of living with the encroaching water rather than waging war against it \u2013 an ethos more common in the Netherlands or Venice than the US. Clippership Wharf has Boston Harbor\u2019s first \u201cliving shoreline\u201d \u2013 a network of natural plantings, salt marshes, rocky beaches and wildlife habitats aimed at dissipating waves from storms and subtly taming the high tides.</p> <p>You get from the condos to the waterfront via a series of tiered grassy embankments that bring you down to a publicly-accessible boardwalk overlooking a jumble of rocks and, on one side, the remnants of an antiquated seawall that has been partially given over to the water and seeded with salt marshes to provide a more natural buffer to the advancing harbor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=13%20million%20people%20in%20US&amp;title=could%20be%20displaced%20by%202010%2C%20says%20study\" data-alt=\"Displaced\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=13%20million%20people%20in%20US&title=could%20be%20displaced%20by%202010%2C%20says%20study\">Displaced</a> </figure>  <p>Seawalls, by contrast, often cause the erosion of land or beach in front of them and can simply push water on to neighbouring properties. In many ways, this Boston development is a model for how America should be building on the coastline in an age of climate breakdown.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve repatriated the shoreline with native species, this is more like what it would have been 150 years ago,\u201d Iselin said. \u201cIn four or five years you\u2019ll see the salt marsh starting to take shape.</p> <p>\u201cI think it takes a certain caliber of developer to think that way, but I think more and more developers are. The challenge is not thinking that way, it\u2019s figuring out a way to implement it because the solutions are more difficult, both from a regulatory perspective and from a cost perspective.\u201d</p> <p>The developers haven\u2019t left too much to chance \u2013 Clippership Wharf has been elevated to 14ft above the average high tide in the harbor, which waxes and wanes every six hours. Deployable wooden barriers are slotted into place ahead of a storm, while an underground car garage includes water pumps and an emergency back-up generator.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a9900c7fe9c79a9c21ae968c89a691bf0e64085\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a9900c7fe9c79a9c21ae968c89a691bf0e64085/0_0_2360_1608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Clippership Wharf development in East Boston, on the Boston Harbor waterfront.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Clippership Wharf development in East Boston, on the Boston Harbor waterfront.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Wonsek Art Works Inc</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These adaptions caused consternation among city authorities about a gradient mismatch with surrounding streets but the inclines are fairly gentle and are still wheelchair-accessible.</p> <p>A more potent concern is that the climate crisis is accelerating existing gentrification of what was once a solidly working class area. Apartments at Clippership Wharf will cost you about $5,500 a month<strong> </strong>for three bedrooms, with condos available to buy for as much as $1.75m.</p> <p>These new abodes are built on a site that was vacant for 30 years, a patch of contaminated soil left over from the heyday of the harbor being a frenzy of goods shipped on to wharves that stretched out into the water. Lendlease has clearly done a sterling job of opening up a waterfront path to the general public, but the \u201cperception of gentrification is very real\u201d, Iselin conceded.</p> <h2>\u2018We are a hub of immigrants\u2019</h2> <p>Boston has one of the more progressive city leaderships when it comes to the climate crisis \u2013 its <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/preparing-climate-change\">Climate Ready Boston plan</a> sets out the challenge in detailed and stark terms \u2013 but, still, low-income residents of East Boston worry that they will be the worst hit when the water starts lapping on to roads and into basements.</p> <p>The city has had one near miss \u2013 Superstorm Sandy, which crunched into New York City in 2012, would have left many Bostonians hip-deep in water had it arrived at high, rather than low, tide. Some residents, not shielded by the expansive defenses and water pumps of the new developments, fear they won\u2019t be so lucky next time.</p> <p>\u201cWhere I live was built in 2003 and that was not built to be climate resilient \u2013 all the critical utilities are in the basement, which could flood,\u201d said Magdalena Ayed, the founder of environmental justice group <a href=\"https://www.harborkeepers.org/\">the Harborkeepers</a> who lives in subsidized housing just a few hundred feet from Clippership Wharf. \u201cThe question is where does the water go (from the new development), will it go in and behind to us?\u201d</p> <p>Originally from Argentina, Ayed moved to Boston 14 years ago and has seen East Boston\u2019s waterfront rapidly change into a place where only the relatively wealthy, perhaps working in Boston\u2019s growing biotech sector, are able to afford. The new developments will only push up rents for everyone else, she worries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a22e9d7f56fc51a064e00feeb047800f151985de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a22e9d7f56fc51a064e00feeb047800f151985de/0_0_2880_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apartments at Clippership Wharf cost about $5,500 a month for three bedrooms, with condos available to buy for as much as $1.75m.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apartments at Clippership Wharf cost about $5,500 a month<strong> </strong>for three bedrooms, with condos available to buy for as much as $1.75m.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Wonsek Art Works Inc</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBoston was built on the backs of hardworking people, we are a hub of immigrants \u2013 Ukrainians, Irish Americans, Italian Americans, Vietnamese, Latinos and north Africans,\u201d Ayed said. \u201cThat\u2019s still the case but it\u2019s changing. I don\u2019t even make a living wage, I wish I could afford to live in one of these new buildings but I can\u2019t. I probably won\u2019t be able to ever afford it.\u201d</p> <p>Ayed said that Lendlease \u201cdeserves a lot of credit\u201d for thoughtfully protecting its patch of the shoreline but said she\u2019s worried about the impact of flooding upon the elderly and less mobile in the public housing behind the new developments. In 2018, two nasty storms threatened to flood East Boston homes, with public transport grinding to a halt.</p> <p>\u201cThe bigger question is whether we should even be building in these flood zones,\u201d Ayed said. \u201cThe whole managed retreat issue is the elephant in the room.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/25/red-hook-climate-change-floodplain-hurricane-sandy-gentrification\">Red Hook: the hip New York enclave caught between gentrification and climate change</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Leadership</h2> <p>Boston, a famously feisty city not prone to meek surrender, certainly isn\u2019t contemplating the abandonment of its waterfront. The mayor, Marty Walsh, has committed 10% of the city\u2019s budget to making Boston more resilient to climate change, through a series of efforts to raise pathways, erect seawalls and install natural barriers known as berms. A competing idea, to creating an enormous harbor barrier costing around $12bn, has been shelved.</p> <p>The task of transforming Boston into a modern, climate-adapted place while not pushing out its long-term working class is a conundrum that is set to play out in other cities along America\u2019s eastern seaboard. The issue of climate gentrification is already starting to bite in Miami, for example, where minority communities long established on higher ground have complained they are being inundated by shiny new apartment blocks for wealthy residents who are seeking safer ground.</p> <p>\u201cAs we look at resilience, equity has to be at the heart of it,\u201d said Christopher Cook, Boston\u2019s chief of environment, energy and open space, who pointed to several projects around Boston aimed at protecting low-income neighborhoods rather than displacing them.</p> <p>\u201cSuccess is giving everyone equal access to the harbor. The real benefit of nature based solutions is that they can be adaptive, you can give socially vulnerable populations a recreation space. Seawalls can\u2019t do that. But we have to be concerned (about gentrification). If this is all just for wealthy people we won\u2019t have been successful.\u201d</p> <p>Even for a city with a detailed plan, there are gaps to fill in. Boston can require developers to erect berms, for example, but who then is responsible for maintaining them? If developers are left to protect their own plot of land, how do you best ensure there is a coherent, joined-up response to sea level rise along the whole waterfront? Who pays for all of this?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a4c6dfebae8a9f049b8d833cc0ae0bb26a53714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a4c6dfebae8a9f049b8d833cc0ae0bb26a53714/0_0_1263_758/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boston isn\u2019t contemplating the abandonment of its waterfront.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boston isn\u2019t contemplating the abandonment of its waterfront.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Dunwell/ Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Big cities like Boston can muddle through a lot of these questions themselves but the vast US coastline faces a hopefully mismatched response to the swelling seas.

And in summer and fall, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/04/02/above-average-atlantic-hurricane-season-predicted-including-possible-major-hurricane-strike/\">forecasters predict</a> \u201cabove average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States\u201d. We\u2019re already seeing this catastrophic convergence elsewhere: In Ecuador, <a href=\"https://earther.gizmodo.com/this-is-what-climate-change-looks-like-in-an-era-of-cov-1842539967\">a muted government response</a> to flooding in indigenous communities, for fear of spreading the virus; in Fiji, devastated by Cyclone Harold this week, 19 confirmed coronavirus cases are casting doubt on how to rebuild.</p> <p>Here too, we will need to find ways to do the needed relief work without deepening the pandemic. Amid all this suffering, the case for bold moves to tackle the miseries of inequality, Covid, and climate at once will get clearer.</p> <p>Moreover, green stimulus is the only option for a smooth transition to the 21st century green economy. The era of dirty energy is ending. Even the conservative CBNC analyst Jim Cramer has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/jim-cramer-investors-should-sell-oil-stocks-on-any-rumored-opec-deal.html\">warned investors</a> that oil stocks are no longer safe investments, as society is increasingly repudiating fossil fuels. Giant investors like Blackrock are gradually <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/business/dealbook/larry-fink-blackrock-climate-change.html\">winding down</a> their investments in carbon. And at the <a href=\"https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/04/14/european-leaders-push-green-recovery-plan-for-post-covid-economy/\">European</a> level, and in countries like <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/germany-touts-green-stimulus-in-post-covid-19-policy-push\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/04/16/south-korea-embraces-eu-style-green-deal-for-covid-19-recovery/#7089bc4a5611\">South Korea</a>, a green stimulus-based recovery is becoming the consensus choice, with investments in efficiency and clean energy seen as obvious drivers of economic reconstruction.</p> <p>Here in the US, green stimulus is easily the best way to create good jobs through public investment. <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTOGMC/Resources/Measuring_the_employment_impact_of_energy_sector1.pdf\">According to a 2011 World Bank</a> study, $1m invested in the oil and gas in the United States creates just five jobs, compared to 17 jobs per million dollars invested in energy-saving building retrofits, 22 jobs for mass transit, 13 for wind, and 14 for solar. <a href=\"https://rael.berkeley.edu/publication/putting-renewables-and-energy-efficiency-to-work-how-many-jobs-can-the-clean-energy-industry-generate-in-the-us/\">Kammen\u2019s research</a> and that of <a href=\"https://citizensclimatelobby.org/laser-talks/jobs-fossil-fuels-vs-renewables/\">other institutes</a> all concur that investment in a modern green economy is a more efficient job creator than the fossil sector.</p> <p>The longer-term vision of the green stimulus is a more rewarding, lifelong career of dignified green work. We should also invest in Stem education for all<em> </em>children and create apprenticeship programs in vulnerable communities, matched with new careers for workers to enter. And by directly investing in frontline communities, following <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/california-climate-investments\">best practices</a> in California, we can bring technologies like solar and battery storage to neighborhoods that have been <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/report-finds-wide-racial-and-ethnic-disparities-in-rooftop-solar\">scandalously left out</a> of the clean energy boom so far. Plus, these same nimble, local solutions make neighborhoods more resilient to extreme weather. Local storage and nested microgrids make the power system, including healthcare facilities, more reliable during disasters. We\u2019d be making environmental, economic, and social improvements in the same places, at the same time.</p> <p>And we should speak of green investments in concrete terms. <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/memos/green-industrial-policy\">Polling conducted</a> by Data for Progress in March finds majority support for massive green spending overall. More interesting is the finding of even greater support \u2013 including majority Republican approval \u2013 for <em>specific</em> public green investments, like electric buses, retrofits to low-income housing, and renewable energy. Strip away abstract rhetoric, and the substance that we\u2019re advocating is incredibly popular.</p> <p>For these reasons, we recently joined nine other experts in social and climate policy to write a letter to Congress outlining a menu of policy options for a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@green_stimulus_now/a-green-stimulus-to-rebuild-our-economy-1e7030a1d9ee\">Green Stimulus</a>. Our proposals span eight sectors of the economy. But fundamentally, a Green Stimulus is about mobilizing massive public funds \u2013 say, $2tn to start \u2013 in specific green investments to create high-quality jobs and improve the quality of life, especially in low-income communities, communities of color, and indigenous communities, which have suffered the most disinvestment and pollution in recent decades.</p> <p>It seems counterintuitive, but the timing for such a Green Stimulus is perfect. Bridge-loans and advance payments on public green purchases of goods like solar panels and electric vehicles for public use would stabilize firms\u2019 and workers\u2019 finances. Announcing initiatives like a Climate Conservation Corps would give young people eager to work jobs to apply for, and plan to start. And desk workers across the economy could get on Zoom and do paperwork to make green projects shovel-ready the minute it\u2019s safe to break ground. (Indeed, <a href=\"https://weatherization.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/pdf/WAPRecoveryActEvalFinalReports/ORNL_TM-2015_139.pdf\">a major reason</a> the 2009 Obama stimulus faltered was months wasted on paperwork.)</p> <p>Each of us has lived through climate-fueled disasters \u2013 in Cohen\u2019s case, Hurricane Sandy, and in Kammen\u2019s, last year\u2019s devastating wildfires. We agree with the environmental justice advocates who argued then that disaster recovery shouldn\u2019t be about trying to <a href=\"https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/04/advocate-climate-policy-must-also-address-inequality/\">bounce </a><em><a href=\"https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/04/advocate-climate-policy-must-also-address-inequality/\">back</a></em> to how things were before the disaster. We don\u2019t want to bounce back to a January 2020 economy when half the country lived paycheck to paycheck; unchecked carbon pollution endangered our future; and <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pke94n/cancer-alley-has-some-of-the-highest-coronavirus-death-rates-in-the-country\">racial</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/climate/air-pollution-coronavirus-covid.html\">inequalities</a> made people of color so vulnerable to disease. Rather, by deploying a Green Stimulus that centers workers and communities, we can bounce forward together.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Daniel Aldana Cohen is a</em><em>ssistant p</em><em>rofessor of s</em><em>ociology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he directs the Socio-Spatial Climate Collaborative, or (SC)2, and is a co-author of A Planet to Win: Why We Need a Green New Deal</em></p></li> <li><p><em>Daniel Kammen is p</em><em>rofessor at the University of California, Berkeley, c</em><em>oordinating l</em><em>ead a</em><em>uthor for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and former Science Envoy for the United States Department of State</em></p></li> <li><p><em>This story is a part of Covering Climate Now\u2019s week of coverage focused on climate solutions, to mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.

  "<p>Just about any aspect of the current global situation sounds like a<strong> </strong>dystopian movie. But if you\u2019d told me that I\u2019d one day find myself hiding from a deadly virus in a small apartment with my ex-fiance, I\u2019d probably have run on to the streets screaming.</p> <p>Which is not an option available to me right now.</p> <p>Instead, I\u2019m stuck in lockdown with the person I once thought I\u2019d marry but who I belatedly realized \u2013 to borrow a metaphor \u2013 would never renounce dogs and become the cat person I always dreamed of.</p> <p>Is it possible to make it through such a bizarre scenario unscathed? Here\u2019s what I\u2019m learning.</p> <h2>The breakup</h2> <p>We had a great origin story. I met him at a night-time videogame event<strong> </strong>outside a castle. I muttered something to myself, and the darkness laughed in reply. After some conversation with the shadowy figure, we went back inside and I was delighted to find he was handsome and interesting. We became friends, and several years later when his girlfriend was out of the picture, a couple.</p> <p>We moved in after just six weeks together, into a cupboard-sized apartment. We bonded over a mutual love of birds and quickly started adopting rescues: at one point, we had 23 and couldn\u2019t hear ourselves above the chirping. He reluctantly allowed me to fulfill my dreams and get a cat, although he was less pleased about the second and downright angry about the third.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/music-productivity-working-from-home\">Music can boost your productivity while working from home \u2013 here's how</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Disagreements over the cats were the first crack. I longed to be married, which led to a very unwise engagement after three years together. The final year was peppered with volcanic arguments \u2013 he was working all hours, I wasn\u2019t helping enough at home, the third cat kept throwing up everywhere.</p> <p>As luck would have it, we broke things off just after we\u2019d signed a year-long apartment contract. I made plans to move out and find a replacement tenant, and then coronavirus hit.</p> <h2>The arguments</h2> <p>We hadn\u2019t seen a whole lot of one another before lockdown kicked in because my ex was doing the healthy thing and getting on with his life. He was out almost every night and weekend, so we\u2019d have short, snatched conversations in the kitchen about whether we needed any more dish soap, and not much else.</p> <p>Sheltering in place meant we were in the same room a lot more. Inevitably, we talked.</p> <p>I learned the hard way that even a casual, funny story<strong> </strong>about how badly online dating was going for me was not welcome. He hit the roof and made it very clear that there would be no discussion of dating, new partners, or that guy I went out with for a few weeks after him.</p> <p>And of course, our breakup raised its unwelcome head.</p> <p>The resulting arguments were some of our worst. We rehashed the problems that caused the split, the unsolved grievances about how each of us handled it (me: terrible rebound boyfriend, him: stonewalling), and whether we still loved each other (yes, surprisingly). No one gained anything from it but resentment.</p> <h2>Reconsidering the relationship</h2> <p>A few weeks of cabin fever later, I was seeing him with new eyes. He was no longer at work all the time, we\u2019d had some fun conversations and movie nights, and our former love nest was the only safe place left. It was intoxicating, like being the last two people on earth.</p> <p>We slipped back into our former way of communicating. With the little in-jokes and made-up words, it started to feel so much like old times that I even accidentally called him \u201cbaby\u201d.</p> <p>Add to this the fact that we were being kind to one another \u2013 I\u2019d make him hot drinks, he\u2019d bring me back little treats when he ventured outside, and offered warm hugs and reassurance when it all got too scary and I broke down crying \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see<strong> </strong>how our next terrible argument started.</p> <p>Sitting on the couch gazing at the man I\u2019d loved for so long, I wrote him a long text message about trying again. It seemed too huge to say out loud.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t go down well. In fact, the response was a bit like splitting up all over again, only with no exit door.</p> <p>He told me unequivocally that it was over for good, and that our breakup had done exactly that: broken us. The kindness and gestures were partly because he still cares about me, and partly because he\u2019s a nice person in a strange situation. I\u2019ve had to learn to stop reading into them.</p> <h2><strong>Old intimacies</strong></h2> <p>One of the best things about living with a partner is getting to be unashamedly yourself. I\u2019ve realized that this applies even with an ex. Those lines have already been crossed, we don\u2019t have to uncross them just because we\u2019re in a pandemic.</p> <p>We had separate bedrooms when we were together because he kicks like a mule in his sleep, so there was no awkward bed situation to navigate. But he still comes to shower in my en-suite bathroom, even when my underwear is all over the floor. And I\u2019m still my most authentic self with him \u2013 the worst jokes, the stained pyjamas, the craziest quarantine hair.</p> <p>And when we both fell ill at the same time (not with Covid-19, thankfully), we were still able to laugh about the symptoms.<strong> </strong>Thankfully, he\u2019s someone I can count on to bring me another toilet roll in my time of need.</p> <h2>Reflections on the oddest time of my life</h2> <p>At this point, no one knows how long lockdown will last. Everything feels surreal, but nothing more so for me than sharing takeout with my former fiance, laughing at old jokes, knowing he\u2019d rather be anywhere but here.</p> <p>This extra time with him has reminded me why I fell in love with him, even as I know there are painful parts to come, like splitting up our shared belongings.</p> <p>The birds are going with him. But the cats? They\u2019re mine.</p>",
  "<p>It can feel wrong, or simply impossible, to focus on anything other than getting through this most challenging moment. It is reasonable to argue that since lessons will not reduce our immediate suffering, we should learn them once we\u2019re through this. But the vulnerability that makes the present so painful is exactly why some discussions cannot wait. The suffering we stand to reduce or increase by the threads of action that we begin to unwind now could be magnitudes of what we\u2019re currently experiencing.</p> <p>Imagine that while your country practised social distancing, your neighbouring country responded to Covid-19 by packing citizens into gymnasiums by the tens of thousands. Imagine if, in addition, they instituted genetic and pharmaceutical interventions that helped their citizens maintain productivity under such adverse conditions, even though this had the unfortunate side effect of devastating their immune systems. And to complete this dystopian vision, imagine if your neighbours simultaneously reduced their number of doctors tenfold. Such actions would radically increase death rates not only within their country, but yours. Pathogens do not respect national boundaries. They are not Spanish or Chinese.</p> <p>Pathogens do not respect species boundaries, either. Influenza and coronaviruses move fluidly between human and animal populations, just as they move fluidly between nations. When it comes to pandemics, there is not animal health and human health \u2013 not any more than there is Korean health and French health. Social distancing works only when everyone practises it, and \u201ceveryone\u201d includes animals.</p> <p>The meat that we eat today overwhelmingly comes from genetically uniform, immunocompromised, and regularly drugged animals lodged by the tens of thousands into buildings or stacked cages \u2013 no matter how the meat is labelled. We know this, and most of us would strongly prefer it be otherwise. But we would prefer a lot of things in the world that aren\u2019t so and, for most of us, the future of animal farming is low on our list of priorities, especially now. It is understandable to be most concerned with oneself. The problem is, we aren\u2019t doing a good job of being selfish.</p> <p>We don\u2019t yet know the full history of the emergence of Covid-19, the particular strain of coronavirus that now threatens us. But with recent pandemic virus threats from influenza viruses such as<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html\"> H1N1 (swine flu)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/h5n1-people.htm\">H5N1 (bird flu)</a> there is no ambiguity: those viruses evolved on chicken and pig factory farms. Genetic analyses have shown that crucial components of H1N1 emerged from a virus circulating in North American pigs. But it is commercial poultry operations that appear to be the Silicon Valley of viral development.</p> <p>It is on chicken factory farms that we have most frequently found viruses that have mutated from a form found only in animals into a form that harms humans (what scientists call \u201cantigenic shift\u201d). It is these \u201cnovel\u201d viruses that our immune systems are unfamiliar with and that can prove most deadly.</p> <p>Of <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu%2Fpandemic-resources%2Fmonitoring%2Firat-virus-summaries.htm&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C7b6bfb3bb84047f840d208d7e18037bc%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637225813109294161&amp;sdata=736Z4bJxFJCB3PPiovRw%2Bdc%2BQjkz8MdM6T8acoCWNEI%3D&amp;reserved=0\">16 strains</a> of novel influenza viruses currently identified by the CDC as \u201cof special concern,\u201d including H5N1, 11 come from viruses of the H5 or H7 type. In 2018 a group of scientists analysed the 39 antigenic shifts, also called \u201cconversion events,\u201d that we know played a key role in the emergence of these particularly dangerous strains. Their <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frontiersin.org%2Farticles%2F10.3389%2Ffvets.2018.00084%2Ffull&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C7b6bfb3bb84047f840d208d7e18037bc%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637225813109294161&amp;sdata=bwdH2qZZjRMkBHrLklF5NOgpa5BtMXGT4r%2BDHZiejX4%3D&amp;reserved=0\">results</a> prove that \u201call but two of these events were reported in commercial poultry production systems\u201d.</p> <p>Imagine if our military leaders told us that almost every terrorist in recent memory had spent time in the same training camp, but no politician would call for an investigation of the training camp. Imagine if we knew that those terrorists were developing weapons more destructive than any that has been used, or tested, in human history. This is our situation when it comes to pandemics and farming.</p> <p>The United States CDC is the abbreviation for an agency whose name is actually the Centers for Disease Control <em>and Prevention. </em>We drop <em>prevention</em> from the acronym, which is innocent enough. But we also tend to drop serious discussion of prevention in favour of tactics for responding once pandemics hit. This is understandable \u2013 especially in the midst of a pandemic \u2013 but recklessly dangerous. We are preoccupied with the production of face masks, but we appear unconcerned with the farms that are producing pandemics. The world is burning and we are reaching for more fire extinguishers while gasoline soaks through the tinder at our feet.</p> <p>To reduce risk of pandemics for ourselves, our gaze needs to turn to the health of animals. In the case of wild animal populations, such as the bats that scientists have theorised as a probable origination point for Covid-19, the best solution seems to be to limit and regulate human interaction. Much has rightly been written on this and, slowly and unevenly, policies seem to be moving in the right direction. As it became established that a number of people contracted the virus after visiting a wet market in Wuhan, where the virus likely passed through humans from bats via an intermediate host, China shut down 19,000 wildlife-farming operations and banned meat from wild animals at wet markets.</p> <p>In the case of farmed animals, though, the lack of public understanding has allowed unscrupulous corporations to move policy in exactly the wrong direction. Across the globe, corporations have succeeded in creating policies that use public resources to promote industrial farming. One <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2019%2Fsep%2F16%2F1m-a-minute-the-farming-subsidies-destroying-the-world&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C7b6bfb3bb84047f840d208d7e18037bc%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637225813109304156&amp;sdata=GLpuUPdx6rQhukwztXyJ4GBHrQhsktxUJcwrUm%2FAdm4%3D&amp;reserved=0\">study</a> suggests that the public is providing $1m per minute in global farm subsidies, overwhelmingly used to prop up and expand the current broken model. The same $1m a minute that promotes factory farming also increases pandemic risk.</p> <p>In the US, the death rate for Covid-19 has been less than 2%, but had this been, say, H5N1 the death rate would be far higher \u2013 the CDC reports a <a href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu%2Favianflu%2Fh5n1-people.htm&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C7b6bfb3bb84047f840d208d7e18037bc%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637225813109304156&amp;sdata=Zb8vPV9oPivRrGILQHvQCs0STXVYHsW051owYDo2XUI%3D&amp;reserved=0\">60% death rate</a>. After a spike of H5N1 deaths in 2017, the virus\u2019s spread subsided for reasons that remain unclear. Should we be relieved? <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/pdf/castelbrando/nancy_j_cox.pdf\">Nancy Cox,</a> who led CDC\u2019s influenza operations for more than two decades, has emphasised: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how the story\u2019s going to end.\u201d H5N1\u2019s failure to reach pandemic proportions simply means we have a terrorist kicking around who is just one small viral mutation away from obtaining the equivalent of a nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>The implications of a 1-2% death rate are all around us: half of the world is living under stay-at-home orders, children don\u2019t go to school, hospitals are running out of life-saving equipment, we are facing a generational financial depression, and the funeral services that have traditionally allowed us at least to mourn together are being (rightfully) banned. Can we extrapolate the implications of a 60% death rate in our imaginations? That would be a 30-fold increase over our current situation. What if the next pandemic didn\u2019t spare children? The death rate for children infected with H5N1 approaches 50%. How does it feel if you imagine one person you love a coin toss away from a horrible death? Try imagining if half of everyone you know who had the flu last year was now dying. If you have children, how many of them had the flu last year? Force yourself to imagine these things then ask yourself: how much would it be worth sacrificing now to avoid that happening?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/industrial-sized-pig-and-chicken-farming-continuing-to-rise-in-uk\">Industrial-sized pig and chicken farming continuing to rise in UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This leads to the most pertinent question: What can we do? The link between factory farming and increasing pandemic risk is well established scientifically, but the political will to curtail that risk has, in the past, been absent. Now is the time to build that will. It really does matter if we talk about this, share our concerns with our friends, explain these issues to our children, wonder together about how we should eat differently, call on our political leaders, and support advocacy organisations fighting factory farming. Leaders are listening. Changing the most powerful industrial complex in the world \u2013 the factory farm \u2013 could not possibly be easy, but in this moment with these stakes it is, maybe for the first time in our lifetimes, possible.</p> <p>The fact that we know our food system is partly to blame can empower us. We know how to strike at the single greatest risk factor for pandemics. We know how to make ourselves and our families safer. The very uncertainty that unsettles us also reminds us that everything can change for the better, too. Thankfully Covid-19 seems to attack our children extremely rarely, and if we respond with sufficient wisdom, this time that is so marked by death will perhaps also be remembered by them as a turning point, a time of reckoning, quiet heroism and, as the months pass, renewal.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jonathan Safran Foer is an author.

  "<p>Good evening, this is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia on Monday 20 April.</p> \n<h2>Lowest increase since March</h2> \n<p>Australia has recorded its lowest daily increase in cases since early March.</p> \n<p>Three states \u2013 Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia \u2013 have recorded no new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours.</p> \n<p>Victoria recorded just one new case overnight, while New South Wales recorded six new cases, the lowest daily total in five weeks. The Australian Capital Territory recorded one new case.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s the third day in a row that South Australia recorded no new cases. The state\u2019s chief public health officer, associate professor Nicola Spurrier, said that result came on the back of increased testing. Almost 5,000 people were tested over the past five days.</p> \n<p>Both South Australia and Queensland said if results remained that strong, they would begin considering lifting restrictions.</p> \n<p>The national total increased by just 26 cases. That seems to comprise mainly of 16 new cases among crew members aboard the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which were not included in NSW\u2019s daily totals. A total of 202 crew members on the ship, which is moored at Port Kembla, have now tested positive to Covid-19.</p> \n<h2>Virgin Australia goes into administration</h2> \n<p>Accounting firm Deloitte is understood to have been appointed the administrators for Virgin Australia, which has collapsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/queensland-nsw-fight-headquarters-virgin-australia-if-it-survives\">despite competing offers of rescue packages from the Queensland and NSW state governments.</a></p> \n<p>It comes after the Australian government refused the airline\u2019s request for a $1.4bn emergency loan. It\u2019s not clear what this development will mean for the airline\u2019s 10,000 staff or 130 planes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia coronavirus email signup button\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Facebook and Google forced to share advertising revenue</h2> \n<p>The Australian government has announced it will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/19/facebook-and-google-to-be-forced-to-share-advertising-revenue-with-australian-media-companies\">impose a mandatory code of conduct on tech companies Facebook and Google</a> that will force them to share advertising revenue with Australian media companies.</p> \n<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the code, which will include penalties and binding dispute resolution mechanisms, will \u201ccreate a level playing field\u201d between media companies and the two tech giants.</p> \n<h2>Privacy concerns remain over coronavirus app</h2> \n<p>Digital experts have called on the federal government to formally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/privacy-concerns-persist-over-australias-coronavirus-tracing-app\">make data collected by its coronavirus tracking app exempt from use by law enforcement.</a></p> \n<p>And the Law Council of Australia has said that the public health benefits of the app need to be balanced with the privacy implications. </p> \n<p>Government services minister Stuart Robert said on Monday that the information collected by the app, which is intended to register when people have been standing near another person for more than 15 minutes, can be used in contact tracing for a potential Covid-19 infection, will \u201callow us to get back to life quicker\u201d.</p> \n<h2>NRL chief executive quits</h2> \n<p>Todd Greenberg, the chief executive of the NRL, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/nrl-ceo-todd-greenberg-quits-amid-rugby-league-coronavirus-crisis\">resigned his post effective immediately</a>, in the latest blow to a league that has struggled financially since the shutdown of the 2020 season due to the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>In a shock announcement on Monday, Greenberg said he and the league had come to a mutual agreement to part ways.

  "<p>Memory, according to the barrister representing \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/07/coughing-major-millionaire-case-not-black-and-white-says-quiz-writer\">coughing major</a>\u201d Charles Ingram in ITV\u2019s Who Wants to be a Millionaire dramatisation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/quiz-review-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-charles-ingram-diana-drama\">Quiz</a>, is a funny thing. When you remember something, you think you\u2019re reconstructing what it was like at the time. In fact, what you recall is your last recollection, filtered through the state you are now in.</p> <p>Nostalgia is a funny thing. Quiz, a programme watched by almost 6 million people on its last night, told a story from the beginning of the century, from pre-Iraq New Labour, the time of Chris Tarrant and primetime TV shows, bootcut jeans and chintz sofas. On three nights last week, it encouraged its audience, housebound by the coronavirus lockdown, to sip on the crisp white wines of slick television executives, to recall a time before Google, when the biggest story in Britain was about an army major who may or may not have cheated his way to a million pounds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nostalgia can keep people distracted while power is solidified</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like video-conferencing services, hedge fund managers betting against the stock market and manufacturers of nuclear bunkers, nostalgia is enjoying a boom time. Our culture was already long in its grip \u2013 the coronavirus lockdown has only solidified its hold on us. Now very little new art or entertainment can be made. We can barely go outside. We can barely create new memories. Fear and anxiety stalk the land. Friends and family may already have fallen seriously ill. The economic outlook is bleak.</p> <p>But we have our sofas and our laptops, our televisions and our streaming services. When times are tough, the desire to escape to a place of perceived peace becomes ever harder to deny \u2013 the warm bath of nostalgia is ready and waiting. The country is giving up, slipping into it, dozing in those waters for hours on end before climbing out to put on a soft, enveloping robe, also made of nostalgia. The fear of missing out has morphed into the remembrance of things past.</p> <p>On Netflix, Friends<em> </em>has been doing a brisk trade in nostalgia for a while now. Rachel still has <em>that </em>haircut. Joey remains enamoured with sex and eating. Ross\u2019s love of dinosaurs and divorce (and Rachel) endures. The Office<em> </em>is one of the streaming site\u2019s most watched shows at the moment, now combining nostalgia for a time with nostalgia for a place (even if you once thought you hated it): the office, that thing you used to go to, before all this happened.</p> <p>With fortuitous timing, earlier this year Channel 4 put all of Seinfeld on its website, so you can watch the 90s\u2019 foremost show about nothing, in a world where you do nothing. The British broadcaster also has Frasier and Cheers<em> </em>at its disposal, with the latter\u2019s theme tune already a masterpiece in nostalgia, evoking a warm glow in millions of people who\u2019ve never set foot in the city of Boston, let alone a basement bar there. Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and right now, that place is the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Tswannell/status/1250130571591901185\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just a bit of fun \ud83d\ude02 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coys?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coys</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/C2Vy3jHotM\">pic.twitter.com/C2Vy3jHotM</a></p>&mdash; Thomas Swannell (@Tswannell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tswannell/status/1250130571591901185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 14, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>With no sport being played, classic games are replayed on television, radio, podcasts and even, somehow, in the form of live blogs.

In football-less Premier League, the present is an ever darker place, in which<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41160746\"> zero-hour contract king</a> Mike Ashley can be found flogging a beloved north-eastern institution to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/exit-the-house-of-karrimor-enter-the-austere-and-unforgiving-house-of-saud\">petro-state prince</a> who even the CIA acknowledges has blood on his hands. Far happier, then, to return to seemingly more innocent times, with jumpers for goalposts and a vintage game crackling on the wireless.</p> <p>Much of this nostalgia exists and is driven by social media. With more of us in front of our screens and on our devices, but with nothing much in the way of new content to share, Instagram and Facebook draw us further back, with reminders of where we were and what we were doing in previous years. Half the people I know on social media \u2013 myself included \u2013 suddenly find themselves posting photos of what they looked like aged 20. Instagram is wall-to-wall <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/throwback-thursday\">Throwback Thursdays</a> and \u201csimpler times\u201d.</p> <p>Politically, this pandemic represents an opportunity for both left and right \u2013 one that our culture\u2019s addiction to nostalgia is tied up in. In the US, Donald Trump has been harnessing the past for years, most notably with his \u201cMake America great again\u201d slogan. The stuttering campaign of Joe Biden is fuelled by a centrist liberal nostalgia for the Obama years and Bill Clinton.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/bbc-summer-sport-nostalgia-coronavirus-lockdown\">BBC to broadcast summer of sport nostalgia during coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the UK, we have had Brexit, with its imperial nostalgia, and Boris Johnson\u2019s 2019 election campaign, with its promise to end politics and return us to a time \u2013 once again, imagined \u2013 when we didn\u2019t have to worry about such things.</p> <p>Nostalgia can be a powerful tool for such forces and in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, it can keep people distracted while power is solidified.

  "<p>Each night, Bipul* is kept awake by the fear of loan sharks hounding his parents for the money he owes. Five months ago, the 25-year-old Sri Lankan borrowed $1,400 (\u00a31,120) to pay recruiters to take him to the United Arab Emirates, where he got a job as cleaner at a five-star hotel. But since the coronavirus outbreak there are no longer any guests, so he no longer has work and the loan is going unpaid.</p> <p>\u201cI really need a job so I can repay it,\u201d he says. \u201cI also need to earn money to help my family. This is such a big problem.\u201d</p> <p>Bipul was earning AED 1,000 (\u00a3218) per month, working up to 11 hours a day, six days a week at the Pullman Hotel in Sharjah, which is managed by Accor, a French firm that owns several upscale international hotel chains.</p> <p>Bipul\u2019s final salary instalment and passport are being held by the company until flight restrictions are lifted and he can be put on a plane home, he says. Sending most of his earnings to Sri Lanka and living paycheque to paycheque, he is now stranded and penniless.</p> <p>Dulhara*, a Nepali in his 20s, is struggling to pay $2,500 of debts he incurred with Nepalese recruitment brokers who brought him to the UAE last year. Until he was placed at a job with Accor, the brokers made him live in a room with more than 20 other men, where he slept on a mattress on the floor and was given insufficient food. After that ordeal, he was desperate for life to improve.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trapped,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel so sad and angry. But what can I do?\u201d</p> <p>The UAE is on lockdown and most hotels are shut, leaving very low paid migrant workers \u2013 mainly employed in the tourism, hospitality and construction sectors \u2013 stranded in the country with no prospect of earning. The Emirati government has allowed some repatriation flights for Asian migrant workers left jobless by the pandemic. However, some countries have refused to allow their citizens home, citing concerns over possible disease transmission, leaving workers struggling to survive without funds.</p> <p>\u201cThese are worrying reports. Given the already vulnerable position of migrant workers in the UAE, abrupt redundancies are likely to have a devastating effect,\u201d says May Romanos, Amnesty International\u2019s Gulf migrant rights\u2019 researcher. </p> <p>In accordance with UAE law, Accor is still providing its blue-collar migrant workers with food and accommodation. But in addition to their worry over debt, both Bipul and Dulhara say they are increasingly frightened their families back home will find paying for food difficult now they can\u2019t send money.</p> <p>\u201cNo redundancies have been made at Pullman Sharjah and Marjan Island Resort &amp; Spa as a result of the possible impact that Covid-19 is having on business levels,\u201d said Accor in a statement.

  "<p>Before the Great Toilet Paper Shortage, alternative means of washing were not top of mind for most Australians. We laughed at the eccentricity of the French with their peculiar, rather-too-intimately fastidious bidets. Then, in March, Google searches for bidets skyrocketed <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=AU&amp;q=bidet\">by at least 1,000%</a>.</p> <p>Having a French mother, I was more familiar with their low slung, stocky design, but not with its origins. I always assumed it had been invented by a Monsieur Bidet. But <em>non</em>, it turns out that the word originates from the term for a pony which makes sense, given that it is straddled like one. </p> <p>Bidets take up space, so it was inevitable that someone would come up with a more efficient solution. In 1957 the Swiss inventor Hans Maurer combined the bidet and toilet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/17/supermarket-trysts-and-video-chats-how-australians-are-dating-during-covid-19\">Supermarket trysts and video chats: how Australians are dating during Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many years later, his idea took off on the other side of the world. Anyone returning from a holiday in Japan talks about the fancy toilets: electronic ones whose lids lift on approach, and have special features such as seat warming, glowing night lights in the bowl and various washing and drying modes that make toilet paper redundant. By 2002, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/world/nara-journal-japanese-masters-get-closer-to-the-toilet-nirvana.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Japanese%20Masters%20Get%20Closer%20to%20the%20Toilet%20Nirvana&amp;st=cse\">nearly half</a> of Japanese homes had one. Often they are rented, serviced and deep cleaned every few months. Many of these are made by Toto, the manufacturer of the most sophisticated conveniences on the market.</p> <p>The Japanese brand has pioneered the design of techy toilets since 1980, with sleek remote-controlled units (the latest model, the Neorest NX, is a sculptural shape that resembles an egg) and special features including a feminine wash setting, deodorising charcoal filter, patented ceramic glaze for optimal bowl surface hygiene, and \u201ctornado\u201d triple jet flush.</p> <p>Since toilet paper panic buying began, Toto\u2019s New South Wales distributor reports an increase in inquiries of \u201caround 200%\u201d, according to Randall Cadby, their managing director. Google data also shows that searches for \u201csmart toilets\u201d in Australia spiked to their highest point since tracking began in 2004.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A graph showing Australians' interest in smart toilets over time\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2152_RC04/embed_loader.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(&quot;TIMESERIES&quot;, {&quot;comparisonItem&quot;:[{&quot;keyword&quot;:&quot;smart toilet&quot;,&quot;geo&quot;:&quot;AU&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2004-01-01 2020-04-17&quot;}],&quot;category&quot;:0,&quot;property&quot;:&quot;&quot;}, {&quot;exploreQuery&quot;:&quot;date=all&amp;geo=AU&amp;q=smart%20toilet&quot;,&quot;guestPath&quot;:&quot;https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/&quot;}); &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Though Cadby says sales have slowed as the crisis continues, there\u2019s enough interest in, and concern around \u201calternative toileting devices\u201d that the Queensland Building and Construction Commission issued a public warning on 8 April, stating that \u201cthe failure to properly install these products, including installation of a suitable backflow prevention device, may lead to water supply contamination, posing serious risks to health and safety\u201d.</p> <p>Toto\u2019s smart toilets start at $9,000. Professional installation aside, Cadby says that \u201cthere are cheaper options than the latest state-of-the art electronic model\u201d.</p> <p>Reece Plumbing, Australia\u2019s biggest retailer of bathroom ware, sells a cheaper range by Spanish brand Roca at around $3,800 with fewer bells and whistles. Meanwhile, at the lower end of the market, Bunnings sells washlets with spray nozzles for around $400.</p> <p>When it comes to innovation, competition between brands is fierce. Korean brands such as Pristine and Uspa developed child-friendly settings and an enema wash feature. Then came so-called turbo washes (a \u201ctherapeutic\u201d jet of warm water that manufacturers claim offers relief from constipation).</p> <p>When Toto learned that its female clientele were embarrassed by the sound of bodily functions and flushed twice to cover those noises, it created a \u201cmodesty button\u201d that produces the sound effect of a waterfall to prevent embarrassment in public toilet stalls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/15/mic-camera-action-how-to-make-a-video-presentation-people-will-actually-like\">Mic, camera, action: how to make a video presentation people will actually like</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Toto takes its R&amp;D so seriously that it has a team of toilet testers who wear mobility-restricting suits to ensure their design is disability friendly. Small wonder their products are especially popular with older people, who find reaching back to wipe difficult. In 2019, Cadby estimates that the disabled and elderly represented 40% of sales.</p> <p>It is possible that toilet paper shortages have simply accelerated a trend that was already gaining ground. \u201cChannel Nine\u2019s The Block ... is a good indicator of popularity within our market. In the 2019 season, four out of five of the properties featured a Roca Inspira smart toilet,\u201d says Reece\u2019s marketing leader, Daniela Santilli.</p> <p>Personally, I first heard of smart toilets when an environmentalist friend threw a party to celebrate his 70th birthday, and spent more time raving about his loo than his family. \u201cYou never need to buy toilet paper again,\u201d he enthused, prophetically.</p> <p>Toto\u2019s NSW distributor also reports a steady increase in sales to premium developers, hotels, casinos and restaurants. \u201cWe\u2019re at the National Press Club in Canberra,\u201d says Cadby, without irony.</p> <p>\u201cSome of our customers are pretty passionate about their toilets. I know a lawyer who converted the space where he kept a filing cupboard so he could fit one in for his exclusive use. And a couple I know fought over who would get the toilet during their divorce proceedings.\u201d</p> <p>The company\u2019s biggest local individual client to date was an early adopter. A prominent billionaire who \u201cspent $1m purchasing 30 smart toilets\u201d for his home in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs, \u201cincluding one for the security guard at the gate\u201d, claims Cadby. Presumably, he was feeling pretty flush at the time.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Newman walked to the podium with the calm confidence of a soldier and welcomed us with humility. His audience was 20 virology researchers preparing to lead groups in universities around the UK in 2016.</p> <p>Newman, then a Porton Down-based virologist for Public Health England, had seen more action than all of us combined. He shared photos of his travels in African villages ravaged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/09/ebola-guinea-family-west-africa-crisis\">some of the most dangerous viruses</a> that face humanity. Pop-up labs set up in tents, with \u201cclean\u201d areas on one side for DNA sequencing equipment to confirm virus infection, and patient areas to the other side, hosting beds with seriously ill people. Fascinating, how a tiny piece of genetic information wrapped in a protein coat can cause such devastation.</p> <p>Let\u2019s face it, viruses that cause \u201cthe sniffles\u201d aren\u2019t what get most of us into virology. Some colleagues quote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/zombie-movies-ranked\">zombie apocalypse</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/zombie-movies-ranked\"> movies</a> as inspiration for entering the field, and it\u2019s true that there\u2019s a certain macabre thrill in studying these terrible pathogens. But there are really only a few viruses able to kill us within days of infection.</p> <p>Newman spent much of his career <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28108668\">hunting haemorrhagic fever viruses</a> that fit that description: Ebola and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/apr/05/medicineandhealth.lifeandhealth\">Marburg</a> are both contagious via contact with infected bodily fluids and cause bleeding and organ failure, with mortality rates of up to <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-virus-disease\">90%</a> and <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease\">88%</a> respectively. The incidence of these deadly viruses, however, is extremely rare, and outbreaks are thankfully extinguished rapidly by international teams of experts. Viruses causing the common cold, on the other hand, get a free pass through human populations.</p> <p>What is it that makes a virus deadly, or merely an inconvenience? What determines whether it spreads to become a pandemic, like Sars-Cov-2, or burns out rapidly, in a remote location? What does \u201csuccess\u201d mean, in viral terms? These are questions on many peoples\u2019 minds, as they wonder what else might be out there. Could the next pandemic be 50 times as bad as this one? Is the lethality of viruses a grim lottery, with mere luck separating us from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/07/we-learned-four-valuable-lessons-from-ebola-they-can-help-us-fight-the-coronavirus\">something like Ebola</a> sweeping the Earth?</p> <p>In fact, viruses generally have to follow certain rules if they want to get ahead. Stealth is critical, because these pathogens are unable to thrive and reproduce alone. Instead, they invade host cells and rely on them to, first, decode their genetic information to produce components for new virus particles, next, assemble those components, and finally, release new viruses to infect more cells. If this process causes tissue damage that leads to organ failure, the virus risks perishing along with its host.</p> <p>That\u2019s why \u201cnightmare\u201d viruses \u2013 like those with 90% mortality \u2013 thankfully aren\u2019t always very successful. To survive and thrive, a virus must operate like a spy in enemy territory, skilled at passing its genetic material from cell to cell without alerting the host\u2019s immune response.</p> <p>Viruses responsible for mild to moderate respiratory infections frequently fall into this category. They include respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/parainfluenza/index.html\">human parainfluenza viruses</a>, rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US estimates that adults have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/rhinoviruses/index.html\">two to three colds a year</a>, and children have even more, but colds pose little threat to people with healthy immune systems. As we now know only too well, Sars-Cov-2 is far more of a menace, because it can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome in some patients, which may lead to between <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30165-X/fulltext\">1% and 7%</a> mortality.</p> <p>A successful spy must be a master of disguise, and so it is with viruses: if they want to evade recognition by immune cells, they must change their protein coat frequently. This is achieved via tiny alterations in their genetic material called mutations. The Goldilocks principle applies here: if the mutations are too subtle, the viral coat will be easily identified by existing antibodies, whereas if they are too drastic they might simply inactivate the virus. The mutations that allow viruses to fly under the radar fall somewhere in between. Influenza viruses, which use rapidly evolving ribonucleic acid (RNA) as their genetic material, are experts at this game.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">History teaches us</a> that influenza mutations can result in pandemics with millions of deaths, so we\u2019ve learned to keep a watchful eye on them. As flu evolves over the months, virologists respond by producing seasonal vaccines that remain effective \u2013 for a time, at least.</p> <p>Coronaviruses have RNA genomes too, but they are very large. That means that there are many more opportunities for mutations to go wrong \u2013 from the virus\u2019s point of view. As a result, they have developed a sort of \u201cproof-reading\u201d mechanism that edits out mutations \u2013 meaning that they change a lot less rapidly than flu does. This is good news for us, and for vaccine development. But we still need more information to determine just how long a vaccine might be effective for.</p> <p>How does a virus go on to achieve world domination? Getting from A to B is of the essence. Sars-Cov-2 rides droplets propelled by coughs and sneezes to board a new host. This is a more effective route of transmission than that used by non-respiratory viruses like Ebola, and its efficiency is increased if the virus particles are more stable and can survive on surfaces outside the body. This is why keeping a safe distance from each other and isolating patients is so useful in preventing new infections. Sars-Cov-2 also has a lipid-containing coat, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/science-soap-kills-coronavirus-alcohol-based-disinfectants\">thorough handwashing with soap</a>, which breaks down fats, can stop it in its tracks.</p> <p>It should be increasingly clear that to end the pandemic and keep Covid-19 outbreaks to a minimum, we need to seriously upgrade our spyware. We need surveillance teams of epidemiologists that decipher patterns of viral spread and molecular virologists to track virus evolution so we can update our defences. We need immunologists to help to understand how the body fights the virus and aid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/apr/16/covid-19-what-would-immunity-look-like-podcast\">vaccine research</a>. We also need trained and well-equipped doctors and nurses to safely look after infected people, and scientists to help design effective treatments.</p> <p>We need to fund these heroes well, and keep their kit up to date, and we need structures and public health strategies in place to promote hygiene, contain outbreaks and prevent transmission. Covid-19 has shown us that we must stay vigilant, and each of us can personally help break the transmission cycle.</p> <p>What if a new pathogen emerges and bears all those terrifying hallmarks of viral success \u2013 it doesn\u2019t kill us quickly, mutates often, and is easily transmitted? We rely on the World Health Organization to report new outbreaks and international teams of experts to act rapidly to contain them. It\u2019s important that both receive proper funding and support from governments. </p> <p>When someone like Newman, or the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-public-health-rapid-support-team-uk-phrst\">UK\u2019s Public Health Rapid Support Team</a>, receives a call to pick up their pop-up lab and join other defenders at the heart of the outbreak, not everyone welcomes them on location, and people are understandably reluctant to keep away from their infected loved ones. These teams will have their work cut out for them. But their work is vital. And when they return they will doubtless have lots of stories to share with the new generation of virologists \u2013 some of them, hopefully, inspired to join the fight by the crisis we\u2019re now battling.</p> <p>\u2022 Dr Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham</p>",
  "<p>Military veterans who served in Afghanistan and Iraq have drawn up <a href=\"https://www.helpforheroes.org.uk/get-support/mental-health-and-wellbeing/a-field-guide-to-self-care/\">a package of guidance and support</a> to help NHS workers cope with the traumatic stress from treating patients on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The advice has been drawn up by the Help for Heroes charity, initially for staff at the Nightingale emergency hospital that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/07/how-to-build-a-hospital-in-nine-days-emergency-architecture-in-a-pandemic-coronavirus-outbreak\">opened in east London this month</a>, in the belief that NHS staff are experiencing levels of emotional intensity similar to that on the battlefield.</p> <p>Carole Betteridge, a former navy nurse who ran a field hospital at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, said the understanding of traumatic stress had changed dramatically over the past 20 years and lessons could be shared. She spent 26 years in the navy as a nurse and medical planner, and is now head of welfare and clinical services at Help for Heroes.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThere are so many parallels I can see between the military experience and what NHS workers are having to deal with. This is a conflict situation and we have to make sure we care for the carers.\u201d </p> <p>Medical staff are being faced with daily life-or-death situations \u201cfar more than we did in Iraq or Afghanistan\u201d, Betteridge said.</p> <p>The most acute source of anxiety was the feeling that personal efforts had been insufficient, she said. \u201cPeople in hospitals will want to be able to help everybody, to be able to save everybody, but sometimes that\u2019s not possible, and it\u2019s difficult to deal with. People always feel they could have done more.\u201d</p> <p>Military techniques that can help are based on clear communication at the time, a buddying up between experienced and inexperienced workers, and a proper rotation of responsibilities so certain carers are not overburdened.</p> <p>Particularly important is trauma risk management, where a team who often may have have completed a 12-hour shift come together and reflect on a difficult day\u2019s events.</p> <p>Betteridge said: \u201cYou should talk about the good things and the things that didn\u2019t go so well; discuss how you are dealing with things \u2013 and talk about your families and positive things.\u201d</p> <p>Rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among military veterans have risen as the phenomenon is better understood. Research from King\u2019s College highlighted by the charity Combat Stress suggest 17% of Iraq and Afghan veterans who served in combat developed PTSD, compared with 6% in support roles.</p> <p>It can take years for problems to be formally acknowledged. Historically, on average it took 13 years after leaving the military. The figure dropped sharply to four years among Afghan veterans, as opening up about mental health problems has become more socially acceptable.</p> <p>Betteridge said: \u201cThe experience of the veterans is that you can\u2019t go through that kind of conflict experience without it having some effect. The good thing is we understand these situations better now, we can sort of plan for it. I think that will lessen the effect.\u201d</p> <p>Help for Heroes was called in to help produce the material by Prof James Calder, a clinical lead at the NHS Nightingale in London, recognising that the environment was similar to a military field hospital.</p> <p>Unlike a normal NHS hospital, at the Nightingale at the ExCeL centre in London Docklands, and similar facilities around the country, volunteers who do not know each other are being thrown together in an emergency situation.</p> <p>Betteridge said: \u201cIt\u2019s always harder when you don\u2019t know the people you are working with. Try and get to know them a bit when you start, introduce yourself when you put your PPE on, buddy up, and that will help you.\u201d</p> <p>At Camp Bastion, British military medics from all three branches of the armed forces worked alongside Americans, Estonians and Danes during Betteridge\u2019s seven months in charge during 2011.</p> <p>At NHS Nightingale, medics are being drawn from local hospitals, with volunteers from St John Ambulance assisting alongside them. Cabin crew and other airline staff from EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic are expected to provide assistance.</p> <p>London\u2019s Nightingale has been used relatively lightly so far, with only a few dozen patients, because trusts in the capital have been able to cope with the numbers of coronavirus cases. But NHS officials want to increase the number of patients treated there to help the health service gradually normalise when the outbreak eases.</p> <p>The Help for Heroes materials, drawn up with the help of combat veterans, <a href=\"https://www.helpforheroes.org.uk/get-support/mental-health-and-wellbeing/a-field-guide-to-self-care/\">are also </a><a href=\"https://www.helpforheroes.org.uk/get-support/mental-health-and-wellbeing/a-field-guide-to-self-care/\">being published online</a> so they can be made available to all NHS workers to complement existing mental health and support schemes.</p>",
  "<p>In the first week of March, New York\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thearmoryshow.com/\">Armory Show</a> opened on schedule, as it has done for the past 26 years. Despite coronavirus concerns, gallerists and collectors from across the globe packed Piers 90 and 94 on the West Side of Manhattan for <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/armory-show-2020-1794207\">one of the ritziest art fairs in the calendar</a>. Big sales were made \u2013 a painting by the superstar contemporary <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/price-check-2020-armory-show-1793946\">painter Kehinde Wiley went for $280,000</a> (\u00a3220,000) \u2013 and the organisers congratulated themselves on not surrendering to the fearmongers (\u201cNew Yorkers are strong,\u201d concluded the fair\u2019s director, Nicole Berry). Aside from the absence of air-kissing and the prevalence of hand sanitiser, it was hard to spot anything amiss.</p> <p>Only a month later, the Armory Show looks like the last days of the Roman Empire. Days after it closed, European countries had gone into lockdown. Art fairs elsewhere were <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/here-are-all-the-art-fairs-that-have-been-cancelled-or-postponed-due-to-coronavirus\">being cancelled by the dozen and auctions postponed</a>. By mid-March, galleries worldwide had locked their doors; haemorrhaging income, many started <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/drumbeat-of-steady-museum-layoffs-1826637\">furloughing or laying off staff</a>. New York itself has become the epicentre of the North American outbreak. And Pier 90 is now famous for a grimmer reason: it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/comfort-ship-new-york-coronavirus-failure-symbol\">where a US Navy hospital ship is moored</a>.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t a business worldwide that hasn\u2019t felt the virus\u2019s impact, with calamitous results for millions. And the art world has been far from immune. An industry that has become synonymous with hyper-connectedness and global mobility is now, like the rest of us, at a standstill. The art market is idling. The places where we experience art \u2013 <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/museum-lockdown-impact-survey-1827237\">from </a><a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/museum-lockdown-impact-survey-1827237\">leading museums to the tiniest independent spaces</a> \u2013 are abruptly out of bounds. Many galleries are likely to go out of business; artists will lose livelihoods.

The virus will change a lot of things for art.\u201d</p> <p>But what sort of changes, and what sort of things? Is there only emptiness on the horizon, or are there opportunities, too? And when we finally emerge, what will art \u2013 and, yes, the art world \u2013 look like?</p> <p>One glimmer of hope is that, though we can\u2019t see art in person, we seem hungry to access it by any means possible. Galleries have been experiencing record web traffic: visitors to the British Museum site soared in the early days of the crisis, <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/art-design/2020/03/virtual-galleries-art-museums-tours-online\">while the Courtauld Gallery\u2019s virtual tour reported an astonishing 723% spike in visitors in mid-March</a>.

But with physical galleries now empty it\u2019s suddenly the sole means for organisations to retain a connection to audiences. The most august institutions are revealing a more unbuttoned, down-to-earth side: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/royalacademy?lang=en\">the Royal Academy Twitter feed</a>, previously full of earnest promos for RA events, has been taken over by an #RAdailydoodle challenge aimed at amateur artists (sample post: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/royalacademy/status/1248259270363222017\">\u201cWho can draw us a thirsty ferret?\u201d</a>). Other galleries are trialling similar projects \u2013 less top-down, more collaborative.</p> <p>Morris at Tate detects a deep shift: \u201cHaving a real conversation with real people is hugely exciting. I think it\u2019s partly because people are missing the social space of being in a museum. It\u2019s something we haven\u2019t always done enough. And once we reopen, we get a chance to recalibrate that.\u201d</p> <p>The same is true behind the scenes, she adds: the fact that the hectic merry-go-round of openings and events has paused means that it\u2019s possible to get hold of people. \u201cEveryone seems more available, perversely. I\u2019ve been having conversations with colleagues from all over the world.\u201d</p> <p>Beneath all this, of course, there is a grim reality: money. With the global economy stalled, <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/how-the-art-world-became-the-art-industry-1710228\">the wealth that has fuelled the art world for the past 20 years</a> \u2013 a period of discombobulating growth, museum expansions, soaring auction prices, more art fairs by the month \u2013 is suddenly in doubt.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve been partying for the last two decades,\u201d says Morris. The <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/\">commercial gallerist David Zwirner</a>, who now has spaces in New York, Hong Kong, London and Paris, concurs: \u201cIt got out of hand, especially the market: crazy auction prices and the rest. The infiltration of value into the perception of art, art being regarded as an asset \u2013 all that needs to be rethought.\u201d</p> <p>Is he fearful for the future? \u201cOf course. There\u2019s going to be a lot of pain, especially for smaller galleries. And, of course, artists.\u201d</p> <p>Cole is similarly anxious: \u201cAt the top end, the art world is a luxury industry, but many of the people who work in it \u2013 the artists, the handlers, gallery staff \u2013 are in very precarious positions. We published an article the other day saying that a third of<a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/one-third-of-french-galleries-could-shut-before-end-of-2020-due-to-coronavirus-impact\"> French galleries could close by the end of 2020</a>. Even if the art market bounces back, it\u2019s going to be a much smaller world.\u201d</p> <p>Yet, while accounting for these very real hardships \u2013 local museums in the UK are especially vulnerable \u2013 both Cole and Morris argue that there are clues here as to how things might operate differently. \u201c\u2018Normal\u2019 was unsustainable,\u201d Cole argues. \u201cThe endless expansion, the mega-collectors, the purchasing of big trophy objects. I think we\u2019re entering a period of less is more. I hope it\u2019ll be less macho.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fc66068f64baba814cc69daec4bb06870e9feab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fc66068f64baba814cc69daec4bb06870e9feab/0_0_3500_2275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A final look at Fons Americanus, Kara Walker\u2019s Turbine Hall commission as the Tate Gallery went into lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"650\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A final look at Fons Americanus, Kara Walker\u2019s Turbine Hall commission as the Tate Gallery went into lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morris suggests that footfall-driving blockbuster exhibitions, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/21/how-to-move-a-masterpiece-secret-business-shipping-priceless-artworks-art-handling\">star loans shipped carbon-intensively from Berlin to LA to Tokyo</a>, might have had their day. \u201cIt\u2019d be great for museums to focus on their permanent collections, the amazing things we already possess. We\u2019ve taken our eye off the core mission. I\u2019d love a return to slower looking.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone agrees that, whatever comes next, galleries will have a bigger role than ever. The moment they reopen, it\u2019s hard not to see them being thronged, says Zwirner: \u201cThe work of art in a physical space is different: it craves you. Looking at art is a communal act.\u201d</p> <p>The big question, of course, is what we\u2019ll be looking at: with an event as all-enveloping as the current pandemic, is it too early to speak of \u201ccorona art\u201d?</p> <p>The contemporary artist <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/blog/artists-show-us-what-they-have-been-up-to-during-the-lockdown-while-ryan-gander-does-a-live-studio-tour-today\">Ryan Gander has talked of the \u201ctime famine\u201d</a> afflicting the art world; artists \u2013 like many of us \u2013 now have plenty of time on their hands. And whether they\u2019re sequestered in their studios or trying to balance childcare and laundry, many will end up channelling their experiences of this strangest of moments into the work they make. Judging by <a href=\"https://www.lissongallery.com/news/studio-join-ryan-gander-s-live-walkthrough\">Gander\u2019s Zoom studio tours</a> and <a href=\"http://www.martincreed.com/site/live\">Martin Creed\u2019s livestream jam sessions</a>, some already are.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e410c885888997a144c4fba2da7fcfba72215cb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e410c885888997a144c4fba2da7fcfba72215cb1/0_0_601_474/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sketchy \u2026 the Royal Academy\u2019s doodle a ferret challenge.\" width=\"500\" height=\"394\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sketchy \u2026 the Royal Academy\u2019s doodle a ferret challenge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RA Twitter - @royalacademy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morris isn\u2019t sure what will result, but feels confident that it will be worth attending to: \u201cIf you look at the great traumatising events of the past \u2013 world wars, global emergencies of different kinds \u2013 artists have always responded,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter the first world war it was dada and surrealism; after the second, existentialism and gestural abstraction. Whatever the work looks like, it\u2019ll be interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Keen to get an artist\u2019s perspective, I track down the Argentinian-born, New York-based Mika Rottenberg, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/arts/design/mika-rottenberg-review-new-museum.html\">best known for her unsettling installations and videos</a>, some of which take aim \u2013 appropriately enough \u2013 at the excesses of late capitalism. When we Skype, she\u2019s in upstate New York, trying to balance home-schooling her daughter and connecting with colleagues and friends, many of whose projects have been cancelled or postponed.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Rottenberg seems \u2013 if not exactly upbeat \u2013 at least philosophical. As an active member of the <a href=\"https://www.culturedeclares.org/\">Culture Declares climate movement</a>, she sees a strong connection between the climate emergency and the coronavirus one, and she is thinking hard about how art fits in \u2013 both as a response and something that can illuminate a path forward. More practically, she is using tools such as video conferencing to collaborate with other artists and scope out projects. She can\u2019t be physically present in a gallery, but perhaps she doesn\u2019t need to be.</p> <p>\u201cThe fear is that we become more conservative, build a wall around ourselves,\u201d Rottenberg says. \u201cI really don\u2019t want that to happen. And even if we can\u2019t travel, I don\u2019t want us to abandon that sense of global connectedness, the exchange of ideas. Right now we need hospital beds and ventilators and masks, but art has a role to play too. It has to.\u201d</p> <p>Has she actually been able to get any work done? She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m used to multi-tasking. When I\u2019m not editing video, my favourite spot in the studio is the kitchen table.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has shown how many of us, when trapped at home, have reached instinctively for art. Maybe it\u2019s taking <a href=\"http://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/cappella-sistina/tour-virtuale.html\">a virtual spin around the Sistine Chapel</a>, or dusting off craft materials. Maybe it\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/royalacademy/status/1248261163877613569\">sketching ferrets</a>. </p> <p>\u201cPeople are really having to make do with what they have,\u201d says Cole. \u201cThey\u2019re sharing images, video, memes, using art in all sorts of creative ways.\u201d She ponders the question. \u201cArt is really useful at the moment. Whatever comes next, we have to cling to that.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The heads of all the UN\u2019s major agencies have issued a graphic warning of the risk of coronavirus to the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries after disclosing that international donors had pledged around a quarter of the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/funding-fight-against-covid-19-world%E2%80%99s-poorest-countries\">$2bn the UN requested for its emergency Covid-19 response in March.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/humanitarian-dispatches/an-urgent-call-to-fund-the-global-emergency-supply-system-to-fight-covid-19-ea063658f7d9\">In an open letter</a> shared before publication with the Guardian, the world\u2019s most senior emergencies, health and development officials, warned that help for the world\u2019s weakest countries was in everyone\u2019s \u201cinterest to stop the virus from spreading unchecked, destroying lives and economies, and continuing to circle around the world\u201d.</p> <p>In particular, the agency heads are calling for $350m to be specifically earmarked for the establishment of a rapidly enhanced and expanded UN global logistics system, including key regional hubs, to serve as air and cargo bridges to move key personnel and equipment as conventional air traffic has shut down, or movement has been restricted.</p> <p>The plan envisages using two air transport centres in Europe \u2013 still accessible by commercial flights \u2013 to then transport aid staff on charter to key crisis areas, including the Middle East and Africa, as well as the provision of seven field hospitals around the world dedicated to treating humanitarian workers who fall sick with the disease while working.</p> <p>The plan mirrors early discussions among some European countries in recent days to set up their own humanitarian air bridge via the EU\u2019s civil protection coordination mechanism.</p> <p>Amid mounting concern that countries in the developing world with the least ability to contain coronavirus could become reservoirs for the disease, driving new waves of the virus around the planet, the letter adds that without a stepped up effort \u201cthe global response could stutter to a halt\u201d.</p> <p>The call followed mounting concern both inside the UN system and among prominent NGOs of the devastating impact of coronavirus on the countries already vulnerable and heavily dependent on international aid because of high poverty, widespread social insecurity or conflict.</p> <p>The letter is signed by the heads of the World Food Programme, World Health Organization, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UN Refugee Agency and International Organisation for Migration, among others, as well as by Mark Lowcock, the UN\u2019s emergency relief coordinator.</p> <p>Describing the latest funding appeal, Lowcock underlined that full funding for the logistics effort was critical to the UN\u2019s Covid-19 mitigation efforts. \u201cIf the world does not step up for this, nothing else happens,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Lowcock described the situation in Yemen in particular \u2013 where the UN is already desperately short of funds \u2013 as an example of a worst-case scenario.</p> <p>\u201cThe most difficult place is Yemen, partly for funding reasons. We feed 13 million people there every month but are in process of closing 31 of 40 main programmes over the next several weeks.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t keep getting supplies in and out there\u2019s going to be a huge tragedy. Central African Republic is also difficult as is Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan.\u201d</p> <p>The appeal for a joined-up global response followed months in which countries have largely forged their own paths as many global political institutions \u2013 including those of the EU \u2013 have struggled to find consensus.</p> <p>Describing coronavirus as the \u201cmost daunting challenge facing humanity since the second world war\u201d, the letters adds: \u201cCoronavirus knows no borders, spares no country or continent, and strikes indiscriminately.</p> <p>\u201cIn this race against an invisible enemy, all countries must fight back but not all begin from the same starting line. In countries where the world\u2019s most vulnerable need humanitarian aid and supplies to beat back the pandemic, cancelled flights and disrupted supply routes hit disproportionately hard.</p> <p>\u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s interest to stop the virus from spreading unchecked, destroying lives and economies, and continuing to circle around the world.\u201d</p> <p>Lowcock added: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about compassion and empathy it\u2019s about hard self interest. Nobody is going to be safe, until everyone is safe. The places [where] humanitarian agencies work are potentially huge reservoirs where it is hard to mange the virus.\u201d</p> <p>The letter followed the appeal launched by the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, on 25 March amid the escalating global economic meltdown prompted by the pandemic. However, it revealed that despite the appeal for $2bn only $550m has so far been pledged.</p> <p>It also came just a week after Donald Trump\u2019s suspension of funding to the WHO, the main UN agency leading the fight against coronavirus.</p> <p>One of the most pressing concerns has been the devastating impact of the collapse of commercial aviation relied on by humanitarian organisations in places like Africa to move staff and supplies, requiring UN\u2019s World Food Programme to massively expand its transport and logistics services \u2013 including its UN Humanitarian Air Service \u2013 which is available to all aid professionals, which itself requires an extra $350m.</p> <p>Chris Lockyear, international secretary general of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, said that, like many agencies, MSF was involved in a \u201crace against time with the pandemic\u201d even as it had been forced to shut down programmes across the world.</p> <p>\u201cTime is fundamental. We have already seen how devastating this disease is in places with highly developed health expertise and security. If the consequences have been devastating in Europe and the US imagine what we are looking at in places with perhaps only a handful of doctors.\u201d</p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-threatens-to-turn-aid-crises-into-humanitarian-catastrophes\">Guardian reported last month</a> officials and experts are concerned not only with the impact of the disease in developing countries but of the knock-on effect in pre-existing emergencies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/01/afghanistan-braces-for-coronavirus-surge-as-migrants-pour-back-from-iran\">in places such as Afghanistan</a>, Syria, Yemen and Zimbabwe, where humanitarian supply lines to hugely vulnerable populations are already extremely fragile.</p>",

No event in the coming days would generate a gathering to compare. The game would draw people from across the Puget Sound area, and maybe beyond.</p> \n   <p>In the end, the match went on. Two days after the public health department wrote on Facebook, \u201cWe are making a recommendation to postpone or cancel events greater than 10-50 people,\u201d officials in King County allowed a soccer match to be held with 33,000 fans, squeezed together.</p> \n   <p>How that happened is captured in hundreds of pages of emails exchanged among federal, state and local officials, as well as executives from the Sounders, Seahawks, Mariners and XFL Dragons.

Emphasis ours:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our supply-chain group has worked around the clock to secure gowns, gloves, face masks, goggles, face shields, and N95 respirators. These employees have adapted to a new normal, exploring every lead, no matter how unusual. <strong>Deals, some bizarre and convoluted, and many involving large sums of money, have dissolved at the last minute when we were outbid or outmuscled, sometimes by the federal government.</strong> Then we got lucky, but getting the supplies was not easy.</p> \n   <p>A lead came from an acquaintance of a friend of a team member. After several hours of vetting, we grew confident of the broker\u2019s professional pedigree and the potential to secure a large shipment of three-ply face masks and N95 respirators. The latter were KN95 respirators, N95s that were made in China. We received samples to confirm that they could be successfully fit-tested. Despite having cleared this hurdle, we remained concerned that the samples might not be representative of the bulk of the products that we would be buying. Having acquired the requisite funds \u2013 more than five times the amount we would normally pay for a similar shipment, but still less than what was being requested by other brokers \u2013 we set the plan in motion. Three members of the supply-chain team and a fit tester were flown to a small airport near an industrial warehouse in the mid-Atlantic region. <strong>I arrived by car to make the final call on whether to execute the deal. Two semi-trailer trucks, cleverly marked as food-service vehicles, met us at the warehouse. When fully loaded, the trucks would take two distinct routes back to Massachusetts to minimize the chances that their contents would be detained or redirected.</strong></p> \n   <p>Hours before our planned departure, we were told to expect only a quarter of our original order. We went anyway, since we desperately needed any supplies we could get. Upon arrival, we were jubilant to see pallets of KN95 respirators and face masks being unloaded. We opened several boxes, examined their contents, and hoped that this random sample would be representative of the entire shipment. Before we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me. No, this shipment was not headed for resale or the black market. The agents checked my credentials, and I tried to convince them that the shipment of PPE was bound for hospitals. After receiving my assurances and hearing about our health system\u2019s urgent needs, the agents let the boxes of equipment be released and loaded into the trucks. <strong>But I was soon shocked to learn that the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting our PPE.</strong> Only some quick calls leading to intervention by our congressional representative prevented its seizure. I remained nervous and worried on the long drive back, feelings that did not abate until midnight, when I received the call that the PPE shipment was secured at our warehouse.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9caef48f080ee110447e18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-19T20:11:37.245Z\">9.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A number of US governors from both sides of the aisle, including Virginia Democrat Ralph Northam and Maryland Republican Larry Hogan, have accused Donald Trump of making \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d statements amid mounting pressure to roll back stay-at-home measures. </p> \n  <p>As the Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe and Edward Helmore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-governors-trump-making-delusional-comments\">report</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Many state leaders have said they cannot embark on Trump\u2019s recommended <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/\">three-phrase programme</a> to ease stay-at-home restrictions without a robust and widespread system of testing in place.</p> \n   <p>Researchers at Harvard University have suggested the US should conduct more than three times the number of coronavirus tests it is currently administering over the course of the next month, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html\">New York Times reported</a>.</p> \n   <p>Democratic Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia told CNN on Sunday that claims by Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence that states have plenty of tests were \u201cjust delusional\u201d.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe have been fighting for testing,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have enough swabs, believe it or not.
