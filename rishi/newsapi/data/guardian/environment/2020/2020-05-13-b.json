The decision by the Russian watchdog could affect hundreds of ventilators that have been produced since April as Russian hospitals sought new supplies to prepare for a flood of coronavirus cases. </p> \n  <p>Five coronavirus patients, some reportedly attached to ventilators, died in the early hours of Tuesday after a fire broke out at the St George hospital in St Petersburg. A fire last week at a Moscow hospital treating coronavirus patients also killed one person. That fire may also have been tied to a faulty ventilator. Both hospitals were reportedly using Aventa-M ventilators produced by a state-run factory in Russia\u2019s Urals region. </p> \n  <p>An April tender showed that last month the St George hospital had ordered 237 ventilators from the factory, which is the only manufacturer of that ventilator in the country. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbbe068f08d99d46a15f24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/emmanuel-akinwotu\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:34:56.619Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The continuing ban on public and religious gatherings in Nigeria has led to increasingly divided reactions from Churches in Nigeria. </p> \n  <p>In recent weeks, two of the most influential mega-church pastors in the country have grown in hostility to the government\u2019s lockdown measures, and questioned the severity of the pandemic altogether.</p> \n  <p>Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Tabernacle has been among the most ardent critics of the ban on places of worship. Its main branch on the outskirts of Lagos draws 50,000 people. Earlier this week Oyedepo said the closure of churches while hospitals and markets were open amounted to a conspiracy against Churches. <br><br>\u201cThere is something wrong; for people to be allowed to be in the market for six hours and can\u2019t be in church for two hours. I can smell a rat,\u201d he said this week. \u201cThe voice of darkness is influencing people at various levels, targeting the church because the growth and expansion of the church is the greatest headache of the devil. I declare churches open.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome\u2019s Christ Embassy is spread around the world with a main branch in Lagos seating 30,000 people. The pastor has been a consistent critic of measures to tackle the pandemic. \u201cThe lockdown is not science,\u201d he said in a sermon on Tuesday. The wearing of facemasks in public was \u201can embarrassment to science\u201d, he added. He has also previously linked Covid-19 to 5G mobile phone networks, fuelling a conspiracy theory that has spread around the world.</p> \n  <p>Both church leaders have faced criticism for their comments, not least from fellow church pastors. Pastor Tunde Bakare, the head of The Citadel Global Community Church, where the main hall in Lagos seats 5,000, this week donated two church buildings and a private residence to Nigerian states for isolation centres. </p> \n  <p>\u201cChurches with multiple facilities, rather than their leaders criticising the government should collaborate with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must be prepared to offer some of their halls to the government as isolation centres, in support of the efforts of the government.\u201d<br><br>In a further boost to Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 response, the Catholic Church in Nigeria this week donated all of its 425 medical facilities across the country to the government to serve as isolation and treatment centres. Nigeria\u2019s predominantly deeply religious population is evenly split between Christians and Muslims according to government surveys. </p> \n  <p>The effect of the lockdown on religious life has been immense. Yet many Nigerian Christians are increasingly calling on the country\u2019s mega churches to donate their now empty auditoriums as the country rushes to build its health capacity. New infections of Covid-19 in Nigeria are growing, now at 4,787, doubling in the last 12 days. 158 people have lost their lives and 959 people have recovered. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbba898f08d99d46a15ef8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:15:35.176Z\">10.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Reuters have filed this update from Poland:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Poland will extend its strict border controls until 12 June due to the coronavirus pandemic, its Interior Ministry said on Wednesday.</p> \n   <p>Poland closed its borders to foreigners in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus and has extended the restriction four times since then.

Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent \u2013 and highly profitable \u2013 no-touch future.</p> \n  <p>This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen \u201cshared\u201d on a mediated platform. It\u2019s a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. It\u2019s a future that claims to be run on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. It\u2019s a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/13/naomi-klein-how-big-tech-plans-to-profit-from-coronavirus-pandemic\">Naomi Klein: How big tech plans to profit from the pandemic</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb75ce8f08a55ecde58e3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T05:00:58.509Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nature is healing in San Jose, California: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">oh my goat <a href=\"https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz\">https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz</a></p>\u2014 Helen Sullivan (@helenrsullivan) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb7d148f08a55ecde58e5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:54:56.152Z\">5.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thailand has recorded zero new coronavirus cases for the first time since 9 March, Rueters reports. </p> \n  <p>Thailand has 3,017 confirmed cases and<strong> </strong>56 deaths, according to <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a> data. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a/0_237_5296_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb76a68f08d99d46a15d56\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:45:47.425Z\">5.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000. </strong>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,261,955 people around the world are known to have contracted the virus, while at least 291,964 have died since the pandemic began.<strong> </strong>The numbers, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing recording and testing regimes.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than 147,000 Americans could die by early August \u2013 study. </strong>A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans will die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The current US death toll stands at 82,376.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil reports record deaths. </strong>Brazil reported a record <a href=\"https://covid.saude.gov.br/\">881 Covid-19</a> deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">figures</a>. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest.</li> \n   <li><strong>US Senate threatens sanctions on China over Covid-19 accounting. </strong>US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</li> \n   <li><strong>Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents. </strong>The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. It was widely believed that this will be done within 10 days. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity today, suggesting that while there is a citywide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times.</li> \n   <li><strong>Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home\">Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d</a>, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday.

accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for the detrimental role they played in this pandemic,\u201d said Senator Jim Inhofe, one of the sponsors of the \u201cCovid-19 Accountability Act.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cTheir outright deception of the origin and spread of the virus cost the world valuable time and lives as it began to spread,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</p> \n  <p>Trump must also certify that China has closed its highest-risk wet markets and released Hong Kong activists arrested in post-Covid-19 crackdowns.</p> \n  <p>Without certification, Trump would be authorised under the legislation to impose sanctions like asset freezes, travel bans and visa revocations, as well as restricting Chinese businesses\u2019 access to US bank financing and capital markets.</p> \n  <p>\u201cChina refuses to allow the international community to go into the Wuhan lab to investigate,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, another sponsor of the bill.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey refuse to allow investigators to study how this

  "<p>Do not feel guilty if you neglect your freezer. It happens to the best of us. \u201cI don\u2019t think I cleaned ours at home in a year until lockdown,\u201d confesses Nina Matsunaga, the chef-owner at the Black Bull Inn in Sedbergh, Cumbria. \u201cWe do our work freezer every couple of days.\u201d</p> <p>Like Matsunaga, many of us are looking anew at our freezers. Covid-19 has concentrated minds on saving money, minimising waste and shopping less frequently. People are storing more, collectively, and after a 30% spike in the month before lockdown, frozen food sales have continued to rise, according to the British Frozen Food Federation.</p> <p>You can work productively with whatever you have, from giant chest freezers to single compartments in small fridges. All sub-zero space is useful. But how many of us know how best to utilise what in her book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-ice-kitchen-9780008385118.html\">The Ice Kitchen</a> Shivi Ramoutar describes as an \u201cunfashionable\u201d preservation method?

Slow freezing produces bigger crystals. Therefore, \u201cdrier\u201d ingredients freeze best. Peas thrive at -18C, while berry fruits turn to mush as they defrost. If you are making jam that is fine but freezing can ruin less flexible foods.</p> <p>For instance, the Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge, owner of the Butcher\u2019s Tap butcher in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, warns against freezing prime cuts \u2013 even high-grade, dry-aged beef \u2013 and particularly cheaper, watery steaks: \u201cThe muscle fibres get stretched and when it defrosts water comes out and that steak\u2019s juiciness becomes insipid. You\u2019ve broken its body.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How do you protect food in that icy environment?</strong></h2> <p>Exposed to freezing air, loosely wrapped foods become dry, icy and corroded \u2013 so-called \u201cfreezer burn\u201d. To avoid that, place food in reusable silicone pouches or heavy plastic food bags, push as much air out as you can, and seal. Freeze each pack laid flat at first to minimise ice crystals. \u201cFlat surface areas freeze quicker,\u201d says Dan McGeorge, the head chef at Rothay Manor, Cumbria, which also allows you to arrange your freezer like a filing cabinet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d984d75859e4a52d606ebbff72949a9f9635f6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d984d75859e4a52d606ebbff72949a9f9635f6f/0_2163_4912_2944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Food should be packed and sealed with as much air removed as possible to avoid freezer burn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Food should be packed and sealed with as much air removed as possible to avoid freezer burn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: jon11/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Sorry, filing cabinet?</strong></h2> <p>We tend to dump stuff in freezers where it sits for years, unlabelled and unidentifiable. Avoid that by labelling your flattish packs of rice, soups, sauces, shredded meat, chopped vegetables etc top right and storing them upright in a freezer drawer like files, rotating the oldest to the front. \u201cYou just riffle through to find the right pack and pull it out,\u201d says Lulu Grimes, the managing editor of BBC Good Food.</p> <p>Ramoutar\u2019s labels include the date the food was frozen (her general rule is to use everything within three to six months) and: \u201cHow I reheat it, so H for hob, O for oven, a temperature and time.\u201d You can buy special freezer labels, but paper, pen and sticky tape works. Avoid washable markers that rub off easily.</p> <p>Tip! From bacon rashers to egg whites, portion food into identifiable, user-friendly quantities. \u201cDon\u2019t freeze berries, sausages or meatballs in blocks,\u201d advises Si Toft, the chef-owner at the the Dining Room in Abersoch, Gwynedd. \u201cLay them on greaseproof paper, freeze for two hours, then bag them and take out individual handfuls.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Is there anything you should never freeze?</strong></h2> <p>Very little gets a flat no. Defrosted boiled eggs and raw potatoes are grim, however, and raw egg yolks go rubbery. \u201cWhisk them slightly and add a stabiliser \u2013 salt or sugar, depending on what you\u2019re doing with them,\u201d suggests Ramoutar.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hard, mature cheeses and firm blues freeze better \u2013 they are fine in a toastie</p> <footer> <cite>Dan Bliss</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Generally, this is a question of preparation and end use. Can you be bothered to protect a food\u2019s textural integrity and will that matter?<em> </em>Deseeded, salted, sliced, rinsed, dried and frozen cucumber makes lovely crunchy batons for dips, but that is a lot of graft. Conversely, soft herbs that turn into dark mulch as they defrost taste fine in soups and sauces \u2013 as do finely chopped vegetables. Large pieces of raw vegetable become spongy in the freezer, which will not enhance your Sunday roast. Cook before freezing for a better result.</p> <p>Broadly, if you are going to blitz it later, if you just need the flavour and not the mouthfeel, you can freeze anything. But blanching soft herbs and vegetables \u2013 submerge briefly in boiling water, plunge them into ice, dry them thoroughly \u2013 helps to retain colour and flavour.</p> <h2><strong>Can you freeze milk and cheese?</strong></h2> <p>Milk, yes. Cheese is complicated. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend it,\u201d says Dan Bliss of the cheesemonger Paxton &amp; Whitfield. \u201cThe moisture and fat splits. Defrosted cheese has a weird texture. But avoiding food waste is close to my heart. Hard, mature cheeses and firm blues freeze better \u2013 they are fine in a toastie, and you get amazing pockets of molten cheese in scones when you add grated frozen cheese to the mix. With soft cheeses, make lasagne or sauces and freeze those.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What is the problem with fish?</strong></h2> <p>Historically, \u201cfresh\u201d fish was regularly frozen at sea and defrosted for sale, which meant you could not freeze it at home without cooking it first (on the basis that you should not refreeze defrosted food). That is no longer always true. Ask your fishmonger for guidance or check the label, which may explain: \u201cThis product was previously frozen and has been restored to chill temperature under carefully controlled conditions. It is still suitable for home freezing.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I freeze whole spices to keep them fresh: tamarind paste, curry leaves, blitzed ginger, garlic and whole fresh turmeric</p> <footer> <cite>Sumayya Usmani</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ideally, freeze whole fish or skin-on fillets. Brining the fillets (10% salt solution, 20-40 minutes), helps to firm up the delicate flesh. Thoroughly dry the fish, and wrap it in a moisture-absorbing cloth and lots of clingfilm. \u201cWhen you think you\u2019ve got enough, double it. The secret is knowing it\u2019s covered,\u201d says the chef John Molnar, owner of the Cod\u2019s Scallops fishmongers and chip shops in Nottingham.</p> <p>Molnar dislikes freezing seafood \u2013 although, interestingly, freezing helps to tenderise fresh squid and octopus \u2013 but, carefully separated and wrapped, scallops work well: \u201cStacked like a packet of Rolos.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Do you really need fresh herbs and spices?</strong></h2> <p>If you want them to look great, yes. If you just need flavour, no. Soft herbs can be blitzed and frozen in cream or oil, and you don\u2019t need to carry a vast array of fresh spices to make curry. \u201cI freeze whole spices to keep them fresh: tamarind paste, curry leaves, blitzed ginger, garlic and whole fresh turmeric, which I grate when needed,\u201d says Sumayya Usmani, a Pakistani food expert and owner of Glasgow\u2019s Kaleyard Cook School.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63c33ce3e2a3a025967c606244697f46b4a76245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63c33ce3e2a3a025967c606244697f46b4a76245/0_510_4479_2687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spices and herbs can be frozen so they stay fresh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spices and herbs can be frozen so they stay fresh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natikka/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Can a freezer fast-forward my cooking?</strong></h2> <p>In endless ways, from using cooked frozen rice in stir-fries (undercook it by 20%, make sure you cool it quickly, freeze) to making soup in minutes from frozen spinach.

Indeed, most chefs use the freezer as a tool for meat rather than for storage. If you want perfectly cubed pancetta or incredibly thin beef for carpaccio, firm the meat by freezing it for 30 minutes, then slice it. James Cochran, the head chef at 12:51 restaurant in London, uses a Microplane to grate frozen beef on to poached eggs (\u201clike fancy tartare\u201d) and bone marrow into mash, \u201clike parmesan, to add umami\u201d.</p> <p>Kerridge is more open to freezing meat at home \u2013 \u201ccured meats work fine\u201d \u2013 and in braises, curries or stews, where the sauce is the main flavour, it will be impossible to detect if the beef shin, ham hock or chicken breasts used were frozen. \u201cPacket chicken breasts are just protein which takes on the flavour of whatever they are cooked in,\u201d he says.</p> <h2><strong>Is the freezer a baker\u2019s secret weapon?</strong></h2> <p>It certainly lends itself to cool hacks (sorry). Chilling layers of a celebration cake makes them less fragile as you trim and level them, but also, says Rachel Stockley, the head chef at Baratxuri in Ramsbottom, Bury, if you freeze the icing as you complete each layer it produces a smooth, hard finish, so the cake \u201csits in those even layers the pros get\u201d. After glazing sausage rolls and pies, Andy Waugh, of Mac and Wild, London, freezes them for 30 minutes and repeats that before cooking: \u201cIt gives you an extra-lush finish.\u201d The freezer will even save wedges of dry fruit cake, advises Scott Paton, the head chef at Boringdon Hall, Devon: \u201cThe fruit plumps up and makes the cake moist.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units.</p> \n<p>The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus\">issued an alert</a> to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/\">toxic shock</a> and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, medics at the Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital announced the death of a 14-year-old boy, the first known fatality from the condition in Britain. Between 75 and 100 children are now receiving treatment across the country. Typical symptoms include a fever, skin rashes, red eyes, cracked lips and abdominal pain.</p> \n<p>Doctors suspected early on that coronavirus played a role in the new disorder by triggering an excessive immune reaction in the children, but there was no proof that the two were linked.</p> \n<p>The latest evidence comes from doctors in Bergamo, the city with the highest rate of coronavirus infections and deaths in Italy. Medical records at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital showed that since the outbreak reached Bergamo, cases of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/kawasaki-disease/causes/\">Kawasaki</a>-like disease rose to about 10 per month compared with one every three months in the previous five years.</p> \n<p>Of 10 children treated for the disorder between mid-February and mid-April, eight tested positive for antibodies to the virus.

  "<p>Ministers faced fresh allegations on Wednesday of failing to prepare care homes for a pandemic, as it emerged that Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-real-care-home-death-toll-double-official-figure-study-says\">may have killed 22,000 residents</a> in England and Wales \u2013 more than twice the official toll.</p> \n<p>Council social care directors in England warned the government two years ago, in a series of detailed reports, about care homes\u2019 exposure to a pandemic, the Guardian has learned.</p> \n<p>They called for better supply plans for personal protective equipment \u2013 warning that \u201cdemand for PPE could rapidly outstrip supply\u201d \u2013 plus improved infection control and a system to enlist volunteers to help services expected to be stretched to breaking point.</p> \n<p>The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), which represents directors of adult social services in England, told the Guardian it carried out the work to improve government planning for a flu pandemic at the request of the Department of Health and Social Care. But it said: \u201cWe are not aware of whether government departments picked up on any of the recommendations set out.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cAs the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans \u2013 allowing us to rapidly respond to this unprecedented crisis. Our planning helped prevent the NHS being overwhelmed and means we are past the peak of the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>The fresh allegations come as Boris Johnson was accused of downplaying the threat to care homes as recently as March, while a study from the London School of Economics (LSE) put the death toll for care home residents in England and Wales at 22,000, more than double the official estimate.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/care-home-residents-harvested-left-to-die-uk-government-herd-immunity\">'Harvesting' is a terrible word \u2013&nbsp;but it's what has happened in Britain's care homes | Richard Coker</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On a day of rising pressure over the failure better to protect the elderly and vulnerable against the coronavirus outbreak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/boris-johnson-resorts-to-bluster-under-keir-starmer-cross-examination\">Keir Starmer used prime minister\u2019s questions</a> to ask why Public Health England (PHE) had advised in March that care home residents were \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to become infected by Covid-19. This was PHE\u2019s position as the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic and people were already dying in the UK.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader said the government had been \u201ctoo slow to protect people in care homes\u201d, and Johnson was forced to admit that \u201cthe number of casualties has been too high\u201d in the sector.</p> \n<p>Stamer said the final coronavirus death toll, currently standing at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-40000-official-figures-say\">just over 40,000</a> in the UK, including care homes, hospitals and private homes, would be \u201cdeeply horrifying\u201d.</p> \n<p>The advice on the \u201cunlikely\u201d threat posed by Covid-19 to care homes was changed on 13 March and Downing Street said it was drawn up at a time when there were no infections in the UK. But the clash highlighted growing anger over the attention and resourcing given to preparing care homes as ministers focused on preventing the NHS from being overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>In a sign of shifting priorities, the government announced a \u00a3600m cash injection for care homes to help control infection.</p> \n<p>The report prepared by Adass for the government in 2018 followed a government pandemic planning exercise known as Cygnus, which uncovered the need to boost the capacity of care homes and staff numbers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5db220bd-91df-44be-8f21-f47c8505b40b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xAU2euHH8v0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>They stated that frontline care workers would need advice on \u201ccontrolling cross-infection\u201d and called for a system for mustering volunteers from families, charities and the community to help overwhelmed homes. They also called for new guidance on increasing stocks of PPE, with a prescient warning that \u201cdemand for PPE could rapidly outstrip supply\u201d. </p> \n<p>Care operators have struggled to limit cross-infection, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/the-observer-view-on-care-home-deaths-being-an-indictment-of-our-society\">outbreaks</a> killing more than two dozen residents in some facilities in the space of a few weeks. Staff absences have been running at 10% to 20% and early in the crisis the care industry complained that it was not covered by the government\u2019s NHS volunteering scheme.</p> \n<p>A survey of more than 100 care homes published on Wednesday by the Alzheimer\u2019s Society found 43% were still not confident of their PPE supply, with one home resorting to taping bags around carers\u2019 arms, feet and hair. Some 58% of homes said they were unable to isolate residents, and one-third said they had taken in Covid-positive patients discharged from hospital.</p> \n<p>The latest assessment of fatalities in care settings by LSE academics found that more than half of all \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in England and Wales \u2013 those above the five-year average for the period from 28 December to 1 May \u2013 happened in care homes. They said that from 13 March to 1 May, care homes accounted for 19,938 excess deaths.</p> \n<p>Only 8,310 of those were specifically linked to Covid-19 by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), reflecting the declarations of care homes rather than on death certificates.</p> \n<p>The researchers added that deaths of care home residents in hospitals were not currently represented in the ONS figures, and that around 15% of deaths of care home residents happened in hospitals , bringing the total to more than 22,000.</p> \n<p>The report authors, Adelina Comas-Herrera and Jos\u00e9-Luis Fern\u00e1ndez, have been tracking virus death tolls in care homes globally since the start of the pandemic. They cited concerns raised internationally about deaths being linked to the residents being isolated in their rooms, without adequate food, drink or medical support, and not to the virus itself.</p> \n<p>The ONS appeared to support their estimate, saying its data showed just under 20,000 excess deaths registered up to 1 May in care homes since the pandemic started.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf those, 8,312 have had Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe are undertaking further analysis on all deaths of care home residents which will be published in the coming days.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, Downing Street confirmed that the international comparison of death rates by country had been dropped from the slide at the daily press conference, but denied that it was because of embarrassment that the UK is now shown as having the second worst toll after the US.</p>",

Then, desperate to quench their thirst, they hunted sea birds, drank their blood and drained their eggs.</p> <p>\u201cAfter that, we we all fell down there and sleep until the sunrise the next morning woke us up.\u201d</p> <p>Totau was interviewed for Bregman\u2019s account, which focuses on the positives of their story \u2013 the ability of the boys to cooperate and establish a functioning community that allowed them to survive for more than a year \u2013 in contrast with the characters in William Golding\u2019s novel Lord of the Flies. Totau says that in general the boys managed to \u201csettle it down and keep it in peace\u201d, though they did clash occasionally. They were after all six teenagers stuck together in a frightening situation.</p> <p>\u201cYou should be fairly understanding of what could happen in a group of people like that, and also in a situation they are facing,\u201d he says. But he cautions against thinking their experience was a fun one.</p> <p>\u201cWe [were] not happy where we [were],\u201d says Totau. \u201cIf you were on a place, you don\u2019t know where it is, and also you did not see any part of your family, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be happy to be there ... you won\u2019t be happy until you see your family.\u201d</p> <p>The families had all held funerals for the missing boys, though Totau says when he was reunited with his relatives his father told him he had never given up hope that he was alive.</p> <h2>\u2018They were so scared\u2019</h2> <p> The boys were eventually rescued by Peter Warner, an Australian adventurer who was sailing around Tonga in 1966.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3d5468583631446b302ce3b304d5e9ab108097dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d5468583631446b302ce3b304d5e9ab108097dd/0_0_3581_2792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Warner (third left) with his crew: David, John, Luke, Bill, Stephen, Jim, Kolo and Mano in 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"780\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Warner (third left) with his crew: David, John, Luke, Bill, Stephen, Jim, Kolo and Mano in 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Raymond/Fairfax Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI could not explain how we feel, all of us, we are full of tears, happy, and like we walk through to heaven,\u201d said Totau of the moment they spotted Warner\u2019s boat. One of the group \u2013 Stephen \u2013 swam out to meet it, the other boys gathered on the rocks, calling out to each other.</p> <p>Totau has nothing but praise for Warner, with whom he has since worked and considers a friend. But he says initially, Warner and his crew were fearful of the boys. </p> <p>\u201cThey were so scared, because we were all naked, long hair,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all hopped in the water and swim out to the boat \u2026 Mr Warner did not put the ladder down because they were all scared about us, but luckily we could speak to him in English and we talk, he give us a few questions, he give us a few photos from Tonga. He showed us the photo of our queen, we said \u2018yes that\u2019s our queen, Queen S\u0101lote\u2019\u2026 Sort of testing and trying to find out if what we\u2019re telling him is true or not.\u201d</p> <p>When they returned to Tonga, the boys were imprisoned \u2013 the boat they had taken more than a year previously was stolen and the boat\u2019s owner decided to press charges \u2013 and it was Warner who helped to secure their release. He discovered they had been locked up when, after returning them to Nuku\u2018alofa, they had not shown up on his boat for a party he was throwing in their honour.</p> <p>Totau says Warner walked the streets until 1am before he could find news of the boys and he was eventually able to secure their release from jail by selling the Australian rights to the story to Channel Seven and using the money to pay for a replacement boat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ecca4fc3d234691cb8e834a08f02fb08f6e8a5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ecca4fc3d234691cb8e834a08f02fb08f6e8a5b/0_424_2634_1580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Warner aboard his fishing boat in 1967\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Warner aboard his fishing boat in 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fairfax Media Archives/Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the publication of Bregman\u2019s article, there has been backlash among some Pacific Islanders. A key objection is the fact that the story of the boys was told largely from the point of view of the white Australian who rescued them. There was also anger at the explanation of why \u2018Ata was uninhabited \u2013 \u201cThe island had been inhabited once, until one dark day in 1863, when a slave ship appeared on the horizon and sailed off with the natives,\u201d wrote Bregman \u2013 which some felt was too cursory a reference to the the devastating reality of the Pacific slave trade, which saw tens of thousand of people from the South Pacific kidnapped, tricked or coerced into slavery around the world.</p> <p>Others have strongly objected to the revelation in the article that Warner owned and then sold the rights to the story of the boys\u2019 rescue.</p> <p>Bregman made the point that the article was an extract from a chapter of his book, Humankind, in which he interviewed Mano and Sione, the oldest of the six boys, and made use of never-released interviews with the group.</p> <p>\u201cEverything I write about what happened on the island of \u2018Ata in 1965-66 is based on their accounts. I devote a lot of attention to the horrible Pacific slave trade, not only on \u2018Ata but also on Easter Island,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy account from what happened on \u2018Ata comes from Mano: \u2018The real Lord of the Flies, Mano told us, began in June 1965.\u201d</p> <p>Bregman said the notion that Warner benefitted financially from the story was \u201cridiculous\u201d. \u201cThe most important storyline in the chapter is of the deep bond that developed between Peter and Mano. As Mano said later: \u2018He\u2019s like a father to me.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"db98cdc25346956f4b0a66af511bfd69a8ee91d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db98cdc25346956f4b0a66af511bfd69a8ee91d7/0_0_3000_2352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from the 1963 film of William Golding\u2019s Lord of the Flies.

  "<p>Farmers have lost a challenge to the government\u2019s cancellation of the badger cull in Derbyshire in a high court ruling that has been welcomed by wildlife groups.</p> <p>A judicial review of the environment secretary\u2019s decision to halt a planned expansion of the cull to Derbyshire last September brought by the National Farmers\u2019 Union was dismissed on all grounds.</p> <p>The NFU said the cancellation of the Derbyshire cull came after the intervention of Carrie Symonds, Boris Johnson\u2019s partner and a patron of the <a href=\"https://www.conservativeanimalwelfarefoundation.org/we-are-delighted-to-announce-carrie-symonds-director-of-communications-for-the-conservative-party-as-our-new-patron/\">Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation</a>, who was briefed by Dominic Dyer, head of the Badger Trust, three weeks before the government U-turn.</p> <p>The extension of the cull to Derbyshire was widely opposed by wildlife groups including the Badger Trust and Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, which is running <a href=\"https://www.derbyshirewildlifetrust.org.uk/badger-vaccination\">the largest badger vaccination programme in the country</a>. Derbyshire Wildlife Trust argued that a cull would jeopardise its work with 52 landowners and farmers, in which 221 badgers were vaccinated in 2019.</p> <p>The government licensed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/28/more-than-100000-badgers-slaughtered-in-discredited-cull-policy\">the killing of 35,034 badgers in 2019</a> in 40 culling zones from Cornwall to Cumbria, its seventh successive year of badger culling, a controversial destruction of a legally protected wild species which has done little to slow the spread of TB in cattle.</p> <p>While pro-cull farmers, supported by figures from the Animal and Plant Health Agency, claimed that 77% of new cases of bovine TB in Derbyshire were caused by badgers, Derbyshire Wildlife Trust used freedom of information requests to reveal that this figure was based on the personal judgment of vets called to new outbreaks.</p> <p>Peer-reviewed scientific literature estimates that badgers contribute 5%-36% of outbreaks in cattle. Most bovine TB within herds is transmitted by other cows who are not diagnosed with the disease by the notoriously unreliable cattle tuberculin skin test.</p> <p>The National Farmers\u2019 Union said it was <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/news/latest-news/nfu-responds-to-high-court-judgment-on-derbyshire-badger-cull-decision/\">\u201cshocked and dismayed\u201d</a> by the high court decision. Stuart Roberts, deputy president of the NFU, said: \u201cThe 11th-hour direction by the secretary of state was made against absolutely all the scientific and veterinary advice and left farmers in the Derbyshire area, who met all the licence criteria, completely devastated. Many of them had seen this cull as their last hope at dealing with this awful disease which has been devastating their cattle herds and crippling their business for years.</p> <p>\u201cIt remains our view that it simply cannot be lawful for the government to make policy up on the hoof.\u201d</p> <p>After an independent review by Sir Charles Godfray into bovine TB policies, the government recently conceded that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/badger-cull-phased-out-replaced-vaccinations-bovine-tb-england\">the mass culling of badgers was not a long-term solution</a> to reducing bovine TB. It announced a new emphasis on vaccinating cattle as well as badgers against the disease, which scientists hailed as \u201ca seismic shift\u201d.</p> <p>Dominic Dyer, chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: \u201cThe Badger Trust is delighted to see the prime minister took note of the concerns we raised in our open letter to him on why a badger cull licence should not be issued in Derbyshire in 2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe high court judgment shows he was highly engaged in the decision-making process to withhold a cull licence in Derbyshire and we are pleased to see that the judge accepted his intervention in this case was both legitimate and lawful.</p> <p>\u201cIn its verdict on the Godfray review, the government has made it clear that it wants to find an exit strategy to badger culling based on badgers and cattle vaccination combined with improved TB testing in cattle and tighter biosecurity and movement controls. The Badger Trust fully supports this change of policy.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>BuzzFeed is to end its news operations in the UK and Australia, effectively marking the end of the digital upstart\u2019s global ambition to shake up traditional news media.</p> <p>Once derided for its focus on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/aug/12/5-ways-listicle-changing-journalism\">traffic-grabbing \u201clisticles\u201d</a>, BuzzFeed transformed into a highly respected peer to traditional media outlets.

BuzzFeed launched a local news operation in the UK just over six years ago.</p> <p>According to sources, those furloughed are \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to return to BuzzFeed. BuzzFeed UK will keep staff covering news with a \u201cglobal audience\u201d, such as its investigations operation and celebrity news coverage, for now at least.</p> <p>\u201cFor economic and strategic reasons, we are going to focus on news that hits big in the United States during this difficult period,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>\u201cTherefore, we will notify staff in the UK and Australia that we are not planning to cover local news in those countries. We will be consulting with employees on our plans regarding furloughs and stand-downs in these regions.\u201d</p> <p>The company said that the cuts would also hit its flagship US operation as it looks to hit savings goals while continuing to produce \u201ckinetic, powerful journalism\u201d. \u201cWe [want to] reach the savings we need and produce the high-tempo, explosive journalism our readers rely on,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>BuzzFeed maintained that it was still \u201cinvesting heavily\u201d in its news operation, with a projection of investing $10m more this year than the division makes, and $6m in 2021.</p> <p>Launched by Jonah Peretti in 2006, the outlet is among a generation of start-ups, also including Vice and Vox, that took the media world by storm only to run into financial difficulty as the advertising climate collapsed. As recently as 2016, the company had attracted a valuation of as much as $1.7bn.</p> <p>The unprecedented advertising slump brought on by the coronavirus has hastened the end of an already struggling business model. In January, Peretti <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonah/buzzfeed-in-2020\">posted a 2,500-word blog</a> laying out plans to diversify the ailing business\u2019s revenue streams. Days later it was reported that he had upgraded his Los Angeles home, <a href=\"https://www.dirt.com/moguls/tech/jonah-peretti-house-los-feliz-1203306667/\">buying a $5.2m property</a>.</p> <p>He had previously publicly raised the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/business/media/buzzfeed-jonah-peretti-mergers.html\">merging with other digital publishers</a> in order to gain the scale to fight on more equal terms with the likes of Facebook and Google, which dominate the digital advertising market.</p> <p>Less than a year later, <a href=\"https://amp.ft.com/content/4adccda4-e518-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc\">three of the companies Peretti referred to as potential partners had done deals</a>: Vice, which has a more male-focused audience, acquired Refinery29, which targets millennial females, to create a $4bn publishing group. Vox bought New York Media, which owns sites including Vulture and The Cut, to build scale.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it emerged in December that BuzzFeed\u2019s international operations, non-US businesses including the UK, Germany, Australia and Brazil, had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0e21a76-23f0-11ea-9a4f-963f0ec7e134\">seen losses quadruple in 2018</a>. International revenues fell by 35%, according to the most recently available public filings. In the same year BuzzFeed cut a third of its UK newsroom staff.</p> <p>At the same time BuzzFeed News began asking readers to \u201chelp shape the future\u201d of its content through donations, a similar model to that used by the Guardian. The support page, promoted at the bottom of news stories, <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/buzzfeed-news-now-asking-readers-for-donations-from-5-to-100-to-help-it-report-more-news/\">asked for donations of $5 to $100</a> to diversify away from a reliance on advertising revenues.

  "<p>Reopening primary schools in England from the start of next month could fuel the spread of coronavirus, one of the government\u2019s scientific advisers has admitted.</p> <p>Osama Rahman, chief scientific adviser to the Department for Education (DfE), appeared to undermine the government\u2019s case for reopening schools when he gave evidence to the Commons science and technology committee on Wednesday.</p> <p>Questioned by MPs, he admitted that a wider reopening of schools could bring together \u201chundreds of potential vectors\u201d that could lead to the spread of the virus. He also said there was a \u201clow degree of confidence\u201d in studies suggesting children transmit Covid-19 any less than adults.</p> <p>Asked whether there was a risk of the virus being transmitted when schools reopen, Rahman said there would always be a risk of transmission. \u201cEven going to school anyway is not a risk-free environment,\u201d Rahman said. \u201cThe question is to what extent that risk is acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>The adviser raised eyebrows when he was unable to give a figure for deaths among under-18s from Covid-19: \u201cI don\u2019t have those numbers to hand. It\u2019s an important question.\u201d</p> <p>Carol Monaghan, a member of the committee, said: \u201cAs a former teacher listening to this, I don\u2019t think the profession is going to be at all satisfied by what they are hearing at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>The government expects children in England to be able to return to nurseries, reception, year 1 and year 6 from 1 June at the earliest, and other primary year groups to return before the summer. The plans have been met with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/13/unions-warn-of-lack-of-understanding-over-english-school-reopenings\">fierce opposition</a> from education unions. Schools are currently open only to children of key workers and pupils classed as vulnerable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/are-children-less-susceptible-to-coronavirus\">Are children less susceptible to coronavirus?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rahman told the committee there was little evidence to suggest children transmit the virus any differently from adults. \u201cThere are some studies which suggest that they might transmit it less than adults, but this evidence is mixed, it\u2019s quite early, and so there is a low degree of confidence among Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] currently in the evidence which suggests that they might transmit it less.\u201d</p> <p>Monaghan then asked: \u201cSince there is a low degree of confidence, we are potentially putting together hundreds of potential vectors that can then go on and transmit \u2013 is that correct?\u201d</p> <p>Rahman responded: \u201cPossibly, depending on school sizes.\u201d</p> <p>Rahman\u2019s evidence is likely to result in headteachers thinking again about reopening, throwing the government\u2019s timetable into doubt. It will also raise questions about the DfE\u2019s level of involvement in the decision-making process behind the reopening, after Rahman told MPs: \u201cThat was not a departmental decision, that was a cabinet decision following advice from Sage.\u201d</p> <p>Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, described Rahman\u2019s evidence as shocking and disturbing. \u201cThe government has simply not provided a single shred of evidence that opening schools from 1 June will be safe for children or for teachers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSchools have been placed in a situation where the wrong decision will result in people becoming seriously ill and dying. The government must now publish the scientific evidence it is relying on to claim that it will be safe for children to return to schools from 1 June.\u201d</p> <p>The DfE later posted a letter from Rahman on its Twitter account offering \u201csome important points of clarification\u201d following his appearance before the committee. He said he had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the government\u2019s plans to reopen education institutions. </p>",

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Sir Keir Starmer was widely expected to outperform Boris Johnson at PMQs, and in their first encounter last week he duly managed to do so with aplomb. On their second outing you would have expected No 10 to have given some thought to how to mount a more effective response. But there was not much evidence of this, and Johnson was duly skittled.</p> \n  <p>One problem for Johnson was that some of the usual tactics just don\u2019t work at Zoom PMQs. A outright untruth can win you temporary reprieve in the House of Commons if 300 MPs are cheering you on and it is going to take people a while to work out that you\u2019re mistaken or lying, but Johnson does not have the wall of sound protection he used to enjoy, and denying the existence of a document that Labour were able to circulate within seconds (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/13/uk-coronavirus-live-millions-health-conditions-return-to-work-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ebbdc9c8f08a55ecde591b4#block-5ebbdc9c8f08a55ecde591b4\">12.47pm)</a> was just an elementary error. Starmer is not infallible, and there are ways of beating him in an argument. But suggesting that Starmer (the archetypal \u201cswot\u201d, as the PM would put it) is wrong on a point of fact - how naive can you get?</p> \n  <p>Having exhausted denial as a tactic, Johnson (in exchanges two and three) resorted to ignoring the question. But this, again, is a less reliable tactic in a largely silent House of Commons, and Johnson\u2019s failure to be able to address the point raised by <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/12/governments-handling-covid-19-british-disaster/\">the Ambrose Evans-Pritchard column in the Telegraph, </a>or to be able to give a sensible explanation of the excess death figure, left him looking unimpressive. In the final three answers Johnson was on slightly less shaky ground. There is an argument for not using the global death comparisons chart (although one that\u2019s harder to make if you\u2019ve only just abandoned it now), he did at last acknowledge the childcare problem, and he promised to publish Sage advice. But his very partial recovery was too late. By then the damage was done.</p> \n  <p>Again, none of this was particularly surprising.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Diamond said the UK was \u201cat the higher level\u201d for coronavirus deaths in Europe, but that he was not prepared to say it had the worst record</strong>. Asked directly if the UK had the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not prepared to say that at this time. I don\u2019t think that we have very good data in the UK and I do think that there is no doubt that we are, if you like, at the higher level for deaths. I\u2019ve no problem about saying that.</p> \n   <p>Because of the great difficulty in understanding exactly whether we\u2019re comparing apples with apples, or apples with pears, I\u2019m not prepared to say that the UK has the highest.</p> \n   <p>So, for example, if we look at the comparison with Italy, the most recent adjustment made in Italy only took us up to the end of March. We are much further on ...</p> \n   <p>So there are very, very different data collection strategies in different countries. It will be some time, because of the way that other countries report, that I\u2019m able to give an authoritative answer to that question.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Diamond also explained why comparing death rates in different countries could be misleading. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let\u2019s just start with age. We know that, above all, this is a disease which really impacts the elderly members of society. So if you population has a radically different age structure, then one needs to do something about controlling for that. Ireland, for example, has a much younger age structure than some other parts of Europe.</p> \n   <p>Secondly, we know from ONS data it\u2019s a pandemic which started in London. It takes much longer to move through rural areas. We need to know something about the degree of urbanisation, the degree to which people are living close together.</p> \n   <p>These are areas that you really need to take into account, as well as the points that we\u2019ve that we\u2019ve already talked about, which are about making sure that the recording is comparative.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The UK Statistics Authority has backed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-live-sunak-expected-to-extend-furlough-scheme-as-lockdown-confusion-continues?page=with:block-5ebad4de8f08d99d46a15999#block-5ebad4de8f08d99d46a15999\">Downing Street\u2019s decision to stop publishing a daily global deaths comparison chart.</a> </strong>At the hearing<strong> </strong><strong>Ed Humpherson</strong>, director general for regulation at the authority, was giving evidence alongside Diamond and he was asked specifically about the move, which means No 10 no longer presents a daily chart showing the UK as having the worst record in Europe.

coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p><strong>The Association of Independent Festivals</strong> (AIF), which represents 65 festivals in the UK, including <strong>Gloucestershire\u2019s 2000trees</strong>, <strong>London\u2019s Meltdown</strong> and <strong>Sheffield\u2019s Tramlines</strong>, reports 92% of its members saying they face costs that could ruin their businesses as a result of cancelled events, with the vast majority (98.5%) not covered by insurance for cancellation related to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Costs include potential refunds of up to \u00a3800m for events that were due to take place this summer, and average non-recoupable costs of \u00a3375,000 per festival for overheads such as marketing, staffing and advertising. </p> \n  <p>A member survey has revealed that the sector could be facing redundancies of 59% on average and will lose more than half of its workforce between September 2020 and February 2021 without support.</p> \n  <p>The AIF chief executive, <strong>Paul Reed</strong>, says that many independent festivals aren\u2019t able to access funds through the government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme because they are unable to meet eligibility criteria, while the bounce-back loan scheme, capped at \u00a350,000, doesn\u2019t adequately cover what they need to stay afloat without income for this year. </p> \n  <aside

Large public spaces such as buffets should ensure guests not in the same family can remain at least 1.5 metres apart, while big events such as concerts are discouraged.</p> <p>Guests should be advised on \u201crespiratory etiquette\u201d, namely sneezing or coughing into a tissue or a bent elbow, and issued with frequent reminders to wash their hands. Hotels would also be expected to keep address records to allow contact tracing in the event of an outbreak of coronavirus.</p> <p>The non-binding guidelines are an attempt to ease a fall-off in travel that has emptied Europe\u2019s beaches and squares of tourists since mid-March, threatening millions of jobs in a sector that accounts for 10% of the bloc\u2019s economy.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s guidance can be the chance of a better season for the many Europeans whose livelihood depends on tourism and of course for those who would like to travel this summer,\u201d Vestager said.</p> <p>Travellers are being asked to wear face masks on all modes of transport and in airports and stations, and transport workers to wear masks and gloves. Buses, trains and ferries are encouraged to run with fewer people, although airlines will not be required to leave middle seats empty.</p> <p><strong>Germany</strong> said on Wednesday that it would start relaxing entry controls on its borders with EU members from this weekend, but <strong>Spain</strong>, one of the continent\u2019s biggest tourist destinations,<strong> </strong>said it could wait until July.</p> <p>Decisions on the reopening of borders are the responsibility of national governments, but the commission urged the 27 member states to coordinate lifting their restrictions in stages, starting with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/eu-reopen-borders-tourists-covid-19-recovery-plan\">countries with </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/eu-reopen-borders-tourists-covid-19-recovery-plan\">low levels of coronavirus</a>.</p> <p>European governments are already pressing ahead with their own plans to reopen at different speeds depending on their national circumstances. The three Baltic states of <strong>Estonia</strong>, <strong>Latvia</strong> and <strong>Lithuania</strong> will reopen borders to each others\u2019 citizens, creating a \u201ctravel bubble\u201d, from 15 May.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s external borders are to remain closed to non-essential travel until at least mid-June.</p> <p><strong>Germany\u2019s</strong> interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said Berlin had \u201cset the clear goal of free travel in Europe by mid-June\u201d. Checks on the border with Luxembourg would be be dropped as early as Saturday, he said, and Berlin was consulting with Copenhagen on lifting all controls on the Danish border.</p> <p>Germany also plans to open all border crossings with France, Switzerland and Austria, rather than selected ones as at present, with spot checks replacing systematic controls.</p> <p>Earlier, Vienna said it was opening its borders with Germany and working on staggered reopenings with Switzerland, Liechtenstein and some eastern European countries.</p> <p>Spain will however impose a two-week quarantine on all travellers arriving from abroad from Friday, and two foreign ministry sources told Reuters that Madrid aimed to keep its borders closed to most travellers from abroad until July.</p> <p>The head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, has recommended the wearing of masks in all public spaces, amid reports that the government is considering making their use compulsory. At present masks are mandatory only on public transport. They have been handed out at train and metro stations.</p> <p>Sim\u00f3n said the best measure to control the virus was \u201ckeeping the two-metre distance\u201d, but added that masks \u201ccan be really helpful when it comes to controlling the epidemic\u201d.</p> <p>In Germany, face masks are obligatory on public transport and, in most regions, inside shops, but increasing numbers of people are taking legal action arguing that masks hinder personal expression and are not proven to be an effective tool against curbing the virus.</p> <p>Masks are also obligatory on public transport in <strong>France</strong>, and most stores prefer shoppers to wear them. The Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has again asked the government if she can reopen the city\u2019s parks and gardens and said she would make it mandatory to wear a mask in them if permission is granted.</p> <p>The <strong>Belgian </strong>government said schools, museums and hairdressers would be allowed to start reopening under strict distancing and hygiene conditions from 18 May. Marriages and funerals will be allowed to go ahead with no more than 30 guests, and street markets may start trading again with a maximum of 50 traders, who must wear masks.</p> <p><strong>Russia, </strong>Europe\u2019s new coronavirus hotspot, again reported more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday. The health minister, Mikhail Murashko, said more than 100,000 patients had been hospitalised.</p> <p>Fears are growing of a second wave in <strong>China</strong>, with the north-eastern city of Jilin put in partial lockdown and Wuhan, where the virus first appeared last year, preparing to test its entire population after clusters of new cases.</p> <p>The coronavirus has infected 4.3 million people worldwide, according to the <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University tracker</a>, and killed more than 293,000.</p> <p><em>With reporting from Sam Jones in Madrid and Kate Connolly in Berlin</em></p>",
  "<p>Hunched against the wind in Tasmania\u2019s central highlands are the floral relics of the last ice age. Walking among them, armed with a large pole and a cloth bag, is James Wood, the coordinator of the Tasmanian seed bank. It is the first time in five years that Tasmania\u2019s 1,000-year-old conifers have seeded, and he is determined not to miss it.</p> <p>It is the third week of April. A coronavirus outbreak has occurred in Tasmania\u2019s north-west, causing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/we-can-save-lives-tasmanias-isolated-north-west-succumbs-to-australias-strictest-coronavirus-rules\">the premier to close two regional hospitals and place 5,000 health workers and their families in quarantine</a>. And Wood is walking a deserted stretch of the Overland Track, alone but for Justin Dyer, his guide from the Tasmanian Walking Company, in search of stands of pencil pines, or <em>Athrotaxis cupressoides</em>.</p> <p>On an ordinary day, the Overland Track carries 60 hikers. But the national parks are closed and travel banned due to the coronavirus, so for five days Wood and Dyer see no one except for a few park rangers, dozens of pademelons (a squat, short-tailed wallaby) and a hungry platypus that ignored them in favour of hunting in a tarn, two humans being no competition to the lure of a full belly.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just incredibly quiet,\u201d Wood says. \u201cYou do get this feeling of real privilege that you\u2019re getting that place pretty much to yourself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2823ce6ff33e8cf61033180dcdf49ef2e9249cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2823ce6ff33e8cf61033180dcdf49ef2e9249cd/0_71_3111_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Close-up of a pencil pine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pencil pines are one of five ancient conifer species endemic to the Tasmanian highlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pencil pines are one of five species of conifer endemic to Tasmania\u2019s high country, the most well-known of which are king billy pines (<em>Athrotaxis selaginoides</em>).

Stands of pencil pines and cheshunt pines at Lake Mackenzie were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/27/world-heritage-forests-burn-as-global-tragedy-unfolds-in-tasmania\">destroyed when a fire raced down the Devil\u2019s Gullet in 2016</a>. Stands of king billy pines were also lost.</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is that if fire frequency increases in these upland areas, and that seems very likely, that could change very quickly,\u201d Wood says. \u201cSo what we are trying to do here is act preemptively and get seed collections in place when we can.\u201d</p> <p>The Tasmanian pines are more dispersed and their habitat wilder, making a rescue effort like that which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/15/dinosaur-trees-firefighters-save-endangered-wollemi-pines-from-nsw-bushfires\">saved the ancient Wollomi pines in the New South Wales Blue Mountains this summer more difficult</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt does make them very vulnerable,\u201d Wood says.</p> <p>Pencil pines and other <em>Athrotaxis</em> produce seeds only every few years, as part of a global masting event that triggers sudden seed production in unrelated plants around the world.</p> <p>The last masting event was in 2015. The trigger, says Wood, appears to be two successively hotter summers, although there\u2019s no consensus on the exact cause. This year the seeding was \u201cpatchy\u201d, with pencil pines on higher and drier areas not producing pine cones, and cheshunt pines, which often grow nearby, not seeding at all.</p> <p>It means that while Tasmania will likely deliver on the prerequisite for hotter summers, due to the climate emergency, the accompanied drying out of the highlands could leave the pencil pines too stressed to seed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41f08076fd5e64a6911d6a464e0745c6dc7dee88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41f08076fd5e64a6911d6a464e0745c6dc7dee88/1156_0_1937_2421/800.jpg\" alt=\"The shape of a pencil pine tree\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pencil pines seed only every few years when specific environmental conditions are met.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is why the 2020 masting was so important. An ambitious plan involving teams of volunteers, visiting specialists from the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh, helicopters and arborists was formed in December and tree enthusiasts on Facebook were mobilised to monitor conifer flowering. Those plans were spiked when the pandemic was declared, and Wood got permission for the two-person operation focused just on the pencil pines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/15/dinosaur-trees-firefighters-save-endangered-wollemi-pines-from-nsw-bushfires\">'Dinosaur trees': firefighters save endangered Wollemi pines from NSW bushfires</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pencil pines are particularly tricky for seed gatherers, because they grow in the wild as suckers.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the stands of the trees that you see in Tasmania are all clonal,\u201d Wood says. \u201cThey sucker from their roots and spread that way so large strands of trees generally have only a couple of individuals. You may see several hundred trees but there may be only a dozen or less individuals in that stand.\u201d</p> <p>They walked 70km over the five days, gathering two handfuls of pine cones from each of the 46 stands visited to ensure the seeds collected were genetically diverse. At the end, the bank was 8,000 seeds richer.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately we have missed all the other opportunities we had,\u201d Wood says. \u201cHopefully when the next masting event takes place those stands will still be there and still be happy.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A fleet of Russian supertrawlers has been spotted fishing off the coast of Scotland in a protected area, raising concerns by environmentalists over the impact of industrial vessels on marine life in UK waters.</p> <p>The 11 vessels, among the largest trawlers in the world, have spent \u201csignificant time\u201d fishing in the Wyville-Thomson Ridge, a British special area of conservation (SAC), according to data analysed by Greenpeace.</p> <p>The vessels, each more than 100 metres long and capable of processing hundreds of tonnes of fish every day, are believed to be targeting blue whiting, a pelagic species that lives in midwater.</p> <p>The fleet is operating legally, according to the Scottish government. The area, to the west of the Shetland Islands, is within waters shared by the UK and the Faroe Islands. It is managed jointly, but governed by the Faroese government under a special treaty. Its designation as a SAC by the European Union does not prevent commercial fishing in the area.</p> <p>Environmentalists condemned the \u201cdestructive\u201d practices of supertrawlers and called on the UK government to better regulate their activities to protect marine life.</p> <p>Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, called for a ban on supertrawlers in UK marine protected areas. He said: \u201cWhile the UK is in lockdown, this fleet of destructive supertrawlers has been plundering fish from what is supposed to be a protected area in UK waters.</p> <p>\u201cThe intensity with which these vast ships fish is not compatible with a healthy ocean. They drag vast nets, up to one-mile long, in their wake hoovering up fish and other marine life and disturbing the entire water column.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf the UK government wants to be taken seriously as a world leader in marine protection, it must do more to restrict and regulate the activities of the international supertrawler fleet, and support small scale, sustainable fishing communities.\u201d</p> <p>Lockdown measures and a drop in the fish export market due to coronavirus has forced many of the UK\u2019s small scale, more sustainable fishing boats to tie up at port, unable to work.</p> <p>The Wyville-Thomson ridge SAC sits on reef at the edge of Scotland\u2019s continental shelf. It \u201csupports diverse biological communities representative of hard substratum in deep water\u201d <a href=\"https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/wyville-thomson-ridge-mpa/\">according to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee</a>.</p> <p>John Hourston, a volunteer with the Blue Planet Society, which campaigns against the bycatch of dolphins in fishing nets, called for better monitoring and more regulation.</p> <p>\u201cThese factory trawlers can stay at sea for weeks. They have nets with mouths that could swallow three jumbo jets. The problem is dolphins feed on these fish in midwater when they aggregate to spawn,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou drag a net through these fish and you will also catch what is feeding on them. There needs to be more regulation around the pelagic supertrawler fleet.\u201d</p> <p>Studies have shown high bycatch rates of dolphins in pelagic trawlers targeting blue whiting and European sea bass in the Bay of Biscay.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Scottish government said while the SAC was within the UK continental shelf limit of the seabed, the responsibility of the waters above it were joint.</p> <p>\u201cWe are aware that a multinational fleet is legitimately operating in shared waters under the Faroese government\u2019s authority, and has done for a number of years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are targeting blue whiting, a species caught with nets that do not contact the seabed.\u201d</p> <p>It was monitoring the vessels, via marine protection patrol boats and electronic surveillance, \u201cto ensure there are no infringements and none have strayed into areas that are exclusively within UK fishery limits or the Scottish zone\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/stealth-plunder-of-argentinian-waters-raises-fears-over-marine-monitoring\">conservation groups expressed alarm over lower levels of surveillance</a> of fishing operations during the coronavirus pandemic after lobbying from fishing fleets.</p> <p>Several companies operating the trawlers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>",

For one thing, there has been significant population growth, so the increase in job numbers has not necessarily been so remarkable.</p> <p>But it is the poor quality of the jobs created \u2013 their \u201cprecarity\u201d \u2013 which has been less trumpeted by the government. It is a bit late now to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/uk-key-workers-ppe-ministers-clapping-protect-nhs\">salute essential workers</a> and thank them for what they are doing when they have been underpaid and neglected for so long. A round of applause once a week, however heartfelt, provides no protection against the virus and does nothing to help with the cost of living.</p> <p>This crisis could be a moment to rethink how work is organised and rewarded, what sort of jobs we need to be done, and how to try to make sure these jobs can provide worthwhile careers.

It will now take place in early 2021,\u201d the Rijksmuseum said in a statement. \u201cThe protocol for working in the glass chamber has been revised to conform with the guidelines set by the government. Consequently, to ensure it is possible to maintain a minimum physical distance of 1.5 meters, no more than two people will work on the painting at any given time.\u201d</p> <p>Further restoration work on The Night Watch is scheduled to resume again on Wednesday, after a few weeks\u2019 pause due to the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>The Rijksmuseum is expected to reopen on 1 June but its usual capacity for 10,000 visitors a day will be reduced to 2,000 to allow for social distancing.</p>",

We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity and in employment, and already the job gains of the past decade have been erased.</p> \n   <p>Since the pandemic arrived in force just two months ago, more than 20 million people have lost their jobs. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>... before warning that the crisis could cause long-term economic damage that won\u2019t simply go away when the pandemic ends, painting a grim picture of a \u2018prolonged recession\u2019:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The record shows that deeper and longer recessions can leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy. Avoidable household and business insolvencies can weigh on growth for years to come. Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers\u2019 careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt. The loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life\u2019s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes.</p> \n   <p>These businesses are a principal source of job creation\u2014something we will sorely need as people seek to return to work. A prolonged recession and weak recovery could also discourage business investment and expansion, further limiting the resurgence of jobs as well as the growth of capital stock and the pace of technological advancement. The result could be an extended period of low productivity growth and stagnant incomes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In conclusion, Powell also warns that while the Fed can lend money to help companies keep afloat, only politicians can agree fiscal measures to help the economy:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This tradeoff is one for our elected representatives, who wield powers of taxation and spending. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbf0928f080c727453a19d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T13:17:57.575Z\">2.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">NIESR: UK GDP could shrink 30% this quarter</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Back in the UK, the NIESR thinktank has predicted Britain\u2019s economy could shrink by nearly a third in the current quarter.</strong></p> \n  <p>That would far outstrip anything seen in recent decades (<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/ihyq/qna\">the ONS\u2019s quarterly GDP time series</a> goes back to 1955, and shows that Q1 1974 was the worst quarter with a 2.7% drop)</p> \n  <p>Having analysed today\u2019s GDP report, IERS says:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The ONS preliminary estimates suggest that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/may/13/uk-economy-gdp-q1-2020-march-covid-19-recession-business-live?page=with:block-5ebb869d8f080c7274539dc8#block-5ebb869d8f080c7274539dc8\"> growth declined by 2.0 per cent in the first quarter of 2020</a>, broadly consistent with what we suggested it could be last month.<a><strong><br></strong></a></li> \n   <li>The substantive contraction in growth reflects negative contributions across all the headline sectors.</li> \n   <li> Output declined by 5.8 per cent in March itself, mainly due to record falls in construction and services.</li> \n   <li>The latest ONS estimates are preliminary and largely uncertain but continues to suggest GDP is around 25 per cent smaller when the lockdown is in place.</li> \n   <li>In light of the preliminary release, we forecast growth in the second quarter to decline sharply by about 25 to 30 per cent.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d90af4b349923661184748e77e43a13a1447e10e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d90af4b349923661184748e77e43a13a1447e10e/0_0_570_313/500.jpg\" alt=\"UK GDP forecasts\" width=\"500\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK GDP forecasts</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NIESR</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbee188f080c727453a187\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T13:02:02.756Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">US wholesale inflation tumbles as global economy weakens</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Over in America, the prices charged by companies for their wares has tumbled in another sign that the global economy is weakening fast.</strong></p> \n  <p>The US Producer Price Index (PPI) fell by 1.3% in April, driven by a 3.3% tumble in prices for goods.

  "<p>Coronavirus might have brought the television and film industries to a total standstill, but not even a catastrophic global pandemic can change some things. Which is to say that BBC One has just announced a new adaptation of Great Expectations.</p> <p>This is great news, because it will introduce the Charles Dickens classic to anyone who didn\u2019t watch the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/dec/27/great-expectations-review-sam-wollaston\">BBC One Great Expectations adaptation from 2011</a>. Or the BBC\u2019s 1981 adaptation of Great Expectations. Or the BBC\u2019s 1967 adaptation of Great Expectations. Or the BBC\u2019s 1959 adaptation of Great Expectations. Or the NBC adaptation from 1954, or ITV\u2019s 1989 adaptation, or any of the various Great Expectations films made in 1917, 1922, 1934, 1946, 1974, 1983, 1998, 1999 or 2012. If you haven\u2019t seen any of those, this new Great Expectations should be a treat.</p> <p>Of course, you could argue that when a work is as heavily adapted as Great Expectations, the joy of watching it will be seeing the space it carves for itself and the themes it chooses to illuminate. How faithful they are to the source material, how much they reflect the times in which they were made, the new lens through which the audience can see characters who risked devolving into archetype. Which would be great, except this new version is going to be made by the creative team behind Tom Hardy\u2019s voodoo- and incest-tinged gothic drama Taboo.</p> <p>The new miniseries \u2013 a co-production between BBC One and FX \u2013 counts Steven Knight as a writer and Hardy and Ridley Scott as producers. And this means we\u2019re probably going to be in for the most miserable version of Great Expectations yet. The commission makes sense, because this is also the braintrust behind the most recent version of A Christmas Carol. And that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-new-scrooge-a-charismatic-antihero-for-christmas\">very much Scrooge Goes Grimdark</a>, in which our brooding, dirt-spackled hero found himself weighed down with grief over a factory fire. There was swearing. There was gratuitous gravestone urination. There was \u2013 and this is the greatest crime that an adaptation of A Christmas Carol can commit in the 21st century \u2013 not a single Muppet to be found.</p> <p>And that was just A Christmas Carol. With all its orphans and cruelty and disappointment, Great Expectations is already a bit of a bummer. So lord knows how Knight will manage to grubby it up. Perhaps Miss Havisham could end up in hospital after giving herself a tattoo with an infected needle. Maybe Pip will find himself strung out on opiates. Could Estella possibly buy a Stanley knife and start doling out vigilante justice to children and the elderly? The adaptation is going to make us all miserable anyway, so why not go the whole hog?</p> <p>Of course, I\u2019m speaking far too soon here. Knight\u2019s A Christmas Carol adaptation was a ratings winner. Plenty of critics managed to take a lot of pleasure from it. Its cast was absolutely top notch. Who\u2019s to say the same won\u2019t be the case here? If nothing else, you\u2019d have to imagine that Hardy is lining himself up to play Magwitch, which would be extremely watchable.</p> <p>But even if this new Great Expectations ends up a disappointment, at least we can take two important things from it. First, this is Great Expectations \u2013 if you don\u2019t like this adaptation, then another one will be along in a couple of years. And, second, if Knight is writing this, then it means he isn\u2019t currently writing any more episodes of See on Apple TV+. That alone has to be worth something.</p>",
  "<p>Iran is an ancient country with a complex people, among them some of the greatest poets who ever lived. Sadly, the Iranian novel has yet to reach the popularity of the country\u2019s poetry. This is perhaps because there is something enigmatic about how Persian prose is written, often using surrealism and magical realism to mimic the playfulness in its poetry. No matter what Iranians do, even if they write historical textbooks, it seems they can never shed the poetic touch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/11/aria-by-nazanine-hozar-review-an-epic-tale-of-turmoil-in-tehran\">Aria by Nazanine Hozar review \u2013 an epic tale of turmoil in Tehran</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that is the beauty of the culture.

I\u2019m trying to write about people who are trapped, which is what I\u2019ve tried to do in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/aria-9780241417904.html\">my novel Aria</a>. All the books I\u2019ve suggested here are in their own way about entrapment, except for the poems written by Sohrab Sepehri, who, being the lone poet out of the lot, is teaching the others how to set themselves free.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-blind-owl-and-other-stories-9780714544588/\">The Blind Owl by Sadegh Hedayat</a><br></strong>It would be impossible to begin a discussion on modern Iranian literature without including this masterwork by the father of Persian magical realism. The Blind Owl is a feverish tale of a pen-case painter\u2019s descent into the nightmare of his own psyche as the reader is exposed to his mistrust of oppressive forces, abuse of power, sexual and gender hierarchy, and the constraints of modern Iranian society. No other novel better illuminates the state of modern Iranian alienation and isolation, or the Persian ability to make the disturbing beautiful.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-934211-48-2\">My Uncle Napoleon by Iraj Pezeshkzad translated by Dick Davis</a><br></strong>A coming-of-age story following an unnamed 13 year-old narrator as he observes his dysfunctional family and neighbours, in particular the eccentric family patriarch, uncle Napoleon \u2013 nicknamed sarcastically for his obsession with the French emperor. The story, set during the 1940s, becomes somewhat \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/20/michael-foley-top-10-absurd-classics\">absurd</a>\u201d with its larger than life characters and their exaggerated circumstances. But Pezeshkzad is working in the great tradition of Asian and Middle Eastern literature. Imagine One Thousand and One Nights transported into the intimate neighbourhoods of 20th-century Tehran.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/roger-housden/saved-beauty/\">Saved By Beauty by Roger Housden</a><br></strong>A travel memoir by the British-American Housden, whose love of Rumi propels him to discover the poet\u2019s culture. His quest to understand the complexities of Iran initially binds him to the country\u2019s rich heritage of poetry, mysticism, art and architecture, as well as the many friends he meets along the way. But despite his steadfast desire to focus solely on the country\u2019s beauty, Housden has to face the Islamic Republic\u2019s darkness and ideological quagmire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a69753478d88ef547ffb03007da53c711e0e806\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a69753478d88ef547ffb03007da53c711e0e806/0_197_5150_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Xerxes\u2019 Gateway, also known as the Gate of all Nations, at Persepolis, near Shiraz, Iran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xerxes\u2019 Gateway, also known as the Gate of all Nations, at Persepolis, near Shiraz, Iran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/persepolis-i-ii-9780099523994.html\">Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi</a><br></strong>Satrapi\u2019s autobiographical graphic novel is the story of her upbringing in post-revolutionary Iran. Apart from its whimsy and appealing graphics, what makes the narrative matter is Satrapi\u2019s viewpoint as an upper-class Iranian child suddenly wary of the differences in class and religious expression. These moments provide the more humorous observations in the book, and the most touching. The storytelling is honest and, in what can also be found in the great tradition of Iranian cinema, Satrapi achieves the most poignancy by telling her tale through the eyes of a confused and curious child.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691101347/iran-between-two-revolutions\">Iran Between Two Revolutions by Ervand Abrahamian</a></strong><br>Published in 1982, this is a look at the era between the constitutional revolution of 1905-1911 and the Islamic revolution of 1979, each driven by divisions in religion, ethnicity and class. It is perhaps the most thorough investigation into the reigns of both Pahlavi kings and the British and American interference that permitted their rule and one-party system, fuelling the Islamist and communist movements in the 1960s and 70s, culminating in the 1979 revolution.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.englishpen.org/translation/touba-and-the-meaning-of-night/\">Touba and the Meaning of Night by Shahrnush Parsipur</a></strong><br>Written after the author had spent more than four years in an Iranian political prison, Parsipur\u2019s works have been banned by the Islamic Republic. This novel reflects on the changing politics of Iran from the onset of the 20th century through the constricted life of a bold young woman, Touba. After her father dies when she is 12 and she is left to her own devices, Touba proposes marriage to a 52-year-old man hoping it will bring her survival and prosperity. The novel offers a rare, detailed and sophisticated insight into women\u2019s lives in Iran, in a world where men hold all power, and where women suffer needlessly \u2013 sometimes horrifically \u2013 because of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/feb/12/best-books-iran-start-reading-here\">The best books on Iran: start your reading here | Pushpinder Khaneka</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>7. <a href=\"http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/iran/pirzadz.htm#ours\">Things We Left Unsaid by Zoya Pirzad</a><br></strong>Iranian-Armenian Pirzad sets her tale in 1960s Abadan amid the apparent tranquillity of domestic life. She slowly guides her main character, the daydreaming mother and wife Clarice, towards the growing awareness of gender inequality in the 1960s, as Clarice begins to question the roles prescribed for her and other women. The nuanced tension focused on sexuality and gender throughout the narrative could arguably be Pirzad\u2019s commentary on current Iranian societal and gender divisions without drawing the ire of the censors.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sohrab_Sepehri\">8. A Selection of Poems from The Eight Books by Sohrab Sepehri, translated by Bahiyeh Afnan Shahid</a><br></strong>Every Iranian has their personal favourite modern poet, from Ahmad Shamlou to Forough Farrokhzad to Simin Behbahani. Mine is Sepehri. His work more than the rest belongs in the category of monumental Persian mystical poets such as Rumi, Hafez, Saadi and Khayaam. Sepehri died of cancer in 1980. Better known in his lifetime as a painter, the complexities of his poetry were most associated, like his painting, with his love of nature. But there is also a connection, much like Rumi\u2019s, with the most profound understandings of Sufi Islam, Vedanta philosophy, and perhaps the very early Christian teachings. Sepehri never proselytized but his mind and heart are laid bare in The Eight Books, a selection of which have been beautifully translated by Shahid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/22/top-10-political-travel-books\">Top 10 political travel books</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://royahakakian.com/books/journey-from-the-land-of-no/\">Journey From The Land of No by Roya Hakakian</a><br></strong>This memoir from Iranian-Jewish writer and journalist Hakakian traces her growth as a budding revolutionary in 1978-1979 towards the realisation that the political reforms she and her friends had fought for had been hijacked and undermined by a religious totalitarianism not only targeted at her own Jewish community but at intellectual, egalitarian and democratising Iranians alike, regardless of faith.

The Premier League will go one step further and encourage masks. Dressing rooms will be no-go areas, meaning players drive in wearing training kit and wash it at home, a system already operating abroad. A club doctor explained how some individuals will be carefully monitored because of worries they could be overwhelmed by a return to the outside world in a physical environment having lived alone for about two months.</p> \n<p>Even in these days of zonal marking, staying apart on a pitch while providing effective training will be complex. Coaches will have to be creative to ensure they keep their players interested after two months of Zoom sessions and personalised exercise programmes.

A number of players explained it would take three weeks of normal training to get back to a competitive level and matches would be required. Without friendlies to build momentum, competitive fixtures are likely to be an inferior product when they start, especially inside an empty stadium.

Once all the results are returned, those that come back negative will be able to begin full physical contact training. However, almost a third of tests provide false positives, a number of doctors have told the Guardian, which could leave many players in isolation unnecessarily and potentially whole teams in quarantine. One potential plan would be to cut the quarantine time to three days for those who show no symptoms before retesting them. If a player has symptoms he will be obliged to tell his club, having signed a document to say he will abide by the rules, putting the emphasis on self-regulation.</p> \n<p>Players have expressed concern that they are putting their families as well as themselves at risk. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/05/eibar-players-say-they-fear-terrible-consequences-of-la-liga-resumption\" title=\"\">Eibar\u2019s players released a statement</a> which summed up the feeling of many in the game: \u201cIt worries us that by doing what we like most, we could get infected and infect our families and friends, and even contribute to a new wave of the pandemic \u2013 with the terrible consequences that would have for the whole population.\u201d It is a reminder among all the fanfare of football potentially coming back that players are only human and some will have relatives on the vulnerable list.</p> \n<p>All the best practices will be put in place to minimise the risk to players but, as with everything related to coronavirus, the unknowns are where the dangers lie.

  "<p>The Morrison government has overhauled cost recovery arrangements for regional airports to conduct security screening to head off a potential revolt by the Nationals in the Senate.</p> <p>The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick sought on Wednesday night to disallow regulations imposing security screening requirements that he says would have forced small airports to seek cost recovery through increases in landing charges. Patrick said the changes originally proposed by the home affairs minister Peter Dutton could see fares from Whyalla increase by $54 to $70 per passenger.</p> <p>Government MPs, including the former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/25/peter-duttons-regional-airport-security-plan-under-fire-in-coalition-party-room?CMP=share_btn_tw\">raised objections</a> to the Dutton proposal in a Coalition party room meeting in February.

But as Patrick moved the disallowance in the Senate on Wednesday night, Nationals senators issued a joint statement saying there had been an eleventh hour change of heart about cost recovery.</p> <p>Senators, including former frontbenchers Bridget McKenzie and Matt Canavan, said they had secured agreement from the government \u201cto ensure costs incurred by regional airports to implement improved security screening measures will not be passed on unfairly to regional travellers\u201d.</p> <p>The statement did not give details about the specifics of the agreement, but declared Nationals in the Senate had negotiated changes to Dutton\u2019s original proposal for cost recovery \u201cto ensure travellers did not face disproportionate cost increases, particularly at a time when regional aviation is reeling from the consequences of Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>McKenzie, who leads the Nationals in the Senate, said it was important to ensure once travel restrictions were lifted people returned to visiting regional Australia. She said she did not want security screening costs \u201cto replace Covid as an impediment to those visits\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe support the security screening, but right now regional tourism is stagnant. We need to kick start it again and adding costs to regional air travel is the wrong thing to do in a post Covid-19 environment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Patrick told the chamber he believed the government had agreed to apply non-differential pricing for security screening at airports across the country.

It affects what we watch, and while some shows have stood the test of time (<a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/comic-relief-comfort-nostalgia-5-ways-our-tv-viewing-has-changed-lockdown\">viewing of Only Fools and Horses is up 20% and Last of the Summer Wine, 30%</a>), others have fared less well, such as America\u2019s Next Top Model (ANTM).</p> <p>It may have taken nearly 20 years and a global pandemic, but social media users have come to the collective realisation of just how sadistic the programme was. ANTM was an amalgamation of the exact type of issues that the show\u2019s creator and host, Tyra Banks, rallies against today: racism, fat-shaming and the pressuring of young women to undergo unnecessary cosmetic procedures.</p> <p>The clip that served as the catalyst for the backlash showed judges berating a contestant for refusing to close the \u201cunmarketable\u201d gap in her front teeth. Some cycles later, a contestant had her gap professionally widened at Banks\u2019 request. Another surreal scene showed Banks coaxing white models in blackface to represent \u201cAfricans\u201d. She soon acknowledged her decisions as \u201creally off choices\u201d, as did <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kenmok/status/1259256532585164800\">Ken Mok, a producer of the show</a>. \u201cTimes have definitely changed,\u201d he tweeted in response. \u201cThank goodness they have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a different time\u201d may not cut it as a defence, but it doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t true. We watched Ms Banks put the Tyra in tyrant on a weekly basis, with the same nonchalance we consumed pretty much every other equally problematic reality TV show at the start of this century. ANTM\u2019s 2003 launch coincided with the early 00s reality TV golden age, where sadly casual viciousness was part and parcel of the genre. </p> <p>Punching down wasn\u2019t just commonplace, it was a staple. P Diddy\u2019s cruelty as the mentor on the 2002 series Making the Band 2 is the stuff of legend. On one of their final assignments, contestants were made to trek three hours on foot to Brooklyn to bring Diddy a cheesecake. Anyone who didn\u2019t make the journey would be disqualified. Simon Cowell was far more merciless in the early days of The X Factor, and The Apprentice\u2019s resident savage Claude Littner is now a pussycat compared with his heyday as the most-feared interviewer going. He has dialled down his ferocity to such a degree that he is able to double up as one of Lord Sugar\u2019s stern but still far more amiable aides.</p> <p>Then there were the shows where malice was baked into the formula. There\u2019s Something About Miriam was a Bachelor-style dating show that aired in 2004, where the \u201ctwist\u201d was rampant transphobia. At the show\u2019s end, it was revealed to the six men who had been competing for the heart of Miriam Rivera that she was a transwoman, with the sole aim of humiliating all involved.</p> <p>That was the same year that British Big Brother went \u201cevil\u201d, after the prior series was panned as the most boring on record. In the US, 2005\u2019s Whose Your Daddy? did just what it said on the tin: an adult who had been put up for adoption as a child was put in a room with 25 men, one of whom was their biological father. If they guessed correctly, they would win $100,000. If not, the person that they incorrectly selected would get the $100,000. Even \u201cfeelgood\u201d makeover shows have aged terribly; 10 Years Younger was shallow and misogynistic, while Trinny and Susannah\u2019s What Not to Wear was a bitchfest of body shaming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9baf0656561dc288dcaae9f676ee00999d95a34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9baf0656561dc288dcaae9f676ee00999d95a34/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A deranged dating series\u2019 ...

In 2018, viewers couldn\u2019t stomach the sight of a blubbing Dani Dyer on Love Island, who was breaking down over misleading footage of her then-boyfriend Jack Fincham and an ex-partner shown to her by the producers. As previously noted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/25/can-you-even-spell-father-jeremy-kyle-and-the-end-of-angry-tv\">the Guardian</a>, there has been a shift towards softer, more lighthearted factual entertainment such as First Dates and The Great British Bake Off. The original Queer Eye, which was progressive simply by existing, ran from 2003 to 2007, and while the premise has remained the same, the reboot is more millennial. The crass stereotypes of gay men have been dropped and there is a new focus on body positivity, self-care and mental health.</p> <p>But old viewing habits die hard. This winter\u2019s drama-free season of Love Island was labelled the dullest yet, with most favouring the deranged dating series Love Is Blind. Its success looks set to usher in another reality renaissance, and perhaps a pivot back to the televisual insanity of yesteryear; the decision to have newly engaged couples dump each other at the altar displayed levels of malice unseen on reality TV for years. Clips from the deeply problematic series 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 continually go viral \u2013 the more heinous the couples are being towards each other, the more popular they appear to be.</p> <p>In years to come, we will undoubtedly write of these current shows with the same horror we now do about ANTM. Times have certainly changed, as have the parameters of what is considered acceptable cruelty. But I\u2019m unsure viewers\u2019 appetite for this modern-day bear baiting has been completely sated.</p>",

government, on 7 May 2020, the government did not state that it would provide additional sitting weeks, but merely that it might.</p> \n   <p>Two, this was to be based on an assessment, that was to be taken, and I quote, \u2018a couple of days\u2019, end quote, after parliament had risen, based on whether there had been an outbreak of Covid-19 as a result of these sittings.</p> \n   <p>Three, given the virus has an incubation period of weeks not days, this position was always absurd. </p> \n   <p>Four, the minister\u2019s misrepresentation of these statements also presumes the government has been forthcoming with accurate information at these meetings, which is challenged by the fact that on issues as straightforward as whether there would be changes to jobkeeper, the government has provided information at these meetings which was proven to be false the very next day.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

In relation to mental health and the coronavirus epidemic in Australia, in particular we have invested $669m in telehealth of which I\u2019m advised 47.7% of all consultations in the previous week with regards to standard mental health items were conducted over the phone. </p> \n   <p>In addition to that, what we have also seen is that general telehealth items have very significantly been for mental health. </p> \n   <p>So it doesn\u2019t have to be confined to the particular mechanism which the member outlines. </p> \n   <p>What we have opened up with telehealth is a much broader ability to access services in conjunction with the services provided through telehealth, we have also made sure that there were psychological and psychiatric items that were also made available. On top of that, there was a $74m investment focusing on support services for people, mostly online or through telehealth, through organisations such as the Black Dog Institute for healthcare workers, Origin for young people, Lifeline, Kids Line, so many other different support groups. And in particular, Beyond Blue has led the coronavirus activity. </p> \n   <p>So with to other proposals, the government will always consider them. What we have done already is on the advice of the mental health officers, the chief medical officer, in particular the chair \u2013 or CEO \u2013 of the National Mental Health Commission and the prime minister\u2019s suicide prevention adviser, Christine Morgan, establish the arrangements which are in place. These have been critical to help save lives and protect lives during what is a difficult period and where there are proposals we\u2019d always review them. </p> \n   <p>What we have done so far, I would say, is potentially world leading and in particular the national cabinet will be considering the national mental health pandemic plan this week and we are making very good process with the states and I want to thank the prime minister for his support and his leadership in drawing that into the national cabinet.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

However, the fact is that the decision on Chinese tariffs will be based on an anti-dumping investigation into Australia\u2019s exported barley that has been ongoing for almost 18 months.</p> \n   <p><strong>If anything, Australia\u2019s worries over potential tariffs underline the anxiety surrounding deteriorating China-Australia relations. Since China-US relations hit their lowest point in decades amid the Covid-19 crisis, relations between China and Australia have been heading in the same direction. Australian politicians have made no secret of their desire to follow the US, joining in on the China blame game. If China-US ties continue to deteriorate, the uncertainty surrounding China-Australia relations will also increase.<br></strong></p> \n   <p><strong>Such uncertainty will inevitably lead to economic repercussions. In this sense, it now seems necessary to advise Chinese people and companies to watch out for potential risks when it comes to doing business with or studying in Australia.</strong><br></p> \n   <p><strong>Fundamentally speaking, it is not in the interests of people in China and Australia if the latter\u2019s politicians continue to take unfriendly actions and launch political attacks on the former. China-US relations are now in trouble, and if Australia chooses to follow, that would not only negatively impact its relations with China but would also come at the cost of its own economy and trade.</strong><br></p> \n   <p>In fact, the importance of China to Australia\u2019s economy may be far greater than some Australian politicians estimate. China is Australia\u2019s largest export destination, with exports to China accounting for about one third of its total exports. China is the main buyer of Australia\u2019s commodities, farm products and education services.<br></p> \n   <p>There is a need for Australia to reposition its role in regional geopolitics rather than becoming the lapdog of the US. It needs to rethink its relationships with the US and China at this juncture.

If you\u2019d prefer to keep it vegetarian, or can\u2019t find either dried shrimp or fish sauce, leave them out. Equally, other chilli flakes will do, if need be, though they\u2019ll have a different flavour.</p> <h2>2 Boil and cool salted water</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ad1daaa691cf60bf956abb38d4f9ca84e94f8ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ad1daaa691cf60bf956abb38d4f9ca84e94f8ec/742_741_8252_4953/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\u2019s Kimchi 02.

Heat, stirring, until the salt has dissolved, then pour into a cold bowl and leave to cool while you prepare the cabbage. Some say that you should use non-chlorinated water, which for most of us will mean mineral water, but tap water works for me.</p> <h2>3 Prep the cabbage</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2320706f886868149e34a4aa6c74bc0a392e4b27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2320706f886868149e34a4aa6c74bc0a392e4b27/0_0_10328_7760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\u2019s Kimchi 1. 1Chinese cabbage and daikon are common in many kimchis, but any cabbage or radish will do, if need be\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>While the brine is cooling, wash the cabbage and chop it lengthways into quarters.

Shake the leaves dry in a clean tea towel, then tip back into the large bowl. Pour in the seasoning and toss to coat \u2013 gloves are advisable if you use your hands.</p> <h2>8 Pack the kimchi into a jar</h2> <p>Spoon the kimchi into a clean jar, crock or pot, pressing it in very firmly to minimise the amount of air trapped between the leaves. As much of the cabbage as possible should be submerged in the liquid it emits, so you need to weight it down \u2013 a clean plastic bag full of cold water should do the trick \u2013 then seal the jar.</p> <h2>9 Leave to ferment</h2> <p>Put the jar in a cool place out of direct sunlight for five days, checking on it and pushing it back down under the liquid as necessary (it will give off more as it sits), then taste; it should be mildly tangy by this point. Once it\u2019s sour enough for your taste, refrigerate it to pause the fermentation process, and consume at your leisure \u2013 it will keep for months.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The dramatic improvements in air quality associated with the coronavirus lockdown could increase sunlight and affect weather patterns, scientists say.</p> <p>With factories closed and roads relatively empty, air pollution in cities across Asia, Europe and the US has dropped by as much as <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-lockdowns-effect-on-air-pollution-provides-rare-glimpse-of-low-carbon-future-134685\">60%</a> in recent weeks.

Satellite measurements show that Europe experienced a surface dimming effect until the late 1980s, followed by a brightening effect as air pollution regulations kicked in. China followed a similar pattern, but had to wait until 2005 for brightening to set in.</p> <p>The cleaner skies resulting from lockdown are likely to have enhanced the brightening effect even further, but measuring the impact on climate is not straightforward.</p> <p>\u201cAerosols can scatter and absorb radiation. They can also modify clouds to make them more reflective and longer lived,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/laura-wilcox/\">Laura Wilcox</a>, a climate scientist at the University of Reading.</p> <p>Unlike carbon dioxide, aerosols only hang around in the atmosphere for a week or two, meaning that any reduction in pollution will be quickly felt. \u201cWith smaller amounts of aerosol in the atmosphere we will already be seeing more solar radiation reaching the surface, and thus potentially warmer surface temperatures in regions that usually have high levels of air pollution,\u201d says Wilcox.</p> <p>But detecting the effect of falling air pollution and disentangling it from the random ups and downs in the weather will be extremely challenging.</p> <p>\u201cHere in the UK we\u2019ve had record amounts of sunshine because of the blocking high pressure system that has sat over the country through April,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~sgs02rpa/\">Richard Allan</a>, another atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading. \u201cThese unusual weather conditions are likely to obscure any increase in temperature resulting from the clearer skies.\u201d</p> <p>However, measurements over a larger area and longer time scale might demonstrate a Covid climate effect. Using <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6b34\">computer simulations</a>, Wilcox and her colleagues had previously shown that rapid cuts in air pollution were likely to accelerate climate change in the future.</p> <p>In the most extreme scenarios (with rapid increases in air quality) their results suggest the hottest day of the year may be up to 4C hotter by 2050, with around one third of that increase due to cleaner skies.</p> <p>Wilcox\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/acp-2019-1188/\">latest research</a> also predicts that reductions in Asian air pollution will also result in more intense tropical monsoon rains, driven by a greater contrast in temperature between oceans and land.</p> <p>If the drop in air pollution is sustained for long enough then it might be possible to see its impact on climate.</p> <p>\u201cI will be watching India closely over the coming weeks. We would typically expect to see summer monsoon onset within the next four weeks, and would usually see both very hot temperatures and high aerosol levels ahead of monsoon onset,\u201d says Wilcox.</p> <p>Instead, the drop in air pollution over northern India may help to drive a more intense monsoon, and Wilcox and her colleagues are on standby, ready to gather measurements and compare with previous years.</p> <p>But even if cleaner skies are temporarily accelerating climate change, the long-term dangers associated with global warming are far greater.</p> <p>\u201cContinuing to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at the current rate will drive far larger and more sustained temperature rises that along with <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14337\">changes in the global water cycle</a> will cause serious impacts for our societies and the ecosystems upon which we depend,\u201d says Allan.</p>",

On the Vogue Instagram, the editor\u2019s lockdown looks have been exacting, low-key chic: in her lush spring garden with an adorable dog, at her elegantly curated desk in tailored sweatpants. But hosting Vogue Conversations videos, or on Naomi Campbell\u2019s YouTube channel, she is in sunglasses framed against a window with drawn curtains. Closed curtains and sunglasses in the middle of the day make for a shifty, motel-room-scene-in-a-heist-movie look, even in the Hamptons. It\u2019s all wrong.

You have seen the faces \u2013 your colleagues, your favourite Pilates teacher, the Duchess of Cambridge \u2013 1,000 times but you haven\u2019t seen inside their homes. The pandemic has forced us to make our private spaces public. And what may have begun as a voyeuristic interest is morphing into something else as the potential \u201cnew normal\u201d sees us spend much more time at home long term. </p> <p>Your house is no longer just your home. It\u2019s your HQ. In the new world order, the bookcase and the gallery wall are king of the power Zoom. Both backdrops can bridge the gap between authentically homely and rigorously professional. If the ideal power backdrop was once the skyscraper skyline view from your glass-boxed top floor office, a wall of books or black-and-white photographs makes for a passable lockdown substitute \u2013 the same busy, masculine right angles, the same solidity. You don\u2019t have an office filled with leather-bound reference tomes or a study lined with weighty hardback biographies? No problem \u2013 a sitting-room shelf of battered paperbacks will do, at a push. Messaging is about simplicity and clarity, as every politician knows (or so we used to assume).)

  "<p>Chickpeas are a long-term store cupboard staple, the kind of thing you take with you when you move house. But they also build up: it\u2019s not unusual to have more tins of chickpeas than you know what to do with, and an excess of one ingredient is nothing if not dispiriting. Here, then, are 17 easy and delicious ways to use them up.</p> <h2>Salad</h2> <p>I confess I reached a fairly ripe age before I learned to love chickpeas. When I was growing up in the US, they were called garbanzo beans, and my mother kept a tin of them in case she needed to make three-bean salad, which I never ate because of the name. To a child, \u201cthree-bean salad\u201d sounds three times worse than \u201cone-bean salad\u201d, which sounds bad enough.</p> <p>As an adult, however, I have two tips for you: first, you can discover a whole new world of chickpea recipes by typing \u201cgarbanzo\u201d into Google; second, three-bean salad is a simple pleasure. The three beans in question are chickpeas, kidney beans (drained and rinsed) and green beans, tossed with sliced red onion, parsley and a basic vinaigrette, and chilled for a bit before serving. Traditionally, it\u2019s made with tinned green beans, but I think this is an unnecessary privation \u2013 use fresh, cooked and cooled. You will find recipes online for four-bean, five-bean, six-bean and even-seven bean salads, invented by people with perverse ambitions and time on their hands. I leave you to judge how far is too far.</p> <p>Chickpeas also pair well with halloumi, sliced and fried for about a minute on each side. <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/warm-halloumi-chickpea-lime-salad\">Halloumi, chickpea and lime salad</a> is a good template, but you can also try the chickpea and cheese combination with red onion and avocado,<a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/halloumi-carrot-orange-salad\"> with carrots and watercress</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/17/foodanddrink\">beetroot and spinach</a>.

Inset: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Soups and stews</h2> <p>We have to start with the Italian Friday night supper <em>pasta e ceci</em>, which is not just simple but pleasingly parsimonious. It\u2019s a dish you might rustle up from ingredients left behind by the previous guests of an Airbnb flat: a tin of chickpeas, an onion, a potato, tomato puree, a parmesan rind and some old, broken pasta. There are many more elaborate variations, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/16/pasta-e-ceci-recipe-tinned-chickpea-pasta-broth-rachel-roddy\">Rachel Roddy\u2019s store-cupboard</a> version is the perfect introduction.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/moroccan-chickpea-soup-0\">Chickpea and chorizo stew</a> is another basic to which you might apply the usual lockdown rules: chorizo equals \u201cany sausage at all\u201d; parsley and coriander are in most circumstances interchangeable, and it\u2019s OK to replace smoked paprika with whichever hot red stuff you happen to own, including bottled sauces. These relaxations will remain in place until further notice.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/30/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-broccoli-fennel-chickpea-stew\">Broccoli, fennel and chickpea stew</a> makes use of vegetables you might otherwise struggle to combine, and Meera Sodha concocted it to appeal to children. It does contain orzo, which you may not have to hand, but it shouldn\u2019t be that difficult to procure. If your local shop had it, they will still have \u2013 nobody panic-bought orzo.</p> <p>Anna Jones makes an important point in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/10/anna-jones-chickpea-recipes\">recipe for chickpea and turmeric stew</a>: tinned chickpeas vary widely in terms of quality and texture \u2013 some are hard, some a bit sludgy. The ones in jars are generally nicer (and more expensive), and dried chickpeas, which need to be soaked overnight and then simmered for about an hour, have a slightly chalkier bite.</p> <h2>Falafel</h2> <p>You\u2019re not supposed to use tinned chickpeas to make falafel because they are too wet. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/feb/19/how-to-cook-perfect-falafel\">Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect falafel</a> uses dried chickpeas and dried split broad beans. But I\u2019m not here to stop you trying it with tinned chickpeas, <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/spicy-falafels\">and anything this recipe lacks in perfection it more than makes up for in simplicity</a>. If you think that falafel without the faff is not falafel, you could try Nigel Slater\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/23/nigel-slater-easy-dinner-basics-cupboard-chickpea-cakes-spinach-baked-apples\">chickpea cakes with spinach and lemongrass</a>, which are in the same spirit and more approachable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e7378ee83cd906f25fa4df7b48fb50ce90f183b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e7378ee83cd906f25fa4df7b48fb50ce90f183b/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chickpeas and curries \u2026 made for each other.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chickpeas and curries \u2026 made for each other.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brent Hofacker/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Curries</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/20/quick-chickpea-curry\">This recipe is so simple it\u2019s for students</a>: you just need onion, cumin, turmeric, garlic, tinned tomatoes, a couple of handfuls of spinach leaves and some coriander. I felt terribly overpraised when I made this for my family last week because I felt I had done so little to earn their appreciation. It was just too easy. But then I had the rest for lunch the next day and thought: sod it \u2013 this is excellent.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/chickpea-curry/\">Jamie Oliver\u2019s chickpea curry</a> is no more difficult, but it does call for a wider range of spices (bear in mind that \u201cdhana jeera powder\u201d is just a mixture of ground cumin and coriander), and this <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/coconut-chickpea-spinach-curry\">coconut chickpea and spinach curry</a> requires nothing more exotic than two tins of coconut milk.</p> <h2>Pasta</h2> <p>For Italian-Americans <em>pasta e ceci</em>, or simply \u201cpasta cheech\u201d, tends to refer to a deeply comforting pasta dish rather than a soup, although in most cases you would still probably eat it with a spoon. The basic ingredients are the same, and the variations are equally endless, so no matter what adjustments you make, you\u2019re probably approximating somebody\u2019s mother\u2019s version. It\u2019s a traditional way to use up odds and ends of leftover short pasta.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35b53dc718b120243aa5177569f5ae539c3c5633\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35b53dc718b120243aa5177569f5ae539c3c5633/0_222_6016_3608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pasta e ceci \u2026 endless variations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pasta e ceci \u2026 endless variations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oxana Denezhkina/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eaf0QUqbFAQ\">Bon App\u00e9tit video</a> probably gets closest to the way I was taught to make it, although the Italian-American woman who showed me how didn\u2019t use any tomatoes and insisted the pasta should be orecchiette so that, once it was stirred together, a chickpea sat nestled in each little ear, like a pearl in an oyster. She also used undrained tinned chickpeas \u2013 for her, the gloop the chickpeas came in was an essential part of the sauce.</p> <h2>Pudding</h2> <p>You may well be aware that the gloop the chickpeas come in has a name \u2013 aquafaba. The term was coined a few years ago (from the Latin for \u201cbean\u201d and \u201cwater\u201d), but, ever since, aquafaba has been hailed as a miracle vegan binding ingredient that can stand in for eggs and even be whipped like meringues (verdict from my test kitchen: no, it can\u2019t). In theory, any pudding requiring eggs can be made using aquafaba instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44a1feccd696b2d57f1daafe5482d8735ad7d5d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44a1feccd696b2d57f1daafe5482d8735ad7d5d0/0_68_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aquafaba meringues with caramel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aquafaba meringues with caramel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Russell/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I tried it with <a href=\"https://www.nigella.com/recipes/brownies\">Nigella Lawson\u2019s standard brownie recipe</a>, reducing the batch size to minimise my disappointment and substituting three tablespoons of chilled chickpea tin water for every whole egg. Otherwise, everything else was the same.</p> <p>I\u2019ve made these brownies many times before \u2013 with eggs \u2013 and the difference was pretty marked. These were oiler, flatter and a great deal chewier. While they weren\u2019t terrible, and didn\u2019t taste nearly as beany as you might imagine, I am easily discouraged by anything other than immediate and unequivocal success.

  "<p>You could barely see that it was a finger. \u201cThe wound was large, with several deep cuts into the flesh.

The wire was <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR0325442015ENGLISH.PDF\">first installed in 2005</a>, removed two years later and restored by the centre-right government of Mariano Rajoy in 2013. The socialist government led by Pedro Sanchez had a chance to make good on repeated promises of a more humanitarian migration policy after June 2018. And throughout 2018 and 2019, Spanish officials stated their determination to remove the razor wire and, <a href=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2019/12/03/actualidad/1575392092_094935.html\">in the words of</a> the interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, move beyond \u201cbloody methods\u201d of border control. <br></p> <p> Spain\u2019s humanitarian policy has become largely redundant, though, given that Moroccan authorities have <a href=\"https://www.abc.es/espana/abci-marruecos-concluye-valla-concertinas-para-dejar-interior-retire-ceuta-201910270229_noticia.html\">started installing razor wire </a> along their own border fence with Ceuta.

At home, it\u2019s about drones, surveillance and technical cooperation to identify migrants approaching the EU border before they even reach it. Meanwhile, violent border policing is kept farther afield: out of sight, out of mind. So the Moroccans build an \u2018ugly\u2019 fence which can be criticised, while the Spanish create a more \u2018humanitarian\u2019 alternative,\u201d says Kopp.</p> <p>Public pressure elsewhere has led some governments to reconsider the use of razor wire as experts brand it both inhumane and ineffective. Others even wonder about the legality of its use.<br><br>\u201cOn the one hand, legislation about borders states that crossing anywhere other than an official checkpoint is illegal. On the other hand, the notion of crossing a border illegally is usually voided under international refugee law if making an asylum claim,\u201d says Bernd Kasparek, a researcher at <a href=\"https://bordermonitoring.eu/\">Border Monitoring</a>, a German NGO that tracks pushbacks of refugees. \u201cSo there is a legal tension at the EU\u2019s borders. Sometimes it is very necessary to cross the border irregularly in order to lodge an asylum claim. Fortified borders like these interfere with that legal right, particularly in places where it\u2019s an open secret that 99% of asylum claims lodged with border guards are rejected,\u201d Kasparek adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9fe8c821729a2a41b0fe609cae35d800d548c2d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe8c821729a2a41b0fe609cae35d800d548c2d4/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dead animal caught in razor wire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An animal is killed on a fence built to keep out migrants in Slovenia.

In Slovenia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/11/balkan-wildlife-faces-extinction-threat-from-border-fence-to-control-migrants\">environmentalists\u2019 fears</a> of the impact of razor wire on wildlife led in 2016 to the removal of the coils from sections of its border with Croatia. In light of legal constraints in several European states on the deployment of razor wire in rural areas, some manufacturers <a href=\"https://www.gcmetal.pl/en/border-fence-iii/\">even indicate</a> the wildlife-friendly credentials of their razor wire.</p> <p>One difficulty in mounting a challenge is the near impossibility of establishing the true scale of the injuries inflicted specifically by razor wire at borders. According to Kate Dearden, project officer at the I nternational Organization for Migration\u2019s <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/\">Missing Migrants Project</a>, many governments only keep records on deaths at borders, rather than deaths that occur later as a result of injuries during attempts to cross them. </p> <p>Moreover, it can be hard to discover exactly which portions of Europe\u2019s fences are topped by razor wire and who supplied it; in recent years many governments have classified detailed information about fences as state security issues. Nevertheless, some manufacturers have refused to sell to border fences on humanitarian grounds. In 2015, Talat Deger, director of the Berlin-based company Mutanox, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-companies-refuse-to-sell-razor-wire-for-hungarys-anti-refugee-fence-a6668296.html\">refused</a> to do a deal with the Hungarian government. In an interview last year, Deger\u2019s successor, Efekan Dikici, said that he and his staff have kept to the principle.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to sell razor wire, of course, but only for the right purposes: to secure property, factories, jails, or for example on the railings of ships to prevent piracy. For those purposes it\u2019s justified; but when it\u2019s being used against humans who need help, that\u2019s awkward,\u201d said Dikici. \u201cMost of our workers have a foreign background themselves, so I think we all feel this a bit more.\u201d <br>That stance is costly. Dikici stressed that it can be genuinely difficult for razor wire suppliers to establish the end use of their product, given that they often deal with middlemen and procurement agencies. \u201cIf you\u2019re selling to a government, razor wire could be used for a prison or a border. But if a request for a really huge amount comes in, we do wonder whether it\u2019s for a border fence. Even large private properties need a few hundred metres, not kilometres. I ask myself, if we got a request from the US for the Mexico border, would we give them a quote?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7064d3d46084260980e23cc9945a1d96431443db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7064d3d46084260980e23cc9945a1d96431443db/0_0_3100_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian migrants clamber under a razor-wire fence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian migrants clamber under a razor-wire fence into Hungary at the border with Serbia, near Roszke, August 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernadett Szabo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other companies do not appear to have these scruples \u2013 after all, there is a brisk trade to be done in razor wire, which is not to be confused with barbed wire. Razor wire is cut from single sheets of galvanised steel, and most commonly sold in folding coils known in the industry as concertinas. The sharp razors come in various sizes; most seen by the Guardian at four European border fences are of the BTO-22, BTO-20 and BTO-10 varieties \u2013 straight razor edges affixed to a metal coil.</p> <p>There are even more formidable options: CBT-60 includes \u201charpoon\u201d style hooked razor heads that can embed themselves in the flesh of those trying to cross them. Some razor wire manufacturers seemingly flaunt the effects in their brochures; for example, Chinese manufacturer Hebei Jinshi <a href=\"https://www.razorbarbedwirefence.com/pdf/concertina-razor-wire-brochure.pdf\">advertises</a> its CBT-65 long blade as a \u201cvicious product\u201d whose \u201cextra long blade razors produce[s] [a] frightening effect.\u201d</p> <p>However, some European producers have discovered that selling razor wire to border fences comes at the cost of bad press, even in times of rising xenophobic sentiment.<br><br>When Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, decreed in 2015 that a fence be raised on Hungary\u2019s border with Serbia, the Malaga-based manufacturer <a href=\"http://concertina.es/en/\">European Security Fencing</a> (ESF) provided the razor wire. ESF, a subdivision of Mora Salazar, has delivered coils for fences in Austria, Slovenia, Bulgaria and France, and proudly presents itself as one of Europe\u2019s leading razor wire suppliers.</p> <p>Nevertheless, after the installation of its razor wire on the Hungarian border, ESF spokesmen told the Spanish press that they had been unaware of the product\u2019s final use by the Hungarian clients. In September 2015, the company <a href=\"https://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/concertinas-valla-Hungria-refugiados-Spain_0_431507330.html\">deleted its official Twitter account</a> following the backlash provoked by a tweet boasting of ESF\u2019s leading role in the European razor wire industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83cf9636445169459ca1f0e15bb0a8f7700c7b08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83cf9636445169459ca1f0e15bb0a8f7700c7b08/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alain Diabanza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alain Diabanza, a former refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who now teaches in Spain, at the razor-wire fence in Ceuta, Spain\u2019s north African territory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, ESF appears to have competition in the form of Polish company GC Metal, which now refers to itself as Europe\u2019s leading seller of razor wire. The company\u2019s website <a href=\"https://www.gcmetal.pl/en/securing-the-border/\">indicates</a> that it may have been involved in supplying concertina wire for the Bulgarian-Turkish border fence. Neither ESF nor GC Metal responded to requests for comment about the end use of their products or their humanitarian implications. <br><br>Europe\u2019s fortified borders are here to stay, even if borders in decades to come may be unrecognisable in comparison to today\u2019s crude fences. Razor wire, much like fortified borders in general, is both inhumane and ineffective, concludes Kopp, though its removal may not necessarily be a bellwether for a more humanitarian migration policy. Seismic sensors, night vision cameras and <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/05/11/drones-artificial-intelligence-europe-roborder/\">surveillance drones</a> have all come to play a greater role in border policing \u2013 with hi-tech solutions like these, will razor wire become redundant?</p> <p><br>\u201cThere\u2019s a high symbolic value to razor wire, like fences,\u201d says Mark Akkerman, a researcher at the Transnational Institute and author of a <a href=\"https://www.tni.org/files/publication-downloads/business_of_building_walls_-_full_report.pdf\">recent report</a> on Europe\u2019s border-industrial complex. \u201cSimply put, they allow governments to show the public, the press, their voters, and the world that they\u2019re \u2018doing something\u2019 about migration.\u201d</p> <p><br>\u2022 Maxim Edwards is a Berlin-based editor at GlobalVoices</p>",

Through a hodgepodge of laws and executive orders, at least 21 states have granted some form of civil immunity to healthcare providers, according to a tally sent to the Guardian by National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care \u2013 though in a few cases it is not clear if the immunity extends to nursing homes.</p> <p>Smith Sloan wrote: \u201cStates recognize that providers require legal protection as a result of actions related to combating the Covid-19 pandemic. LeadingAge \u2026 is pursuing protections on the federal level with a coalition asking for uniform and consistent relief as well.\u201d</p> <p>Some states are including immunity from criminal liability, but policies do generally make exceptions for especially egregious treatment, including willful misconduct or gross negligence.</p> <p>Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said: \u201cTo basically take away the one area of potential accountability when residents are most vulnerable to me is dumbfounding and dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>For some public health experts, however, the issue is not so cut and dried. They describe nursing homes as a sector in chronic need of reform that is nevertheless \u201cthe safety net of the safety net\u201d for vulnerable people.</p> <p>Experts acknowledge that the industry is filled with deficiencies, and is based upon a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/nursing-homes-care-corporate.html\">broken business model</a> that struggles in the face of a pandemic. But they also say nursing homes have been under-prioritized by officials in a public health crisis that has disproportionately targeted their patient populations.</p> <p>Michael L Barnett, a professor at the Harvard school of public health, said: \u201cPutting a nursing home out of business because somebody died is really punishing at the wrong level, because certainly there are nursing homes that probably did not act responsibly, or they may have ignored the threat.

That\u2019s about the same overall mortality rate as for Ebola in 2014 in west Africa.\u201d </p> <p>After two weeks of self-isolating, Piot ended up in hospital.</p> <p>The professor had perilously low oxygen levels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/happy-hypoxia-unusual-coronavirus-effect-baffles-doctors\">a phenomenon</a> of coronavirus in which patients present with no breathlessness or distress but have oxygen saturation scores <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/well/live/coronavirus-pulse-oximeter-oxygen.html\">low enough to </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/well/live/coronavirus-pulse-oximeter-oxygen.html\">typically cause unconsciousness</a>.</p> <p>\u201cLung images showed I had severe pneumonia, typical of Covid-19, as well as bacterial pneumonia. I constantly felt exhausted, while normally I\u2019m always buzzing with energy. It wasn\u2019t just fatigue, but complete exhaustion; I\u2019ll never forget that feeling. I had to be hospitalised, although I tested negative for the virus in the meantime. This is also typical for Covid-19: the virus disappears, but its consequences linger for weeks,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI was concerned I would be put on a ventilator immediately because I had seen publications showing it increases your chance of dying. I was pretty scared, but fortunately, they just gave me an oxygen mask first and that turned out to work. So, I ended up in an isolation room in the antechamber of the intensive care department.</p> <p>\u201cI shared a room with a homeless person, a Colombian cleaner, and a man from Bangladesh \u2013 all three diabetics, incidentally, which is consistent with the known picture of the disease. The days and nights were lonely because no one had the energy to talk. I could only whisper for weeks; even now, my voice loses power in the evening. But I always had that question going around in my head: how will I be when I get out of this?\u201d </p> <p>He was released after a week but was back in hospital days later.</p> <p>He had an \u201corganising pneumonia-induced lung disease, caused by a so-called cytokine storm\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a result of your immune defence going into overdrive.\u201d </p> <p>Piot is still recovering and warns that the more we learn about the virus, the more questions arise. \u201cThere will be hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, possibly more, who will need treatments such as renal dialysis for the rest of their lives,\u201d he predicted.</p> <p>\u201cWe are learning while we are sailing. That\u2019s why I get so annoyed by the many commentators on the sidelines who, without much insight, criticise the scientists and policymakers trying hard to get the epidemic under control. That\u2019s very unfair.\u201d</p>",

In addition to the standard declaration, commissioners had to disclose more specific conflicts as they worked through proposals.</p> <p>Harris said Power had askedhim to develop a protocol: \u201cIn the course of the work that is being undertaken by each commissioner, should they encounter something that involves effectively commercially sensitive information which could create a perception that they were being put in an advantageous position, they should draw that matter to his attention, or in his absence, to my attention.\u201d</p> <p>That had happened on one occasion, Harris said, but he declined to say which commissioner had declared the conflict, or disclose the proposal in question. He also pushed back on a request to make the conflict declarations public.</p> <p>Harris said Liveris \u2013 who heads a manufacturing group which Harris said was \u201cappended to the commission\u201d because that group was \u201cset up in an informal manner\u201d \u2013 was not subject to the conflict declarations that other commissioners faced.

The commissioners are Greg Combet, Jane Halton, Paul Little, Catherine Tanna and David Thodey.</p> <p>The statement said Combet, Halton and Little worked two days per week, and the approximate value of those contracts was $108,000, paid monthly over the six month period. Tanna worked one day per week, so the approximate value of the contract is $54,000, paid monthly over the six month period. Thodey was not paid a daily rate but his expenses were being met.</p> <p>Asked to explain the NCCC\u2019s work, Harris said the opening phase had been \u201cimmediate problem solving\u201d, like helping to source personal protective equipment and ensure that container ships were unloaded successfully at a time when global supply chains were disrupted.</p> <p>He said the commission was now in transition to a second, advisory phase. It was \u201caccepted wisdom\u201d that things would be different after the pandemic, and the NCCC was contributing to that accepted wisdom and providing \u201cbroadly speaking, a business perspective\u201d.</p> <p>Harris acknowledged that the membership of the commission did not span all dimensions of the Australian economy but said departmental officials were supplementing its work.</p> <p>The commission had been \u201ca magnet\u201d for projects, with some proposals before it well known and others newer.

I learned in that moment this \u201climo\u201d was not the fancy limousine that I had expected but merely a large bus. It was a portent, this shattering of expectations; it would happen again and again over the course of the marriage.</p> <p>I did not know then about the geographic mores of literary gatekeeping that enshrine New York as the haloed altar of American letters. I did have a passion for the written word, a passion so fervid that I had agreed, at 16, to marry a man I barely knew for the promise of studying literature in America.</p> <p>We moved to Indiana. The marriage didn\u2019t last but my literary aspirations did. They were ill-suited to the life I was left with: that of a single mother with a toddler and very little money. I had won custody, but the judge had decreed custody could be taken away were I to move more than 100 miles from where I lived then. If I had nursed any hopes about a Maya Angelou-esque new beginning in New York, where all the writers were, I had to set them aside.</p> <p>I felt sentenced to Indiana and so I pretended that I did not live there. When talking to other Pakistanis, on the internet, at conferences and during visits home I deflected questions over where I actually lived. I was actually writing by then, first for blogs, then in 2009 for Dawn, Pakistan\u2019s largest newspaper published in English. When I took a position that required I go to New York City every six weeks, I thought my American writing career was about to begin. Instead, I got condescension.</p> <p>The interactions usually went something like this: \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d someone would ask, in the way literary New Yorkers do when sizing someone up (and they\u2019re always sizing someone up). When I would say \u201cIndiana\u201d, most assumed I had said \u201cIndia\u201d. When I laughed and enunciated, \u201cIndia-NA,\u201d they frowned.</p> <p>After a while I stopped correcting them. Exotically eastern, I thought, was probably better than dowdily midwestern.</p> <p>I took on other forms of subterfuge. Once while trying to impress a publicist who was about to send me a book, I used the address of a New York friend. A few other times, while corresponding with editors, I gave my agent\u2019s address in New York. Only if someone was particularly insistent did I offer up the truth.</p> <p>Even after writing two books and hundreds of articles and essays, I balk at being excluded from the literary milieu because I do not live in New York full-time. At first I justified the lie to myself as a necessary one; the lore of literary New York required it, the brutal business of being a writer required it. More recently I\u2019ve rationalized it as half true, which it became when I began to spend a part of every month in New York City.</p> <p>Covid-19 has put an end to that \u201calmost in New York\u201d lifestyle. Catastrophe, I am learning, has the potential of exposing costs. Freed of travel and Fomo, I am aghast at the energy I frittered on it. With New York literary life paused, most of my anxieties have also dissipated. In the lovely silence of my study I can simply <em>be</em> a writer rather than engage in the performance of being a writer which is what New York is all about. I wonder now, why I did not free myself of New York sooner?</p> <p>I know why. In a literary world where writer-ly performance \u2013 appearance at the right parties, questions at the right book talk, curated Twitter feeds and hustling with the publishing industry\u2019s kingmakers \u2013 can yield bountiful book deals, everyone feels pushed and prodded into similar enactments.</p> <p>As a brown, immigrant author, I know that I will never really be part of that elite milieu. The niche most available to me is one in which I gouge up the details of my suffering, framed in the requisite arc of having escaped my own culture, my arranged marriage, etc. If I do a good job, I could be permitted to tell the stories of other brown women. In the meantime, the new Didions of my generation will write about anyone, of any color or class no questions asked.</p> <p>Catastrophe and transformation go together. The first we now know with a familiarity we would never have imagined were we not currently living it, the parameters of the second must still be envisioned. Is it possible to build a literary culture less centered on one very expensive place? During a global pandemic it feels radical even to consider it but I do believe that the American literary elite can be pushed to imagine it; to admit that literary genius can be cast in molds other than the Didion or Sontag.</p> <p>I lied about my New York address because I wanted to appear cooler, more accomplished, more a part of the club than I was. Faced with a literary scene that by and large, favored women with Ivy League pedigree and insouciant style over those with a catalogue of hardscrabble, school-of-life truths such as mine, I hid facts and put up fronts. I still feel terrible for that girl who hid her truths, who never before spoke about being a single mother, who felt too afraid of losing custody of her child to head off for literary adventure in New York City. I would be lying if I said that I would have told her to do otherwise, to be completely honest \u2013 not yet, not just yet.</p>",
  "<p>A pub quiz question. What do the following have in common: Blackpool Tower Ballroom, the Grand Opera House Belfast, Hackney Empire and the London Palladium? All were the creation of Frank Matcham, the centenary of whose death falls this Sunday. Alan Bennett, a devout admirer, called him \u201cundoubtedly this country\u2019s greatest theatrical architect\u201d. At a time when we are resigned to many more months of virtual playgoing, it is a joy to celebrate the sensuous memories of sitting in one of Matcham\u2019s matchless theatres.</p> <p>The bare facts of his career are fascinating. He was born in Devon in 1854, was apprenticed at 14 to a Torquay architect, came to London in 1875 and joined the practice of Jethro T Robinson, who was consulting architect to the Lord Chamberlain and whose daughter he went on to marry. After Robinson\u2019s death in 1878, Matcham took over the building of the Elephant and Castle theatre in London. But that was just the start. His explosive heyday lasted from 1891 to 1913, when he designed not just theatres and music halls but such local landmarks as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Leeds\">County Arcade in Leeds</a>, Harrogate\u2019s Royal Hall and the Blackpool Tower Circus. It is estimated that he built or rebuilt more than 150 theatres, of which 26 still thankfully survive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9286fa4da238c32ebcc15347b6544675f9a93f80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9286fa4da238c32ebcc15347b6544675f9a93f80/0_0_2362_1418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Matcham\u2019s Richmond theatre auditorium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Matcham\u2019s Richmond theatre auditorium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What makes a Matcham theatre so special? Several things. One is that no two Matcham buildings are alike. The King\u2019s Theatre in Glasgow, with its arcade of conches, is Scots baroque. The Grand Opera House Belfast, all onion domes and elephant heads, is extravagantly oriental. And the London Coliseum \u2013 widely considered to be his masterpiece \u2013 suggests, through its terracotta facade and Venetian windows, a hymn to the Italian Renaissance. But the Coliseum offers another clue to Matcham\u2019s genius: his ability to combine intimacy and opulence. One of his core beliefs was that every seat should provide a good view; having sat in the rear stalls and circle at the Colly, I can vouch for that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8c11858d06ae33f74ec417db3e14834d7391aa49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c11858d06ae33f74ec417db3e14834d7391aa49/145_247_3020_5033/600.jpg\" alt=\"Matcham circa 1910.\" width=\"600\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matcham c.1910.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The penny dropped about his gifts when I read an essay in an excellent volume called Frank Matcham and Co, edited by David Wilmore. Andrew Saint, in a piece entitled Frank Matcham in Perspective, makes the point that Matcham, working in a hectically commercial environment, had little time for rule-based classicism or the refinement of William Morris\u2019s arts and crafts movement. Instead, Saint draws a parallel between Matcham and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/picture/2012/apr/19/quintessential-charles-dickens-novel\">Dickens</a>, which strikes me as brilliantly perceptive.</p> <p>John Earl, writing in The Matcham Directory, talks of \u201cthe sheer variety of the man\u2019s joyful inventions\u201d. You could apply the same words to Dickens \u2013 and, as with the writer, Matcham\u2019s work was often patronised by academic purists. Edwin Sachs, in a triple volume devoted to modern opera houses and theatres, wrote that to illustrate Matcham\u2019s work in such a tome \u201cwould be as anomalous as to include the jerry builder\u2019s cottages in a volume on domestic architecture\u201d. That sneer reminds me of FR Leavis excluding Dickens from The Great Tradition on the grounds that, with the exception of Hard Times, his novels lack \u201ca sustained seriousness\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"467533fca39c3e9213dbb51d39fa71d2f5593267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/467533fca39c3e9213dbb51d39fa71d2f5593267/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A tea dance at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tea dance at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the whirligig of time brings its revenges. Matcham\u2019s work was viewed with hostility by the architectural establishment during his own life and for 50 years after his death. Since 1970, however, it has been enthusiastically celebrated. It all started when the threatened demolition of the Lyric Hammersmith in London reminded us that it boasted a magnificent Matcham auditorium.</p> <p>Then came the discovery of 10,000 previously unseen drawings from the Matcham office that belied the idea of him as some rough-and-ready improviser. Above all, there has been a growing reaction over the past half century against the monochrome monotony of many a civic playhouse. At a time when even the illustrious Denys Lasdun, who designed the National Theatre, was said \u201cto have no language for frivolity\u201d, we crave a bit of Matchamesque panache.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a600c1e3d636412d84ca43658bd4e624a8aaf7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a600c1e3d636412d84ca43658bd4e624a8aaf7f/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Lyric Hammersmith, in London, after a refurbishment in 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matcham\u2019s Lyric Hammersmith, in London, after a refurbishment in 2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Tett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obviously, you can\u2019t simply reproduce his style today: it was a product of Victorian and Edwardian expansiveness. (It\u2019s striking how many of his suburban music halls were \u201cEmpires\u201d.) But we yearn for Matcham\u2019s freewheeling inventiveness and \u2013 as the theatre guru Iain Mackintosh pointed out \u2013 we now have it in the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/16/steve-tompkins-architect-haworth-tompkins-q-and-a-national-theatre-liverpool-everyman\">Steve Tompkins</a>. He and his partners have worked on a huge variety of theatres including the Liverpool Everyman, the Bristol Old Vic, the restored grand hall at Battersea Arts Centre in London and the Bridge on the capital\u2019s South Bank. They all have flair, wit and a rapport between stage and audience that is the essence of a first-rate theatre.</p> <p>When Tompkins was named most influential person in British theatre in the Stage\u2019s annual list in 2019, the paper\u2019s editor, Alistair Smith, hailed Tompkins as a modern Matcham. Before 1970, the comparison would have been meaningless. Today it is the highest compliment a theatre architect can receive. When we eventually get the chance to sit once again in a Matcham theatre, we should take a moment to look around and rejoice in the work of this native theatrical genius.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://biblio.co.uk/bookstore/theatreshire-books-dacre\">Frank Matcham and Co and The Matcham Directory are available from Biblio</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

The current US death toll stands at 82,376.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil reports record deaths</strong></h2> <p>Brazil reported a record <a href=\"https://covid.saude.gov.br/\">881 Covid-19</a> deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to John Hopkins University <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">figures</a>. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest.</p> <h2><strong>US Senate threatens sanctions on China over Covid-19 accounting</strong></h2> <p>US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</p> <h2><strong>Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents</strong></h2> <p>The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. It was widely believed that this will be done within 10 days. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity, suggesting that while there is a city-wide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times.</p> <h2>Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home\">Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d</a>, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday.

Shuttered shops and factories, grounded planes and stay-at-home consumers as a result of lockdown restrictions mean <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/economy-finance/ip125_en.pdf\">the EU economy is expected to shrink by 7.5% in 2020,</a> a deeper fall than the 2009 financial crisis.</p> <p>Gentiloni is concerned that countries do not have the same resources to recover from this economic shock. The hardest hit countries \u2013 Greece, Italy, Spain and Croatia \u2013 face falls in economic output (GDP) in excess of 9% in 2020, while Germany\u2019s economy is set to contract by 6.5% and Austria\u2019s by 5.5%. Meanwhile countries have varying levels of state resources to rescue ailing companies and pay workers\u2019 wages \u2013 emergency measures that have become easier since Brussels relaxed state aid rules to deal with the crisis.</p> <p>Gentiloni said state aid requests from EU member states were very imbalanced. \u201cWhat is clear is the uneven level of the recovery and the risks this creates to our single market and the necessary convergence, especially within the euro area. This is something that I could even define as an existential threat to the building of the Union,\u201d he told a group of European newspapers, including the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cIf we want to look from a more optimistic way it is not only an existential threat but also in some sense a historic opportunity to fill the void we have in common tools of economic and fiscal policies.\u201d</p> <p>The 19-country eurozone\u2019s unfinished foundations were exposed by the 2008 global financial crisis, which morphed into a debt crisis for Europe\u2019s weakest economies. A decade later policymakers continue to call for deeper integration, such as a eurozone budget and finance minister.</p> <p>Gentiloni, however, said he was not talking about a finance minister when he spoke of \u201ccommon tools\u201d in economic policy. Instead, he gave the example of an EU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/eu-plans-to-spend-100bn-on-saving-jobs-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">plan to borrow and spend \u20ac100bn (\u00a388bn) to protect workers\u2019 jobs across the EU</a>. Similar plans were discussed eight to 10 years ago \u201cand the discussion went for years and years without any chance to reach agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the end, during this crisis we delivered.\u201d</p> <p>The European commission is drawing up a recovery plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/clashes-predicted-over-trillion-euro-covid-19-aid-as-eu-meets-online\">after EU leaders in April called for a response to the exceptional economic shock</a>. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission\u2019s president, has said the plan would include \u20ac1tn of support, but it remains to be decided where the money will come from. The recovery plan will be folded into the EU\u2019s next seven-year budget, which was the source of bitter disagreements before the pandemic began.</p> <p>One unresolved question is the balance in the recovery plan between loans and grants. France, Spain and Italy are seeking some financial transfers, while Germany, the Netherlands and other northern countries prefer to give support through loans.</p> <p>Gentiloni said he could not specify the split between grants and loans, but made clear his support for a certain amount of financial transfers. He said some sectors, such as tourism, and unspecified geographical areas needed intervention \u201cin the principle of solidarity of this kind, grants\u201d. Secondly, he added, relying too much on loans would push countries deeper into debt. He said he was optimistic about the debate. \u201cThis principle of a mix of grants and loans is more understood now than it was a month ago. The crisis has changed the awareness of the importance of solidarity.\u201d</p> <p>Adding urgency to the need for a recovery plan, he said, was an expected shortfall of private investment \u20ac800bn in 2021 and 2022, funds that should have kickstarted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">Europe\u2019s green deal</a> and main answer to the climate emergency. The EU\u2019s strategic goals, he said \u201cneed to be supported, strongly supported now\u201d.</p> <p>The commissioner also said he was worried about a no-deal from negotiations on a post-Brexit future with the UK, which is one of the \u201cdownside risks\u201d in the commission\u2019s latest economic forecast for the UK and EU. \u201cNo deal is a lose-lose situation,\u201d he said reiterating the commission\u2019s widely shared view that economic difficulties would be worse for the UK. \u201cObviously we hope that in both cases we will not have this downside risk materialise.\u201d</p> <p>The UK economy is forecast by the commission to shrink by 8.3% in 2020, but failure to reach an agreement would further dampen economic growth.</p>",

Misinformation has filled the vacuum and public confidence in 5G has been shaken.\u201d</p> <p>The report goes into significant detail to address some of the concerns put forward by those opposed to 5G, including pointing out that the impact of non-ionising radiation has been heavily researched. Initially 5G will operate in the same spectrum band as 4G, and although it will move to higher frequencies in a few years, the report notes \u201chigher frequencies do not mean higher exposure levels\u201d.</p> <p>The report also counters several of the reports provided by opponents of 5G on the alleged health impacts.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, a vast amount of misinformation about the safety and impact of 5G is out there,\u201d the committee said.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps some confusion comes from the new spectrum bands 5G will use. The committee heard that \u2018higher frequency does not mean higher power\u2019, and that, in fact, devices will operate at a lower power due to focusing the 5G signal only to where it is required and the increased number of antennae, which means that users will have less exposure than under previous generations of mobile technology.</p> <p>\u201cThe committee has been assured that 5G is safe.\u201d</p> <p>In December last year, the federal communications minister, Paul Fletcher, announced $9m in funding to address misinformation about the health impact of telecommunications networks, including more research and public education.</p> <p>The committee has made several recommendations, including getting the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (Arpansa) to better consult with members of the public about concerns over electromagnetic radiation, and the committee supported the federal government\u2019s education campaign funding.</p> <p>The report was finalised in March before misinformation began spreading online claiming either 5G was responsible for coronavirus, due to the construction of 5G networks in Wuhan, or for \u201cpoisoning cells\u201d that created coronavirus.</p> <p>The misinformation has been widely spread on Facebook, in particular \u2013 a video went viral where a man claiming to be a former Vodafone executive warned the pandemic was a global plot to install 5G and track the population through vaccines.</p> <p>In reality, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/vodafone-exec-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-video-revealed-pastor-luton-jonathon-james\">the Guardian revealed</a>, the voice on the tape making the baseless claims is an evangelical pastor who had only worked in sales for Vodafone for less than a year in 2014.</p> <p>Several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/how-false-claims-about-5g-health-risks-spread-into-the-mainstream\">mobile towers in the UK</a> have been attacked by people as a result of the misinformation, and telecoms workers have reported being harassed by members of the public.</p> <p>Facebook has since said it is taking \u201caggressive steps\u201d to remove coronavirus-related misinformation, including linking it to 5G, or encouraging attacks on phone towers.</p> <p>In Australia, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-13/coronavirus-racism-blamed-nazi-flag-appears-in-regional-victoria/12145166\">a Nazi flag with #COVID19 written on it</a> was tied to two Chinese flags on a mobile tower in regional Victoria in April.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/13/why-are-australians-smashing-their-tvs-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-5g-and-coronavirus\">Why are Australians smashing their TVs?

  "<p>The government is telling us that if we don\u2019t open up the Australian economy soon, we will do lasting harm to it.

With record unemployment coming our way and a world economy headed for recession, where does Frydenberg think employers will find the money to pay their staff and workers will find money to pay their rent if his government pulls the pin on fiscal stimulus midway through this crisis?</p> <p>The reason firms pay workers to make things is because customers pay firms to have those things. While the Morrison government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-no-excuse-to-push-ideological-changes-such-as-company-tax-cuts-labor-says\">still obsessed with the idea</a> that cutting the company tax rate will make firms invest in bigger factories, every CEO and board in the country is obsessed with whether customers will be able to afford to buy their stuff once the shops, gyms and restaurants begin to open up again. Businesses do not lead recoveries, they respond to them, and until the customers start buying more stuff than the companies can make, the companies aren\u2019t going to waste money expanding their production capacity.</p> <p>The economic models governments use to predict the future have never had a good track record. The Coalition has delivered six budgets since winning office in 2013, and Treasury has overestimated wage growth in all six of them. But those errors are trivial compared to the bizarre assumptions those same models make about the long-run impact of the deepest recession in a century.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Morrison government has to ditch not just the metaphor of snap back, but the policies based on that metaphor</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Economic models usually deal with recessions by assuming they don\u2019t really matter. Of course, economic modellers know that \u201cnegative shocks\u201d hit the economy from time to time, but they also know that positive shocks hit the economy from time to time as well. If you assume that the positive and negative shocks cancel each other out, guess what? You don\u2019t have to worry too much about the long-run consequences of some short-term pain.</p> <p>Again, modellers know that there are both bumps and potholes in the road, but if you assume that the bumps and dips even each other out you can, in the words of the Reserve Bank of Australia, build models with an \u201cerror-correction architecture\u201d. This forecasting approach expects that if the economy is booming then it will, most likely, slow down a bit soon. And if the economy is in a recession, it will probably speed up again soon. Such simplifying assumptions allow economists to pretty much ignore the short-term path the economy is on. But a problem ignored is not a problem solved.</p> <p>In 1991 the Australian economy went into a six-month recession which saw GDP fall by 1.4%. If that was a pothole then the 10% recession the RBA and Treasury are predicting for this year is a virtual cliff. But does anyone really believe the assumption that the higher the cliff, the better a car will bounce back? That if Covid-19 caused our economy to collapse by 20%, the economy would snap back twice as fast as we are assuming it will in response to the 10% recession we are expecting?</p> <p>It\u2019s not just dodgy modelling assumptions that cause problems for economic policy making; dodgy metaphors are just as dangerous. Assuming that the depth of a recession determines the strength of the recovery \u2013 and talking about the ability of an economy to snap back \u2013 implies that nature, not policy makers, will determine what happens to the economy in the coming years. Economic history and theory suggest that the opposite is the case. It was massive public spending programs that brought the Great Depression to an end, not natural forces. It was Labor\u2019s fiscal stimulus that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2019/apr/03/the-coalition-says-the-silliest-things-about-economic-management\">stopped Australia going into recession after the global financial crisis</a>, not market forces.</p> <p>The economy will snap back after falling off a 10% cliff no better than the front of your car would snap back after driving off a 10-metre cliff. Just as it takes time, effort and skill to reshape a car after a crash it takes time, effort and skill to put an economy back together. Particularly after its biggest downturn in a century.</p> <p>It\u2019s not ideological to say that business can\u2019t lead us out of this recession, it\u2019s economics. Economists typically break the economy up into four sectors: consumer spending, private sector investment, government spending and net exports. When we talk about the size of GDP, we are literally talking about the sum of those four parts. Let\u2019s think about what\u2019s likely to happen to those parts.</p> <p>We know that unemployment is set to rise dramatically, and the number of people moving to Australia will fall dramatically. While there\u2019s likely some pent-up demand for restaurants, movies and holidays, it\u2019s hard to see a big, sustained increase in consumer spending dragging us back up the Covid-19 cliff in the next few years.</p> <p>As most of the rest of the world is being hit harder than Australia by Covid-19, it\u2019s unlikely that foreign demand for our exports is booming any time soon either, especially since big export earners such as tourism and education will be largely shut off from their customers for some time yet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/07/australias-national-cabinet-to-set-timetable-to-reopen-economy-in-several-stages\">Australia's national cabinet to set timetable to reopen economy in several stages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And while Frydenberg has been talking like a Keynesian who sees a role for government spending to stimulate the economy, he isn\u2019t acting like one when he says he will cut government spending in the second half of this year.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s private business investment. If domestic and foreign consumers are spending less money and the government is spending less money, why would private businesses choose \u2013 in the middle of a pandemic and recession \u2013 to spend up big on new factories, or anything else? Business investment was already at record lows in 2019, so why would anyone, other than an economic modeller, assume that means this year it would have to pick up?</p> <p>The government is right to try and get the economy moving as soon as it is safe to do so because, no matter what the economic models assume, deep recessions do not cause their own recoveries. And the fact that deep recessions don\u2019t cause their own recoveries is precisely why the Morrison government has to ditch not just the metaphor of snap back, but the policies based on that metaphor.</p> <p>The Australian economy does not need temporary and targeted stimulus. It needs hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of new public policies and investment to fill the gaping hole that Covid-19 has dug into our economy. And the sooner they get started on those policies, the sooner unemployment will fall.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the independent thinktank the Australia Institute</p>",

But he said senior staff had been involved.</p> <p>Asked by the Greens senator Nick McKim whether it had considered the public interest and the impact on trust in politics, the commissioner said that \u201cobtaining any additional information or evidence to prove the element of intent in relation to any relevant offences would likely require more than cooperative statements, and require investigative action using coercive powers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe use of such powers could have had an impact on the business of parliament and would involve a journalist and the identification of their source. These factors require significant public interest to justify further investigative action.

He said the minister had included two ecological communities and 31 species on the 2019 <a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/e0a90020-a411-4508-adac-53758c304de1/files/priority-assessment-list-2019.pdf\">finalised priority assessment list</a> as a result of recommendations from the scientific committee.</p> <p>A spokesman for Ley said the department made decisions after considering \u201ccompeting merit and priority\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn this case the matter has been previously considered and determined by parliament,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The spokesman said Ley had launched \u201cone of the most comprehensive assessments of threatened species impacts\u201d since last summer\u2019s bushfire crisis .</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/nominations/ecological-communities-not-prioritised-assessment\">reasons </a>published on its website, the department said \u201cseveral scientific reports relevant to the assessment of the river and wetland systems would be released during 2019, which will greatly assist the automatic reconsideration of this nomination in 2020\u201d.</p> <p>Evan Quartermain, Humane Society International\u2019s head of programs, said there was already more than enough scientific evidence to support listing of the two communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/12/murray-darling-lower-lakes-were-largely-fresh-before-european-settlement-csiro-review-finds\">Murray-Darling lower lakes were largely fresh before European settlement, CSIRO review finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBy allowing overwhelming evidence to be disregarded for basically any reason during the listing process, our current environmental protection framework allows politics to influence something that should be purely scientific,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s discretion that has the potential to send species extinct and collapse entire ecosystems.\u201d</p> <p>Quartermain said the organisation should not have had to renominate the communities given both had been protected in 2013 after thorough assessments.</p> <p>He said disallowance of listings was frustrating and \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d. He hoped it would be addressed through the review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act that is under way.</p> <p>\u201cScience, not politics, should be the only basis for listings but it\u2019s clear that as it stands this isn\u2019t always the case,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d the Morrison government had not followed scientific advice. She said the government was attempting \u201cto influence the outcomes of scientific processes designed to protect our environment\u201d.</p> <p>Richard Kingsford, the director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of New South Wales, said the scientific research on the two communities showed both had high levels of biodiversity and were degrading significantly as a result of reduced flooding.</p> <p>\u201cThe question would be: why were they ruled out at that first step?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIdeally you want an objective process for assessing these things and then you can decide what your options are [to manage areas needing protection] after that. That\u2019s a fundamental issue here.\u201d</p>"
