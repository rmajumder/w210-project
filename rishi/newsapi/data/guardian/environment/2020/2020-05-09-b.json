This includes what\u2019s known as \u201c<a href=\"https://foodfirst.org/what-is-parity-and-why-you-should-care/\">parity</a>\u201d \u2013 a fair price for farmers\u2019 crops, guaranteed by the government, to prevent overproduction and market chaos.</p> \n   <p>Subsidies that currently <a href=\"https://ips-dc.org/we-subsidize-the-wrong-kind-of-agriculture/\">propel</a> farming consolidation and mass production of commodities for livestock feed and fuel must be reformed to promote organic, smaller-scale, regionally and local foods. This will help farmers survive and provide communities with resilient and diverse food supplies rather than depending on vast and fragile corporate food supply chains.</p> \n   <p>If there were ever a time to bust up the food and farming monopolies, which are reminiscent of the Beef Trust of the early 1900s, now is it. Centralized corporate power is creating agricultural and economic mono-cropping at a time when we most need a food system that\u2019s diverse, equitable and sustainable.</p> \n   <p>The Covid-19 crisis and worsening climate chaos require far more public-sector direction and coordination of something as central to human survival as food.</p> \n   <p>Amid the current supply-chain breakdown, as news spread of gargantuan food waste, some <a href=\"https://www.wkbw.com/news/state-news/new-york-state-farmers-donate-34-000-pounds-of-milk-beef-and-produce-to-nyc-families-in-need?fbclid=IwAR0L4qkyEIvINGqaGblka5BiOrPTgo-nazaGBJYCfFNmFZ_Zc2NMqz81txU\">farmers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/caravan-brings-thousands-of-pound-to-produce-to-western-washington-for-families-in-need/281-1eae725e-6923-4bcc-b7e2-ffb86f4ad56b?fbclid=IwAR2jloI75BLLJRtGwr2uRvLSTU4PlszVTxfkitpzxyheVfiS-euVBTKVfLA\">caravans</a> of volunteers have helped deliver food directly from the farms to people in need \u2013 a truly heroic gift.</p> \n   <p>But this vital act, feeding people in need and averting massive food waste, can\u2019t be left to random acts of kindness.

It is a slightly higher rise than the previous day, when there were 10,699 new cases. Russia\u2019s coronavirus cases overtook France and Germany this week to become the fifth highest total in the world.</p> <h2>Lagos could be put on lockdown again after social distancing rules disregarded</h2> <p>Nigeria\u2019s largest city, Lagos, could return to lockdown if residents continue to ignore social distancing rules, its governor warned on Saturday.</p> <p>The city emerged on Monday from a five-week stay-at-home order that had left the city\u2019s large number of poor struggling to make ends meet. But since the easing of the restrictions, people have been seen thronging markets and banks despite orders to avoid mass gatherings.</p> <h2><strong>UK death toll rises by 346 as coastguard warns lockdown flouters</strong></h2> <p>The UK death toll has risen by 346 to 31,587 across all settings, while 215,260 have tested positive, an increase of 3,896 cases on Friday. Meanwhile, the coastguard recorded the highest number of incidents in one day since the lockdown began as people \u201cignored\u201d the government\u2019s message to stay at home.

Dresden were scheduled to play Hannover 96 next Sunday in their first game back following the stoppage caused by the outbreak.</p>",
  "<p>You join me overlooking an empty Edinburgh crossroads, an indoorsman considering my new neck of the woods. Near-empty buses roll down Dundas Street and shush across the junction in the haar (fog). In this brave mute world \u2013 a month of Christmas mornings so far \u2013 I watch lone joggers and mothers with children, and wave at good dogs. I write to my friends. I check in by phone. \u201cYes,\u201d I say, several times a week, \u201cEdinburgh\u2019s very nice. Quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, I spent several months travelling for a book, seeking out solitude and remote locations \u2013 strange to think now. I visited wild places on the edge \u2013 frozen Soviet ghost towns, Mars missions in the Utah desert, shrines perched high on Japanese mountains \u2013 as well as spartan structures whose wildness emanated from within, such as Simon Starling\u2019s metamorphic installation <a href=\"https://www.themoderninstitute.com/artists/simon-starling/works/shedboatshed-mobile-architecture-no-2-2005/88/\">Shedboatshed</a>, the writing \u201cWendy houses\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/feb/08/roald-dahl-100-anniversary-events-wondercrump-the-witches\">Roald Dahl</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/11/moomins-creator-tove-jansson-finland-island-teach-about-small-worlds\">Tove Jansson</a>, and Roger Deakin\u2019s Suffolk <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/aug/05/roger-deakin-cabins-walnut-tree-farm-suffolk\">shepherd\u2019s hut</a>.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking about these places a lot these days; about the way different people either embraced their outposts or, like Jack Kerouac, went to pieces. Kerouac spent his 63 days as a wildfire spotter crazed and lonely, beset by nightmares of yetis and bears \u2026 as well as by actual bears. There are fewer bears in Edinburgh but the cabin fever is still very real.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"37fbc086804eeca2b637cab9916cc7d239d320a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37fbc086804eeca2b637cab9916cc7d239d320a1/0_0_5409_3606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Mars Desert ResearchStation in a remote cornerof the Utah desert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mars Desert Research Station in a remote corner of the Utah desert, US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jurriaan Brobbel/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here we all are isolating inside, alone together. Parisian writer Sylvain Tesson makes the point in his marvellous book<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/01/consolations-forest-sylvain-tesson-review1\"> Consolations of the Forest</a> when he\u2019s left alone for six months in a cabin in the middle of the Russian Taiga: \u201cIt\u2019s \u201327\u00b0 F. The truck has dissolved into the fog. Silence falls from the sky in little white shavings. To be alone is to hear silence \u2026 I will finally find out if I have an inner life.\u201d</p> <p>The closest I came to such boondocks deprivation in my outpost travels was the days I spent helping renovate a bunkhouse in the middle of Iceland\u2019s interior tundra \u2013 plumb in the middle of nowhere. The hut, called Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes, was built in 1930 and sits on the shore of a frozen lake facing Iceland\u2019s second-largest glacier. Such cabins are called <em>s\u00e6luh\u00fas</em> in Iceland \u2013 houses of joy \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see why when one pictures the ancient Norse people sighting such a shelter after a long day\u2019s slog.</p> <p>Originally built as way stations along ancient roads, they are used today by people exploring this country\u2019s uncanny beauty. Rebuilt and reimagined over the centuries, s\u00e6luh\u00fas now range in form from rudimentary rock-and-turf igloos to solid chalets with plumbing and stoves.</p> <p>I travelled to Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes with two carpenters, Stef\u00e1n and Atli, to fix up the building for future hikers. As we drove towards the glacier\u2019s huge white maw, the s\u00e6luh\u00fas emerged from the grass and marsh: red roof, green gables, white sides banked with turf. A little cabin sitting up, hugging its knees. \u201cSo, you know this place we are going is a very haunted house,\u201d Stef\u00e1n announced. \u201cOh yes?\u201d I replied. Atli met my eye in the rearview mirror. \u201cOh yes!\u201d he said. \u201cOh yes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"378349f25aff9dcea4054d2f9ebddd02e8a3baf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/378349f25aff9dcea4054d2f9ebddd02e8a3baf0/0_312_4032_2418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Landscape shot of Iceland. \u2018Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes is one of the most haunted buildings in Iceland.

I was furnished with copious tales of spectral encounters \u2013 ghostly women haunting sleepers in the \u201cbad bed\u201d, doors slamming, heavy footsteps in the attic; or walkers approaching a well-lit cabin full of life but opening the front door to find the inside freezing, dark and silent. Imagine walking all day and reaching, at dusk, the only man-made structure on a vast permafrosted plateau to find your bothy beset by poltergeists. It would be\u2026 upsetting.</p> <p>But there was no sign of malevolence for the first week, and work to replace rotten planking and posts went well. In 24-hour daylight we hammered and dug, wrapped up against the wind, tiny figures in a leopard-print prairie. And we all slept well in our cosy cots \u2026 Until the time Stef\u00e1n had \u201ca long night with the ghost\u201d \u2013 an Inception-style series of dreams within dreams, none of them good. \u201cI\u2019m part-troll so I can deal with it,\u201d he told me next morning with a wry smile, but he looked knackered, like a man who\u2019d fought his way out of a supernatural tumble dryer.</p> <p>If ever I awake after bad dreams now, I think of Stef\u00e1n\u2019s matter-of-fact \u201cI\u2019m part troll\u201d mantra, because I think it\u2019s true that being at peace with oneself is important for any traveller who wishes to explore the unknown. So often wild places reveal us to ourselves \u2013 how we are, whether we\u2019re happy in our own skin. If only Kerouac had possessed Stef\u00e1n\u2019s stoicism, faced with the great beyond. So often, to paraphrase early conservationist<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/06/john-muir-conservation-scotland\"> John Muir</a>, going out is really going in. In these locked-down times, many may be longing for company, noise and bustle, but solitude still enthrals me; just as much as wilderness, I think it\u2019s a great teacher.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Dan Richards is author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/04/outpost-journey-wild-ends-earth-dan-richards-review\">Outpost</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/04/outpost-journey-wild-ends-earth-dan-richards-review\">: A Journey to the Wild Ends of the Earth</a> (Canongate, \u00a39.99)</em></p>",
  "<p>As the country debates how and when to get the economy up and running, it would be wrong to pretend that Britain can return to business as usual. As even the prime minister admitted, we will need to proceed with \u201cmaximum caution\u201d. That\u2019s why we are calling on government to guarantee that the right policies and practices are in place to make workplaces safe. This must be a central part of any return.</p> <p>A crucial first step is to ensure all employers carry out thorough assessments of risks and identify the actions they are taking to deal with them. We want those risk assessments published. This is vital for giving workers confidence that it is safe to return to work. But it\u2019s also a matter of national interest. One bad employer who plays fast and loose with safety not only puts those workers and their families in danger \u2013 they put public transport workers and whole communities at risk of infection too. What happens behind workplace doors must be consistent with the wider public health approach. If work cannot be done safely, it should not proceed.</p> <p>We cannot afford to cut any corners. The last few weeks have laid bare the terrible damage this virus can wreak.</p> <p>Our national death toll is now the highest in Europe. Many of our members have lost their lives transporting people and goods, protecting the public and caring for the vulnerable. Health and safety used to be mocked by the free marketeers and the role of union health and safety representatives undervalued. Now it and they must be an integral part of the fight against this pandemic.</p> <p>We know that most employers want to do the right thing. But for those who don\u2019t, and whose actions risk the health of their workforce and our economic recovery, there must be no hiding place.</p> <p>After years of cuts, the government must boost funding for pro-active monitoring and health and safety enforcement. And we need a public information campaign so rogue bosses face sanctions. The trade union movement wants to be able to recommend the government\u2019s back-to-work plans. But for us to do that we need to ensure that ministers have listened and that we stay safe and save lives at work too. <strong>Frances O\u2019Grady</strong>, TUC general secretary<strong>, Dave Prentis</strong>, Unison general secretary,<strong> Len McCluskey</strong>, Unite general secretary,<strong> John Phillips</strong>, GMB acting general secretary,<strong> Paddy Lillis</strong>, Usdaw general secretary<br></p> <h2>Don\u2019t experiment on us<br></h2> <p>I agree with Uisdean Robertson, the councillor for North Uist, and the Rev Drew Kuzma in arguing against ending the lockdown early in the Outer Hebrides (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/islanders-bristle-at-idea-of-being-used-as-uk-test-site-to-end-lockdown\" title=\"\">Islanders bristle at idea of being used as \u2018guinea pigs\u2019 for ending lockdown</a>\u201d, News).

The biggest hit to jobs was in the accommodation and food services industry, down 33.4% in the five-week period. Arts and recreation services were down 27%. Nearly a fifth of jobs held by people aged under 20 have vanished. Official job figures for April will be released on 14 May.</p> <p>About a quarter of all Australian workers are casuals, but it\u2019s uneven. The jobs with highest prevalence of casual employees are <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1718/CasualEmployeesAustralia\">hospitality workers (79%) and food preparation assistants (75%).</a></p> <p>Hutley says that while casual work suits some people such as students and gives flexibility to employers to scale their workforces up and down, employees had little real choice. These workers have been exposed as especially vulnerable to any shock in the economy. \u201cThere should be some way of protecting those workers and giving them greater power to be able to report people who are not doing the right thing without fear of losing their job,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Others are arguing that the crisis is an opportunity to open a broader and deeper debate, beyond what is an acceptable level of social security support.</p> <p>Tim Kennedy, the head of the 156,000-member United Workers Union, says despite Australia congratulating itself for 20 years of economic growth before the pandemic, \u201c<a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/4/united-workers-union-australia-labor-morrison\">the last few weeks show that a large proportion of Australians are on the bones of their arse.</a> It didn\u2019t take much to knock us down.\u201d</p> <p>The union, which represents workers in hospitality, hotels, casinos, warehouses and health, argues for a government \u201cjobs guarantee\u201d backed by a government subsidy, which would mean employers could not put off people during the crisis. It wants an \u201cemergency income guarantee\u201d for everyone else at the minimum wage of $740 a week.</p> <p>\u201cThe system is broken and it\u2019s not good enough to patch it up and sail on through,\u201d he told Jacobin recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these crises keep coming; after 2008\u20139, they said it was a once in 50-year thing. Ten years later, a pandemic knocked capitalism over very quickly. Just look at the way it is unfolding in the United States. And on top of it all, we\u2019ve got a climate crisis that keeps ratcheting up every year, which also threatens the system.\u201d</p> <p>An income guarantee such as this \u2013 whether temporary or not \u2013 comes close to the idea of a universal basic income (UBI), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/08/something-big-has-to-change-could-australia-afford-a-universal-basic-income\">increasingly debated</a> since the global financial crisis. The difference overall is that a UBI is paid to all without conditions, even to the wealthy (which is clawed back though taxes), whereas an income guarantee is paid to those without paid work.</p> <p>The idea is that the economic system now is incapable of providing all workers with a reasonably paid job. The shocks to come with technology replacing jobs, as well as the upheaval of climate change, will exacerbate structural weaknesses in the workplace.</p> <p>In Spain, with devastating numbers of coronavirus infections and deaths, the governing coalition of the Socialist party and the left movement Podemos has signalled <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/pascaledavies/2020/04/06/spain-aims-to-roll-out-universal-basic-income-to-fix-coronavirus-economic-crisis/#6483a4c74b35\">it will introduce some form of regular payments</a> for its poorest citizens.</p> <p>A guaranteed payment would address poverty better, the argument goes, compared with \u201ctargeted transfer\u201d as we have in Australia, particularly if it has a punitive underpinning.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-quiggin\">Professor John Quiggin</a>, an economist from the University of Queensland, advocates some form of income guarantee for those not in the workforce.

  "<p>Even at the time \u2013 in 2017 \u2013 the fee Paris Saint-Germain paid Barcelona for Neymar was extraordinary: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/02/neymar-psg-barcelona-tells-team-mates-leave\">\u00a3198m was 125% more than the previous record</a>, set a year earlier when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/09/manchester-united-sign-paul-pogba-93-million-juventus\">Manchester United had signed Paul Pogba</a> from Juventus.

The indications are that FFP will be relaxed for a year or two so as not to penalise clubs who have suddenly, and through no fault of their own, found their revenue streams blocked, but there appears little desire to return to a free-for-all of spending.</p> <p>Before Neymar, the transfer record had more than doubled only twice. In 1903, Small Heath (now Birmingham ) splurged \u00a3500 on the Barnsley inside-forward Benny Green, quintupling a decade-old record that had stood since Aston Villa had broken the three-figure barrier to acquire the Scottish forward Willie Groves from West Bromwich. In 1932, River Plate signed the barrel-chested centre-forward Bernab\u00e9 Ferreyra from Tigre for \u00a323,000, obliterating the mark set four years earlier when Arsenal had bought the inside-forward David Jack from Bolton for \u00a310,890 and taking the record outside of Britain for the first time. Green\u2019s record stood for barely nine months but Ferreyra was the most expensive player in the world for 17 years.

He was an enormous success, famed for a ferocious shot that brought him an average of a goal a game for eight seasons. Ferreyra\u2019s popularity effectively funded the construction of El Monumental, but as the global downturn struck, particularly in the industrial areas where football had previously thrived, no other club came close to matching the fee.</p> <p>It was only with the surge in attendances in the UK after the second world war and then investment in Italian clubs by local industrialists that the record was challenged again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/apr/18/johnny-morris-obituary\">The inside-forward Johnny Morris</a>, having fallen out with Matt Busby, was sold by Manchester United to Derby for \u00a324,000 in 1949 and the record fell a further four times in the following three years.</p> <p>The Ferreyra and Neymar situations are analogous in as much as River and PSG made their signings aware the deal would project an image of wealth and power. In both cases, the player was sufficiently celebrated to justify the expenditure even as the cliff edge suddenly appeared. But what now for clubs, what now for transfers, during the crisis? \u201cIt feels somewhat inappropriate to see speculation about transfers for hundreds of millions in current circumstances,\u201d Manchester United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, said this past week. \u201cThere\u2019s a big disconnect between those stories and the economic realities facing football clubs in general.\u201d</p> <p>Revenues will fall. There will be a period of, probably, several months when games are played without full stadiums. United\u2019s match-day revenue last season was \u00a3110m; that cannot easily be replaced. A major recession seems all but certain. Sponsorship, advertising and commercial income will all drop. There will be a fall in subscriptions to television channels which, along with reduced advertising, will diminish broadcast deals. Nobody knows how travel may continue to be affected, reducing the viability of international tournaments and foreign tours. This is the biggest financial hit facing the game since the 30s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/02/premier-league-critics-should-recognise-football-cannot-wait-for-ever\">Premier League critics should recognise football cannot wait for ever | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the word Woodward used seemed apposite \u2013 \u201cinappropriate\u201d.

Initially set to take place in four local authorities, the trial will be extended to \u201cevery region in the country who wants them in a bid to get e-scooter rental schemes up and running in cities as fast as possible\u201d.</p> \n<p>Electric scooters \u2013 which can travel at up to 15.5mph \u2013 are banned currently on roads and pavements in the UK. The government launched a consultation about legalising e-scooters in March and would need to pass secondary legislation to legalise their use.</p> \n<p>Shapps also announced \u00a310m in additional support for car-charging points on the streets, in light of the growing popularity of electric vehicles and in an effort to \u201ckeep this quiet, clean car revolution going\u201d.</p> \n<p>While an extra \u00a3250m has been mooted to get more people cycling and walking, campaigners say it is a drop in the ocean in terms of the amount of funding needed to effect real change.</p> \n<p>In Manchester, creating the Bee Network, a Dutch-style 1,000-mile network of walking and biking, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2019/jun/24/what-14bn-buys-1800-miles-of-cycle-lanes-or-one-big-roundabout?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">will cost an estimated \u00a31.5bn</a>, according to Chris Boardman, the Olympic champion turned walking and cycling commissioner.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here to give it to you straight.

But he added: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a cyclist to benefit from society as a whole switching to cycling and walking.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said research showed half of journeys outside London are three miles or less. If only 5% of people started cycling to work, it would mean 9m fewer car journeys, 8m fewer rail journeys and 13m fewer bus journeys.</p>",

Some of those queueing had been waiting since 5am.</p> <h2>Thousands of nightclubs and other venues shut in South Korea</h2> <p>South Korea\u2019s capital, Seoul, has shut thousands of nightclubs, hostess bars and discos after a cluster of Covid-19 infections were linked to clubbers who went out last weekend after the country relaxed social distancing rules. More than 2,100 venues have been ordered to close in measures imposed today by Seoul\u2019s mayor, Park Won-soon, according to the Associated Press.</p> <h2><strong>UK death toll rises </strong><strong>by 346 as coastguard warns people </strong><strong>ignoring lockdown</strong></h2> <p>The UK death toll has risen by 346 to 31,587 across all settings, while 215,260 have tested positive, an increase of 3,896 cases on Friday.

  "<p>All of a sudden, and after years of bluffing, conservatives are warning of the dangers of jumping to hasty conclusions. Before I go any further, I must therefore say our newly scrupulous masters have a point. The league tables of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">national Covid-19 death figures</a> are not the last word on the crisis, and may look different in a few weeks. That\u2019s that done, then. Everybody happy? Good. Let\u2019s get on with it.</p> <p>In the world as it is, rather than as it may be, a shameful fact is undeniable. The highest Covid-19 casualties are in the US and the UK, where the mendacities of the populist right have deformed society. It turns out that being governed by Anglo-Saxon conservatives is a threat to the health of nations. Their rule kills the old and blights the futures of the young. To understand their ineptitude, think of how conservatism turned into a know-nothing culture in the past decade, and ask what Donald Trump and Boris Johnson would be doing in an alternative universe where they never came close to power.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The alt-right sees itself as sceptical and independent, even if its supporters are as predictable as speaking clocks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I don\u2019t think you need a wild imagination to find the answer. Trump would be propagating corona conspiracy theories about 5G and Bill Gates as enthusiastically as <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/09/michelle-obama-ill-never-forgive-trump-for-birther-conspiracy-theory.html\">he endorsed the straight lie</a> that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and ineligible to serve as US president. Johnson would have been egging on his colleagues at the <em>Telegraph</em> as they insisted last week the lockdown was a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/briton-nervous-nelly-europe-need-deal-coronaphobia-fast/\">pant-wetting</a>\u201d response to the virus from a government of \u201cnervous nellies\u201d. When it was Johnson\u2019s turn to offer his two pennies\u2019 worth, he would repeat the Brexit right\u2019s party line that the government had \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/07/despite-ferguson-fiasco-no-10-make-second-major-blunder/\">petrified the public</a>\u201d to the point where it was overwhelmingly against lifting the lockdown and going back to work as it jolly well should. My guess is he would remind readers, for they are never allowed to forget, that he managed a second-class classics degree from Oxford sometime in the 1980s by deadlifting a Latin phrase and announcing \u201c<em>aegrescit medendo</em>\u201d \u2013 the cure is worse than the disease. For that is what the world that provided his most loyal support <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/04/21/against-should-lift-lockdown-save-economy/\">believes</a>. </p> <p>The British new right, \u201calt-right\u201d, populist right, call it what you will, sees itself as sceptical and independent, even if its supporters\u2019 reactions to all events are as predictable as speaking clocks. Class plays its part, as it always does in England. We are witnessing the Oxbridge arts graduate\u2019s fear of expertise, particularly the expertise of scientists who cannot cut a good figure or turn a catchy phrase. In Johnson\u2019s days at Oxford, they were dismissed as \u201cnorthern chemists\u201d \u2013 chemist being a catch-all term covering everyone studying subjects the suave could not understand. Northern chemists drank beer, went to comprehensives and were boring as hell. By what right do these nobodies now tell us what we can and cannot do?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Everybody is noticing that the state doesn\u2019t have a grip on the crisis</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For all the unearned superiority of the Brit right, its differences with the US are more of tone than substance. Its American cousins embrace paranoid conspiracism. The Trump administration is now asserting that the virus was <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/06/asia/coronavirus-china-wuhan-lab-origins-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html\">developed in a Chinese lab</a> \u2013 as if there were not enough valid reasons to condemn what the Chinese Communist party has done. The worst of the British right marches down the same road. It turned Neil Ferguson\u2019s liaison with his lover from a personal failing to abide by his own guidelines into evidence of a leftwing plot. Writing in the <em>Critic</em>, Toby Young, Johnson\u2019s friend and I would say his greatest admirer on Fleet Street, said that, because the lover had campaigned for leftish causes, he was \u201c<a href=\"https://thecritic.co.uk/the-fatal-hubris-of-professor-lockdown/\">99% sure</a>\u201d that the majority of scientific advisers everywhere in the world were leftists with an ideology that was pushing governments into panic measures. Confronted with an emergency they do not understand, modern rightwingers reduce complexity to culture war, and dismiss advice they cannot take with the only reason their limited minds can comprehend: the political bias of the \u201cliberal elite\u201d.</p> <p>It has worked for them until now. Blaming the libs has taken them to power. In theory, today\u2019s crisis ought to suit them, as it has shown the centrality of the nation state. The nationalist right might hope that, along with global supply chains disappearing as countries \u201creshore\u201d vital industries, multilateral agreements on climate, justice and human rights will vanish. In the world of Trump and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\">Xi Jinping</a>, they did not seem to have much of a chance anyway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd50c85e95825a1e25393f6bb456700bc0e77189\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd50c85e95825a1e25393f6bb456700bc0e77189/279_648_5107_3064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hundreds protest in a crowded \u2018reopen Pennsylvania\u2019 demonstration in April\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds protest in a \u2018reopen Pennsylvania\u2019 demonstration on 20 April 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet nationalists in power cannot cry \u201cAmerica first\u201d or Britannia Unchained as they turn their nation states into failing states. Most people are not \u201cpetrified\u201d because the government has scared them to death but because they see the fatal mess conservatives are making of managing the crisis. I accept that there is a danger on the left of robotically damning everything Tories do, and that if Rishi Sunak had been a Labour rather than a Conservative chancellor, his bold rescue package would have had him cheered at the Durham Miners\u2019 Gala. But come now. The ever-expanding list of fiascos, from failing to lock down early enough, to failing to provide adequate protective equipment. The trickery in pretending that the government was committed to providing 100,000 tests a day when it turned out to be 100,000 tests for just one day. The chaos of an administration that briefs that it will be allowing picnics in parks one minute and denies it the next. Everybody is noticing that the state doesn\u2019t have a grip on the crisis.</p> <p>As faith melts away, people will be less inclined to believe ministers when they say it is safe to end lockdown, and less inclined to trust the government\u2019s tracking apps. And however much unjustifiable cynicism there is about government, there are good reasons not to trust modern rightwing leaders. As the words of their loudest supporters show, they come from a culture that despises the actions we need to take to protect ourselves. That culture was guaranteed to fail when strong government was needed, and is, as a matter of shameful fact, demonstrably failing today.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

People arriving in the UK would have to self-isolate at a private residence, potentially having to provide an address at the border. The new restriction is expected to take effect at the end of this month. </p> \n  <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been asking ministers to clarify for weeks now.

However, there are well over 50,000 primary, social care and community care providers across Britain. Liz Jones, policy director at the National Care Forum, said: \u201cThe issue is when it can be ramped up both in terms of the people registered to use it, and ordering the quantities they actually need.

She grew up in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jan/16/theairlineindustry.transportintheuk\" title=\"\">Sipson</a>, a village that can trace its history back more than 1,000 years, but now sits immediately north of Britain\u2019s busiest airline hub.</p> <p>Now living a mile to the east in Harlington, Taylor, 62, is experiencing a rare moment of quiet, thanks to the dramatic reduction in air traffic caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIt struck me during the period with the volcano that I had never experienced a life without planes,\u201d Taylor says, referring to the ash cloud caused by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/25/air-traffic-volcanic-ash-cloud\" title=\"\">2010 eruption of volcano Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull</a> in Iceland, which grounded aircraft over much of Europe for nearly a week. \u201cNow this prolonged period has really been life-changing. I\u2019m not sure how many of us want to go back to the old normal.\u201d</p> <p>For decades, Taylor and other locals have been fighting Heathrow\u2019s plans for a third runway. The pandemic has added another question mark to those ambitions \u2013 a reality acknowledged by the airport last week. Heathrow\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, told MPs that it could be up to 15 years until the UK needed a third runway at its largest airport.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a5abc3561815f7de56924f3f7607197796c4d03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a5abc3561815f7de56924f3f7607197796c4d03/0_6_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A British Airways 747 flying low over houses near  Heathrow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A British Airways 747 landing at Heathrow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn 10 to 15 years, if we are successful in rebooting the UK economy and getting back to full swing, I think we will still need a third runway,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Holland-Kaye was asked whether the coronavirus crisis had blown a \u201cmassive hole\u201d in the economic argument for the third runway, but he insisted the airport\u2019s expansion remained a \u201ccritical economic plank for the growth of the country\u201d.</p> <p>Both Heathrow and Britain\u2019s second-largest airport, Gatwick \u2013 some 30 miles south of London \u2013 have been hoping for years to increase capacity. The pandemic has undoubtedly blown a hole in the short-term business case for those plans, and indeed for any airport expansion in the UK, with air travel not expected to recover to 2019 levels for several years. Will financial backers support multibillion-pound projects based on demand shrouded in uncertainty?</p> <p>Until the pandemic hit, it was environmental rather than economic factors that were seen as the greatest obstacle to airport expansion plans. Nonetheless, Heathrow believes the case for expansion remains strong, and last week had an opportunity to remake its argument. Last Thursday the supreme court gave it permission to appeal against a ruling earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/27/heathrow-third-runway-ruled-illegal-over-climate-change\" title=\"\">that its third runway plan was illegal</a> because ministers who approved it had not taken into account airlines\u2019 impact on the climate crisis.</p> <p>The government decided not to appeal against the initial verdict, but Heathrow is ploughing on, insisting that the privately funded project would see billions pumped into the UK\u2019s economy, \u201cstimulating sectors across the country and creating tens of thousands of new jobs\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Heathrow, which is owned by a consortium including Spanish group Ferrovial and Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, added: \u201cOnce the benefits of air travel and connectivity have been restored in years to come, an expanded Heathrow will be required.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e02cc952b841d3c64f1a70887df87f69d8d8397f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e02cc952b841d3c64f1a70887df87f69d8d8397f/0_206_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty Terminal 5 at Heathrow this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty Terminal 5 at Heathrow this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even when commercial air travel attempts a concerted recovery, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/physical-distancing-will-end-era-of-cheap-air-travel-industry-warns\" title=\"\">probably with social distancing measures on board</a>, passengers are not expected to immediately revert to their pre-coronavirus travel habits.

The slump in passenger demand is forecast to last several years by British Airways\u2019 owner, International Airlines Group (IAG). As Heathrow\u2019s biggest customer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/british-airways-owner-reports-big-loss-coronavirus\" title=\"\">it does not foresee see a return to 2019 levels until 2023</a>.</p> <p>This slowdown has also cast doubt on Gatwick airport\u2019s plans to develop its emergency runway for regular use, almost five years after it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/01/heathrow-third-runway-recommended-in-davies-report-on-airport-capacity\" title=\"\">lost out to Heathrow</a> in a tussle over increasing UK air capacity.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s second-biggest airport is facing the loss of two important customers, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/virgin-atlantic-to-close-gatwick-operations-and-lose-3000-workers\" title=\"\">Virgin Atlantic announced its departure</a> just days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/british-airways-to-cut-gatwick-operation-and-lay-off-1130-pilots\" title=\"\">BA threatened to walk away</a>.

As with Heathrow, there is debate over whether Gatwick will need the extra capacity given the industry\u2019s uncertain future.</p> <p>Gatwick\u2019s chief executive, Stewart Wingate, says he remains \u201cvery optimistic about the long-term prospects of the airport\u201d, despite the significant impact of the pandemic on the business and the local economy.</p> <p>The airport has delayed by a year its planned consultation with the local community over expansion plans, but insists this will proceed in 2021.</p> <p>\u201cThe project is entirely consistent with government policy to make best use of existing runways, and we know the scheme enables modest growth, improved resilience and significant economic benefits while having little overall environmental impact compared with alternative projects,\u201d says Wingate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/heathrow-zip/giv-39028qD1kSArI9gF/\" data-alt=\"Heathrow expansion plans\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/heathrow-zip/giv-39028qD1kSArI9gF/\">Heathrow expansion plans</a> </figure>  <p>The impact of the aviation slowdown won\u2019t be limited to the airport. The neighbouring West Sussex town of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/crawley-worst-uk-coronavirus-job-losses-aviation\" title=\"\">Crawley is likely to be the place hardest hit</a> by the economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis, according to a report from the Centre for Cities thinktank. The town relies mainly on the aviation and aircraft manufacturing industries for jobs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s devastating when people lose their jobs,\u201d says Sally Pavey, chair of Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emission (Cagne), which campaigns against the airport\u2019s expansion plans and the effect of aircraft emissions on the surrounding area. The group doesn\u2019t see demand returning to Gatwick, where leisure travel accounts for eight out of 10 passengers, for several years.</p> <p>\u201cGatwick has always been reliant on the extra money in a member of the public\u2019s pocket to spend on a low-cost holiday. If flights are no longer low-cost and people don\u2019t have surplus money, Gatwick will be the weakest one. Every time slots become available at Heathrow, the airlines leave Gatwick.\u201d</p> <p>With its flight schedule reduced during the pandemic, Heathrow has closed one runway and is using the other for both takeoffs and landings.</p> <p>Campaigners such as Robert Barnstone, campaign coordinator at the No Third Runway Coalition are worried that Heathrow might seek to continue this \u201cmixed-mode\u201d operating model as a future \u201cconsolation prize\u201d if the airport fails in its quest to build a third runway. Under current rules, one Heathrow runway must be used for landings only, while the other is only for take-offs. Allowing both to handle a mix of take-offs and landings would mean the airport could add 60,000 flights year.</p> <p>As campaigners prepare for the expansion appeal to be heard by the supreme court, Barnstone adds: \u201cWe need to make sure we stop expansion by the front door. We also need to stop it by the back door, through the idea of increasing flight capacity under mixed-mode operations.\u201d</p> <p>Even as the economic case against ending \u2013 or pausing \u2013 expansion grows, the UK\u2019s biggest airports are determined that, at the very least, this debate will survive the pandemic.</p>",
  "<p>In early April, one bullish American consultant suggested on Twitter that if people didn\u2019t emerge from coronavirus quarantine having learned a new skill, gained more knowledge or having started something they\u2019d been putting off, then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheJeremyHaynes/status/1245767684484202496\">\u201cyou didn\u2019t ever lack the time, you lacked the discipline\u201d</a>.</p> <p>As the tweet was widely shared, it met mockery and anger in equal measure, as people noted that home schooling, financial worries, stress and/or illness are making this period anything but a delightful self-improvement holiday.</p> <p>Getting through it is achievement enough.

  "<p>The annual Met Gala would have taken place in New York last week, had it not been postponed indefinitely in March owing to the pandemic. The theme would have been About Time: Fashion and Duration, or \u201ctime itself\u201d, according to Andrew Bolton, the curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s partner exhibition, which is ironic now that a morning can feel like a month, and a week can feel like a minute.</p> <p>Ordinarily, it is one of my favourite celebrity bashes, sitting happily in the middle of a ridiculous/gorgeous Venn diagram, showing off high fashion so high that the people who point at Picassos and say \u201cmy five-year-old could have done that\u201d will inevitably comment that \u201cyou couldn\u2019t wear that down the shops\u201d, as if the point of a ballgown in the <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/fashion/katy-perry-met-gala-2019-chandelier-a4135421.html\">shape of a chandelier</a> were to make the trip to Tesco a bit more lively. (Having said that, you could definitely have used it to carry a few extra bags home.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"969f5268830d1c387cd08e3ae63dd9c6f9f34eb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/969f5268830d1c387cd08e3ae63dd9c6f9f34eb3/0_0_1080_1350/800.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Roberts poses over a full bubble bath\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Here\u2019s me...not going to the Met Ball tonight. #stayhome #yesyoustillhavetostayhome\u2019: Julia Roberts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/ @juliaroberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the run-up to this year\u2019s postponed non-event, Billy Porter, the man responsible for every key red-carpet talking point from the past two years, challenged <em>Vogue</em> readers <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/article/billy-porter-instagram-challenge\">to recreate the most famous Met Gala looks at home</a>. \u201cIt can be Rihanna, it can be Gaga, it can be... me,\u201d he said. Given that <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/billy-porter-met-gala-2019-the-blonds\">Porter entered the 2019 Met Gala</a> on a bed carried by six shirtless men, before showing off a pair of enormous golden wings, you <em>could</em> be him, but it would take a bit more than a creative way with some sticky back plastic and a few loo roll tubes.</p> <p>Still, it is a testament to the imagination that lockdown seems to have unleashed that people tried it, and essentially succeeded. They certainly did far better than me on a \u201cdress like a Simpsons character\u201d round during a Zoom pub quiz recently. All I can say is that a swimming cap was ruined.</p> <p>On the night the Met Gala was supposed to happen, Anna Wintour hosted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HptQEYkMrVQ\">a YouTube livestream</a>. Florence Welch performed in front of some frankly covetable wallpaper. Potential guests posted their looks on Instagram. Katy Perry, of the chandelier dress fame, showed a Gaultier baby bump, in the style of the Madonna cone bra, with the caption \u201cwhat would have been\u201d. Amanda Seyfried posted her look while posing with a chicken, next to a chicken coop. My favourite was Julia Roberts, who posed precariously in a black and white gown over a full bubble bath, holding what appears to be a cup of tea, which is surely a night in barely bothering to masquerade as the desire for a night out. It felt perfectly appropriate.</p> <h2>Daniel Radcliffe, just as much a wizard as he always was</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2407f503febebcb2c5cdbce9f859b17a9bde201\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2407f503febebcb2c5cdbce9f859b17a9bde201/0_151_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Radcliffe: kicked off the Harry Potter reading.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Infantes/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Tuesday, Harry Potter fans were surprised at the news that \u201camazing friends of the Wizarding World\u201d would be taking it in turns <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1xuYUY0dY\">to read a chapter </a>of the first book in the series, <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone</em>.</p> <p>Stephen Fry, Eddie Redmayne and Noma Dumezweni all appeared in the announcement, but there was only one candidate to read the opening chapter, and it had to be Daniel Radcliffe, although this did offer the slightly unsettling spectacle of Harry Potter at 30, reading a book about Harry Potter at 11, as if he didn\u2019t know anything about it. Perhaps it was best not to overthink it.</p> <p>In another wonderful moment for fans of children\u2019s literature, Andy Serkis conducted a live reading of <em>The Hobbit</em> on Friday from start to finish, <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/thehobbitathoncovid19appeal\">to raise money</a> for the charities NHS Charities Together and Best Beginnings.</p> <p>I had been sceptical of audiobooks as an adult. I saw them as the stern-faced old-fashioned ancestor of that bright young upstart the podcast. But in lockdown I\u2019ve been devouring them. I stare out of the window with my headphones on, marvelling at how experts can consider the increase in road usage to be \u201cslightly worrying\u201d when the road I look out on to has been back to pre-lockdown traffic levels for two weeks now.</p> <p>Still, the stories can be soothing. Fiction read aloud has an effect that podcasts can\u2019t always muster. It encourages a necessary depth of escapism, whether that\u2019s Harry Potter or, in my case, <em>The Testaments</em>. And you know things are bad when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/10/the-testaments-by-margaret-atwood-review\">that</a>\u2019s what you choose to listen to in order to switch off.</p> <h2>Charlie Brooker, please carry on predicting the future</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee92f26e18a9ec04a77aea1b9dc652ba915ad0bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee92f26e18a9ec04a77aea1b9dc652ba915ad0bf/0_203_4191_2515/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Brooker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Brooker: apocalypse no.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Holyoak/BBC/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2018At the moment, I don\u2019t know what stomach there would be for stories about societies falling apart, so I\u2019m not working away on one of those,\u201d Charlie Brooker <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2020-05-04/black-mirror-6-update/\">told</a> the <em>Radio Times</em> last week, when asked about the possibility of a sixth season of <em>Black Mirror</em>.</p> <p>Brooker may not have the appetite for apocalypse writing, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s right about viewers. As much as I can pass an evening at home crying along to Paul O\u2019Grady\u2019s <em>For the Love of Dogs</em>, there has been a huge appetite for watching or rewatching films such as <em>Outbreak</em> and <em>Contagion</em>, which are either funhouse mirrors or opportunities for the ultimate immersive viewing experience. BYO hazmat suit, although maybe mute the sound during the \u201cdon\u2019t talk to anyone, don\u2019t touch anyone, stay away from other people\u201d bit.</p> <p>Given that <em>Black Mirror</em> appears to have got ahead of several global events before they came to fruition, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2015/sep/21/pigs-prime-minister-black-mirror-ashcroft-allegation-charlie-brooker\">pig\u2019s head political scandal</a> to the election of a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/black-mirrors-charlie-brooker-predicting-donald-trump-love-story/\">racist cartoon character</a>, then perhaps Brooker could write an episode where hardworking scientists quickly and efficiently come up with an immediate vaccine for a deadly virus.

  "<p>Organised crime groups are taking increasingly audacious risks as they attempt to smuggle large quantities of drugs into lockdown Britain, senior police figures say.</p> <p>Analysing the latest operations of transnational criminal networks, the National Crime Agency\u2019s head of drug threat said that police were making more significant seizures during the pandemic than normal.</p> <p>Lawrence Gibbons said that with restrictions on movement, the absence of flights and with only essential travel advised on many routes such as Eurotunnel, international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/11/police-cuts-organised-crime-national-crime-agency\">drug dealers</a> were being forced to make high-stakes decisions.</p> <p>\u201cLockdown restrictions mean they are having difficulty moving drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause there is less opportunity they are taking more risks by moving drugs in bulk.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a drug dealer [in Belgium or the Netherlands] and you\u2019re trying to get your 100kg of cocaine into Britain, you would often split that into four lots of 25kg. If one gets stopped, three get through. But because of the lack of opportunity they\u2019re either sending two lots of 50 or 100 in one go, which they wouldn\u2019t normally do. We\u2019ve had some massive seizures.\u201d</p> <p>At street level, drugs are also being moved around in larger quantities. NCA intelligence reveals dealers are less likely to offer sales of, for instance, single rocks of crack cocaine and instead are offering bulk deals to limit interaction with users.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/07/drug-dealers-posing-joggers-nhs-staff-covid-19-lockdown\">Disguise</a>, said Gibbons, had also become an established tactic for street dealers. \u201cMany disguise themselves as key workers \u2013 some as couriers with yellow high-vis slips to look as though they are making official deliveries [medical supplies].</p> <p>\u201cOthers have changed their timings so they only work certain times of the day or night, rather than a 24/7 service.\u201d he added.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Since the lockdown, the market has been relatively stable, with small price increases across all substances</p> <footer> <cite>Niamh Eastwood, Release</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although global drug production in countries such as Colombia and Afghanistan, where heroin is produced, has remained largely unaffected by the pandemic, localised shortages in the UK have seen the price of heroin double in some places.</p> <p>However, the drugs charity <a href=\"https://www.release.org.uk/\">Release</a> has called for UK police to suspend its dismantling of drug syndicates and \u201cde-prioritise drugs\u201d, both for users and suppliers, warning that it could disrupt the availability of illicit substances and push addicts to try more harmful alternatives.</p> <p>Its monitoring of the UK drugs trade since the lockdown had, though, indicated the market was durable. \u201cSince the lockdown, the market has been relatively stable, with small price increases across all substances, and reports of purity declining, especially for heroin and crack cocaine,\u201d said Niamh Eastwood, a Release spokesperson.</p> <p>Steve Rolles, senior policy analyst at charity <a href=\"https://transformdrugs.org/\">Transform</a>, said that most initial research into the impact of the lockdown on the drugs trade had confounded expert predictions. \u201cDrug markets have been a lot more resilient than most people expected in terms of supply,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Among recent seizures involving the NCA was the recent dismantling of an international drug-smuggling ring in Galicia, north-west Spain. In total four tonnes of cocaine were seized along with a small flotilla of \u201cboats and speedboats\u201d used for transporting the drugs. Twenty-eight people were arrested.</p> <p>Last Tuesday UK Border Force officers intercepted a van in northern France claiming to be carrying medical supplies to a UK hospital but found to be also transporting 285kg of cocaine worth more than \u00a325m at street prices.</p> <p>Days earlier a lorry <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/260-kilos-of-cocaine-seized-by-border-force-at-coquelles\">holding 260kg of cocaine</a> was stopped by UK officials at the French entrance to the Eurotunnel.</p> <p>Yet police believe organised criminals are mostly targeting UK container ports, using a practice Gibbons called \u201c<a href=\"http://commodityconversations.com/wordpress2/2019/04/29/rip-on-rip-off/\">rip on, rip off</a>\u201d where drugs are stashed in legitimate shipping containers and are then retrieved, often using corrupt port officials. Last Tuesday NCA investigators were alerted to a suspicious break-in at a vast container terminal in Tilbury, east London. <a href=\"https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/two-charged-after-1m-cocaine-recovered-from-port\">Two Albanian nationals were arrested</a> after allegedly trying to retrieve around 16kg of cocaine from a refrigerated container which had arrived from Belize on 1 May.</p>",

She\u2019s broken a dizzying number of world records and been named one of the most 100 influential people in the world by Time. She\u2019s first-name-only levels of famous and a British cultural icon.

Right on cue, Jameela Jamil, who never misses an opportunity to opine on body image issues, strode into the debate. \u201cAdele would hate this so much,\u201d the actor and activist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameelajamil/status/1258504640829681666?s=20\">tweeted</a> on Thursday, with a photo montage of Skinny Adele memes. \u201cI\u2019m so glad she isn\u2019t [on Twitter] to see people weaponize her body against women. These memes are everywhere. This is so offensive. So destructive. So reductive. It encourages us to demonize and become afraid of food.\u201d</p> <p>Those are all good points. Nevertheless, one does have to wonder exactly how helpful it is for Jamil to have shared the memes with her 1.1 million followers.</p> <p>You\u2019d think that during a once-in-a-century pandemic that is devastating the world we\u2019d all have gained a little perspective. You\u2019d think that we might have lost interest in how much a celebrity weighs. Alas, policing female bodies and appetites is a timeless trend. We\u2019ve been doing it since Eve was shamed for gluttonously eating that apple and, no doubt, we\u2019ll be doing it until we get hit by an asteroid or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/pentagon-releases-three-ufo-videos-taken-by-us-navy-pilots\">aliens arrive</a> to put us all out of our misery. Despite all the progress there has been around gender equality much of the world is still more interested in what goes into a woman\u2019s mouth than what comes out of it.</p> <h2>Jacob Wohl is at the centre of yet another fake sexual assault allegation</h2> <p>The pro-Trump smear artist reportedly <a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/05/07/she-said-anthony-fauci-sexually-assaulted-her-now-she-says-jacob-wohl-and-jack-burkman-paid-her-to-lie/\">paid</a> a woman called Diana Andrade to pretend that Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had sexually assaulted her. Andrade initially went through with the plan but then had second thoughts and blew the whistle. Wohl, and his equally odious sidekick Jack Burkman, have a history of trying to (very badly) fabricate sexual harassment allegations against the likes of Robert Mueller, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren. Last year he claimed that Warren had paid for an S&amp;M relationship with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/05/go-cougars-elizabeth-warren-gave-the-classiest-response-to-a-rightwing-trolls-lie\">twentysomething marine.</a> Wohl is a complete joke but his antics do a lot of damage to the credibility of sexual assault survivors.</p> <h2>Betsy DeVos revises campus sexual assault legislation</h2> <p>The US education secretary (and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/26/betsy-devos-yacht-vandalism-protest\">owner of multiple yachts</a>) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/betsy-devos-sexual-assault-title-ix-rules\">has issued new rules on sexual assault in schools and colleges</a>; equal rights groups argue these revisions \u201ctip the scales in favor\u201d of abusers and reduce the rights of survivors. The new regulations are expected to be challenged in court.</p> <h2>Love in the time of corona</h2> <p>That headline has already been used approximately 10 billion times so far in articles about romance during the coronavirus crisis.

I\u2019m sure Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez would be very proud.</p> <h2>Tara Reade calls on Joe Biden to drop out</h2> <p>Reade, who has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993, called on the presumptive Democratic nominee to drop out of the presidential race <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/tara-reade-megyn-kelly-interview-joe-biden-drop-out\">during an on-camera interview with Megyn Kelly</a>. Reade also says she is prepared to take a polygraph test if Biden also takes one. (There\u2019s a huge amount of controversy around the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45736631\">credibility of the polygraph</a>, so I\u2019m not sure that would really help anything.)</p> <h2>Women are being \u2018tossed to the wind\u2019 in birth control case</h2> <p>The US supreme court has been <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-oral-arguments-employer-birth-control/\">hearing arguments</a> on whether the Trump administration can make it easier for employers to stop providing free birth control coverage in their insurance plans for religious or moral reasons. <a href=\"https://qz.com/1852501/rbg-says-women-tossed-to-the-wind-in-scotus-birth-control-case/\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg has said</a> that the government is attempting to \u201cto toss to the wind entirely Congress\u2019s instruction that women need and shall have seamless no-cost coverage\u201d.</p> <h2>Men and women disagree about how much time they spend on chores</h2> <p>Nearly half of men say they do most of the home schooling during lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/upshot/pandemic-chores-homeschooling-gender.html\">according to a poll by the New York Times</a>. Weirdly, only 3% of women agree their spouse is doing more.</p> <h2>The women battling to free Myanmar from meth</h2> <p>Mostly in their 40s and 50s, a group of vigilante women are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/07/theyre-fearless-the-women-battling-to-free-myanmar-from-meth\">apprehending drug traffickers in the jungle</a>.</p> <h2>Gendered lockdown fueling hate crime in Bogot\u00e1</h2> <p>There have been at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/08/separation-by-sex-gendered-lockdown-fuelling-hate-on-streets-of-bogota\">20 violent incidents</a> against trans people in supermarkets during lockdown since Colombia started a policy in which men and women are allowed out of quarantine on separate days.</p> <h2>107-year-old artist survives Covid-19</h2> <p>Marilee Shapiro Asher also <a href=\"https://www.jta.org/2020/05/06/united-states/she-survived-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-and-covid-19-what-is-marilee-shapiro-ashers-secret\">beat the 1918 Spanish flu when she was six</a>.

  "<p>Barack Obama has reportedly said the \u201crule of law is at risk\u201d in the US, after the justice department <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/michael-flynn-criminal-case-trump-russia\">said it would drop its case</a> against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/trump-attorney-general-william-barr-flynn-case\">For Trump, l'etat, c'est moi.

That\u2019s the kind of stuff where you begin to get worried that basic \u2013 not just institutional norms \u2013 but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk.</p> <p>\u201cAnd when you start moving in those directions, it can accelerate pretty quickly as we\u2019ve seen in other places.\u201d</p> <p>The president has repeatedly blamed Obama for the FBI investigation into Russian election interference which expanded to include links between his campaign and Moscow. Last week, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/04/don-lemon-trump-cnn-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories\">retweeted a conspiracy theorist</a> who claimed Obama directed the investigation.</p> <p>On Thursday Trump said at the White House: \u201cWhat they did, what the Obama administration did, is unprecedented \u2026 and I hope a lot of people will pay a big price because they are dishonest, crooked people. They are scum, human scum.\u201d</p> <p>The president added: \u201c[Flynn] was targeted by the Obama administration, and he was targeted in order to try to take down a president.\u201d</p> <p>After nearly two years of work, special counsel Robert Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy but did detail extensive links between Trump aides and Russians and numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president.</p> <p>Trump claims exoneration by Mueller. Mueller said he was not exonerating Trump.</p> <p>Flynn\u2019s guilty plea to lying to the FBI was one of Mueller\u2019s biggest coups. In 2017 Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937007006526959618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E937007006526959618&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fmay%2F07%2Fmichael-flynn-criminal-case-trump-russia\">acknowledged</a> it, writing on Twitter: \u201cI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice-President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\u201d</p> <p>According to Yahoo News, Obama told the web call the case made him feel a \u201csense of urgency\u201d about November\u2019s election, in which Trump is set to face Joe Biden, Obama\u2019s vice-president.</p> <p>\u201cWhenever I campaign,\u201d Obama reportedly said, \u201cI\u2019ve always said, \u2018Ah, this is the most important election.\u2019 Especially obviously when I was on the ballot, that always feels like it\u2019s the most important election. This one, I\u2019m not on the ballot but I am pretty darn invested. We got to make this happen.\u201d</p> <p>Obama reportedly said the election would be about fighting \u201clong-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy [have] become a stronger impulse in American life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason,\u201d he reportedly said, \u201cwhy the response to this global crisis [the coronavirus outbreak] has been so anaemic and spotty.

The top four from each of the 20-team groups of Spain\u2019s Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B will be involved, competing for four places in the second tier \u2013 if, that is, the ministry of health allows it, which is far from certain. For everyone else, the other 64 teams in Segunda B, it\u2019s over. That includes I\u2019Anson\u2019s Rayo Majadahonda, joint fifth, any shot at promotion now denied.</p> <p>His contract terminated, without a team, all he can do is wait for next season \u2013 whenever that is.

People feel better that there\u2019s a decision, even though it hurts. At least your mind\u2019s at rest. The decision\u2019s been made now and we have to put up with it, but it\u2019s crazy. It doesn\u2019t make sense.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not just saying this because we\u2019re so close to that fourth position and it\u2019s unfair on us \u2013 we weren\u2019t good enough \u2013 but because there are loads of teams that thought they still had a chance. Teams in eighth, ninth, 10th. Or look at Lleida, four points off the actual top, having played all the hardest teams, and now they\u2019re out of it. Then, at the same time, there are teams in the relegation zone who are all going to stay up.

That forces the creation of a new group in Segunda B next season and the season after that it will be reformed again, with the insertion of a new 40-team, two-group division between the Second Division and the rest of the Second Division B for 2021-22. No one knows how that will be decided. No one knows anything much.</p> <p>Players haven\u2019t been consulted \u201cat all\u201d, I\u2019Anson says. \u201cThe Federation didn\u2019t let the players\u2019 union, the AFE, get involved or express what we wanted. It\u2019s pretty much only really the teams in relegation [places] that have accepted it. Everyone looks after their own interests. But I don\u2019t think the problem is whether we were in the play-offs; it\u2019s the lack of information. That\u2019s been playing on every player\u2019s mind.</p> <p>\u201cFor 58 days, we\u2019ve been working but not been able to kick a ball. We\u2019re not living in big houses, earning millions. We needed a quick decision, our minds put at rest. If this was the decision, we needed to know a long time ago.

That means there are also huge opportunities to learn and for people to change their (usually negative!) relationship with numbers.<br><br>I think we\u2019ve always had the responsibility to inform without making people feel afraid, alone or sad. At first though, especially here in the US, it felt like not enough people were sufficiently scared. It was fear that was compelling me to stay at home \u2013 fear of making other people sick and fear of getting sick myself. So I was trying to create data visualisations that had that emotional resonance too. Illustrations that showed the numbers in a way that communicated the seriousness of this situation.

What we collect and omit tells us something about what we value and overlook as a society. If you don\u2019t have data you can\u2019t understand a problem or begin to formulate effective public policy to address it.

Very often we\u2019re trying to make sense of new information and patchy datasets in a rapidly evolving crisis. So far data has shown us that the virus is certainly not a social leveller, rather it has found the cracks in society and blown them wide open, making long-standing inequalities painfully clear. By inquiring beyond the headline numbers, data can help us understand who the virus is affecting the most so we can forge a fairer society once this has passed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aad3bcb2c246ea9e5b659eabb0df8dabfd3cb207\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aad3bcb2c246ea9e5b659eabb0df8dabfd3cb207/0_0_8268_4961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graphic showing areas with high BAME populations have higher Covid-19 death rates.

But deaths due to Covid-19 are of obvious public interest and so the figures need to be circulated. Therefore, for data journalists like myself, much of the past two months has been spent chasing data; figuring out which deaths have and have not been included in various organisations\u2019 figures; finding out what we can and cannot compare. <br><br>As a Guardian journalist you are always focused on reporting the truth. Never has this been more pronounced than in this crisis, where you are hyper-aware that underreporting the figures could cause complacency whereas exaggerating them could cause panic. Some have criticised journalists for not being critical enough while others wrongly, and dangerously, suggest that the figures are exaggerated. But it isn\u2019t those people we concern ourselves with: it is getting to the truth and pointing out what we know when we know it. This means that we aren\u2019t just putting out a BIG FIGURE and leaving it at that. Instead we are explaining why we think the BIG FIGURE isn\u2019t the whole picture. We have faith in our audience\u2019s ability to recognise that we may not have all the answers right now but that we are working tirelessly to get them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"79c436bf6d1dc2275c1ee56e634226e41b8fdb56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79c436bf6d1dc2275c1ee56e634226e41b8fdb56/0_0_3953_4961/797.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Evershed\" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Evershed</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Handouts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Nick Evershed, data and interactives editor, Guardian Australia</h2> <p>Australia is now a success story in terms of its early response to Covid-19, with new cases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-australia-numbers-how-many-new-cases-today-maps-deaths-death-toll-covid-19-stats-statistics-graph-map-by-postcode\">now often below 20 a day</a>, and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-covid-deaths-per-million?year=2020-04-26\">far fewer deaths per million people than other countries</a>.

In fact, it was taken more than a century ago, in 1918, during the Spanish flu epidemic, which killed so many millions. The photographer is unknown, forgotten. But the black and white picture was recently \u201ccolourised\u201d by <a href=\"https://marinamaral.com/\" title=\"\">Marina Amaral</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s really crazy,\u201d she says, from her home in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, about that picture\u2019s sudden and frightening present-day resonance. \u201cWe had no idea when we were working on this photo and selecting it for the book.\u201d The World Aflame, Amaral\u2019s second book with the British historian <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/danjoneshistorian/\" title=\"\">Dan Jones</a>, breathes new life into the story of global conflict, from the run-up to the first world war to the end of the second.

And she colours them, digitally.</p> <p>We\u2019ll come back to the process. But first, while we\u2019re talking about modern-day resonance, Amaral says the recent rise of populism and the far right in many countries (not least her own) is part of what motivates her work. The warning signs are there, she says. \u201cYou read some of the things people were saying then, and you can find people saying the exact same thing today.\u201d</p> <p>In her homeland, run by far-right president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jair-bolsonaro\" title=\"\">Jair Bolsonaro</a>, the then culture minister Roberto Alvim recently borrowed heavily from Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister for propaganda during the second world war, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/17/brazil-culture-minister-goebbels-roberto-alvim-nazi\" title=\"\">in a speech</a>: \u201cBrazilian art in the next decade will be heroic and national, he said, as Wagner played in the background (he was later sacked).</p> <p>\u201cThings like that motivate me to keep doing my job,\u201d Amaral says. \u201cIt\u2019s why I believe in the value and importance of colourising photos.

Bolsonaro has dismissed coronavirus as media \u201chysteria\u201d and a \u201cbit of a cold\u201d, shunned social distancing, and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/jair-bolsonaro-dictatorship-rally-protest-brazil-president-denounced\" title=\"\">joined his supporters in anti-lockdown protests</a>. \u201cI think he will commit mistakes that will cost the lives of many people,\u201d Amaral says. When we speak, her grandmother isn\u2019t well; they don\u2019t know if it\u2019s virus-related, but she\u2019s worried. \u201cI\u2019m scared, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The story of how Marina Amaral came to colour in the past is a very 21st century one. When she was 12, she had a blog and wanted to add some graphics. She didn\u2019t know how, nor did she know anyone who could help. So, using YouTube tutorials, she taught herself to use Photoshop, which she has been exploring ever since.</p> <p>A degree in international relations was abandoned; it didn\u2019t excite her. But her mother is a historian and Amaral has always been fascinated by the past. After stumbling across an online collection of colourised photographs of the second world war, she decided to have a go herself. Sourcing pictures from free image libraries, she developed her own Photoshop techniques and published the results on Facebook and Twitter, where she soon gained large followings. That\u2019s where Dan Jones came across her. The historian saw what she had done to a <a href=\"https://marinamaral.com/portfolio/lewis-powell/\" title=\"\">photograph of Lewis Powell</a>, one of the men executed in 1865 for conspiring to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, his vice-president and the secretary of state (Amaral transformed Powell from a nondescript 19th-century Confederate soldier into a smouldering James Dean). Jones got in touch, the rest is\u2026 well, you know what. In colour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"517b3116eb422f12d8c17aba7f9664d99196797e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/517b3116eb422f12d8c17aba7f9664d99196797e/0_0_4064_3272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"American soldiers disembark on Omaha beach in Normandy on D-day, June 1944: black and white image coloured by artist Marina Amaral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"805\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">American soldiers disembark on Omaha beach in Normandy on D-day, June 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert F Sargent/Getty images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>American soldiers disembark on Omaha beach in Normandy on D-day, June 1944.

Historical research is the most important part of the process. \u201cBefore I sit down and start colourising a photo, I will analyse it deeply, often with the help of historians and experts, gathering as much detail and information as possible and cross-referencing it all with visual and written descriptions of the time. I have to dig to find pieces of a puzzle and fill in the gaps.\u201d</p> <p>The process can be time-consuming, depending on the number of details and the complexity of the image. \u201cI will spend hours, days or weeks working on a single photo. There are some that do not work in colour for various reasons \u2013 maybe the original was damaged, or it just doesn\u2019t look right \u2013 so then we have to discard it and start again. It\u2019s important to have an artistic eye, otherwise the photograph will not look real.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, the result looks less like a picture taken in the last couple of months and more like one painted centuries ago. Her colourised photograph of the Russian dancer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ida-Rubinstein\" title=\"\">Ida Rubinstein</a> volunteering as a nurse in Paris at the start of the first world war, has something of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/29/jan-van-eyck-arnolfini-portrait-make-art-come-alive\" title=\"\">Van Eyck\u2019s Arnolfini Portrait</a> about it.</p> <p>The most powerful of the 200 photographs in the book are not the loudest ones: the action, horror, the famous and infamous faces. I\u2019m not sure what it adds to know that the hole in Mussolini\u2019s head leaked what looks like pink blancmange on to the body of his girlfriend, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Petacci\" title=\"\">Claretta Petacci</a>. Robert F Sargent\u2019s famous D-day photograph, <a href=\"https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/exhibitions/artifact/jaws-death-photograph-d-day-normandy-landing-robert-f-sargent-june-6-1944\" title=\"\">Into The Jaws Of Death</a>, of American soldiers disembarking on Omaha beach, is powerful in colour \u2013 but no more so than it is in black and white. More startling is another landing craft photo, of US troops in Operation Torch, the 1942 invasion of North Africa, because this one was taken <a href=\"http://ww2today.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Torch-landing-craft.jpg\" title=\"\">into the faces of the soldiers</a>. One face in particular: a blue-eyed boy who looks about 15, stares into the camera. Is that fear? What happened to him, you wonder? What was his name?</p> <p>For me, Amaral\u2019s colourisation process is most moving when applied to pictures of children. The addition of eye colour, skin tone, freckles \u2013 suddenly, they look like children you might know. And children, especially, relate to her colourised pictures because they are witnessing a reality that is more similar to their own, she says. Amaral\u2019s day is made when teachers email to say her work has helped their history classes, or engaged their students more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5ba44c5f4ad3c15f0570882da3530560840f005\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5ba44c5f4ad3c15f0570882da3530560840f005/0_0_2958_1359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A triple head shot of 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"459\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s very powerful in black and white\u2019: 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Auschwitz Memorial and Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21e8bf216042f99e3ad85aeeeff1390b4b00cde9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21e8bf216042f99e3ad85aeeeff1390b4b00cde9/0_0_2741_1193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A triple head shot of 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz: black and white image coloured by artist Marina Amaral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Czeslawa Kwoka, 14, photographed at Auschwitz.

He is surrounded by a group of adoring boys. They are mostly very fair, and one is wearing lederhosen; otherwise, they could be the scout group that meets down the road. They are all members of the Hitler Youth.</p> <p>But the most haunting picture shows another child, 14-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/27/the-holocaust-is-not-your-metaphor-to-use-in-modern-political-debates\" title=\"\">Czeslawa Kwoka</a>, who was murdered at Auschwitz. It was, Amaral says, one of the most difficult pictures she\u2019s worked on. \u201cIt\u2019s very powerful in black and white, but in colour you can see that her lips are bleeding. She had just been beaten by a guard. You can really see the fear in her eyes, but you can also feel her courage. Colour allows us to understand the reality in a much deeper sense.\u201d</p> <p>The photograph of Czeslawa Kwoka is also part of a special project Amaral is involved in, <a href=\"https://facesofauschwitz.com/\" title=\"\">Faces Of Auschwitz</a>, a collaboration with the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, for which she is colourising registration photographs from the museum\u2019s archive. It\u2019s the hardest work she has done, she says: \u201cBut I think it\u2019s also necessary. They send me the pictures but also the documents, so I have to spend hours looking at their faces, knowing that, after the photo was taken, they were murdered. I need to have that feeling, otherwise I will be transformed into a machine and the whole purpose will be lost.\u201d</p> <p>Amaral knows that colourisation isn\u2019t for everyone. Some see it as ersatz or interfering, even sacrilege. But it isn\u2019t a matter of choosing one or the other, she says. \u201cMy intention is not to replace the original, but to give people the opportunity to see history from a different perspective.\u201d Also to see it more as the photographer saw it, and the way it actually was. The photographer might not have had the choice, or the technology, to take a picture in colour. But looking through the viewfinder, that\u2019s what they saw; the past \u2013 even its grimmest, darkest hours \u2013 was not in black and white.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://headofzeus.com/books/9781789542028\" title=\"\">The World Aflame</a>, by Marina Amaral and Dan Jones, is published by Head of Zeus on 14 May at \u00a325.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2020.

It\u2019s not an individual sport and you need to do things sometimes that are not in your comfort zone, or that are not in your best interests, for the greater good of the team.</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s what great teams are built on ...

Fellow Titan <strong>Nathan Peats</strong> and Manly\u2019s<strong> Marty Taupau</strong> both hesitated to get the shot due to past adverse reactions, but eventually had the injection.</p> \n  <p>As of Saturday afternoon, the Titans were still awaiting confirmation from Cartwright and Kelly over whether they would agree to be immunised and resume training.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s understood <strong>Dylan Walker</strong>, <strong>Addin Fonua-Blake</strong>, <strong>Josh Papalii</strong>, <strong>Joseph Tapine</strong>, <strong>Iosia Soliola</strong> and Canterbury\u2019s <strong>Sione Katoa </strong>all signed a waiver to remain compliant under the NRL\u2019s guidelines and continue training.</p> \n  <p>It has sparked confusion over how different states and territories will enforce the NRL\u2019s return to training protocols, and casts doubt over whether unimmunised players will be allowed to play in Queensland.</p> \n  <p>Graham, who sits on the RLPA\u2019s board of directors, said the confusion was always a risk as the game rushed to resume training. He believes players and clubs could have sacrificed another week of training as a team to ensure these loose ends in the biosecurity guidelines were tied up.</p> \n  <p>Should the NRL decide to bow to government pressure and enact a \u2018no jab, no play\u2019 policy, Graham says players will need to consider the strength of their convictions against their livelihoods.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I know for me, if I don\u2019t like a flu jab, if it puts my livelihood at risk preventing me from making some money to feed my family, I\u2019m getting the flu jab.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s simple in my eyes ... It depends on how strong their convictions are on an individual level. If they want to sacrifice their rugby league game for their personal preference not to get a flu shot, that\u2019s their prerogative.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a52fa0f2edbd31f05fe57c073d4ffff8b27a9e93\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a52fa0f2edbd31f05fe57c073d4ffff8b27a9e93/0_18_3448_2068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Peats (centre) at a Gold Coast Titans training session on Saturday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Peats (centre) at a Gold Coast Titans training session on Saturday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T06:58:57.411Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb64bbc8f0858b1a8106e0f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T06:21:04.369Z\">7.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The deputy chief medical officer, <strong>Paul Kelly</strong>, has also doubt on the chances of fans attending finals footy this year \u2013 another rubbing of salt into an already heavily seasoned wound.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are some iconic moments in Australian sport coming up in that period \u2013 the last weekend in September is dear to many of us.

Dfat staff in Canberra and at posts abroad have been committed to providing Australians with practical solutions to return to Australia.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T03:37:44.721Z\">at 4.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb623588f0858b1a8106d7d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T03:28:47.819Z\">4.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Five new cases in NSW</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The NSW Health department has released updated Covid-19 statistics, which are current up to 8pm on Friday.<br></p> \n  <p>There have been five new cases recorded in NSW, bringing the state\u2019s total to 3,051.<br></p> \n  <p>NSW has also set a new record for a single day, with 13,692 tests conducted in the previous 24 hours.

(Cognisant that last week the federal education minister <strong>Dan Tehan</strong> similarly attacked Andrews \u2013 over school closures \u2013 and then was forced to rapidly apologise).</p> \n  <p>I\u2019m going to run Wilson\u2019s quote in full so readers can make up their own minds. He was speaking on ABC TV with WA Labor member <strong>Josh Wilson</strong> (the member for Fremantle, no relation (<em>at least I don\u2019t think so!</em>) about different states easing restrictions at different times.</p> \n  <p><strong>Tim Wilson</strong>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m a federalist and I believe that we should have local laws reflecting local conditions. But the other reason is because it puts the burden and responsibility on the states to actually explain why they\u2019ve taken the different approaches. Now, they\u2019re taking the point that Josh [Wilson] has just raised \u2013 you know, WA has done things differently. They let kids go back to school earlier, whereas Victoria is saying no. The burden and the responsibility then has to be on Dan Andrews, when other states are allowing people to go and visit their mums on Mother\u2019s Day, why can\u2019t we go and visit in Victoria, our mums on Mother\u2019s Day? Why can\u2019t we send our kids to school? Why are businesses being unnecessarily punished longer than in other states? And he has to come out and articulate that case and take responsibility for it.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019ve just outlined some serious questions I think that Dan Andrews needs to answer for Victorians, if he wants to maintain public confidence. <strong>Because I think ... and there is actually now a narrative that\u2019s building in parts of Victoria where people are increasingly concerned that he\u2019s probably enjoying the </strong><strong>clampdown too much in terms of the authority and power it\u2019s given him</strong>, <strong>and he\u2019s not as enthusiastic to roll it back.</strong> </p> \n   <p>So, people will have their own opinions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wilson later went on to say he was reflecting the sentiments expressed on the front page of the <strong>Herald Sun</strong> as evidence of the \u201cnarrative\u201d he was referring to.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I made the observation of what\u2019s in the Victorian press, and you need to actually go and read the Victorian press. I understand in WA that may not be the case, but the front page of the Herald Sun today is very clear, wanting to understand the rationale, the reasoning, behind why Dan Andrews is not reopening Victoria as other states are doing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But there are three words at the beginning of that key sentence: \u201c<strong>Because I think.</strong>\u201d</p> \n  <p>Victoria has the second-highest total of Covid-19 cases in the country (1,468) behind only NSW.</p> \n  <p>Andrews said on Thursday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Nobody is enjoying these settings, I understand that, but it is ... important to stay the course on this, not just to do what we want to do, but to do what is ... in the interests of every single Victorian family, every single Victorian business.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And yesterday: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can tell you what I will be doing on Mother\u2019s Day, I will not be visiting my mum. She is in good health, but has underlying health issues. I just wouldn\u2019t do it. I would very much like to.</p> \n   <p>These are unprecedented times. We are all doing things very differently.

  "<p>Good evening and here is our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Elias Visontay bringing you the main stories on Saturday 9 May.</p> \n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t cuddle your mum, deputy chief medical officer says</strong></h2> \n<p>Paul Kelly, the deputy chief medical officer, has pleaded with Australians to resist any urges \u201cto cuddle our mums\u201d ahead of Mother\u2019s Day on Sunday.</p> \n<p>\u201cAbsolutely if you are feeling sick yourself, do not go and visit your mum. Please don\u2019t. If you are feeling well and you really want to see your mum, I\u2019m sure it is fine. But for elderly mums, just be a little bit cautious and probably keep that 1.5-metre distance for now,\u201d Kelly said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know it is hard and we all want to cuddle our mums on Mother\u2019s Day \u2013 and a big shout out to all of the mums out there \u2013 but let\u2019s just wait a little bit longer.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Saturday afternoon, there were 6,929 cases in Australia, with the death toll at 97. There had been 16 new cases in the last 24 hours, four of which were related to the Cedar Meats cluster in Victoria. The testing positivity rate was now under 1%. Of the 900 Australians who were sick with Covid-19, 51 were currently being treated in hospital, with 19 of them in intensive care and 15 of those cases relying on ventilators.</p> \n<p>As of Friday, the government\u2019s CovidSafe app had been downloaded 5.4 million times.</p> \n<h2><strong>One country, one direction, different speeds</strong></h2> \n<p>The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said: \u201cWe have a clear three-step roadmap and plan for Australia. This has been adopted and embraced by all of the states and territories and, to just give an update, what we see is that in seven of the eight states and territories they have already indicated their date and commenced with particular steps.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe last state will start on Monday with their steps \u2026 So one country, one direction, different speeds, but all heading towards the common goal of keeping Australians safe but getting Australians back to work.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Labor says the Coalition has no post-Covid economic plan</strong></h2> \n<p>The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has accused the federal government of lacking an economic plan to go with its roadmap to lift coronavirus-related restrictions.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have said there needs to be a full release of the budget outlook, something the government is ducking at this stage,\u201d Albanese told reporters in Queanbeyan on Saturday, campaigning in the Eden-Monaro electorate ahead of the byelection.</p> \n<p>He said the government\u2019s promise of a \u201csnap back\u201d in the economy once the crisis has passed is nothing more than \u201ca marketing slogan from the prime minister who doesn\u2019t have an economic plan\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will be calling for the government to outline its economic plan.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>A 17th resident of Newmarch House dies</strong></h2> \n<p>A 17th resident of Sydney\u2019s beleaguered Newmarch House died overnight.</p> \n<p>The 92-year-old great-grandmother Fay Rendoth, who grew up in the Blue Mountains and only recently moved to Newmarch, is believed to have died after recovering from coronavirus.</p> \n<p>She leaves behind three daughters, eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Five new cases in NSW</strong></h2> \n<p>There have been five new cases recorded in NSW, bringing the state\u2019s total to 3,051.</p> \n<p>NSW has also set a new record for a single day, with 13,692 tests conducted in the previous 24 hours.

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic underlines the need for greater international solidarity, including more cooperation between Britain and the rest of Europe, all 27 European Union ambassadors and high commissioners to the UK have asserted in an unprecedented joint statement.</p> <p>The statement celebrating Europe Day also represents a reassertion of EU unity and the continuing relevance of European values within the UK.</p> <p>The self-confident statement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/09/europe-day-message-solidarity-friendship-british-people\">published in the Guardian</a>, comes as negotiations on the terms of a new trading relationship between Europe and the UK hit difficulties. The talks must be resolved by the end of the year. The EU\u2019s trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, warned on Thursday that the UK was preparing to walk away from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/brexit-uk-plan-to-secure-trade-deal-by-december-is-fantasy-says-eu\">Brexit trade talks</a> and blame the coronavirus.</p> <p>Europe Day, additional to VE day, marks the moment 70 years ago when Robert Schuman, the foreign minister of France, in a <a href=\"https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/symbols/europe-day/schuman-declaration_en\">landmark speech</a> laid the foundations for the European Union as a response to the devastation of the second world war that had ended five years earlier.</p> <p>It is the first <a href=\"https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/symbols/europe-day_en\">Europe Day</a> anniversary since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/31/leave-eu-europe-britain\">UK left the EU</a>.</p> <p>The 27 ambassadors, along with the new EU ambassador to the UK, Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, seemed determined to argue that the case for international solidarity at the heart of their project has only become more relevant not just in the EU, but also in the UK.</p> <p>The ambassadors wrote: \u201cFor anyone who may have doubted that a close future partnership between the UK and the EU is of mutual interest, the ongoing health emergency has certainly provided ample food for thought. Indeed, in today\u2019s globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/02/uk-seeks-access-to-eu-health-cooperation-in-light-of-coronavirus\">cooperation among nations</a> and states \u2013 and peoples \u2013 is essential.\u201d</p> <p>One ambassador said of the statement: \u201cThis is not about getting British people to change the referendum decision, but just to say we are not ashamed of what we represent, and have much in common with the British people.\u201d</p> <p>The statement said the ambassadors regretted but fully respected the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU, though it also reasserted their belief that European nation states, proud of their individual histories, are \u201cstronger together\u201d.</p> <p>They wrote: \u201cAfter progressively enlarging its scope, both politically and geographically, the EU became the biggest single market and the most important provider of development and humanitarian aid in the world, a true global actor committed to effective multilateralism.\u201d</p> <p>Asserting the continuing relevance of Europe Day to Britain, the ambassadors said that \u201cthe UK made a significant contribution to European achievements before and during its 47 years of membership of the EU.</p> <p>\u201cIt is thus only natural for us to celebrate Europe Day also with the British people, its workers and entrepreneurs, its researchers, its teachers and scholars, its artists, its farmers and fishermen, its doctors and nurses. Today, our thoughts go out particularly to the victims of Covid-19 and their families and to all of the dedicated care and frontline workers around the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2646a4824ce97b526a6cffa8583283288afe548f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2646a4824ce97b526a6cffa8583283288afe548f/0_173_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, during a press conference in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, during a press conference in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Landemard/Le Pictorium Agency via Zuma/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn our cities, towns and villages, on both sides of the Channel, we have been witnessing an outpouring of dedication, kindness and altruism. It should not come as a surprise: solidarity is indeed part of our DNA, in the European Union as in the United Kingdom. EU nationals employed by the NHS have worked tirelessly, side by side with their British colleagues, to save lives since the outbreak of the pandemic. An EU repatriation programme helped almost 2,000 British citizens stranded around the globe to return home safely\u201d.</p> <p>Although the EU stumbled badly at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, resorting to national solutions and rowing over plans for collectivising national debt, the ambassadors insisted that their project is valid. They also insisted that Schuman\u2019s dream has gradually come to fruition, \u201cenabling many countries and millions of Europeans to enjoy freedom, democracy, fundamental rights and high standards of living, in what historians will register as the longest period of peace in our part of the world for many centuries\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 May 2020. The original incorrectly stated that Robert Schuman\u2019s landmark speech that laid the foundations for the European Union was made 50 years ago. The speech was, in fact, given 70 years ago.</p>",
  "<p>When Kate Milman was 21, she paused her English degree at the University of East Anglia to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/jan/23/the-newbury-bypass-protest-of-1996-in-pictures\" title=\"\">protests against the Newbury bypass</a>. It was 1996, and the road was being carved out through idyllic wooded countryside in Berkshire. She took up residence in a treehouse, in the path of the bulldozers, and lived there for months. It was a revelation. She lived intimately with the catkins, the calling birds, the slow-slow-fast change in the seasons. Despite being in a precarious position as a protester, she felt completely safe and her brain was calmed.</p> <p>\u201cYou know when you go camping and go back to your house, and everything feels wrong? The lighting is harsh and everything seems complicated indoors. It just got under my skin, this feeling \u2013 that [living in the woods] is like being at home.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, however, she was evicted from her forest heartland. The men and their machines arrived beneath her tree. Kate was arrested under a newly created \u201caggravated trespass\u201d law and barred from joining the protests again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/newbury-protest-camp-bypass-legacy\" title=\"\">The wood was ripped apart</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThat level of grief \u2013 it felt like losing somebody,\u201d Kate says now. It was a highly complex woodland and she had come to know it intimately. \u201cI knew how beautiful it was at dawn and at full moon, and then it was bulldozed. When you watch that amount of stupidity, when you have that much grief and impotence, what can you do with it?\u201d</p> <p>The idea for <a href=\"https://wildthings.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Wild Things</a>, a workers\u2019 cooperative set up to provide children with experience of the natural world, was born. For three days each week, she and her fellow co-op members, Kath, Kat and Nick (her partner), provide half-day sessions for groups of nine pupils from various city schools.</p> <p>I\u2019ve come to a Wild Things day at Bestwood Country Park, a hilltop woodland on the edge of Nottingham. The wind runs through the canopy in waves, worrying the leaves, but it is calm and snug in the green, brambly understorey. The slender trunks of silver birches shine in the low sunlight.</p> <p>We are both layered in the warm, shapeless garb of the forest school practitioner. From the moment formal, government-provided schooling began in the Victorian era, dissenters have championed alternative forms of education based outdoors, which have placed the health and creativity of the child at their heart. \u201cForest school\u201d, a specific type of outdoor schooling with an emphasis on imaginative play in a forest setting and a fire circle, developed in Britain in the 1990s after teachers visited outdoor schools in Denmark. It has flourished in the last two decades without state support, as parents react against the rigid, test-based learning imposed by government reforms and the national curriculum.</p> <p>When I talk to people about forest schooling, everyone agrees that it\u2019s very important to help children \u201cconnect\u201d with the natural world. But, they often say, it\u2019s terribly middle class and white, isn\u2019t it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b587ac9ab82d28dca697545d834ee841f55cbae4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b587ac9ab82d28dca697545d834ee841f55cbae4/0_0_2947_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children's hands holding jay feathers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jay feathers discovered in the woods.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Things</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The children we\u2019re with today are mostly 10-year-olds, members of an \u201cEnglish as a second language\u201d group from Forest Fields primary and nursery school. The school\u2019s bucolic name belies its location in central Nottingham. Its 620 children speak 52 languages. Everyone in today\u2019s group arrived in Britain in the last two years. Several started school only two months ago. They are from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Romania and Syria, and some came from refugee camps. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve seen,\u201d says their teaching assistant, Yasmin Khaliq, who speaks five languages. She has been bringing groups to Wild Things for nine years. \u201cIt\u2019s a godsend,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all outdoors, they are seeing things with their own eyes, there\u2019s no language barrier.\u201d</p> <p>From somewhere above us comes the anxious \u201ccheeeept-cheeept\u201d of a great spotted woodpecker. Then another call, carried on the wind. \u201cKooooo-eeeeeeeeee!\u201d</p> <p>Kate replies, with a completely unexpected volume: \u201cKooooo-eeeeeeeeee!\u201d</p> <p>The children have been allowed to run ahead, alone, through the woods, and they follow the sound of Kate\u2019s call. I hear the heaving of a small pair of lungs before I see the boy, Mohammad, a slim child bent double with effort, legs flying out sideways like a skittish calf, eager to win his personal race. Next up the hill is a tiny, beaming Syrian girl. \u201cI\u2019m Amira, but you can call me Lion,\u201d she grins.</p> <p>All nine children are effervescent. I can\u2019t banish the image of a group of puppies, bouncing around outdoors for the first time. Kate and I walk to the Wild Things base camp. The children scamper ahead, shimmying around brambles, poking around the site with the sharp-eyed curiosity of chickens, investigating branches, tree stumps and some interesting-looking clippers laid out on a tarpaulin.</p> <p>On the days Kate doesn\u2019t take children on camps, she \u201cscrats around\u201d for charitable funding because, mostly, the only way to get pupils from cash-strapped state schools into the woods is to offer the sessions free. The Wild Things staff survive on a minuscule co-op \u201cshare\u201d wage. Kate lives with Nick and their eight-year-old son in a small rural housing co-op. They drive a battered high-top Transit stuffed with bow saws, loppers, clippers, ropes, tarpaulins, plastic mugs, hot chocolate and other essentials such as children\u2019s wellies and woollen gloves: the pupils rarely bring clothes suitable for outdoors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"17a0ce9c99f9b6bc326f7d48b37bb305d5138d8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17a0ce9c99f9b6bc326f7d48b37bb305d5138d8d/0_206_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boy running on a path through the wood in Bestwood Country Park, Nottingham that the Wild Things Forest School uses as its classroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Children need to feel liberated and free.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The children sit round the fire circle while Kate, Kath and Kat (\u201cthe three Ks\u201d) show them how to use loppers and saws, and explain today\u2019s activities. The pupils choose their own adventure. This child-led approach is intended to offer an alternative to conventional didactic, adult-led education, which misses \u201cthat whole chunk of experience where children are just getting to be a wild animal\u201d, Kate says. Ten-year-olds \u201care at that stage of development where they need to feel liberated and free\u201d.</p> <p>Today the children can learn to use bows and arrows, build a fire and cook on it, or lay a trail, hide and have another group track them down. The activities, says Kate when we break for lunch, are really giving them an excuse to mooch and dream in the forest. No two children respond to the place in the same way. Kate and her colleagues are constantly surprised by the infinite span of children\u2019s creative thought and their willingness to express it in the woods: one boy decides to build a gym, another a mask; a girl spins stories \u2013 about a frog and a turtle crossing her path.</p> <p>I join Kat and a trio of girls \u2013 keen little Amira; Homa, a Pakistani girl; and Cristina, a Roma Gypsy from Romania with a long plait, who wears a purple jumpsuit and a shiny purple padded jacket. She can\u2019t speak much English but understands plenty.</p> <p>Our mission is to lay a trail of arrows made from sticks through the wood to a spot where we will hide from the other members of the group.</p> <p>\u201cLike da?\u201d says Cristina, fashioning an arrow from three large branches.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Children can feel at home in the woods in a way they find more difficult in the community they have landed in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMake it smaller?\u201d suggests Kat.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Big!\u201d says Cristina.</p> <p>Cristina gasps as we twist along a narrow path, passing a tree stump covered in gleaming bracket fungus. Beech leaves shine luminous orange on the forest floor. \u201cCome on, guys!\u201d says Cristina. Last week she didn\u2019t talk at all, says Kat.</p> <p>I struggle to break a large stick into arrow pieces. Homa laughs: \u201cCristina is stronger than you,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I assumed that most refugees have come to the UK from cities, but Wild Things has worked with many migrant children who grew up in rural areas. Meanwhile British-born city children belong to a country called Indoors: they ask Kate, \u201cWhat\u2019s mud?\u201d or, \u201cWhy are there so many trees here?\u201d It is often only in Britain that rural children from overseas are confined to city-centre flats. Their questions \u2013 \u201cAre there elephants?\u201d or, \u201cAre there deadly snakes here?\u201d \u2013 are rooted in experience of their countries of origin. For many, Kate says, the woods awaken lost memories and a yearning for home. \u201cAs soon as we light a fire, they say, \u2018Ah, I know this\u2019 or they point to a plant and get really animated. They are in their element.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b58c5d380f381eca58dccf211c6c93fa88687d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b58c5d380f381eca58dccf211c6c93fa88687d4/0_120_4032_2904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children setting off on a tracking hunt at a Wild Things forest school\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Setting off on a tracking hunt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Things</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One group last spring included a partially sighted girl. \u201cWalking up into the woods, she stopped and said, \u2018Listen to that sound!\u2019\u201d remembers Kate. \u201cIt was the buzzing of the insects.\u201d It reminded the girl of her former country. At the end of her six weeks, she said, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve come home.\u201d The Wild Things staff frequently hear similar declarations. \u201cOften children can feel at home in the woods in a way they find more difficult in the community they have landed in, where technology is everything, money is everything, they are at the bottom of the pecking order and there are massive tensions in the area. In the woods they are on a level playing field. They can just be kids again.\u201d</p> <p>We return to the fire circle and the children discuss their plans for next week.</p> <p>\u201cMake a wood house,\u201d says Sanaya. \u201cI made a house with sticks in Pakistan. My grandma makes a fire like this.\u201d</p> <p>It reminds her of home? \u201cYes.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We help a child to fall in love with nature and we don\u2019t know if they will ever be able to access it again</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is the best thing about the wood? \u201cEverything,\u201d says Homa. \u201cHide-and-seek, the fire, the bread, because that makes us all hot.\u201d</p> <p>This prompts Adnan to reminisce about Syria. \u201cI used to like playing with my cousins. It was just like this but with less trees.\u201d</p> <p>Cristina is the most reluctant to leave.</p> <p>\u201cNext time, again?\u201d she asks Kate, looking worried. Kate counts on her fingers to show Cristina seven days.</p> <p>Cristina\u2019s face lengthens at the prospect of such a long wait, but she joins the rest of the group hurtling back down the hill to their minibus heading for the city, and their new homes.</p> <p>Kate and her fellow Wild Things workers often feel the weight of the children\u2019s longing to stay in the woods. \u201cThey constantly say things like, \u2018I feel so free out here,\u2019\u201d she says. Already today, on her second of six sessions, Sanaya was saying, \u201cI know I won\u2019t come back because my family haven\u2019t got a car.\u201d After the six weeks, Wild Things give every child a leaflet with bus routes, showing how they can reach the forest from Nottingham. But the bus drops them in the nearest village, and there\u2019s no cafe in the woods. It will be a very strong-willed 10-year-old who makes her own way here, and an act of faith for her parents to follow her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ac7478e7897d2a8317a3c7ccc476246c95b971f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ac7478e7897d2a8317a3c7ccc476246c95b971f/0_37_4032_2599/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children share treasures back at camp at a Wild Things forest school\" width=\"1000\" height=\"645\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharing treasures back at camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Things</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wild Things know their work enhances the children\u2019s lives but, as Kate points out, \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to measure improvements in confidence, self-esteem, friendships, behaviour. Sometimes you do see something tangible, other times you don\u2019t. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p> <p>Forest school is still relatively new, educational research is poorly funded and a child\u2019s achievement is shaped by myriad circumstances that make it difficult for academics to control for every confounding factor. But there is an enormous weight of scientific research demonstrating the benefits of wild green space for adult mental and physical wellbeing, and a growing body of evidence pointing to the specific benefits of outdoor schooling.</p> <p>The physical gains are easiest to measure. In one study, <a href=\"https://www.owlscotland.org/images/uploads/resources/files/Physical_Activity_at_Forest_School_Research.pdf\" title=\"\">a group of Scottish nine-</a><a href=\"https://www.owlscotland.org/images/uploads/resources/files/Physical_Activity_at_Forest_School_Research.pdf\" title=\"\">11-year-olds were fitted with accelerometers</a> to measure their physical activity during a typical school day and during a day at forest school. These revealed that activity levels were 2.2 times greater during forest school days than on normal school days that included PE lessons, and 2.7 times greater than on \u201cinactive\u201d school days. Scandinavian studies of outdoor schools have also found they improve children\u2019s attentiveness. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494417300737\" title=\"\">a four-year study from Norway</a> identified more inattention and hyperactivity symptoms the less time children spent at an outdoor preschool.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprisingly, there is also hard evidence that outdoor schooling can produce better academic outcomes. A <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03004430.2018.1446430\" title=\"\">three-year study of primary school pupils</a> who were \u201cstruggling to thrive\u201d found a group who attended weekly forest school sessions achieved better overall attendance than their primary school-only peers, and markedly better attainment. The forest school pupils\u2019 writing improved by 18% compared with 7% among comparably disadvantaged pupils; reading improved by 27%, compared with 22% among school-only children; and maths attainment rose by 27% compared with 11%.</p> <p>Even so, forest school teachers are acutely aware that they offer only a tiny taste of magic in childhoods where more time is spent indoors than in any preceding generation. \u201cWe help a child to fall in love with nature and we don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll ever be able to access it again,\u201d Kate says. She thinks for a moment. At least the children now know the woods are there. The place may call to them at any point in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s better to know there\u2019s a bit missing. It might be something you can use in your later life,\u201d she says. \u201cTo know that the woods can make you feel better.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Some names have been changed. </p> <p>Wild Child by Patrick Barkham is published by Granta at \u00a316.99.

  "<p>On Saturday, for the first time in almost 50 years, we observe <a href=\"https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/symbols/europe-day_en\">Europe Day</a> without the United Kingdom as a member state of the European Union. As ambassadors and high commissioners representing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">EU</a> and its 27 countries in the UK, we are nonetheless very keen to mark the date with all the citizens of this great country and with the millions of EU nationals who live and work in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>We celebrate Europe on 9 May because on this same day in 1950, exactly 70 years ago, in the aftermath of the devastating second world war, Robert Schuman, the Luxembourg-born foreign minister of France, laid the foundations of our collective endeavour. He said then: \u201cEurope will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, Schuman\u2019s dream has come gradually to fruition, enabling many countries and millions of Europeans to enjoy freedom, democracy, fundamental rights and high standards of living, in what historians will register as the longest period of peace in our part of the world for many centuries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On both sides of the Channel we have been witnessing an outpouring of dedication, kindness and altruism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After progressively enlarging its scope, both politically and geographically, the EU became the biggest single market and the most important provider of development and humanitarian aid in the world, a true global actor committed to effective multilateralism. With almost half a billion citizens, it brings together peoples and nations from all over Europe who are proud of their history and culture but know they will be stronger together. It is telling that this year, we also mark the 25th anniversary of the accession to the union of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and the 40th anniversary of the historic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2019/sep/18/the-birth-of-solidarity-in-poland-archive-1980\">Solidarity</a> movement in Poland.</p> <p>All this and much more is what we are proudly celebrating today. We do so while looking forward, with confidence, to the future of our union, focused on finding a common way out of the health emergency, ensuring an inclusive economic recovery and building the foundations for sustainable development in Europe and around the world.</p> <p>The United Kingdom made a significant contribution to European achievements before and during its 47 years of membership of the European Union. It is thus only natural for us to celebrate Europe Day also with the British people, its workers and entrepreneurs, its researchers, its teachers and scholars, its artists, its farmers and fishermen, its doctors and nurses. Today, our thoughts go out particularly to the victims of Covid-19 and their families and to all of the dedicated care and frontline workers around the country.</p> <p>The current unprecedented health emergency has brought us closer together \u2013 within each of our countries and among the 27, as well as between all of us in the EU and our British friends. We all know that Covid-19 spares no one \u2013 no family, no country. We all know that only together will we be able to overcome it.</p> <p>In our cities, towns and villages, on both sides of the Channel, we have been witnessing an outpouring of dedication, kindness and altruism. It should not come as a surprise: solidarity is indeed part of our DNA, in the European Union as in the United Kingdom. EU nationals employed by the NHS have worked tirelessly, side by side with their British colleagues, to save lives since the outbreak of the pandemic.</p> <p>An EU repatriation programme helped almost 2,000 British citizens stranded around the globe to return home safely. British flights did the same for EU citizens. These examples illustrate how the most challenging situations bring to the fore the best in each of us, as the Queen so eloquently highlighted in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/queen-urges-britons-stay-strong-coronavirus-covid-lockdown\">broadcast to the nation</a> on 5 April.</p> <p>A democratic decision, which we regret but fully respect, was made by the United Kingdom to leave the EU. We are now implementing the transitional provisions of the withdrawal agreement while negotiating the terms of our future relations. For anyone who may have doubted that a close future partnership between the UK and the EU is of mutual interest, the ongoing health emergency has certainly provided ample food for thought.</p> <p>Indeed, in today\u2019s globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, cooperation among nations and states \u2013 and peoples \u2013 is essential. A good example is what the UK and Italy are doing together on the climate crisis, in jointly ensuring that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">Cop26</a> conference delivers a high level of global ambition to overcome this major challenge for mankind. Another is the ongoing global pledge to finance treatment and vaccination against Covid-19, of which the EU and the UK are major sponsors.</p> <p>We believe that cooperation and solidarity among countries, with full respect for sovereignty and diversity, are key factors in overcoming today\u2019s challenges, starting with the present health emergency. We trust that these principles will also inspire the future relationship between the UK and the EU \u2013 and that is the friendly message that, as a united group of 28 ambassadors and high commissioners, we would like to convey to the British people on this Europe Day.</p> <p><strong>This article was jointly authored by: </strong>Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, ambassador of the European Union to the United Kingdom; Michael Zimmermann, ambassador of Austria; Ellen De Geest, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of Belgium; Marin Raykov, ambassador of Bulgaria; Igor Pokaz, ambassador of Croatia; Andreas S Kakouris, high commissioner of Cyprus; Libor Se\u010dka, ambassador of the Czech Republic; Lars Thuesen, ambassador of Denmark; Tiina Intelmann, ambassador of Estonia; Markku Kein\u00e4nen, ambassador of Finland; Catherine Colonna, ambassador of France; Julia Gross, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of Germany; Dimitris Caramitsos-Tziras, ambassador of Greece; Ferenc Kumin, ambassador of Hungary; Adrian O\u2019Neill, ambassador of Ireland; Raffaele Trombetta, ambassador of Italy; Katarina Pl\u0101tere, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of Latvia; Renatas Norkus, ambassador of Lithuania; Jean Olinger, ambassador of Luxembourg; Joseph Cole, high commissioner of Malta; Simon Smits, ambassador of the Netherlands; Arkady Rzegocki, ambassador of Poland; Manuel Lobo Antunes, ambassador of Portugal; Sorin-Dan Mihalache, ambassador of Romania; Lubom\u00edr Reh\u00e1k, ambassador of Slovakia; Tadej Rupel, ambassador of Slovenia; Carlos Bastarreche, ambassador of Spain; Torbj\u00f6rn Sohlstr\u00f6m, ambassador of Sweden.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 May 2020 to clarify in the main image caption that Winston Churchill was not the British prime minister at the time the picture was taken.</p>",
  "<p>Airbnb has revolutionised travel and since it was founded in 2008 hundreds of thousands of property owners have used the holiday accommodation platform to make ends meet, make a living and, in some cases, make a killing.</p> <p>But while hosts, as they are known, are wringing their hands over the collapse of the travel industry and their loss of income, many city authorities are rubbing theirs at the prospect of thousands of holiday lets returning to the traditional rental market. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/20/soaring-rents-and-noisy-parties-how-airbnb-is-forcing-out-barcelona-locals\">Cities complain</a> that the highly profitable holiday lets have driven up rents and forced out residents with the knock-on effect that local businesses no longer have a community to serve.</p> <p>\u201cWe hope to see a third or even a half of these licensed tourist apartments become normal apartments to rent over the next three years,\u201d said Janet Sanz, Barcelona\u2019s deputy mayor.</p> <p>This was echoed by Ian Brossat, the Paris deputy mayor in charge of housing. \u201cWe intend to take the opportunity to regain control,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Brossat said Airbnb listings had \u201ccollapsed\u201d in Paris and hosts had registered just 40 stays with authorities in the first three weeks of April, compared to an average of 1,210 a month last year. Airbnb refutes the figures, preferring to focus on supply rather than demand.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a report by the holiday rental analysts <a href=\"https://www.seetransparent.com/coronavirus-impact/impact-in-global-demand.html\">Transparent</a> shows a drop of about 98% in reservations in Spain since the lockdown began on 14 March. No one expects a quick recovery and in Spain the tourism industry has effectively written off 2020 and is looking ahead to next year.</p> <p>In order to recoup their losses, owners are now turning to the conventional rental market, with hundreds, possibly thousands, of apartments being offered in Spanish cities for short lets of up to a year, clearly with an eye to a recovery in 2021.</p> <p>However, short lets are only legal for people who have to move temporarily to the city for work. As no one is allowed to move anywhere at present such rentals are likely to be illegal and Sanz says efforts will be made to prosecute.</p> <p>Barcelona has had a long-running war with Airbnb. There are 9,600 licensed holiday apartments in the city and at least that many are unlicensed, contributing to an explosion of tourism to the city since the platform started offering listings in 2009.

But now a long-running campaign by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/not-just-weeds-how-rebel-botanists-are-using-graffiti-to-name-forgotten-flora-aoe\">rebel botanists</a> across Europe to highlight overlooked nature in the city, scribbling names and plant details alongside a pretty weed growing through a wall or a tree spreading overhead, has unexpectedly found its niche.</p> <p>Going for a walk is the only real freedom many have had for weeks, and with no particular place to go but out, there is finally time to notice nature creeping through the cracks: the birdsong no longer drowned out by traffic; the daffodils in front gardens giving way to frothy peonies; a fat supermoon hanging heavy on the night horizon.</p> <p>Our relationship with the natural world is changing as this crisis strips away the layers between humans and the surroundings we used to be too busy to take in. The outdoors, once something glimpsed from a train window, has become somewhere to relieve the anxiety and sometimes let out the grief.</p> <p>Out here in the countryside, lockdown has been perhaps a gentler experience than in the cities. But still the tangible signs of spring unfurling into lush, green summer have been one of the few things giving shape to these nebulous, anxious weeks. When everything else feels jangling and wrong, the sight of meadows turning yellow with buttercups, or the sweet-sour tang of elderflowers blooming in the hedgerows, confirms that at least something is unfolding roughly as it should.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Developers eyeing up once unloved parks and urban green spaces can forget it. When this is over people will want more, not less, of the lungs that help cities breathe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have stopped measuring time by useless empty calendars and started measuring it in the garden, where life goes on even when human clocks have stopped. The seeds planted in a fit of jittery displacement activity when lockdown started were green shoots by the time it was renewed, and are tall enough to go out in the vegetable patch now that the rules are on the verge of being renewed again. I suspect we\u2019ll have eaten the tomatoes and courgettes long before it ends. Growing things makes me wonder who will bring a gardener\u2019s mentality to this crisis, planting the seeds of ideas that will bear fruit in years to come.</p> <p>One of the few things to emerge with any clarity from muddled government messages about the next phase is that the outdoors will become much more important to us, because that\u2019s where the first signs of normal life will return. Talk of being allowed to sunbathe in parks, have picnics or go rambling may sound Enid Blyton-esque but outside may be the best place for the anxious to be, and not just in a pandemic. Research repeatedly shows that being close to the wild makes people feel healthier and happier.</p> <p>It\u2019s still not clear exactly how walking through woods or swimming in a river works, but, whatever the biological mechanism, millions swear by the soothing properties of being <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-44097-3%20http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20160420-how-nature-is-good-for-our-health-and-happiness\">immersed in the natural world</a>. And<strong> </strong>that which soothes or shields us is ultimately that which we want to protect.</p> <p>This pandemic must surely lead to far greater scrutiny of the relationship between human health and the natural world, with scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/07/promiscuous-treatment-of-nature-will-lead-to-more-pandemics-scientists\">warning that deforestation</a> and habitat destruction have driven wild animals into closer proximity with humans and helped novel viruses leap the species barrier. Such cavalier, short-sighted exploitation of our environment cannot carry on.</p> <p>But closer to home, it should also stop us taking small British family farmers for granted, or imposing brutal forms of Brexit that leave nothing but the most industrialised agribusinesses standing. Farmers and food producers aren\u2019t classed as key workers for nothing; when the supermarkets ran out of delivery slots for vulnerable people, in rural communities it was farm shops and vegetable-box schemes, flour mills and backyard chicken keepers who filled the gap.</p> <p>Developers eyeing up once unloved parks and urban green spaces, meanwhile, can forget it. When this is over people will want more, not less, of the lungs that help cities breathe: more tree planting in urban streets and more room for allotments. City living isn\u2019t dead \u2013 no matter how many Londoners have wistfully Googled \u201cmoving to the country\u201d over the last few weeks \u2013 but must make room for people to live a little closer to nature than they currently do.</p> <p>Right across the country, we should insist that new housebuilding schemes leave room for families to have proper gardens and grow food communally; schools, too, need wild places for children to play, not just asphalt and sports fields. It\u2019s not about preparing for another pandemic so much as learning the lessons this one is teaching us about emotionally resilient lives. Research published this week by the University of Exeter, showing people who can get into a <a href=\"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/university/title_793983_en.html\">garden are healthier and happier</a> than those who can\u2019t, was conducted before anyone had heard of Covid-19 but it makes even more sense now.</p> <p>Greens must still tread sensitively in response to this changing mood. Many people clearly take comfort from the idea that, with planes grounded and cars gathering dust, at least the planet can get a break from us. But if climate change campaigners are seen to be rejoicing too much in the accidental outcomes of a sad and terrifying time, they\u2019ll lose sympathy. With thousands of airline workers losing their jobs, it will be a while before most people feel comfortable celebrating the decline of polluting industries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/covid-19-is-natures-wake-up-call-to-complacent-civilisation\">Covid-19 is nature's wake-up call to complacent civilisation | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What environmentalists can do, even at the peak of a crisis forcing us all to live our lives in miniature, however, is to think local.

As the coronavirus crisis deepens in America, evidence is mounting that its impact is concentrated among certain racial and ethnic groups and elder Americans, often behind closed doors.</p> <p>Though anybody is at risk from the contagion, the virus has rampaged through <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/magazine/oakdale-federal-prison-coronavirus.html\">prisons</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html\">nursing homes</a> and exacted an especially heavy toll in African American and other minority communities. \u201cIt is abundantly clear that this virus has not just exposed, but exacerbated, the deep, structural racial inequities that have been taking the lives and livelihoods people of color for generations,\u201d the former Democratic presidential candidate Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe stunning health disparities we\u2019ve seen with Covid-19 will not simply disappear as states begin to reopen \u2013 they will remain and get worse.

  "<p>It was a grim irony that the best transport news in ages was buried in the first few days of the coronavirus lockdown. On 26 March, the government published a document, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878642/decarbonising-transport-setting-the-challenge.pdf\">Decarbonising Transport</a>, which went further in facing up to the problem of emissions from air and vehicle traffic than most campaigners had dared to hope for.</p> <p>The challenge is enormous. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/20/the-guardian-view-on-transport-emissions-the-trouble-with-planes-and-automobiles\">transport overtook energy</a> to become the single biggest source of domestic emissions. Motor vehicles on their own are responsible for around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/16/uk-road-transport-emissions-up-since-1990-despite-efficiency-drive\">a fifth</a> of the total. On aviation, the UK is the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tourismdashboard.org/explore-the-data/carbon-emissions/\">third-worst polluter</a>, behind China and the US.</p> <p>But here was the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52064509\">declaring that</a> \u201cpublic transport and active travel will be the natural first choice\u201d, adding \u201cwe will use our cars less\u201d for anyone who missed the point. Transport was to be a centrepiece of the UK\u2019s preparations for the postponed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\">Cop26 climate talks</a>. Finally, it appeared we were on the way to grasping the nettle of our polluting driving and flying habits.</p> <p>Six weeks on, we are in a different world. Travel of all sorts has collapsed: there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/19/air-traffic-before-after-europe-coronavirus-lockdowns-video\">90% fewer flights</a> from European airports in April compared with a year ago. In the UK there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/rail-journeys-at-5-of-normal-levels-as-uk-stays-home-due-to-coronavirus\">just 5%</a> of the normal number of rail journeys, while road traffic has fallen to levels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/uk-road-travel-falls-to-1955-levels-as-covid-19-lockdown-takes-hold-coronavirus-traffic\">last seen in 1955</a>. In the short-term, this means steep drops in emissions: one estimate says the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-carbon-emissions-fall-by-more-than-a-third-in-lockdown-11983721\">have fallen by 36%</a>. But already experts are warning that unless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">strong action is taken</a>, any temporary benefits could be quickly erased. </p> <p>Probably the biggest risk is that governments will take their eye off the climate emergency, bailing out airlines and car manufacturers as they have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">bailed out oil companies</a>. But while some observers have pointed to the collapse in vehicle sales as the beginning of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200429-are-we-witnessing-the-death-of-the-car\">end for petrol and diesel</a>, other voices warn of the even greater risk to public transport due to worries over being able to maintain social distancing. Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/milan-seeks-to-prevent-post-crisis-return-of-traffic-pollution\">Milan\u2019s leaders declared</a> their determination to avoid a surge in car use, even if residents were reluctant to return to trains, trams and buses. \u201cIf everybody drives, there is no space for people, there is no space to move,\u201d said the city\u2019s deputy mayor Marco Granelli.</p> <p>Milan\u2019s authorities are among the leaders of a group of mayors working together worldwide on plans for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/city-leaders-aim-to-shape-green-recovery-from-coronavirus-crisis\">green recovery</a>. At the heart of schemes announced so far is a radical reorientation of street space in favour of walking and cycling \u2013 a goal that is made all the more urgent given the tentative links being made by researchers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/is-air-pollution-making-the-coronavirus-pandemic-even-more-deadly\">between air pollution and coronavirus</a>. Milan has announced that 35km (22 miles) of road will be transformed over the summer. In Paris, the mayor is spending \u20ac300m (\u00a3262m) on a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2020/04/22/paris-to-create-650-kilometers-of-pop-up-corona-cycleways-for-post-lockdown-travel/#7c382e3354d4\">new cycle network</a>. New York, Mexico City, Bogot\u00e1 and Barcelona are among other cities with schemes ranging from new car-free days to the temporary reclassification of streets as recreation areas.</p> <p>So what of the UK? While it is only fair to point out that the country has been a leader on decarbonisation (after doing so much to carbonise the planet in the first place), when it comes to transport we are a laggard. For a mixture of reasons (powerful oil companies; successful car manufacturers; an unhealthy identification, nourished by popular culture, with the car-mad US), we have been painfully slow to take even obvious steps. Hence our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/01/air-pollution-falling-london-millions-still-exposed\">illegally dirty air</a>, astronomical rail fares and irrational hostility to cyclists \u2013 who are routinely pilloried for the kinds of selfish, careless behaviour that goes unremarked when the culprits are drivers.</p> <p>All is not lost, as March\u2019s draft decarbonisation document showed. This week Boris Johnson \u2013 who, when he was London mayor, shrank the capital\u2019s congestion zone \u2013 suggested that a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/prime-minister-boris-johnson-says-this-should-be-a-new-golden-age-for-cycling-455473\">golden age of cycling</a>\u201d could be about to dawn. Having started slowly, British cities are putting in place pandemic measures such as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-06/london-s-mayor-turns-to-cycling-to-solve-transit-s-virus-problem\">temporary cycle lanes</a> in London, and a <a href=\"https://www.stockport.gov.uk/news/council-helps-to-launch-safestreetssavelives-campaign-to-support-social\">Safe Streets Save Lives</a> scheme in Greater Manchester. The Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government, has told ministers that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged\">green policies </a>such as an accelerated transition to electric vehicles would be the strongest basis for an economic recovery.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s chronic overcentralisation remains a brake on progress. Properly accountable and resourced regional government is needed to engineer, both politically and practically, the modal shifts that are needed. But politics is not all top down, and the shift in behaviour during the lockdown, as millions of people have spent far more time on two wheels or feet, is also important. On a recent walk through my London neighbourhood I saw rollerbladers, sunbathers, neighbours playing darts against a gate and a game of badminton between parked cars. It\u2019s almost 40 years since Donald Appleyard showed in his book Livable Streets that less busy roads lead to stronger communities. Could the pandemic see the start of a broader movement to reclaim our town and cities from cars?</p> <p>\u2022 Susanna Rustin is a Guardian leader writer</p>",
  "<p>I\u2019ve lived in this bit of the city for years, but lockdown has morphed it into a strangely new habitat. My morning exercise walk begins by slinging my binoculars around my neck as if I were going out on a proper birdwatching trip. I head for the River Lagan. Between the Grosvenor and Ormeau bridges, I scan for regulars. Out on the water, a pair of great black-backed gulls fussily dip their bills. The resident heron holds its nerve long enough to eye me speculatively. Finches bauble the canopy on the bank, names chiming in my head like a song for the seasons: green for spring; gold for summer; chaff for autumn. Long-tailed tits might quicken from a pink and white parade of cherry blossom.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, shrill piping had my brain scrambling for the species. I spun around to catch, flying upriver, a small wader with white arrowing its back and trailing the edges to its wings.

Although there have been rumours of an outbreak before, it is the first time the outbreak has been so directly confirmed.<br></p> \n  <p>Ashoori said inmate Loghman Roozchang showed symptoms of the disease very soon after returning from furlough this week. He and two of his brothers convicted of embezzlement had been placed in Hall 2 of Wing 4 of the prison on their return as part of a supposed 14-day quarantine.</p> \n  <p>But he was taken away on Tuesday to hospital and his brother on Thursday confirmed that he had been tested positive.

The campaigners say prisoners are also moving between halls so making the quarantine a largely symbolic exercise designed to satisfy the World Health Organization, the UN body that advises national governments on how to defeat the infection.</p> \n  <p><strong>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</strong>, the best-known of the jailed British-Iranian dual nationals, had been kept in Evin for four years but was released on furlough in April and has spent the time on release at her parent\u2019s home on a tag in Tehran. She is waiting to hear if she will be granted clemency or instead returned to jail. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has asked the UK ambassador to Tehran to visit her in an act of solidarity.</p> \n  <p>Tehran itself was hit by 5.1 earthquake on Thursday night, leading to civilians to rush into the streets for safety.

But if steps are not taken the world could see 31 million cases of gender-based violence, he warned. </p> \n  <p>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>WHO is deeply troubled by the reports from many countries, including Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Ireland, Russian Federation, Spain, UK, and others of increases in interpersonal violence \u2013 including violence against women and men, by an intimate partner and against children - because of the COVID-19 response.</p> \n   <p>Although data is scarce, Member States are reporting up to a 60% increase in emergency calls by women subjected to violence by their intimate partners in April this year, compared to last. Online enquiries to violence prevention support hotlines have increased up to 5 times. </p> \n   <p>Our UN partner UNFPA has sounded the alarm loud and clear \u2013 if lockdowns were to continue for 6 months, we would expect an extra 31 million cases of gender-based violence globally. Beyond the figures, only a fraction of cases is ever reported. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added that governments and local authorities should consider it to be a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to make sure services are available, while calling on communities to look out for their friends, family and neighbours and speak out. </p> \n  <p>To victims, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Violence against you is <em>never</em> your fault. It is <em>never</em> your fault. Your home should be a secure place.
