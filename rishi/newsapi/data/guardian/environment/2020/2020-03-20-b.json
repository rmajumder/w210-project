  "<p>The data tells us that climate change is real, but sometimes the feeling on the ground is far from convincing. A spell of hot weather can always be compared to a similar spell of hot weather from way back in the past. Similarly a big storm, intense rain and flooding often have parallels from long ago. Now a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL086259\">study in Geophysical Research Letters</a> reveals that the signs of climate change are harder to spot in mid-latitude countries such as the UK and US, and easier to see in the tropics.</p> <p>Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, and colleagues compared global mean temperature fluctuations with local temperature fluctuations for different parts of the world. They show that while the global average temperature has wiggled smoothly upwards, a mid-latitude location such as Oxford in the UK has always had wild swings in temperature. \u201cClimate change impacts in some countries are being hidden by their own changeable weather,\u201d writes Hawkins. By contrast increasing temperatures in tropical regions are more obvious because the background climate is steadier in these regions.</p> <p>When it comes to rainfall, the data reveals a clear signal of increasing extremes, masked in mean rainfall plots. Large parts of the UK have now experienced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/21/uk-weather-weekend-rain-could-cause-further-flooding\">exceptional deluges</a>, incomparable to historic records.</p>",
  "<p>In a stark proclamation, Derek SK Kawakami, the mayor of Kauai county in Hawaii, made an extraordinary announcement on Wednesday.

Given that this situation continues to evolve, ministers must also keep the door open to additional measures to support business cash flow.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Matthew Cady</strong>, investment strategist at <strong>Brooks Macdonald</strong>, an investment manager, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Today\u2019s steps by the chancellor are building on the confidence that we\u2019re now seeing from markets that the policy responses arriving are getting to the size that\u2019s needed. Within the gains in UK equities today, we\u2019re seeing relative outperformance in more UK-focused domestic companies, unwinding some of the weakness they\u2019ve seen coming into today\u2019s announcement. </p> <p> What is needed from governments and politicians is a \u2018right-now\u2019 plan, and it\u2019s good to see that the chancellor has finally recognised this with the measures he is taking today. For markets, the coronavirus outbreak will clearly drive a significant jolt to the UK economy over the next one or two quarters. But with UK policy makers now giving it both fiscal and monetary barrels, there are good chances that this stays a short-term impact. Today\u2019s actions should start to give investors some encouragement to take advantage of the pullback in valuations as they think about their longer-term investment horizons. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Kallum Pickering</strong>, senior economist at <strong>Berenberg</strong>, an investment bank, said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK is now running a \u2018virus war\u2019 economy. The usual rules do not apply.</p> <p> Providing cash-strapped firms with generous subsidies to retain their staff will dramatically lower the risk of surging unemployment during the corona virus recession. Encouraging firms to hoard their labour while authorities tackle the medical emergency raises the chance that the economy can get back to normal quickly once any containment restrictions are lifted.</p> <p>It is hard to say at this early stage exactly how much the employment subsidy scheme will cost. As a proportion of annual GDP, quarterly aggregate employees compensation is around 12.5%. If the scheme runs into two quarters or more, the cost in % of GDP to the treasury will easily be double-digits. <br></p> <p> Across the world central banks and governments are working a hard to prevent the inevitable corona-virus recession from developing into a financial crisis. We continue to see enough evidence that, in the UK and in other advanced economies, policymakers will likely pull it off, in the end. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e75020a8f08e0999e6b747c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T17:50:03.729Z\">5.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And the pound is now back to a 1.5% gain, at $1.1665 against the US dollar.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e7500a38f08dcc95cc20427\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T17:46:00.783Z\">5.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Some reaction is starting to come in from business groups and unions.</strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Izza</strong>, chief executive of the <strong>ICAEW</strong>, an accountancy body, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The real battle now is for public confidence: if we can sustain that, the economics will follow.

Across the states for which we have data, claims so far this week are running at a rate that is 15 times higher than they were in March last year. That figure is consistent with a rise in jobless claims from 281,000 to around three million next week. That would be the largest such increase by a factor of more than ten.</p> <p>If it comes to pass, that would be consistent with the unemployment rate increasing by around 2 percentage points in a single week - a figure that is more than double the largest ever <em>monthly</em> increase in the unemployment rate.

These include electricians, carpenters and drivers, many of whom are paid hourly wages and work on a project-to-project basis.

The measures announced by Rishi Sunak at this evening\u2019s press conference are unprecedented in the history of the British state, as the chancellor himself noted. He revealed that the government would establish a coronavirus jobs retention scheme for all employers, large or small, that will cover 80% of wages, up to \u00a32,500 a month. The scheme will initially be open for three months, but could be extended, and will be backdated to 1 March.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">Government to pay 80% of wages for those not working in coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The chancellor\u2019s drastic intervention is a worrying indication of the severity of the crisis to come. It\u2019s unclear why the government waited until Britain had seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/20/uk-coronavirus-live-confusion-over-key-workers-list-as-schools-close\">177 deaths from coronavirus</a> to introduce such measures, including the closure of bars, restaurants and gyms. And despite the scale of this intervention, life will still be very tough for many families, especially in London, where the average wage is higher than the scheme\u2019s ceiling.</p> <p>For many households, rents already amount to more than 50% of income. More radical steps will still be necessary to reduce rents, rather than simply to defer their collection. But this should not distract from the extraordinary scale of today\u2019s announcement.</p> <p>The government plans to inject \u00a37bn into the welfare system, which will help some four million households. The universal credit standard allowance and the working tax credit allowance will both rise by \u00a31,000, while the minimum income floor for universal credit will be suspended, allowing self-employed people to access it at a rate equivalent to statutory sick pay for employees. But with statutory sick pay set at just \u00a394.25 a week, many people \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-outbreak-how-will-it-affect-my-rights-pay-and-debts\">particularly the self-employed</a> \u2013 will still face serious hardship.</p> <p>If the economy is to be able to recover, it is vital that firms are prevented from going bust, or laying off staff. They need to retain the productive capacity to bounce back once the immediate crisis subsides. The chancellor announced more measures to improve liquidity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/20/marks-and-spencer-warns-it-may-have-to-close-stores-temporarily-business-live\">deferring the next quarter of VAT</a> until the end of the financial year in April 2021, measures that amount to a \u00a330bn injection of cash into the economy. These steps will be welcomed.</p> <p>Sunak also announced that interest-free loans for businesses would be extended from 6 months to a year. Yet more intervention still seems likely: with such high uncertainty and the collapse in demand, cheap borrowing is unlikely to be sufficient. What firm would take on more debt under these circumstances?</p> <p>The next stage in the government\u2019s coronavirus policy programme could include non-repayable grants to small business, to help cover fixed costs such as rent, and perhaps capital injections into large businesses in return for equity (which could later be sold off to help pay down the enormous expansion in government debt). Some equity dilution is a small price to pay to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/prepare-for-the-coronavirus-global-recession\">save businesses from collapse</a>.</p> <p>The dramatic decision to instruct all cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close tonight and not reopen tomorrow will be reviewed each month. Nightclubs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/its-curtains-for-theatre-but-not-let-us-hope-for-too-long\">theatres</a>, cinemas, gyms, and leisure centres will also close indefinitely. All business rates are to be abolished for the hospitality sector, and grants of up to \u00a325,000 will be made available for business premises. This will come as an enormous relief to a sector that has been staring at oblivion in recent weeks.</p> <p>With these actions, the government has effectively put the entire economy on to life support. The costs of the virus have been collectivised and the burden shared among all of us. It will require a massive expansion in government borrowing \u2013 by the end of the year, the scale may well dwarf the 2008 financial crisis. It could take decades to pay down the costs of the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-myth-economy-uk-business-life-death\">Coronavirus has shattered the myth that the economy must come first | Adam Tooze</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This crisis is a sobering reminder that humans are fragile \u2013 and that capitalism is merely a human construct.

Rationing is already taking place unofficially in supermarkets but in a way that takes no account of people\u2019s need, he has told Downing Street along with fellow authors, Prof Erik Millstone of Sussex University, and Prof Terry Marsden of Cardiff University. </p> \n  <p>They warn that food banks and food share schemes that give food to those on low incomes are reporting serious shortages, while key workers who can only shop at the end of their shifts are finding shelves empty and nothing to eat. </p> \n  <p>Lang said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am aware of at least one London borough where the food bank has alerted the council of serious shortages despite an 80% rise in visitors.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The food bank was unable to source food and essentials such as tinned meat and vegetables, long-life milk, and toiletries such as toilet paper and soap even though it had funding to buy them. </p> \n  <p>Kris Gibbon-Walsh, head of operations at Fareshare, a charity that supplies food manufacturing and retail surplus to charities that would usually feed 1 million people a week, said it too was struggling to get supplies. He called for the government to step in immediately with funding and mandatory allocation of supplies:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have more demand than ever, and some of it is different demand \u2013 people who can\u2019t go to food banks or might be self-isolating, people who might have eaten at a lunch club for the elderly before. Government needs to instruct industry to keep supplying us.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The experts\u2019 letter to the prime minister says \u201cthere is a dangerous tendency to blame consumers\u201d and that the problems only arise because of panic-buying. In the absence of clearer planning, with market mechanisms failing, consumers are only acting rationally in preparing for being confined at home, the authors add. </p> \n  <p>Before coronavirus struck, nearly 8bn meals a year in the UK were being eaten out of home. Suddenly people are having to make nearly all their meals at home.<br></p> \n  <p>Gibbon-Walsh said supermarkets were struggling to adapt their algorithms quickly enough. These limit the amount delivered to stores to the amount of shelf space, number of people available to stack them, and number of drivers, so even though retailers have surplus at distribution centres, they cannot get it to stores to meet current demand.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T15:37:39.089Z\">at 3.37pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e74de148f08a08573fbe6d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-20T15:18:03.248Z\">3.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Parking app JustPark has launched a nationwide appeal to increase the number of <strong>free parking spaces near hospitals</strong> by allowing the general public to list spaces for free via their app. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustPark/status/1240994749139562497\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NHS</a> needs your help!

They then modelled how the known levels and extent of smoke exposure across the southeast, during the height of the crisis from 1 October to 10 February, would have affected these.</p> <p>Their results estimate that over this period there were 417 premature deaths, 3,151 extra hospitalisations for cardiorespiratory problems and 1,305 additional attendances for asthma attacks. This compares to 33 who reportedly died as a direct result of the bushfires.</p> <p>Many of the deaths and hospitalisations are likely to have been older patients with heart disease or lung problems, such as chronic bronchitis or emphysema \u2013 but severe asthma attacks will likely have resulted in deaths in younger people too, Johnston said. </p> <p>In patients with pre-existing cardiorespiratory issues, smoke exposure promotes inflammation, stresses the body and makes blood more likely to clot, increasing the risk of a heart attack. \u201cIn someone at high risk, subtle changes due to stress \u2026 can be the precipitating factor for a very serious or terminal event,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Guy Marks, a respiratory physician and epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney who was not involved in the research, said the findings \u201chighlights the importance of the health consequences\u201d and is useful in estimating fire-related deaths that may not have been recognised as the result of smoke exposure. </p> <p>The findings concur with previous studies of the health consequences of wildfire smoke in North America, but the numbers \u201care more drastic, potentially as a result of the unprecedented nature of the exposure,\u201d Migliaccio said. He added that while previous studies found increases in hospital visits, the addition of large numbers of premature deaths in the Australian study is significant and disturbing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/11/how-to-get-back-to-normal-after-the-bushfires-i-feel-life-has-changed-into-a-mad-max-movie\">How to get back to normal after the bushfires? \u2018I feel life has changed into a Mad Max movie\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Migliaccio said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/22/australia-bushfires-europe-wildfire-climate\">due to climate change increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires</a> \u201cthese types of exposures are increasing in number and intensity, making this kind of research vital.\u201d </p> <p>To look into just such effects, a consortium of 10 air pollution researchers from across Australia, led by Marks and including Johnston, have already put up their hands for $3m in government funding, which became available in the wake of the crisis.</p> <p>The research proposal, funding of which has yet to be confirmed, aims to plug significant gaps in knowledge about the health impacts of bushfire smoke and how these might be mitigated.</p> <p>Marks says that questions he and his colleagues hope to address include whether there is anything unique about health effect of air pollution caused by bushfires, what the long-term effects of exposure are, and what the effects might be on newborn babies and pregnant women.</p> <p>The researchers \u2013 all members of a collaborative consortium, The Centre for Air Pollution, Energy and Health Research (CAR), funded by Australia\u2019s National Health and Medical Research Council \u2013 also hope to study whether it\u2019s possible to filter air to make indoor refuges safe from pollution, and if public health advice can be improved.</p>",

Psychology research shows that <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02309/full\">shared adversity often brings out the best in us</a>, motivating us to be adaptable and creative.</p> \n<p>On top of that, when we suffer <a href=\"https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/affective-and-physiological-responses-to-the-suffering-of-others-\">we are motivated to help others who also suffer</a>. Sure there are the some who are opportunistic or self-interested and, yes, we saw some of this in the early waves of coronavirus when it came to consumer actions (the empty shelf syndrome) but as the implications of the virus settles in, and as more people are suffering, we have seen a surge in global kindness and people taking proactive steps to generate solutions that will work for everyone.</p> \n<p>A psychology professor, Dacher Keltner of UCLA Berkeley, suggests that <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-00681-000\">kindness has always been a central aspect of human nature</a> going right back to our ancestors because it helped us survive. Out on the harsh savannah it was kindness that prompted close bonds and cooperation among our early descendants, allowing them to band together to share food, defend themselves against predators, solve problems and raise children. </p> \n<p>This is equally true today and has becomes strikingly evident in this time of crisis. Shelly Taylor, another psychology professor at UCLA, suggests that \u201cwe are fundamentally a nurturant species\u201d and that times of threat trigger an instinctive response that she calls \u201c<a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/marianabockarova/files/tend-and-befriend.pdf\">tending and befriending</a>\u201d where we step in protect others (tend) and band together against the threat (befriend).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/18/drop-off-dinners-five-easy-to-reheat-dishes-to-cook-for-your-neighbours\">Drop off dinners: five easy-to-reheat dishes to cook for your neighbours</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"http://ccare.stanford.edu/article/compassion-an-evolutionary-analysis-and-empirical-review/\">Our brains are hard-wired for compassion</a>, and survival of the kindest must outweigh survival of the fittest now.</p> \n<p>Now is a time where we all must \u201ctend and befriend\u201d. Here are some simple things you can do to the global wave of kindness.</p> \n<ol> \n <li><p>. Drop a note in your neighbours\u2019 letter boxes inviting them to be part of a Street WhatsApp group so you can check in on each other and let people know if you\u2019re doing a supermarket run or see if someone needs a friend to talk to.</p></li> \n <li><p>. Support local and online business: the coronavirus is having huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/05/coronavirus-global-economy\">economic fallouts</a>. Support your local restaurants through take-away orders, get fresh fruit from your grocer, have flowers delivered to a friend who is struggling, put your family holiday snaps into an album with an online store, spend money on books, kits, crafts or activities that you can read/do with your new spare time during social distancing.</p></li> \n <li><p>. Share positive stories on social media: research shows that when you share a story that makes someone happy this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=80U__KwX0iU&amp;feature=emb_logo\">positive emotion spreads on to others in the social network</a>.</p></li> \n <li><p>. Give blood. Right now the <a href=\"https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/coronavirus--covid-19--and-blood-donation.html\">Red Cross</a> has a severe blood shortage and donors are needed urgently. The Red Cross assures us that giving blood is safe and does not put you at risk of contracting the coronavirus.</p></li> \n <li><p>. Sit down and <a href=\"https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/gratitude_letter_for_students\">write a thank you letter</a> to someone who has made a positive difference in your life. Send them the letter or better yet call them and read the letter to them.</p></li> \n <li><p>. Wash your hands and practise social distancing. This is still the most effective thing you can do and is a way of showing kindness by not risking the spread of infection to others.</p></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Kindness can come in the intentional actions above and it can come through your small daily gestures. When getting pulled into several battles with my two teenage kids today over e-learning and the fact that school closure does not mean brain closure, I had to remind myself \u201csometimes it\u2019s better to be kind than to be right\u201d, take a deep breath, disengage and find a more constructive way of talking to them. It took effort, but then all the good things do.</p> \n<p>The pace, intensity and magnitude of the coronavirus has the whole world reeling. By committing yourself to be kinder during the crisis you are helping others, helping yourself and helping the world. Now more than ever, we must pause, be patient and choose kindness.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Lea Waters AM, PhD, is a psychology professor at the University of Melbourne and executive board member of the International Positive Psychology Association</p></li> \n</ul>",

On 29 February, Frydenberg lined up confidently at the dispatch box, smirking for Australia. \u201cYesterday, we heard the member for Rankin\u2019s alternative to a balanced budget was a wellbeing budget, Mr Speaker.\u201d</p> <p>The treasurer put air quotes around \u201cwellbeing\u201d for emphasis, lest the thought crime be ambiguous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoshFrydenberg/status/1232545702380572672\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is a warning to every Australian.  <br><br>Labor and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JEChalmers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JEChalmers</a> want to replace responsible economic management with a yoga mat, beads and a \u201cwellbeing budget\u201d.<br><br>Just another Labor excuse for higher taxes and bigger deficits\ud83d\udc47 <a href=\"https://t.co/8bBHvnS7GI\">pic.twitter.com/8bBHvnS7GI</a></p>&mdash; Josh Frydenberg (@JoshFrydenberg) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshFrydenberg/status/1232545702380572672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cNow I want you to picture this alternative,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cThe member for Rankin is about to deliver his first wellbeing budget. He walks in, barefoot, into the chamber \u2026 robes are flowing, incense is burning \u2026 beads in one hand and speech in the other \u2026 gone are the seats, gone are the benches \u2026 and in their place, meditation mats for all, Mr Speaker \u2026 hugs for all, Mr Speaker\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s really instructive to review that footage now because it provides an archival glimpse of a moment, only a few weeks back, where the political class in Australia felt safe enough, when there was enough psychic surplus, to be smug. Frydenberg is so pumped he\u2019s puffed up, and the percussive chortling and thigh thumping from the parliamentary peanut gallery is off the charts.</p> <p>If you follow economic debates you\u2019ll know that wellbeing budgets are a fledgling, but not radical, concept, so the riff was dumb at the time: a triumph of testosterone over reasoned reflection. I strongly suspect that Frydenberg, who is a good man \u2013 a person who makes a point of maintaining human decency in a profession where expressions of decency can be viewed as a weakness \u2013 grasped that it was dopey shortly after his student politics skit winged its way into the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/01/josh-frydenberg-urged-to-do-the-right-thing-after-offensive-hindu-comments\">and not everybody laughed</a>.</p> <p>The point of recounting this episode is twofold. It reminds us that Australia and the world, and the intraday dynamics of political discourse, felt quantifiably different only a nanosecond ago.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think about the choices we'll make in coming weeks and months. I wonder what we'll be when this crisis finally passes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This gathering crisis has picked us up and set us down in a different place. At the moment, I\u2019m having have conversations with my friends about whether we are in 1929, 1981 or 1991 \u2013 or somewhere we\u2019ve never been at all.</p> <p>Secondly, as old mate Alanis once noted, isn\u2019t it ironic? Frydenberg won\u2019t badge his current endeavour of working up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/what-australian-governments-coronavirus-stimulus-package-means-for-you-explainer\">rolling fiscal stimulus</a> as crafting an emergency wellbeing budget, particularly now that the regular budget has been delayed until October.</p> <p>But the facts are clear. The treasurer is now working around the clock in pursuit of clear, humanist objectives: keeping people alive and preserving the economic health of Australia. Events have pushed the once risible objective of measuring and attaining wellbeing right to the centre of the national balance sheet.</p> <p>All the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/04/morrisons-back-in-black-surplus-ad-seems-to-suffer-a-deficit-of-originality\">pre-emptive self-congratulation of \u201cback in black\u201d is out</a>. The measure of success now is not the shibboleths of neoliberal philosophy, but how many lives can be spared, and how many jobs and businesses can be maintained in the face of a profound global economic shock triggered by a health crisis \u2013 which is exactly as it should be.</p> <p>The reasons for this rapid turnaround are obvious. Frydenberg is now confronting the grim reality of being the first Australian treasurer since Paul Keating to preside over a recession, when the life plan was to be the first since 2007-08 to unveil a budget surplus.</p> <p>This is the second time Frydenberg has found himself enduring a short and sharp reversal of fortune because of circumstances largely beyond his own making. When he was energy minister, he thought he might be able to land <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/26/what-is-the-national-energy-guarantee-and-why-is-it-taking-so-long\">a policy mechanism</a> that could have ended a decade of partisan idiocy on emissions reduction, but that opportunity was taken out of his hands by colleagues who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/aug/24/scott-morrison-to-become-australian-pm-as-turnbull-denounces-insurgency\">wanted Malcolm Turnbull gone</a> more than they wanted to fix a problem that needed fixing.</p> <p>When this storm passes, at some time in the future, when there is time to reflect, when the moment finally comes where he can exist inside his own head without interruption \u2013 Frydenberg will, I feel certain, start to wonder why he keeps waking up in someone else\u2019s life.</p> <p>The outlook over the coming months is really challenging. I\u2019m weighing my words judiciously because it doesn\u2019t help when people in my position start hyperventilating and machine gunning adjectives like dire or diabolical just to court someone\u2019s five seconds of attention in the click-and-share economy. So I\u2019ll just say things are really challenging and uncertain.</p> <p>It was an extraordinary experience, standing in the prime ministerial courtyard on Thursday, with a handful of journalists and crews arrayed at appropriate social distancing ratios, to record the moment when the prime minister of Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/australian-government-moves-to-close-borders-as-new-coronavirus-cases-continue-to-rise\">confirmed he would shut the border to visitors</a>.</p> <p>Just a few minutes earlier the government and the central bank resolved to pump more than $100bn into the financial system to keep credit flowing. The Reserve Bank governor told people to brace for a significant spike in unemployment, and to understand that the cash rate would remain at emergency levels for years.</p> <p>With Australia walled off from the world for at least six months, I think about tourism businesses without customers. I think about sole traders who have put their life savings into businesses that won\u2019t survive. I think of the kids who have just finished years of education and will try to enter a labour market that will not have enough jobs for them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/so-you-think-you-have-coronavirus-what-australians-should-do-if-they-are-unwell\">So you think you have coronavirus: what Australians should do if they are unwell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I think of the people who will lose jobs as a consequence of this downturn and may never work again, because that\u2019s how these events pan out, even with the best will in the world.

Like everyone I know, I worry about how little we know about this virus, and about how long it\u2019s going to take to get a vaccine, which is the point at which the world turns the corner.</p> <p>Holed up in Parliament House, which feels at the moment like a docked ghost ship, in semi-lockdown, with empty corridors and many people working remotely, I think about the choices we will all make in the coming weeks and months. I wonder what we will be when this crisis finally passes.</p> <p>Given the hoarding, and the stampedes in our supermarkets, I wonder if pandemics destroy goodwill, rendering this closing bit of whimsy entirely redundant.

Because the RBA buys and sells money in a band around the official rate number, this means interest rates are effectively already zero.</p> <p>It will loan the banks up to $90bn at an interest rate of just 0.25%, on the condition they in turn lend the money to small and medium-sized businesses.</p> <p>On top of that, it will buy government bonds from banks to inject yet more cash into the banks.</p> <p>The process, called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d, was used by central banks during the global financial crisis. It is effectively the same as printing money because the RBA pays for the bonds by increasing the balances of the accounts the banks hold with it.</p> <p>They \u201csimply use the computer to mark up the size of the account\u201d, as the former US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiCs_YHlKSI\">once said</a>.</p> <p>This means the RBA has an unlimited supply of cash and the only practical constraint on how much money it can pump into the system is inflation.</p> <p>Putting too much in would eventually make money worth less, causing prices to rise. But as inflation remains stuck lower than the RBA\u2019s target of 2% to 3%, it\u2019s not likely to worry the Reserve Bank chairman, Philip Lowe, any time soon.</p> <p>\u201cNothing is off the table,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re in extraordinary times and we\u2019re prepared to do whatever is necessary.\u201d</p> <h2>What happens next?</h2> <p>Older readers may remember that last week Morrison delivered a $23bn stimulus package, aimed largely at small business.</p> <p>It was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/should-morrisons-coronavirus-stimulus-package-be-giving-cash-to-ordinary-australians\">gamble</a> that has now clearly failed. Morrison and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, have returned to the drawing board and are expected to emerge with a second try as soon as Sunday.</p> <p>For business, it is now clear the emphasis on tax concessions in version one won\u2019t cut it \u2013 they need cash, and now, to pay the rent and keep on as many staff as possible.</p> <p>The first package also failed to grapple with the cashflow needs of households \u2013 basics like rent, mortgage payments and food.</p> <p>Pressure is building on the Morrison government to make sure people aren\u2019t turfed out on to the street because of the crisis.</p> <p>Overseas, the UK has banned evictions for the duration, while the US has banned foreclosures and evictions for two months.</p> <p>The opposition Labor party would like to see something similar in Australia, plus measures to make sure no one is cut off from essential services including electricity and water.</p> <p>Markets will also be closely watching the size of the package.</p> <p>To give some context, the RBA\u2019s small business loan package alone is worth about 4.5% of gross domestic product.</p> <p>French government stimulus is about 12% of GDP.</p> <p>By contrast, Morrison\u2019s first attempt was just 1.2% of GDP.</p> <p>He will need to emerge with a far larger figure on Sunday or markets will tank \u2013 even more than they would anyway \u2013 on Monday morning.</p>",

Appeal to your strata or council to allow you to put in a little raised bed, and if there isn\u2019t space nearby, your balcony or window sill will do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/09/why-love-and-gardening-always-grow-together\">Why love and gardening always grow together | Allan Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Once you\u2019ve located your space, monitor how the sun tracks in that area for a day or two, and think of your mediums. Are you going to make a raised bed? Have pots or plant along borders? You don\u2019t even need to be fancy about it; growing things in styrofoam boxes with drain holes punched in the bottom is perfectly acceptable.</p> <p>These two elements will give you an idea of what you are able to grow successfully. Then you can find out all sorts of advice and information from gardening websites, and I highly recommend the gardening book <a href=\"https://www.booktopia.com.au/one-magic-square-lolo-houbein/book/9781862547643.html\">One Magic Square</a> by Lolo Houbein, who details all the possibilities of a little garden. One golden tip \u2013 that took me ages to realise \u2013 is that most herbs and vegetables actually have a shallow root system, so don\u2019t go overboard with making a deep bed or wasting too much soil and mulch.</p> <p>Most hardware stores are still in full operation and offer home delivery to those who cannot venture out. This is where you can find most of the things you will need to set up your little food haven. </p> <p> Buy only the minimum, and look around you for the resources you may already have.

The superabundance of selections \u2013 so many varieties you\u2019ve never even heard of \u2013 can be overwhelming, so my suggestion is to examine your and your household\u2019s diet first.</p> <p>What do you like to eat? How do you cook? Keep in mind the season too. I\u2019ve included below a few things I\u2019m excited to grow for winter. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Reconnecting to nature by means of a little gardening is a tremendous balm for these peculiar times</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The final tip I will give is that you have \u201cpatience and a cool hand\u201d (which is a Thai expression similar to having a green thumb). Think of playing like a little kid in the garden. Kids are sometimes the best at sowing seeds because they don\u2019t try too hard at making sure the seeds are deeply tucked in. They grow by accident, casually strewing seeds around \u2013 just like a bird! That and talking to your plants. They are very good listeners.</p> <p>Reconnecting to nature by means of a little gardening is a tremendous balm for these peculiar times. Since we are unable to take off travelling in the near future anyhow, it is apt to put down a few roots. To go to ground, literally. You may be surprised at just at how much you\u2019ll fall in love with eating the produce you\u2019ve had a hand in creating.</p> <h2><strong><br>If you don\u2019t have much light, or space</strong></h2> <p>Grow: <strong>Pennywort, parsley, mint and Chinese celery <br></strong>These plants don\u2019t need much light to photosynthesise due to their broader leaves. They are all excellent, nutrient-dense herbs and are also a tasty addition to any meal.</p> <p>Honourable mentions:<strong> Cavolo nero, Chinese broccoli and most lettuces<br></strong>These plants don\u2019t mind growing upwards, provided they have a little space between them. Compared with other brassicas like cabbages and broccoli, they require a shorter growing period before being harvested. If you harvest them well, they will keep providing for you over the winter and well into spring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/dont-panic-australia-the-coronavirus-doesnt-mean-well-run-out-of-food\">Don't panic, Australia.

Perhaps not a massive yield, but walking into your little garden to see the flowers then the fruit emerge is a heart-melting moment. Then the aroma of eating that first strawberry from a plant you tended will be enough to keep to growing them for life.</p> <h2><strong>If you\u2019re digging a garden bed</strong></h2> <p>Put in everything! GO NUTS! Don\u2019t forget that plants have different growing tendencies \u2013 some need trellising, some like to grow laterally and some are very effective ground covers. Make sure to mulch well between seedlings.<br><br>Honourable mentions: <strong>Growing a tree<br></strong>If you can manage more than multiple beds, grow trees, though make sure the beds are deeper as trees have a deeper rooting system. As my friend Leon Fink of the Fink Hospitality Group once said to me: \u201cPalisa, growing trees is the ultimate sign of hope.\u201d He is spot on.</p>",

  "<p>The afternoon of 10 August 1976 in the Provisional IRA heartland of Andersonstown in west Belfast was hot and sunny. But, as ever, the ongoing conflict was being played out, this time with a British army patrol pursuing a suspect speeding car through streets busy with people shopping and walking.</p> <p>At about 2pm, when the chase reached Finaghy Road North, soldiers opened fire on the speeding car, killing \u201cVolunteer\u201d Danny Lennon, the 23-year-old driver. His car immediately went out of control and veered on to the pavement outside a church. Before it careered to a halt against the railings, it had run down three children and their mother, Anne Maguire. Eight-year-old Joanne and her six-week-old brother, Andrew, died immediately while another brother, two-year-old John, died from his injuries the next day. Anne, after days in a coma, survived, but killed herself eight years later. Another son, Mark, aged seven, who was on his bicycle ahead of the family group escaped injury. A second person in the car fled the scene.</p> <p>A local woman who worked as an office receptionist, Betty Williams, heard the gunfire and was among the first at the scene. Horrified, in the immediate aftermath she began a petition, knocking on doors and calling for peace in Northern Ireland, and quickly gained 6,000 signatures.</p> <p>\u201cThere had been other tragic deaths,\u201d Williams, who has died aged 76, said at the time, \u201cbut the tragedy of the little Maguires was the moment when I felt we just could not take any more.\u201d</p> <p>At the tearful triple funeral Williams sought out Mairead Corrigan, an aunt of the children, to commiserate. It was a conversation that was to have life-changing consequences for both.</p> <p>A hitherto confidential memorandum, written in the Northern Ireland Office at Stormont on the day of the crash, described the incident as a \u201ccarefully planned operation\u201d and \u201ca major success\u201d for the army, while plans were laid to exploit the tragedy to drive a propaganda backlash against the Provos.</p> <p>However, the NIO quickly lost control of the situation as an unprecedented wave of loathing cascaded from both sides of the religious divide in Belfast, right across Ireland and further afield.</p> <p>Much of it was led by women grieving for the victims and demanding an end to the Troubles, which were then in their ninth year. Williams and Corrigan themselves led a march of 10,000 Catholics and Protestants through Andersonstown. The scene of the deaths had become a flowered grotto, while spontaneous prayer marches throughout Ireland were taking place every night.</p> <p>It was while being interviewed at a television studio about the protests that Williams and Corrigan met Ciaran McKeown, a local journalist. He offered to help the pair handle the intense media interest that was already engulfing them.</p> <p>Guided in the background by McKeown, Williams and Corrigan emerged as the figureheads of a new peace movement, which became known as the Peace People after a declaration written by McKeown and read out by the pair at a rally on 21 August.</p> <p>The movement attracted significant support and funding, and for weeks dominated the headlines. A good news story from Northern Ireland after years of civil disorder and failed political initiatives was universally welcome.</p> <p>There followed a clamour for Williams and Corrigan to be awarded the Nobel peace prize, an honour bestowed the following year. The pair were the youngest recipients of the prize and the monetary award was worth about \u00a3560,000, equivalent to about \u00a33.6m today. The money was equally divided but, while Corrigan donated her share to the Peace People organisation, Williams kept hers, saying she intended to use it to promote peace beyond the boundaries of Ireland. This led to criticism from many that she was using the prize as a ticket to fame and personal fortune. Williams said she needed the money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b7d4d9323ef16c0dc04fba58026564215045ecf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7d4d9323ef16c0dc04fba58026564215045ecf5/0_60_4228_2538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Betty Williams (left) and Mairead Corrigan during a rally for peace in Northern Ireland \u2013 the pair first met at the funeral for three children killed during the Troubles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Relations between the two women soured and they were soon completely ignoring each other. In 1978 Williams severed links to the movement she had co-founded. While Corrigan, a devout Catholic, stuck to her primary concern of bringing an end to the local troubles, Williams, dazzled by the attention she received from journalists and broadcasters, focused on becoming an international peace activist and enjoying the associated lifestyle.</p> <p>In the years to follow she travelled widely on her own global peace mission, rubbing shoulders with Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, Yasser Arafat and Aung San Suu Kyi. She was showered with invitations to lecture worldwide and invited to participate in many global peace initiatives. In the process she came to know activist celebrities such as Joan Baez and Sharon Stone and the US presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, together with senior figures at the UN. In all she accumulated 20 awards and doctorates and served on the boards of 15 international peace and children\u2019s organisations.</p> <p>It was all a far cry from her early life in wartime Belfast, the daughter of a Protestant butcher, Jim Smyth, and his Catholic wife, a part-time waitress. Betty, who had a younger sister, Maggie, first attended St Teresa\u2019s primary school and then St Dominic\u2019s grammar. She always said that her mixed upbringing had taught her tolerance.</p> <p>Aged 18, three years after leaving school, she married Ralph Williams, a marine engineer, with whom she had a son, Paul, and daughter, Deborah. Their marriage was dissolved in 1981 and, a year later she married James T Perkins, a wealthy American businessman, and lived with him in Florida. By the end of her life she was living back in Belfast.</p> <p>Her children survive her.</p> <p>\u2022 Betty (Elizabeth) Williams, peace campaigner, born 22 May 1943; died 17 March 2020</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 March 2020.

  "<p>Online romance is rarely easy, but when Elin and David matched on Tinder a week ago, little did they think that by getting together they would be falling foul of government advice. </p> <p>\u201cWe were talking [on the app] for a few days and planning to meet up,\u201d said David, who is 29 and lives in Manchester. \u201cBut over the weekend the coronavirus situation was getting progressively worse and everything started getting cancelled.\u201d</p> <p>Like many others who have found their lives upended by an international crisis, they decided to work out an alternative. Elin, 33, from Calderdale, West Yorkshire, had an idea: she suggested that they Skype each other while cooking the same dish.</p> <p>David found them a Nigel Slater recipe from the Guardian to try: slow-cooked spiced aubergine. \u201cPart steam, part fry,\u201d the instructions said. It seemed promising. It wasn\u2019t exactly Channel 4\u2019s First Dates, but it was something.</p> <p>When the evening arrived, the quality of the video wasn\u2019t good enough, so they switched to speaking on the phone. Despite the technical difficulties, though, it seemed to go well.</p> <p>\u201cWe got to talk loads and find out about each other,\u201d said David. \u201cThere were a couple of moments when we just went quiet because we were concentrating on cooking, chopping the vegetables or something,\u201d said Elin. \u201cThen I took it to the bedroom, in that I just sat on my bed.\u201d</p> <p>Elin and David are not the only ones to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/14/singleton-search-love-coronavirus-dating-risks\">persevering with dating</a> as the global pandemic turns people\u2019s lives upside down. OKCupid said 50m messages were sent on its dating service in the past month by people talking for the first time, with still more expected to do so this month.

More people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/10/looking-for-love-wash-your-hands-first-say-dating-apps\">using Tinder bios</a> to show their concern for others. For example, asking \u2018how is everyone\u2019 instead of putting their life motto.\u201d</p> <p>One online dater, Pete, 34, said everyone now has an easy icebreaker: \u201cI would say there is an easy opening chat subject at the moment. How are you surviving? Are you working from home? There is a good reason to start talking.\u201d</p> <p>But the difficulty of taking the conversation offline, he said, was a source of frustration.</p> <p>\u201cI was supposed to be going on a date with a doctor tonight but she has been treating those with coronavirus ... We have taken the view it is not a good idea to meet but we will do a FaceTime call over the weekend. However, it is not the same.\u201d</p> <p>For those at a more advanced stage in their relationships, the prospects are ambiguous. Divorce lawyers suggest that marriages may be tested by the exceptional circumstances, but that time together could in the end help iron out more problems than it creates.</p> <p>Karin Walker, family lawyer at KGW divorce law, said: \u201cSadly divorce rates go up at Christmas when people spend too much time together.</p> <p>\u201cBut I think this is very different. It will cause people to look at family and relationship and relationship breakdown in a different way. I have noticed more people out walking together early in the morning. Normally it\u2019s just me and my dog and no one else but couples are out walking together ... Maybe we will go back to games and talking to each other, which we do far too little of in our rush around lives.\u201d</p> <p>Mandy Rimmer, a partner at the family department of Stephensons Solicitors, said: \u201cShortly after world war two there was a peak in divorce rates. I do think when people go through something like this, with so much uncertainty and idea of what will happen and how long it will go on for they think life\u2019s too short.\u201d</p> <p>David and Elin\u2019s date might have been an unusual one, but David is hoping for a repeat, virtual or otherwise. He did say, though, that he hoped to find a tastier recipe next time. \u201cIt\u2019s good for people to know that life is carrying on, people are still finding ways to do things like dating,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Elin said: \u201cI think people are maybe more conscious at the moment about the need to be social with others. They are making extra effort, whether it\u2019s through communal video calls or chatting with their entire family and their friends.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The government is to pay the wages of millions of workers across Britain to keep them in jobs as the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak escalates.</p> \n<p>In an unprecedented step for the British government, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the state would pay grants covering up to 80% of the salary of workers if companies kept them on their payroll, rather than lay them off as the economy crashes. The extraordinary payments will be worth up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month, just above the median income.</p> \n<p>Coming just days after the government announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">a business bailout package worth \u00a3350bn</a> to help firms cope with the lockdown of large parts of the British economy as the disease spreads, the chancellor described his revamped plan as one of the most comprehensive in the world and \u201cunprecedented in British history\u201d. City economists said the new plan would cost an additional \u00a378bn.</p> \n<p>Sunak said: \u201cWe are starting a great national effort to protect jobs. We want to look back on this time and remember how in the face of a generation-defining moment we undertook a collective national effort and we stood together. It\u2019s on all of us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The chancellor said his commitments were \u201cunprecedented measures for unprecedented times\u201d as he appealed to the public to support each other.<br><br>\u201cNow more than at any time in our history we will be judged by our capacity for compassion. Our ability to come through this won\u2019t just be down to what government or businesses do but the individual acts of kindness that we show each other.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said there would be no limit on the funding available to pay people\u2019s wages. The payments will be backdated to the start of March, will be up and running within weeks, open initially for at least three months, and could be extended if necessary.</p> \n<p>Speaking directly to employers as growing numbers of British firms teeter on the brink of collapse, leaving millions of jobs hanging in the balance, Sunak said: \u201cThe government is doing its best to stand behind you. And I\u2019m asking you to do your best to stand behind our workers.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government is also deferring the next quarter of VAT payments, which is the equivalent of injecting another \u00a330bn into the economy and is designed to help companies stay afloat, he added.</p> \n<p>Sunak was speaking alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a> at the daily Downing Street press conference hours after schools shut to most children until further notice and just after the prime minister announced the enforced closure of pubs, restaurants, theatres and other social venues. The shutdowns will have dramatic repercussions for the economy, and Johnson said the package of financial aid was intended to be temporary, and part of a \u201cjoint objective\u201d between people and the government to beat the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will do everything in our power to help. Supporting you directly in a way that government has never done before, in addition to the package we have already set out for business,\u201d Johnson said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bde155c3-43e7-4929-8506-bb043a798a88\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2JsWf-2nN1Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The government has come under mounting pressure in recent days to do more to support ordinary people after taking unprecedented steps to help firms as the crisis worsens. Other countries have taken steps to support workers as the global pandemic intensives, including in the US, where the White House is looking at making direct cash payments to American citizens, and Denmark, where the state will pay 75% of workers\u2019 wages.</p> \n<p>French workers who are temporarily laid off by their employers due to the coronavirus crisis are entitled to claim \u201cpartial unemployment benefit\u201d equal to 84% of their wages, and employers are obliged to keep their jobs open for them.</p> \n<p>Sunak did not provide estimates for the cost of the government paying workers\u2019 wages, as the price tag will depend on the extent of firms taking up the offer. There are around 33 million workers in the British labour force, with just over a 10th of them self-employed. While unemployment is currently the lowest since the mid 1970s, it is expected to rise dramatically.</p> \n<p>The consultancy Capital Economics said the latest measures could cost around \u00a378bn and save hundreds of thousands of jobs. Without the wage subsidy, unemployment could have doubled to 8% with more than 1.5 million people tumbling out of work, they said.</p> \n<p>Instead, the jobless rate is now expected to climb to 6% with about 700,000 people losing their jobs.</p> \n<p>The chancellor also announced measures to strengthen the benefits safety net for people out of work, increasing the value of universal credit and tax credits by \u00a31,000 a year to help more than 4m vulnerable households across the country, in a package worth \u00a37bn. He also earmarked \u00a31bn of extra support for renters, ramping up housing benefit and universal credit so the local housing allowance will cover at least 30% of market rents in a local area.</p> \n<p>The government has been forced to revise its approach to tackling the Covid-19 outbreak on a daily basis as the increasing severity of the health pandemic and damage to the economy unfolds.</p> \n<p>Economists at Deutsche Bank forecast the British economy could suffer the worst recession for a century \u2013 outstripping the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 with millions of workers losing their jobs and the unemployment rate doubling.</p> \n<p>Sunak had initially earmarked \u00a312bn in last week\u2019s budget to soften the impact of the Covid-19 health pandemic, although the chancellor was rapidly forced to come back with fresh measures, while promising to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/rishi-sunak-coronavirus-budget-speech\">do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d</a> to see the UK through the crisis.</p>",

  "<p>No one needs telling that rugby is a long way down the list of current global priorities. A lot of people are stuck in coronavirus limbo \u2013 or worse \u2013 and in Exeter it is no different.</p> <p>\u201cIt all seems rather petty talking about the Premiership when we\u2019re in the grip of something potentially as big as it is,\u201d says Rob Baxter, whose ability to retain a clear sense of perspective is among his defining qualities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/20/premiership-rugby-clubs-players-pay-cut-coronavirus\">RFU ends season for all clubs beneath the Premiership due to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Baxter, though, still has a job to do. Until this season is formally abandoned \u2013 as with the Pro14 and all rugby in England beneath the Premiership \u2013 he must keep as many performance-related plates spinning as possible. With the Chiefs five points clear at the top of the league and still, in theory, European Champions\u2019 Cup contenders, there is no English club with more to lose should the plug be pulled completely.</p> <p>With pay cuts already being introduced at other Premiership clubs, the Exeter squad are at home working on individual training programmes. The escalating pandemic could well scupper everything but Baxter is trying to stay upbeat: \u201cAt this point there\u2019s still a lot of positivity about wanting to get every game played and there\u2019s still a window there to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Extending the season into July would be complicated, with the contracts of several players expiring at the end of June. Baxter can see that being problematic \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think you can just put in a new set of regulations\u201d \u2013 and is more concerned with ensuring the correct decisions are made regarding this season\u2019s title winners and the European qualifying places. \u201cPremiership promotion and relegation is probably not the big call this year. Given the Saracens scenario you\u2019ve got your relegation spot and in the Championship there is some space at the top for Newcastle.</p> <p>\u201cThat means the integrity of the competition rests on how we decide the winner and European qualification. What is the minimum [number of games]? We could sit here at Exeter and say: \u2018We don\u2019t need many more games to decide who comes out on top\u2019 but other clubs might want to play as many games as possible. It\u2019s going to be a very difficult balance but it would be great to end up with a competition which feels like it has some genuine integrity.\u201d</p> <p>There is no point in pretending the shutdown is not an untimely blow to Exeter\u2019s increasingly lofty aspirations. Take their in-form fly-half Joe Simmonds, for example. The 23-year-old\u2019s stock is on the rise, so much so that in normal circumstances he would be an England tour candidate for Japan this summer. He has been captaining his club, has missed fewer than half a dozen kicks in all competitions this season despite frequently terrible weather and his teammates rate him massively. \u201cI just hope he finally gets the recognition he deserves,\u201d says Gareth Steenson, his colleague and fellow dead-eyed kicker.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to me that in terms of international call-ups there\u2019s something desperately wrong. Maybe the English selectors don\u2019t come down to the south-west or something. I think Joe deserves to be in and around the England squad. You\u2019re talking about someone who is captaining one of the top teams in Europe and has only missed two or three kicks in the league all year. And he\u2019s still not in the squad. I find that a bit hard to believe.\u201d</p> <p>The next few weeks would have been the ideal moment for Simmonds \u2013 along with his brother Sam \u2013 to nudge a few more influential observers. At least he still has time on his side and England\u2019s current playmakers will not be around indefinitely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/19/premiership-clubs-release-wales-scotland-italy-players-if-six-nations-restarts\">Pro14 suspension extended indefinitely and Cardiff final in June cancelled</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the 2023 World Cup final Owen Farrell will be 32 and George Ford 30; at some stage, notwithstanding the talented Marcus Smith of Harlequins, the quietly-spoken lad from a lobster and crab fishing family in Teignmouth should be pushing for a full cap.

  "<p>The residents of a remote village on the Japanese island of Shikoku have spent almost two decades reusing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/recycling\">recycling</a> and reducing, united behind a mission to end their dependence on incinerators and landfill as the world struggles to tackle the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">climate emergency</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plastic\">plastic waste</a> crisis.</p> <p>Although Kamikatsu, an hour\u2019s drive from the nearest city, Tokushima, and 370 miles from Tokyo, has not managed to banish waste altogether, its heroic efforts have inspired other communities in Japan and further afield to take up the zero-waste challenge.</p> <p>Household waste must be separated into no fewer than 45 categories, before being taken to a collection centre where volunteers ensure items go into the correct bin, occasionally issuing polite reminders to anyone who forgets to take the lid and label off a plastic bottle or remove nails from a plank of wood.</p> <p>Items still in good condition end up at the Kuru Kuru recycling store, where residents can drop off or take home merchandise \u2013 mostly clothes, crockery and ornaments \u2013 free of charge.</p> <p>Not even the coronavirus pandemic has hampered the community\u2019s effort to bring waste generation down to nought (there are no orders to self-isolate in that part of Japan) but it was a quest with rather difficult beginnings.</p> <p>In 2000, the village was forced to change the way it managed its waste when a strict new law on dioxin emissions forced it to shut down its two small incinerators.</p> <p>The ageing, shrinking community did not have the money to build new incinerators or transport its waste to out-of-town facilities. The only option was to create less rubbish and to recycle as many items as possible.</p> <p>Three years later, Kamikatsu became the first place in Japan to pass a zero <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/waste\">waste</a> declaration \u2013 a statement of intent that met with initial opposition but which in the years since has created an unlikely community of ecowarriors.</p> <p>There were complaints that the regular cycle of sorting, washing and disposing of rubbish would prove too much for the village\u2019s 1,500 residents, who found themselves having to sort rubbish into myriad types, to compost food waste and to wash plastic bags and bottles so they could be recycled.</p> <p>\u201cYou are always going to get people who are uncooperative in any community-level project,\u201d said Akira Sakano, the head of Kamikatsu\u2019s nonprofit Zero Waste Academy, formed in 2005.</p> <p>Instead, she added, the academy focused its energies on the 80% of residents who supported the venture and who would, in time, persuade sceptics to follow suit.</p> <p>She said the village had struggled to find a way to recycle certain items that didn\u2019t fit into its waste categories, because manufacturers continued to use non-recyclable materials that inevitably found their way into Kamikatsu households.</p> <p>\u201cOur goal was to achieve zero waste by 2020, but we have encountered obstacles that involve stakeholders and regulations outside of our scope,\u201d said Sakano . \u201cAnd certain products are designed for single use, such as sanitary products, which are difficult to segregate because of the nature of the waste product.\u201d</p> <p>While reducing consumption has proved difficult, most villagers have embraced the recycling regime. As a result, the village has been able to keep the vast majority of its waste out of incinerators and landfill.</p> <p>Products that contain parts that fit into two or more categories have to be taken apart and their components placed in the correct bin. Milk cartons, cans, and even plastic food wrappers and shopping bags must be washed before being thrown out, and newspapers placed in neat bundles, secured with twine made from recycled milk cartons.</p> <p>Glass bottles are relieved of their caps and sorted by colour. Plastic bottles that once contained soy sauce or cooking oil are kept in a separate bin space with PET bottles used for drinks.</p> <p>In fiscal 2016, Kamikatsu recycled 81% of the waste it produced, compared to a national average of just 20%. The small number of items that have proved impossible to recycle, including leather shoes, nappies and other sanitary products, are sent to an incinerator outside the village.</p> <p>And it began addressing the growing problem of plastic, which makes up the majority of the residents\u2019 waste, well before the rest of the country.</p> <p>Japan is the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/27/japans-plastic-problem-tokyo-spearheads-push-at-g20-to-tackle-waste\">second-biggest producer of plastic waste</a> per capita after the US. Its consumers get through about 30bn plastic shopping bags a year, and it once shipped 1.5m tonnes of plastic waste to China every year until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/07/chinese-ban-on-plastic-waste-imports-could-see-uk-pollution-rise\">Beijing banned the imports in 2017</a>.</p> <p>As word of its campaign spread, the village has hosted officials and campaigners from overseas and other parts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan\">Japan</a> hoping to emulate the scheme in their own communities.</p> <p>Not all residents are convinced that the project can be easily replicated elsewhere, however. \u201cIt works because we\u2019re only 1,500 people here,\u201d said Naoko Yokoyama, who moved to Kamikatsu from Kyoto about two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be difficult in a big town with a larger population,\u201d because authorities would struggle to enforce it, Yokoyama told Agence France-Presse as the zero-waste deadline approached last year.</p> <p>To give the village a fighting chance of reaching its target at a later date, residents are encouraged not to buy or use products that may end up as waste, through a scheme that rewards them with points whenever they refuse single-use plastics. The points can then be used to buy other items.</p> <p>Sakano said the future of the zero-waste project would depend on businesses and local governments collaborating to make it easier for households to recycle, but added that individuals still had a duty to reuse and reduce. \u201cAs you can imagine, it\u2019s a lot easier to simply refuse plastic bags than to have to build somewhere to recycle them.\u201d</p> <p><em>Agencies contributed to this report</em></p>",

</figure>  <p><strong>Sunflowers, 1888, by Vincent Van Gogh</strong><br>Coronavirus has closed most museums and galleries in the UK, but some works of art are so vibrant they blaze even as reproductions. The rugged surface of Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers, as if scarred by the passion with which he loaded each brush stroke, gives this painting a substantial and organic presence that can be felt almost as strongly on the National Gallery\u2019s website as in its real presence. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/28/van-goghs-sunflowers-under-coronavirus-quarantine-in-tokyo\">The Sunflowers were put under quarantine in Tokyo in late February</a>, as part of 60 masterpieces on tour.) It would be fatuous right now to show some escapist summer scene as a pick-me-up. Van Gogh\u2019s joy in these yellow flowers, however, has a hard-won, desperate quality. He painted them soon after fleeing Paris, where drink and despair were killing him, for the south of France. He found a little house he liked in Arles, and painted a series of sunflower decorations all saturated, this one perhaps most of all, with his sheer wonder at a southern light and heat he\u2019d never experienced before.

That is creating intense pressure. And I think that intense pressure is what people have to understand is there and release it.</p> <p>\u201cThe priority now is the health and welfare of individuals and to take the stress out of the system,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that comes by telling the athletes it is not going to take place when they were told \u2013 and then for the authorities to take time in deciding when it should be staged in an orderly fashion.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the sporting calendar being almost entirely wiped out for the foreseeable future, the International Olympic Committee has continued to maintain that it intends to stage the Games in July. However athletes, including Britain\u2019s world heptathlon champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/katarina-johnson-thompson-criticises-ioc-for-olympics-preparation-advice\">are increasingly questioning the IOC\u2019s approach</a> when several countries are on lockdown, with facilities closed and competitions cancelled or postponed.

  "<p>WhatsApp is in talks to set up a dedicated NHS chatbot to allow people to access basic information about the coronavirus pandemic, sources with knowledge of the discussions told the Guardian, as the messaging service seeks to shed its growing reputation as a hub for disinformation about the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Any NHS chatbot is likely to follow the same pattern as the one the World Health Organization launched on Friday, which gives people access up-to-date information about the virus and emoji-laden guidance on how to combat its spread through the messaging service.</p> \n<p>WhatsApp sources said separately that it had also considered whether it should further limit the number of people and groups to whom a single message can be forwarded, but that no change was imminent. The service introduced a limit last year that prevents a single message or piece of content from being forwarded to more than five people or groups at a time in an attempt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/21/whatsapp-limits-message-forwarding-fight-fake-news\">to reduce the spread of fake news</a>. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

It has proved a vital tool for coordinating community response efforts but also a breeding ground for unsourced claims about the pandemic and its impacts. The role reflects WhatsApp\u2019s transition from a simple replacement app for text messaging into a de-facto social network built around groups of individuals who share similar interests.</p> \n<p>There are concerns that the government\u2019s communications team does not comprehend the scale and speed at which rumours spread on WhatsApp, making it hard for it to respond to unsourced and potentially damaging health claims or quarantine advice before it has become accepted as fact by large numbers of people.</p> \n<p>\u201cNot only is this a global health crisis, it\u2019s the first global health crisis in the age of social media,\u201d said the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, who called for closer cooperation between tech firms and government officials. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge responsibility on social media firms and governments to ensure fake news does not spread rapidly,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-in-your-area\">Coronavirus UK: how many confirmed cases are in your area?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThis all comes back to the growing anxiety about the mixed messages coming from government.

More outlandish false claims suggest the virus was created in a Chinese laboratory and spread from an aircraft over Europe.</p> \n<p>Nor do WhatsApp messages show the original source or author of the information, while also gaining from the fact that people are more likely to trust information sent to them by close friends and family.</p> \n<p>At the same time, however, the service has become invaluable for many organising community responses.

  "<p>It was a grisly end to a story that has been a stain on India for almost eight years.

The calls to \u201chang the rapist\u201d have been an easy way for politicians to be seen to respond to cases of sexual violence, while ignoring the endemic underlying issues that make India the most dangerous country in the world to be a woman, where a woman is raped every 20 minutes.</p> <p>While the case shocked the world and prompted the government into so-called action, in reality little has changed. The degradation of women remains systemic and women in India, in both rural and urban communities, have to spend large proportions of their days planning ahead, just to make sure they can get to their next destination safely. The mechanisms for women to report sexual violence remain woefully inadequate, more than 100,000 rape cases remain in the courts, and state governments are reluctant to even invest in basic safety measures such as street lighting. The fact that the 10bn-rupee (\u00a3112m) fund set up by the government after the murder \u2013 to give states money to invest in women\u2019s safety initiatives \u2013 remains 91% unspent demonstrates that even when there is funding, there is no motivation to tackle the problem.</p> <p>While the Indian newspapers are filled on a daily basis with gruesome stories of rapes and murders of women of all ages, it was the gang-rape of a 27-year-old vet in Hyderabad in November that again captured global headlines and showed how little had changed. The threat of capital punishment did not stop the four men from allegedly sabotaging the woman\u2019s scooter, lying in wait until she approached asking for help, then gang-raping her, suffocating her and burning her body.</p> <p>After the event, yet again, the resounding response was for the men to be immediately hanged. When the culprits were later shot in suspicious circumstances by the police, who claimed they had been attempting to escape, there was nationwide jubilation. Until there is an acceptance across society and government that violence begets violence and that executing several culprits is not the cure for the endemic and enduring plague of sexual violence nationwide, both safety and justice will remain out of reach for the women of India.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>\u2018It was like a cattle market\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Sally-Ann Fawcett, author, former beauty </strong></em><em><strong>contestant and judge</strong></em></p> <p>From a historical point of view, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/10/misbehaviour-review-1970-miss-world-contest-keira-knightley-jessie-buckley\">the film Misbehaviour</a>\u2019s sequence of events was incredibly accurate: a women\u2019s liberation group \u2013 including activists Sally (played by Keira Knightley) and Jo (Jessie Buckley) \u2013 set out to disrupt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/miss-world-contest-1970-new-film-misbehaviour-jennifer-hosten-first-black-winner\">the 1970 Miss World contest</a> at the Royal Albert Hall in London. They bought tickets and chose their moment to stand up, shake football rattles, shout, scream and throw flour bombs on to the stage. It was a pivotal moment. To do that during a live broadcast in front of millions of viewers \u2013 they really did make their mark. A lot of women took inspiration from that.</p> <p>I think things could have been stronger, though. I once met one of the protesters and she said one of them actually threw a rattle \u2013 and it only narrowly missed the head of Joan Collins, who was a judge. And they were really sorry they did that. In the film, it was more about the flour bombs, shouting and screaming. But I think it was trying to show all the angles in a very empathetic way.</p> <p>There were one or two small errors. For example, they referred to the contest as a pageant. Miss World wasn\u2019t called a pageant until at least the 1990s. It was a \u201cbeauty contest\u201d. And there is a storyline about the inclusion of South Africa\u2019s first black contestant, Pearl Jansen, known as Miss Africa South, during the apartheid era. That was portrayed as the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/10/guardianobituaries2\">Eric Morley, the owner of the contest</a>, though it was actually the idea of his wife\u2019s PA. It was shown as a triumph but it didn\u2019t pan out that way: six years later, South Africa was not allowed to enter either a black or white contestant \u2013 although I realise nobody at the time would have known this.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUa0Mtdv1HQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZUa0Mtdv1HQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUa0Mtdv1HQ\">Watch a trailer for Misbehaviour</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>I met Morley and I think they got him pretty spot on. He had a flamboyance. There was a documentary from 1975 that showed him shouting and screaming at the contestants, as he does in the film. They got his wife Julia right insofar as she was trying to steer him in a more PC direction. Eventually, she got rid of the swimsuit section.</p> <p>They were spot-on with the host, the US entertainer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/29/guardianobituaries.film\">Bob Hope</a>, too. His wife says something like: \u201cWe know what happened last time you hosted it \u2013 you brought the winner home.\u201d He had an affair with Miss World 1961. It wasn\u2019t mentioned explicitly in the film but for those who know, it was cleverly done. In real life, Julia had to hang on to Hope\u2019s arm after the attack because he wanted to dash off to the dressing room and not come back.</p> <p>There is a scene where a large group of male journalists and photographers run at the contestants. That sort of thing happened. Bookmakers would take bets and you would see the chief bookmaker going up to the contestants, looking them up and down and writing notes. It really was like a cattle market, as the feminist group says. Miss World was massive business in the 70s and 80s. Only recently has interest dropped.</p> <p>Morley later admitted that, even though the protest did shake them, they realised all the publicity actually kept Miss World alive. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/dec/08/miss-world-to-the-rescue-the-beauty-contest-in-an-age-of-multiculturalism\">It continues</a> but there\u2019s no swimwear parade and it\u2019s a lot more about the women\u2019s personal achievements and charity work. Is it still a narrow definition of beauty? It is \u2013 but it\u2019s about an overall persona. I don\u2019t think pageants are as relevant today, not the way they were in the 60s and 70s, when they actually were a stepping stone for women.</p> <p><em>Sally-Ann Fawcett is the author of Misdemeanours: Beauty Queen Scandals</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c248e3e1f4d8d8b6e746fc3863202e0595300834\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c248e3e1f4d8d8b6e746fc3863202e0595300834/0_122_3030_1817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019re angry\u2019 \u2026 Women\u2019s Liberation activists protest against the Miss World contest in 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re angry\u2019 \u2026 Women\u2019s Liberation activists protest against the Miss World contest in 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: W Breeze/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018Hopefully, women today have more choices\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Ann Sidney, actor and Miss World 1964</strong></em></p> <p>When I won Miss World we still had black and white TV. It was 1964 and I was a hairdresser, earning 30 shillings a week. Suddenly I was on a pedestal \u2013 and it was fragile. At that time, we went to modelling schools and all wanted to be debutantes. Beauty contests were a stepping stone for working-class kids, or so we believed. It was an amazing experience for me. I\u2019ve travelled around the world five times. I had to do fashion shows \u2013 but I said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a model, can I at least compere?\u201d</p> <p>I found the film was very entertaining and fair. It didn\u2019t take sides, though I think they portrayed Eric Morley a bit cruelly, and Bob Hope. Eric was tough, it was his contest \u2013 after the war, we wanted to celebrate beauty again. But he was always very professional with me. He was portrayed as being very bossy and we all know that wouldn\u2019t be acceptable today. Expectations were different for women: we weren\u2019t used to standing up so much for ourselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d495425686aca2ed88d9cf753e1366a79f24b5c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d495425686aca2ed88d9cf753e1366a79f24b5c1/0_392_3203_1922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protest erupts inside the Royal Albert Hall in 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protest erupts inside the Royal Albert Hall in 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonard Burt/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The camaraderie that exists between the girls really comes across in the film. In those days, lots of beauty contests were held up north, like in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackpool\">Blackpool</a>. It was a way to make a considerable amount of money. One day, one girl would win; the next, somebody else. As Miss World, whenever I toured anywhere, all those girls from the contest came out to visit me. Julia Morley said something about \u201cfurthering the cause of international friendship\u201d and this was true.</p> <p>The feminist group rightly felt it objectified women. As a Miss World, you are a trophy, you are objectified, but you can have a lot worse things to deal with. I never felt uncomfortable. I\u2019m 75 now but I was coming up to 20 when I won. I had a different mindset. We were much more naive and it might not be a choice that I would make now if I were the same age. Hopefully, women today have more choices. I think it\u2019s wrong to choose one woman over another. In this day and age, it doesn\u2019t fit well.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t aware of feminists making a noise about beauty contests when I competed. These days, beauty contest are looked down upon.

  "<p>When Enid Blyton wrote the schoolgirl series Malory Towers after the second world war she injected tales of hope and camaraderie into it to reflect a Britain coming together after a time of crisis.</p> <p>Now the BBC hopes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/06/why-we-still-adore-malory-towers-enid-blyton\">its modern adaptation</a> of the boarding school adventures of 12-year-old Darrell Rivers will do the same and it has brought the programme forward by a fortnight to Monday as a boost for children missing their final week of school because of the coronavirus.</p> <p>Although TV\u2019s first adaption of Malory Towers is set in the late 1940s, it has been brought up to date with an ethnically, socially and visually diverse cast and contains many themes relevant to today\u2019s audience.</p> <p>Sasha Hails and Rachel Flowerday, who adapted the books for the 13-part TV show, said it has a particular resonance in the current climate.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like absolutely the right time to tell it \u2026 as part of the exploration of our times,\u201d said Hails.</p> <p>She said despite Malory Towers being about schoolgirls: \u201cThis is a show for families, kids can watch it with their parents and grandparents; they\u2019re universal stories.\u201d</p> <p>The rise of the #MeToo movement also makes the time right for Malory Towers, as Flowerday explained.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a brilliant quiet feminism in the books and we wanted to draw on that. It was so liberating and exciting writing a show where nearly every character on screen nearly all of the time is female.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really powerful we\u2019re able to do that; we\u2019re at a place in the world where people will sit down, we hope, and watch it. Almost every scene passes the Bechdel test!\u201d</p> <p>Zoey Siewert, who plays prankster Alicia Johns, added: \u201cMost of the cast is girls and women and I love that because there\u2019s not a lot of women who are main roles in shows these days.\u201d</p> <p>Her co-star Ella Bright, who plays Rivers, said her character was \u201cquite a feminist role model\u201d, which was \u201ca good message for young children, especially young girls\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa1c6d0c80ef3363c7311d78fb4f0584ba7db6e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa1c6d0c80ef3363c7311d78fb4f0584ba7db6e9/0_218_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ella Bright in Malory Towers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ella Bright in Malory Towers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Genower/BBC/WildBrain/Queen Bert Limited</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Blyton has been criticised in the past for not being relevant, producer Grainne McNamara said: \u201cActually Blyton is quite progressive in her thinking \u2026 the way she represented those girls in the school is you can go out and be anything and do anything you want, and I think the TV series has really tried to lift that out of the book and focus on it.\u201d</p> <p>The show has kept the fun, midnight feast and tricks from the books but does not shy away from darker themes such as bullying, loss and vaccinations. The TV version has introduced new characters and ideas such as dyslexia but overall it has what McNamara called \u201ca warm sunny feel\u201d making it like \u201cDownton Abbey for children\u201d.</p> <p>Filmed in Canada and on location in Cornwall and at Devon country house, Hartland Abbey, McNamara said: \u201cIt looks like the Railway Children; we\u2019ve consciously made it like that [so] you\u2019d want to go there. We want every viewer to want to go to Malory Towers and feel they want to be Darrell Rivers or Gwen or whoever.\u201d</p> <p>More diverse characters have also been introduced as Hails explained: \u201cWe obviously wanted a diverse cast, as did the BBC, to represent our viewers of today but we wanted it to be authentic. Once we dug in it was quite clear that Britain has been more diverse than it\u2019s often accounted for.\u201d</p> <p>With 500m worldwide sales of Blyton\u2019s books, there has been global interest in the series, which is being co-produced by David Walliams\u2019 company King Bert and Canadian company WildBrain. Flowerday admitted they felt the pressure to get it right: \u201cIt was really important that we did it justice and the cast and crew have done that.\u201d</p> <p>McNamara said \u201csackloads of mail\u201d had been sent to King Bert by fans of the books, \u201cpeople are just so excited about it. I think it\u2019s that real nostalgia for it\u201d.</p> <p>Danya Griver, who plays Gwendoline Mary Lacey, said many of the themes in the six Malory Towers books were relevant to children today: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see things don\u2019t always go to plan; life is great and you must always treasure the things that go well but sometimes they don\u2019t and I think it\u2019s important for people to see if they\u2019ve gone through a bad time they\u2019re not the only one.\u201d</p> <p>This Country star Ashley McGuire, who plays Matron, said despite the modernisations: \u201cWe do try to stay faithful to how they would have talked.</p> <p>\u201cThe sensibilities in those books are things we still look for today; they\u2019ve got a comradeship \u2026 they fight for one another; they\u2019ve got good values. Some things are very different but it\u2019s not a million miles away from how we want our children to enjoy school and one another. They take care of each other.\u201d</p> <p>Malory Towers will air on BBC iPlayer from Monday and on CBBC in April.<br></p>",
  "<p>The world\u2019s most vulnerable people could be last in line for support to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, experts have warned. </p> <p>Countries already dealing with humanitarian and refugee crises face a struggle to find the resources to deal with the pandemic by the time it reaches them, specialists said in a webinar hosted by the <a href=\"https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/\">New Humanitarian</a> news agency on Thursday.</p> <p>Protective equipment and resources for testing are already a concern for China and Europe, but a third wave could leave developing countries with weakened health systems in a worse position \u2013 even though most currently have a relatively small number of cases.</p> <p>Experts working with refugees, on humanitarian responses and in global health warned that the international community needs to begin working closely with governments around the world to help the most vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite ready yet for the fights that are coming over limited supplies of personal protective equipment, limited supplies of vaccines and limited supplies of therapeutics,\u201d said Jeremy Konyndyk, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington DC.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the first 100m doses of the vaccines come out, it\u2019s going to be a big fight over who gets those, and it\u2019s going to be very important that [they don\u2019t] just go to those who can afford them.\u201d</p> <p>Africa has had about 600 cases, compared with thousands in many individual European countries.

The problem is low-income countries are probably arriving on the third wave, after China, after Europe. Access to tests is going to be problematic,\u201d said Blanchet.</p> <p>While many richer countries were currently focused on their own populations and economies, the humanitarian community would have to look at changing the way it works, said the experts, by investing in the strengthening of worldwide public health systems rather than focusing on single-issue campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not just about providing services in a refugee site or a conflict-affected area, this is really about the fundamental of health systems and about health-seeking and health-protecting behaviour across entire countries,\u201d said Konyndyk. \u201cThat is not something that we in the humanitarian sector are always terribly well set up for.\u201d</p> <p>Konyndyk said the sector would have to work more with governments and local organisations, who have the trust of the communities with which they work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/19/community-infections-could-happen-any-time-kenya-prepares-for-covid-19-coronavirus\">'Community infections could happen any time': Kenya prepares for Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Virginie Lef\u00e8vre, programme and partnerships coordinator with the Lebanese NGO Amel Association, said she was already seeing examples of local workers leading the way.</p> <p>\u201cThe locally-led response, the community-based initiatives are working despite the fear.

  "<p>As with millions of other parents around the world, when our two sons get home from school this afternoon, we have no idea when they\u2019ll be going back. Their schools have been hastily scrabbling together remote learning plans, but things are going to be chaotic and unstructured and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll all have to learn to deal with. What I know for certain is that my boys will have one thing on their mind: video games.</p> <p>What they\u2019re picturing (and I can almost see the thought bubbles above their heads when we talk to them about the school closure) is three months in front of the TV playing Apex Legends. You may be in a similar situation in your household, and you may already be feeling guilty about the amount of time your children will end up spending in front of screens simply because you have work to do and their options are limited.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The value of video games is normality. It\u2019s not thinking, for a few moments, about what all this means and where it\u2019s going</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And while it\u2019s going to be important to manage screen time, to work out some form of educational routine and to get the children outside once in a while, you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty if they\u2019re spending more time than usual playing games. There already seems to be a clamour on social media to outdo one another in self-isolation planning. Frankly, if your kids aren\u2019t making artisan soda bread every morning, followed by YouTube pilates, then two hours of conversational French over Skype to a family in Bordeaux than you\u2019re not cutting it.</p> <p>But you <em>are</em> cutting it. You still have a job, you still have to provide for your family, and if that means more time for the kids on games, that is okay. It\u2019s okay.</p> <p>As I have spent my career trying to get across, video games aren\u2019t that bad. They\u2019re not all violent. They\u2019re not all anarchic and noisy. Some are highly creative, they teach a variety of skills, and they\u2019re social. Playing Fortnite or Overwatch or Minecraft is a vital element in a lot of friendships. When my sons play online with their friends, they chat about their lives and have a laugh: at this time, when they\u2019re unable to meet up, playing games together is going to be a vital way to stay in touch.</p> <p>It\u2019s also normal. If parents find the current situation scary and bewildering, what must our children think? In this environment of constant rapid change, games offer something familiar and steady \u2013 they offer rules of engagement and involvement that never change. As the parent of an autistic child I have long understood this under-appreciated element of video games \u2013 they are machines of routine; you get out exactly what you put in. How comforting, how reliable.</p> <p>Sure, do what you can in your community to get children together virtually, through apps such as Skype, Google Hangout and Zoom; do what you can to keep them learning. But don\u2019t fret about games, don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. If nothing else, games can be added into a home education plan: the <a href=\"https://education.minecraft.net/\">Minecraft Education</a> site has a wealth of exercises based around a variety of subjects, while Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey has a tour mode that teaches participants about the Peloponnesian War. Your children can learn about architecture and urban planning from City Skylines or about agriculture from Farming Simulator.</p> <p>But really, the value of video games is normality. It\u2019s hanging out with friends and making jokes at each other\u2019s expense. It\u2019s not thinking, for a few moments, about what all this means and where it\u2019s going. You don\u2019t have to indulge in self-isolation oneupmanship, and you don\u2019t have to feel bad for falling short on the ideal that\u2019s forming on Facebook and Twitter. You can just get through it. That\u2019s enough. And if games are a part of that, fine. They certainly will be in our household.</p>",
  "<p>It should not have come as a surprise. Life had already been upended in China. Iran and Italy have been reeling for a month.

We need some really serious effort to make these bat crossings more effective, or just decide that this is not an effective use of money for conservation.

By the time I emerged from the train station someone had pressed into my hand details of a self-guided tour of the city\u2019s services, and off I set for a couple of hours\u2019 free entertainment \u2013 I wasn\u2019t feeling flush, so it helped that I didn\u2019t have to spend a penny.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e9b88112d4c098d8534ff9a85022cd59ae3293e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9b88112d4c098d8534ff9a85022cd59ae3293e5/0_0_2101_3051/689.jpg\" alt=\"Sim Jae-duck, South Korea\u2019s leading sanitation activist and head of the Korea Toilet Association, in October 2007\" width=\"689\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sim Jae-duck, South Korea\u2019s leading sanitation activist and head of the Korea Toilet Association, in October 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is easy to mock, but even to this most amateur of architecture critics the toilets \u2013 each unique in design \u2013 were genuinely extraordinary. Indeed, the amount of thought and trouble lavished on structures of such humble purpose meant it was not only my bowels that found them moving. A lot of toil had gone into these toilets, and to an outsider the idea that even minor and potentially even unpleasant details could be turned into a positive source of pride if only they were given a little respect and attention seemed emblematic of the nation\u2019s entire approach to tournament-hosting. They were meaningful and important and also quite silly, and all the better for the combination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=My%20Favourite%20Game&amp;description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"In our new series, Guardian writers recall the great sporting contests they will never forget\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=Sport&opinion-tint=false&title=My%20Favourite%20Game&description=In%20our%20new%20series%2C%20Guardian%20writers%20recall%20the%20great%20sporting%20contests%20they%20will%20never%20forget&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsport%2Fseries%2Fmy-favourite-game&links=false\">In our new series, Guardian writers recall the great sporting contests they will never forget</a> </figure>  <p>By the time the game kicked off I was intoxicated by the heady combination of ancient fortresses, several toilets, a healthy serving of Suwon galbi \u2013 renowned as the tastiest beef ribs in all Korea \u2013 complete with an unexpected and not exactly welcome spicy raw-crab side dish, and a great deal of sunshine. Brazil needed only to avoid defeat to top the group but instead of approaching the game with caution they scored five and let in a couple.

  "<p>At the height of the blitz in 1941, the labour minister Ernie Bevin so disliked an official called William Beveridge that he got rid of him to write a report on national insurance. As the bombs fell, an angry Beveridge proposed an entire postwar \u201cwelfare state\u201d, with financial security \u201cfrom cradle to grave\u201d. No one seemed to mind the cost. There was a war on. The rest is history.</p> <p>There is no war today, just politicians who love comparing their roles to those of their blitz counterparts. But every crisis is an opportunity. What might emerge from coronavirus that is on a par with Beveridge?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Beveridge wrote at a time when his beneficiaries also relied on institutional good neighbourliness. Today that has gone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The welfare state is not equipped for pandemic or economic trauma. Its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/retired-and-student-medics-may-be-called-in-to-tackle-covid-19-in-uk\">NHS</a> gigantism and lumbering benefits regime are slow moving and often inhumane. Private citizens are having to use technology to fall back on otherwise eerily medieval forms of support. My street has a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-mutual-aid-how-to-help-the-vulnerable-near-you\">WhatsApp group</a> to help the housebound elderly. A Gloucestershire pub is home-delivering its drinks, and food. A Devon farmer offers drive-in produce, with volunteer dance classes, hairdressing and a nursery.</p> <p>These and a thousand other ventures are struggling to relieve distress, loneliness and, in many cases, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-exposed-extent-uk-social-crisis\">financial ruin</a>. But they are handicapped by the disappearance over recent decades of all that is vital in British neighbourhoods: high streets, police stations, banks, libraries, youth clubs, day centres and cottage hospitals. People have been forced back on neighbours, on geography. When systems fail, geography matters. They can\u2019t stop you walking down the street. Not yet.</p> <p>Beveridge sought a state that provided everyone who needed it with cash and care. But he was writing at a time when his beneficiaries also relied on institutional good neighbourliness. Today that has gone. We need local testing centres, local food supplies, local elderly care, local employment assistance, above all, local leadership. Unlike in continental Europe, the UK has almost no civic mayors, no public administrators who know their clients. These are replaced by distant, form-waving bureaucrats.</p> <p>Most marked at present is food security. High streets have been shutting at an alarming rate. Goodness knows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/19/the-fortress-uk-firms-best-placed-to-weather-the-coronavirus-crisis\">what will be left</a> when the virus relents. British food retailing relies on private supply chains, and these, as shown in a new book, Feeding Britain by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tim-lang\">Tim Lang</a>, are highly vulnerable to short-term shocks. Half of the UK\u2019s food <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldeucom/129/129.pdf\">now comes from abroad</a>, Lang says, and 90% of fruit and vegetables. First go the toilet rolls, then what?</p> <p>A new Beveridge should grasp the gaps in social cohesion that are being revealed by coronavirus. The components of a \u201cvillage\u201d matter \u2013 be it rural hamlet, market town or city street \u2013 and they are not binary. They are not conditioned by a corporatist state on the one hand and a capitalist free-market on the other. An intermediate tier of \u201cassociation\u201d has been ripped away, the businesses, the encounters and activities that lubricate community. As Robert Putnam wrote of the US, Britain now \u201cgoes bowling alone\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/30/google-mo-gawdat-solve-for-happy-interview\">Happiness theory</a> is supposedly in fashion. But rarely is it related to localism. The local seems trivial. Its appeal crumbles before the target-driven bulldozer of Beveridge\u2019s central state. I am sure the NHS campaign to close cottage hospitals, like the Home Office\u2019s to replace police stations with patrol cars, passed every quantifiable test. No one counted the naked insecurity of the resulting communities. What is unquantifiable in modern government does not register.</p> <p>Close one pub in a high street and it is one less nuisance. Close the last pub, and the street loses its heart. British pubs are closing at a rate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/22/uk-pub-closure-rate-halves-as-communities-fight-back\">some 900 a year</a>. Build over one playing field, too bad. But some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/02/tory-cuts-force-sale-710-local-football-pitches\">700 pitches have closed</a> in the past decade, and obesity rates have soared. Some 5,000 parish churches lie virtually empty. No one has an idea <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/27/britain-churches-cathedrals-anglican\">what do with them</a>.</p> <p>Like a brick removed from a wall, each closure of a local institution may be an economy. Close them all and social association collapses. We lose what de Tocqueville called democracy\u2019s \u201cmother science \u2026 the spirit of association\u201d. Its absence turns nations into \u201catomised\u201d states, vulnerable to autocratic populism.</p> <p>For the present, the British government is rushing troops to the front. It is waiving taxes and rents, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/the-chancellors-stimulus-package-doesnt-go-nearly-far-enough\">offering grants and loans</a>. It is even moving hesitantly where it once feared to tread, towards cash-in-hand \u201chelicopter\u201d money, or \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/peacetime-constraints-ditched-in-the-war-for-economic-survival\">people\u2019s quantitative easing</a>\u201d. Those of us who suggested this during the 2008 crisis were ridiculed for printing money and \u201cgiving it to just anyone\u201d. As it was, QE vanished into the maw of banks.

I believe a new Beveridge might, as did the old one, take our minds off the traumatised present and look to the future. It would ask what are the essential components of what we mean by community, be they social or private enterprise, retail, therapeutic, leisure or cultural. It would consider what regulatory and financial support they need to help keep communities alive as social entities. As the saying now goes, what are their true foundational values?</p> <p>The British government is already compiling \u201cpublic goods\u201d to be expected \u2013 and subsidised \u2013 from farmers, in place of EU agricultural policy. They are identifying birds, bees, soil, trees, hedgerows, streams, even beauty. But if birds and bees merit such guardianship, why not the environment of human beings? What about the \u201cpublic goods\u201d that are embraced by towns and cities?</p> <p>Government seems to value the institutions of nature, but not those of humanity.

Fox News has had an outsized role in spreading misinformation, with anchors and guests saying that \u201cnow is actually the safest time to fly\u201d, arguing that people are \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/revrrlewis/status/1238446956793528320\">overreacting</a>\u201d to the virus, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/business/media/trish-regan-fox-hiatus.html\">suggesting</a> that the virus is an \u201cimpeachment scam\u201d.</p> <p>The British government also appeared oblivious to the public health threat of unmitigated contagion by adopting an unbelievably ill-advised strategy of abandoning serious containment efforts in favor of \u201csome kind of herd immunity\u201d to temper later surges of infection. Notably, this strategy does nothing to prevent hospitals from being overrun in the first and largest surge. (The British government has since modulated its rhetoric.)</p> <p>As of this writing, authorities seem finally to be gaining some momentum in making the sort of aggressive decisions that can slow the virus\u2019s spread. My mother texted earlier this week to say that Houston, where she lives, is closing bars and limiting restaurants to takeout. Donald Trump has recommended that all Americans limit gatherings to fewer than 10 people. These are important steps in the right direction, but they still rely to a substantial degree on the choices that individual people will make.</p> <p>Why is it so difficult for us to appreciate the scale of what an unchecked global pandemic could do? The answer may have something to do with how difficult it is to intuitively understand abstract concepts like exponential growth.</p> <p>This difficulty has been appreciated since at least 1256, when an Islamic scholar recorded what is known as the wheat and chessboard problem. The problem appears in a parable about the inventor of chess, whose king demands to purchase the new game. The inventor names his price, to be paid in wheat. He suggested that one grain of wheat should be placed on the first square of the chessboard, two grains on the second, and so on, with the sum doubling in this way over 64 squares. The king thinks this a great bargain, and is stunned when his treasurer informs him that the sum would bankrupt the kingdom. The total number of grains comes to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.</p> <p>Here\u2019s another example. If you took 30 steps from your front door, with each step twice as large as the last, how far could you get? The answer might surprise you \u2013 it\u2019s 26 times the Earth\u2019s circumference. Our inability to appreciate how extraordinarily powerful exponential growth can be has concrete consequences. It\u2019s a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S1?mod=article_inline&amp;\">major reason</a> why people don\u2019t take their retirement accounts seriously enough, for one. It\u2019s also why people seem to be struggling to understand why every single day matters enormously in limiting the spread of the coronavirus, which follows an exponential growth pattern.</p> <p>We are already in the midst of exponential growth in the coronavirus outbreak, with every indicator suggesting that the virus is now spreading unchecked within communities across the country.</p> <p>The good news, though, is that if we act today instead of tomorrow we can prevent a <em>huge</em> number of infections, and a lot of deaths. Time is of the absolute essence here, and it\u2019s individual choices that matter the most. Aggressive social distancing, avoiding all non-essential social contact, avoiding public places like bars, restaurants and movie theaters, and practicing obsessive hand hygiene are all critically important. If you have any cold or flu-like symptoms, assume you have the coronavirus and isolate yourself as strictly as possible until two to three days after all symptoms have resolved. If you develop shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, or marked weakness, then please see a doctor.</p> <p>It\u2019s a rare situation when the lives of others are in the hands of regular people everywhere, young and old, rich and poor, no matter your occupation, and no matter where you live. We\u2019re living it right now. Please take it so, so seriously.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Clayton Dalton is an emergency medicine resident physician at Massachusetts General hospital</em><em> in Boston</em></p></li> </ul>",

service.</strong> This approach seeks integrated enterprise-scale workflow processing capability that could be utilised across the commonwealth.</p> \n   <p>Key to this is recognising the efficiencies that can be generated from large-scale government investment in technology and the reuse of capability across government.</p> \n   <p><strong>The home affairs department will conduct a market consultation process in the coming months seeking industry engagement and insights into the best way to deliver large-scale workflow processing capability for visa and citizenship applications and additionally, for customs functions and personnel security clearances in the home affairs portfolio.</strong></p> \n   <p>While current visa systems continue to function, they are out of date, and processing and decision making in many cases is still undertaken manually, supported by old technology and limited risk assessment capabilities.</p> \n   <p>With this approach, systems and capabilities will be well-placed to meet future demands, enabling the government to respond to emerging global threats and improving service delivery across government.</p> \n   <p>The work the department has done in recent years to modernise its visa service delivery arrangements will be utilised and extended to other areas in developing and specifying the requirements for this much broader capability, on which visa processing will still be the first product delivered.</p> \n   <p><strong>The home affairs department has consequently terminated the request for tender process for its

  "<p>I started ice skating when I was four. Initially, I was just tagging along with my sister, but soon enough the sport became my entire life. In 2004, when I was 10, I won the Moscow Championships and I was a candidate to become a \u201cmaster of sport\u201d \u2013 a Russian title for international champions who have made valuable contributions to sport. I was told that I had what it took to become a professional and even take part in the Olympics. I didn\u2019t go to school, because I had to train for up to six hours a day. All of my friends were ice skaters; it was the only thing I knew.</p> <p>When I was 12, puberty kicked in. I started menstruating and my body changed rapidly. Even though I was just an average teenager, I knew right away that there would be a chance my body would prevent me from being the best skater I could be. With a bigger body, I would no longer be able to do some of the complicated jumps that are necessary for competitions. Besides, in ice skating, a slim, childish body is the beauty standard. A curvy body is not.</p> <p>Training was tough: I had to follow a strict diet. For every kilo I gained, I had to run extra kilometres on top of my usual 15km. My body was being pushed to extremes. I ruined my knees trying to lose weight, but my body never went back to its prepubescent state, despite all the effort.</p> <p>At this point, I was advised to take medication that would block the production of hormones: I would stop menstruating, my breasts would stop growing \u2013 and I would keep my young, slim body. I never questioned it. In Russia, it is widely known that young ice skaters use hormone blockers to keep their bodies from changing. In most cases, taking the hormone blockers works \u2013 although there are always side-effects, such as problems with your nervous system and your heart, that no one really talks about.</p> <p>I don\u2019t think that the professional ice skating judges are explicitly sexist for not liking a voluptuous female body: the weight of your breasts really does affect your jumps. But many young girls are pushed to a point at which they have to quit the sport entirely; they literally break their bodies. All the older professional skaters have metal screws and plates in their bodies, because they have been ruined by competing. My sister is 25 years old and has fake knees.</p> <p>In my case, the drugs backfired \u2013 they had the opposite effect to the one intended. I took them for only three months, but my breasts grew rapidly and I gained 36kg (5st 9lb) in six months. I never got back to my normal body. There was no longer any chance of me competing at the highest level, so I quit ice skating altogether.</p> <p>Losing everything I had fought for caused me to sink into a deep depression for most of my teenage years. It also meant that, aged 14, I had to go to school for the first time. It was harsh. I was bullied a lot and people called me fat all the time. It wasn\u2019t even something I was mad about: in Russia, it is normal to scold someone for being overweight.</p> <p>Eventually, I realised I could get out of my depression only by redefining who I was and no longer focusing on my weight. I decided to start educating myself; I learned Spanish and went to law school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/06/experience-ive-been-protesting-for-seven-decades\">Experience: I\u2019ve been protesting for seven decades</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Russia, there is no system in place to create a healthy sports environment for children. Some figures within ice skating have started publicly criticising these medications, but there was nothing in place to protect me.</p> <p>I am now a coach myself. I teach only children who skate to improve their health, not those who do so with the intention of becoming professionals. Also, ice skating is an expensive sport: if you want to train with a renowned coach, you have to pay thousands of pounds a month. But the kids who need these classes for their health usually don\u2019t have a lot of money, so my lessons are very cheap.</p> <p>I am thankful that this happened to me, and that I was young enough to turn my focus to something other than sport, so I could become the best version of myself.</p> <p><strong>\u2022</strong>As told to Djanlissa Pringels</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

  "<p>The first episode of the new <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2020/12/the-nest\">BBC drama The Nest</a> makes for fascinating viewing. Dan and Emily are having a baby. They are in love, rich, and live in a massive house in Glasgow. The first episode opens with them debating baby names \u2026 but it is not Emily who\u2019s pregnant. After years of trying for a baby they have turned to surrogacy.</p> <p>They bump into 18-year-old Kaya. She is poor and disenfranchised; the couple are rich and secure. She offers to carry their baby and Emily readily agrees, but Dan worries about the ethics of such an arrangement.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Surrogacy raises the the issue of conflicting rights. Does anyone have the right to their own child?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Surrogacy has a high profile right now. A <a href=\"https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/surrogacy/\">UK government consultation</a> is reviewing the current laws, with some campaigners arguing that commercial surrogacy, which is currently illegal, should be allowed in this country. Big Fertility, which is what it really is, pulls in big money: as far back as 2012 the industry was worth an estimated \u00a34.7 bn a year.</p> <p>Altruistic surrogacy is legal in the UK, with the surrogate being allowed to claim up to \u00a315,000 in expenses. But a surrogacy agreement cannot be backed up by the law. This means that the child\u2019s legal parent is the birth mother, therefore she can subsequently refuse to hand over the baby. Legal parenthood can only be transferred by parental order or adoption after a child is born.</p> <p>I have investigated the surrogacy trade for a number of years, travelling to California, Ukraine and India, all notorious for providing legal commercial surrogacy services. In India, I posed as a woman desperate to pay a younger woman to have a baby for me. The clinics I visited could source eggs from eastern Europe and rent a womb in Gujarat. No questions were asked about why a woman in her 50s would go to such lengths to have a baby. When I asked how the surrogate mothers were treated, I was reassured not about their rights, but that the women \u201cobey all the rules\u201d and are required to sign a contract that ties them into the arrangement, even if they change their mind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/01/outsourcing-pregnancy-india-surrogacy-clinics-julie-bindel\">Outsourcing pregnancy: a visit to India's surrogacy clinics | Julie Bindel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I spoke with Nicole Taylor, the writer of The Nest, who told me that she decided to tackle surrogacy in order to explore her own sense of conflict around the commercial market. \u201cObviously there can be issues with altruistic surrogacy, too,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cBut the drama is specifically about a pact between two women that bundles together hopes of healing and helping with a cash payment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I liked about the idea is the plausibility of it [to me] \u2013 that two desperate people could be drawn to each other in this way and, because of their trauma and the magical thinking it engenders, decide that something as ill-conceived and risky as this is in fact \u2018meant to be\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The poster girl for altruistic surrogacy is the big-hearted, well-balanced maternal woman who wants to help infertile couples have a family. She has children of her own and loves being pregnant. But what is interesting about The Nest is that Kaya is nothing like the stereotype. Does this mean disaster and with it a warning about commercial surrogacy, or is it merely a reminder that some women are unsuitable for such an arrangement?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b7406bf99c400ed95b343497d8c1ce0c86722e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b7406bf99c400ed95b343497d8c1ce0c86722e3/0_0_4285_2856/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily (Sophie Rundle), Kaya (Mirren Mack) and Dan (Martin Compston) in a scene from The Nest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily (Sophie Rundle), Kaya (Mirren Mack) and Dan (Martin Compston) in a scene from The Nest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Mainz/BBC/Studio Lambert</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sarah Jones is a founder of <a href=\"https://surrogacyuk.org/\">Surrogacy UK</a>, which was set up to promote altruistic surrogacy. She tells me she is concerned about the representation of surrogacy in The Nest. \u201cIn reality, surrogacy in the UK is unlike surrogacy elsewhere,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIt is an altruistic act based on a solid foundation of mutual respect and trust, with the expectation that the relationship between the surrogate\u2019s family and the intended parent\u2019s family last a lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>But even non-commercial surrogacy can be damaging to the birth mother. On paper, Annie, a feminist campaigner I know, was a perfect candidate to have a baby for an infertile couple. She was healthy, happy, in a stable relationship and had her own children. As a surrogate, Annie became pregnant with twins and suffered complications during both the pregnancy and birth. But once she was pregnant, the couple did not care about her wellbeing any more, only about that of the babies she was carrying.</p> <p>\u201cAltruistic surrogacy can be deeply exploitative and abusive, as I learned to my cost,\u201d says Annie. \u201cWe never hear about the dark underside of surrogacy, only the romanticised version in the media, and well-meaning women like me sign up not knowing the real risks and costs, then get used up and spat out.\u201d</p> <p>Surrogacy raises the the issue of conflicting rights. Does anyone have the right to their own child? Is it really \u201chomophobia\u201d if we outlaw surrogacy and, consequently, close down one of the routes for gay men to have babies? I spoke to Ben and Adam, a couple in the UK who have had a child via surrogacy. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, the surrogate is part of our family and can visit our child whenever she wishes,\u201d says Ben. \u201cIt is a beautiful arrangement and, so long as there is no exploitation involved, where is the harm?\u201d</p> <p>What about the rights of the surrogates? There have been a number of reported deaths and serious health complications during the surrogacy process, and a number of women have told me they have been traumatised by having to hand over the baby to the commissioning parents.</p> <p>The Nest will hopefully inform as well as entertain, but as a feminist concerned by the normalisation of surrogacy, I hope is that it will at the very least lead viewers to ask themselves some pertinent questions about pregnancy for profit.</p> <p>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gpqj\">The Nest starts on Sunday 22 March on BBC</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gpqj\"> One, 9pm</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Several local newspapers on the west coast announced this week that the coronavirus crisis is forcing them to suspend publication, perhaps indefinitely.</p> <p>Jeff vonKanael, the president of the Sacramento, Chico and Reno News &amp; Reviews, three small alternative weekly newspapers in California and Nevada, on Tuesday announced the economic impact of the corona pandemic \u201c<a href=\"https://sacblog.newsreview.com/2020/03/17/from-snrs-president-it-could-be-the-end/\">could be the end</a>\u201d for the organizations. Almost all of the staff will be temporarily laid off, and the print editions will cease to be published for now.</p> <p>VonKanael said in a statement that the drastic move came because of a steep drop in ad revenue from local events and businesses, after many California cities closed \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses including movie theaters, concert venues and art galleries to curb the spread of the coronavirus<strong>. </strong>The Chico News &amp; Review reported losing <a href=\"https://www.newsreview.com/chico/donate\">50% of its ad revenue</a> in less than a week.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m a pretty good salesperson, but to try and place ads for events that aren\u2019t happening is beyond my abilities</p> <footer> <cite>Jeff vonKanael</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all events with more that 50 people are shut down, I thought to myself, \u2018We\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d VonKanael said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty good salesperson, but to try and place ads for events that aren\u2019t happening and businesses that are closing is beyond my abilities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt came as sad news but not as a surprise,\u201d echoed the Reno News &amp; Review editor, Brad Bynum. \u201cWe felt like we were on borrowed time for a while.</p> <p>\u201cWe wrote about the local bands, businesses and breweries, and that\u2019s who we depended on for revenue,\u201d Bynum continued.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/03/total-annihilation-coronavirus-may-just-be-the-end-for-many-alt-weeklies/\">News of</a> the recent closures and layoffs are a stark reminder of the precarious financial positioning of some local news organizations, and it comes exactly at a time when local outlets are a potentially lifesaving, trusted source of information for readers in communities across the US.</p> <p>\u201cThe possibility of newspapers closing is incredibly worrisome right now, especially because the information we need around the coronavirus are things at the local and municipal level,\u201d said Mike Rispoli, director of News Voices, a not-for-profit local news advocacy group.</p> <p>Rispoli<strong> </strong>said the closure of local newspapers would leave many readers to seek information from major national news sources. Those sources have larger and more diverse revenue streams, wider circulations and bigger audiences, but they often lack the specific local information that people need to navigate their daily lives, he noted.</p> <p>\u201cJust like the coronavirus has laid bare fundamental problems in our healthcare and education systems, it\u2019s also exposing inequities in our media system, especially when it comes to local news,\u201d Rispoli said.</p> <p>Local newspapers that still<strong> </strong>produce print editions have come under growing pressure since the shift to digital subscriptions and online ad revenue have become more widespread.</p> <p>Before that transition, advertisement revenue typically<strong> </strong>accounted for 60% to 80% of print papers\u2019 total revenue. But amid the changes, both readership of print papers and advertising dollars began to decline. In California, nearly a quarter of the state\u2019s local newspapers <a href=\"https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/states/california/#1536357280470-403f9cb7-ca48\">shut down between 2004 and 2019</a>, as readership and revenue moved online. According to a 2018 analysis from UNC\u2019s Hussman School of Journalism and Media, many of the remaining papers came to rely on local ads for much of their revenue<strong>. </strong>With local businesses closed amid the coronavirus pandemic, the sudden plummet in ad sales has left many small local print newspapers even more vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cNewspapers will have that much more vanishing revenue to make up,\u201d said Rick Edmonds, the business and media analyst for the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. \u201cThey\u2019re losing money and may be unprofitable and heavily extended in terms of credit.</p> <p>\u201cThey may even have difficulty paying loans, as many businesses will in the months ahead.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/i-could-be-on-the-street-100000-jobs-at-risk-as-coronavirus-pummels-california-restaurants\">'I could be on the street': 100,000 jobs at risk as coronavirus pummels California restaurants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In addition, local newspapers are under additional financial pressure because many large regional and national papers have dropped their paywalls for coronavirus coverage, allowing readers unlimited access to those stories. Local news organizations may feel they have to follow the trend, even though many cannot afford to lose revenue from clicks and digital subscriptions.</p> <p>Since orders to close local businesses are still new, and reports of recent layoffs in the retail and food industries are being released and updated daily, questions about the pandemic\u2019s ultimate economic impact will remain unanswered for months. There is no way to know how many local papers will be affected yet, and how long these organizations will have to suspend publication.</p> <p>VonKanael predicted, however, that the effects would be felt far and wide. \u201cThis is like a tidal wave,\u201d he said of the many layoffs and business closures. \u201cEveryone\u2019s in the same boat economically, so I feel very un-special.\u201d</p> <p>Since VonKanael announced the suspension, he said, the organization has received $17,000 in donations. And while he hopes that the News &amp; Review can eventually restart its operation, he and Bynum worry that the economic impact of the coronavirus could exacerbate existing issues that are consequences of the decline in local news sources.</p> <p>\u201cThe decline\u2019s been a gradual one,\u201d VonKanael said of the shuttering of local publications. \u201cIt\u2019s like global warming, the impacts are there, but people are not noticing as much as they should.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople will either get their news from others who are just posting things on social media without doing research,\u201d echoed Bynum, \u201cOr they\u2019re gonna get it from distant, uninvolved corporate sources.\u201d</p>",

Zero-hour and freelance contracts are a norm in our sector \u2013 whether front of house, back of house or in the office. Some of these people are the first faces you see when you walk into a theatre but they don\u2019t have the protection of a salaried post. These were once permanent positions. During this crisis we run the risk of losing that workforce if they have to seek alternative employment. We\u2019ve always known our business is uncertain, but it is especially so if you\u2019re socio-economically deprived - which in the UK is shockingly more likely if you\u2019re a woman, a person of colour or have a disability. For these people, pursuing a career in theatre has required grit and resilience because our sector is still so very unequal and untransparent in access and opportunity. If we\u2019re not really proactive in thinking about the mental and physical wellbeing of our most marginalised voices in this period, we will lose them. And marginal voices are <em>always</em> our most exciting, innovative talent - our HighTide alumni from Vinay Patel to Sophie Ellerby prove that. Some of these artists and workers have grinned and borne their greater struggle for years for the love and magic of theatre, but this may be the tipping point. How we act now will dictate whether they wish to remain in our sector and it really will be our loss.

Theatre-makers are asking themselves: \u201cWhat is the point of being an artist who makes work for live consumption, if live events are literally against the law?\u201d These are people who already, even without a pandemic, frequently question the practicality of their career choices. What artists need is encouragement and communication \u2013 from their peers but, crucially, from audiences. We need the public to delve into their memories, individual and collective, recent and distant, and recall examples of live entertainment that has changed their life. They need to think about the time a line was spoken and you swallowed hard because you thought you were the only person who had felt that thing. The stories, the characters, the music, the comedy, the performances that have changed our perspectives, lifted our spirits, boosted our confidence, made our days, inspired our minds and moved our hearts. Hearing about these moments will sustain artists through these dark days and remind us why we do it. This dialogue between consumers and creators of live art, cherishing the unforgettable specialness of what artists create, is the key to getting through this and onwards to great, joyful liveness once again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"355e5b3bdfc9e1ddaccecdd489f36781d669eccf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/355e5b3bdfc9e1ddaccecdd489f36781d669eccf/0_755_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red Ladder artistic director Rod Dixon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rod Dixon \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s important to share what we\u2019re doing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>\u2018Build communities\u2019<br></strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/leeds/2011/mar/18/opinion-a-new-form-of-protest-is-growing-in-the-arts\">Rod Dixon, artistic director, Red Ladder</a><br></strong></em>Theatre creates instant communities. We at Red Ladder have our own supporter community through a membership scheme called Ladderistas. We will be sending them newsletters which will serve to keep that sense of belonging so essential at a time of isolation. We know the strength of communities from our non-theatre touring circuit. We can\u2019t be there, but we will keep talking. It\u2019s important to share what we are doing \u2013 such as Red Ladder paying and supporting our freelancers \u2013 as much as we can. Many theatres and companies have these schemes: sign up, support us, keep in touch and help us to keep and build vital relationships for the future.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Reflect, study, refresh\u2019<br></strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/23/my-brother-my-sister-and-me-review-sarah-argent-polka-theatre\">Sarah Argent, theatre-maker, writer, director</a><br></strong></em>These challenging times which have forced us to step off the treadmill of production could be an opportunity for reflection, study and artistic refreshment. We could read or re-read books by artists who excite us and watch recordings of their work (increasingly archive material and livestreams are available online but there could be more \u2013 could the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/\">National Theatre</a> and others make their broadcasts available?). We could contact our heroes and ask what plays, films, books and music inspire them and explore those we don\u2019t already know; ask them to mentor and guide us as we reflect on the development of our own careers \u2013 successes, failures, the projects that have brought us the most pleasure and satisfaction (are these necessarily the ones that are deemed externally to be our most successful?). Then we can draw up or revisit our artistic values and be ready for when theatre re-emerges, as it will do.</p> <p><strong>\u2018Seek out virtual shows\u2019<br></strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/feb/03/crystal-rasmussen-diary-of-a-drag-queen\">Tom Rasmussen, writer and performer</a><br></strong></em>In terms of protecting vulnerable artists, a lot of people in the queer and drag communities are already responding to closures and gig cancellations by creating virtual shows via livestreaming on social media. Whether it\u2019s interactive Facebook lives, where punters can tip via PayPal and ask for certain numbers, makeup tutorials or at-home cabaret lessons, the drag community is adapting swiftly. In a community which doesn\u2019t trust the government for protection, people are already making work in conversation with their audiences in order to sustain themselves. You can support by seeking this out, sharing, and tipping.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb4f6a61dfaec9ff3c6ad25d281cc334469535bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb4f6a61dfaec9ff3c6ad25d281cc334469535bf/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Rasmussen \u2026 \u2018The drag community is adapting swiftly.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Rasmussen \u2026 \u2018The drag community is adapting swiftly.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>\u2018Lobby for clarity\u2019<br></strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/27/theatre-access-actors-writers-directors-theatres-accessibility\">Sean Foley, artistic director, and Amit Sharma, deputy AD, Birmingham Rep</a><br></strong></em>If you can, donate prepaid tickets or have credit on your account.

I\u2019m wondering if the theatre can help out online, in the sense of creating an alternative imagined world and of reminding the nation what it is to be human. I\u2019m aware that in small ways, such as on WhatsApp groups, we are entertaining each other in private. And how necessary it is for a perspective. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2020/mar/18/keep-laughing-judi-dench-leads-older-stars-lifting-spirits-on-twitter\">Stuff can be funny</a> even if the seriousness of the situation isn\u2019t funny at all. But can this be more public? Can we all be more collaborative? What are the forums we could use online so that we can make inspiring stuff for everyone? On a personal note, I am using any skills I have to help anyone who asks me. My neighbour has asked me to use imagination, humour and drawing. If we are an essential help to the nation now, our audience will see the point when we open our doors again.</p>",

  "<p>Between the winter and summer solstices, spring moves across Europe at about 50km per day. \u201cWe could call that four kilometres an hour for 12 hours each day,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tim-dee\" title=\"\">Tim Dee</a> writes in <em>Greenery</em>. \u201cSpring, therefore, moves north at about walking pace.\u201d The book tags along with that green edge as it advances from the Sahel, south of the Sahara, to Scandinavia between December and June. Other writers have followed a similar impulse \u2013 famously Edward Thomas in his pursuit of spring from London to the Quantocks in 1913 \u2013 but never on this scale. As the months and latitudes pass, it is clear that Dee\u2019s journey is not just terrestrial but a bid \u201cto live so as to avoid winter\u201d \u2013 to outpace time itself. What\u2019s miraculous about <em>Greenery</em> is that you finish it feeling he\u2019s almost succeeded.</p> <p>The citational tendency in nature writing can seem less about humility than insecurity, but Dee\u2019s approach is that of the dinner-party host. His real-world travelling companions are frequently writers; here are Heaney, Dickinson, Shakespeare, Coleridge (who coined \u201cgreenery\u201d) and Rilke \u2013 who, we are reminded, believed \u201cmost happenings are beyond expression\u201d. At the head of the table, expressing everything, is DH Lawrence. \u201cComes over one an absolute necessity to move\u201d, the first line of his great travel book <em>Sea and Sardinia</em>, might have been this one\u2019s epigraph. Dee knows that migratory ache.</p> <p>In Chad (11\u02da north) he seeks out the birds ekeing life from the Sahara\u2019s oases and crossing its sands for Europe \u2013 honeyguides and barbets, olivaceous warblers, honey buzzards and, yes, swallows. The desert does to Dee what it does to every writer, in the end \u2013 makes him laugh at his own hubris: \u201cWhat use was my little green book to this epic sand world?\u201d Rilke had a point. Bird-counting in Gibraltar, Dee watches the brink of spring \u201cflying in, arriving dressed as a black kite\u201d. The German island of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/apr/24/heligoland-north-sea-hidden-gem\" title=\"\">Heligoland</a>, historic heartland of bird-migration studies, is an oasis for migrants taking sanctuary from the sea. In Madagascar and then Romania Dee sits for hours and manages \u201cto see more, or to see further, by seeing nothing\u201d. Neither nightjar nor bear grace him with their presence, but there\u2019s profit in that \u201cgood dead time\u201d. \u201cIf I had seen a bear, I would have seen nothing else; without the bear I could see everything.\u201d A few pages later, in South Africa, Dee gazes up at the Coalsack, \u201ca nebula of thick interstellar dust that occludes our view of the celestial topography beyond\u201d. Absence and incipient loss cloud <em>Greenery</em>. Swallows have started wintering in Portugal, we learn \u2013 climate breakdown means \u201cthey aren\u2019t bothering to go any further south\u201d. As a child Dee asked: \u201cIf a snowdrop has died what possibly could be happy about a cuckoo?\u201d The book records his race both to answer that question and to absorb the spirit of spring \u2013 of freshness and rebirth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7b8a54553020d1352008712157b9bf60ec53ba24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b8a54553020d1352008712157b9bf60ec53ba24/826_336_2570_2578/997.jpg\" alt=\"A male redstarts.\" width=\"997\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A male redstarts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: imageBROKER/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the effects of <em>Greenery</em> is to prompt the reader to see the world through the eyes of the overflying swallow: \u201cBirds don\u2019t carry bags. Nor passports. That is often the first thing I say when people ask me why I like them so much.\u201d Despite its south\u2013north bearing, the book is cyclical like the seasons or the movements of the birds that are its lodestars, flitting in time as well as space, drawn back to moments \u2013 often bird-encounters \u2013 from a lifetime\u2019s latitude-crossing, and from the author\u2019s three bases (the book is signed off \u201cBristol, Swaffham Prior, Cape Town\u201d).</p> <p>\u201cPeople are made up by places,\u201d he writes. \u201cSo are birds.\u201d For Dee it\u2019s also true that places are made up by birds. He remembers a tale from Hugh Lofting\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/25/buildingachildrenslibrary.booksforchildrenandteenagers\" title=\"\"> <em>The Story of Doctor Do</em><em>little</em></a>, in which a flock of swallows band together to tug a becalmed ship. Throughout <em>Greenery</em>, birds propel both the narrative (such as it is) and Dee\u2019s life. \u201cBirds are themselves,\u201d he insists \u2013 more than \u201cdim analogies\u201d in the service of poets, in William Sotheby\u2019s phrase \u2013 but they are also how he\u2019s known the world. \u201cI see through them; they see me through.\u201d</p> <p>Here, as in Dee\u2019s <em>The Running Sky</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/24/four-fields-tim-dee-review\" title=\"\"><em>Four Fields</em></a> and especially his book about gulls, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/24/landfill-by-tim-dee-review\" title=\"\"><em>Landfill</em></a>, birds are not species but individuals. A woodcock, in his creepily vivid portrait (has anyone written a woodcock more deeply or funnily?), is supernaturally strange: \u201cWhat workshop could new-fangle a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/sep/01/woodcock-game-bird-restaurants\" title=\"\">woodcock</a>? How would it look? A Kelmscott smock? A Leach pot splashed with telluric glaze? An artisan pie? ... Might you steampunk one from worms and wood waste, a whittled stick for its hard bits, mud and leaf rot for all else apart from a pair of ripe blackcurrants for eyes?\u201d Birds might lead you not only into the fairytale forest, he seems to promise, but far beyond, to a new (better) dimension altogether.</p> <p>Ardent, playful, quietly subversive \u2013 this is how Dee has always written, but his originality and learning mean he never needs to resort to the devotional swooning that has always plagued writing about the non-human world. There are interludes when the air is released from the prose and the book loses its vernal bounce, but a few longueurs feels like a fair exchange for that steampunked woodcock or, say, the near-hallucinatory observation that \u201cthe way an ants\u2019 nest seethes is congruent with the way a wryneck moves\u201d.</p> <p>If the swallow is the species to which Dee\u2019s ship is hitched, closest to his heart is another species, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/08/birds.redstart\" title=\"\">redstart</a>.

If you have played it, she was your assistant, too. She is the heart of the game, your adviser, your companion. She is a yellow dog in snappy office dress, and she is always so happy to see you. Benny Bijou Bentley sashays around the floor with her clip-board. The crowd goes wild, throwing dollars at her feet. I am thinking to myself, \u201cYes, Isabelle - work.\u201d</p> <p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons marks the fifth game in the franchise, that began in 2001 on the Nintendo 64. In the games, you move into a village populated by a random selection of anthropomorphic animals. You are placed in a small home, and then you just live. You explore, you fish, you grow plants, you chat \u2013 there\u2019s no endgame, no goal. You saunter along at your own pace. There\u2019s no rush.</p> <p>There is also no conflict or tension \u2013 the game gives you a sandbox environment in which to pursue a gentler life. The environment shifts with the console\u2019s internal clock \u2013 in winter, plants shrivel and insects disappear, only to stir alive in green pixels again come spring.</p> <p>Central to much of your daily activity is one character: Tom Nook, an enterprising businessman who not only runs the village shop, but also, the local estate agents. You pay your mortgage to him in cash, in whatever instalments you please. Tom is a cute, wide-eyed raccoon, a disarming form that belies the fact that he is functionally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-godfather\">the Godfather</a> of Animal Crossing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88214b1b657c2caa4dbaa5955c16e9a1c6e59f69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88214b1b657c2caa4dbaa5955c16e9a1c6e59f69/77_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No endgame ... Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m aware that these gameplay mechanics sound somewhere between eye-wateringly mundane and vaguely threatening. In reality, Animal Crossing is neither. It is charming beyond belief.</p> <p>My first step into this softer life came when I was commuting more than two hours a day to college. My Nintendo DS was a comforting escape from the juddering trains and slow buses, and the tender world of Animal Crossing was the opposite of the heightened drama of being a teenager. Breakups, betrayals, hangovers, balancing classes with jobs, working out who I wanted to be, none of that was in question here. Life in Animal Crossing was distilled into basic tasks, basic pleasures and basic connections.</p> <p>Relationships with my neighbours in the game were easy in that they were transactional. Friendship, if you could call it that, progresses around the exchange of gifts. When prompted, you can enter nicknames for your pals that the algorithmically generated dialogue will then integrate in to conversation. It is predictable, but for me it gradually escalated in a way that felt comforting. I fished and gathered fruit which I sold to Tom, for the game\u2019s currency \u2013 bells. I listened to the chippy, tuneless music and was soothed. And because there is no ending to Animal Crossing, no plot, I was never in any danger of heightened emotions of any kind. There was no chaos.</p> <p>Years later, my husband and I cohabited in a town in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, where I inherited the role of mayor from an elderly tortoise. On reflection, and I say this with my hands up, I was a bad civil servant. I always assumed my assistant Isabelle was, well, working. I was less occupied with town planning than digging up artefacts. Though if I were to sell them to Tom for bells, I would have made quicker work of paying off my mortgage. Instead, I dutifully donated them to the initially barren museum, operated by a solitary owl. He was a reliably friendly face, and always seemed so grateful for my contributions to the local cultural resources.</p> <p>This museum-filling lit up the synapses in my brain that respond to collecting: the same ones that are ripped apart by Pok\u00e9mon. Here, we have that same catch \u2019em all mechanic, albeit without any victory at the end. Or any end at all. Our prize is not legacy, heroism or a trophy, but a place in a small, fictional community \u2013 a sense of a job well done. I\u2019m part of a generation that is feeling our way in the dark: employment models have changed, security is gone, continuous email access and a growing gig economy have shifted the boundaries between work and home. It is so easy to feel as though there will always be something else to do and that every completed task simply makes way for another task. To build something that feels tangible and joyful is an antidote to this, even if it is a pixellated town, your contribution amounts to something: happier neighbours, a full museum, a house with many rooms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dc825cf1642740ce1f995855df856ee889b86a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dc825cf1642740ce1f995855df856ee889b86a0/87_0_1112_667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Basic pleasures and basic connections ... Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Animal Crossing New Horizon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I spoke to other fans of the series, they had similar tales. \u201cThe thing that I really love about the series is the pace,\u201d says Ian Cummins, 32, who works at Facebook and is the only person I have ever met with a full Pok\u00e9dex. \u201cPicking it up after a long day of working, commuting and reading the news relaxes me. It\u2019s meditative for me to pick my fruit, check in with my neighbours and do some fishing before bed. It also lets me live out my fantasy of abandoning the city to live on an island, while fully acknowledging that I would definitely not flourish if I did that in real life.\u201d</p> <p>There is so much to this fantasy \u2013 tasks are manageable, relationships steady, risk nonexistent. Tom Nook isn\u2019t going to send his boys to break your kneecaps if you\u2019re late with a payment. This is a place where progress and value isn\u2019t contingent on ambition. Our fellow villagers are sweet and quirky \u2013 there are gorillas, cats, hedgehogs, horses, there is a musical dog called KK Slider who plays guitar, there is even a bright red duck called Ketchup. Sure, they can occasionally be oppositional, but you can usually bring them around with the gift of fruit, or by delivering letters to their homes.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Animal Crossing community served me the way that Twitter serves me now,\u201d says Dearbh\u00e1il Clarke, 22, taking their final year in animation at IADT. \u201cIt\u2019s a pocket friendship, without any of the weirdness or commitment of real life. You just put in gifts and get out affirmation ... even when you run out of new dialogue prompts, the friendships don\u2019t feel hollow. They just take on the same rhythm of an old friend telling you the same banal story and you\u2019ll listen and smile because it\u2019s nice to hear and be heard.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke nails the essence of Animal Crossing: cosiness, predictability \u2013 the feeling of a home and community gradually rising to meet you. I distinctly remember dropping by the Able Sisters clothing shop every day in New Leaf: not necessarily to spend my hard-earned bells on clothing, but rather to say hello to the quiet hedgehog named Sable, sitting in the back behind a sewing machine. Initially, when I approach her she doesn\u2019t even greet me. But day after day, she grows to recognise me. Eventually she begins to offer information about herself. Technically, the prize for winning her friendship by talking to her for 10 days in a row is a QR feature that expands clothing options, but I know that what I am really gaining are the tiny secrets of her life. There is texture in this fiction. The progress from silence to warmth. The real reward for this mini-game, completed purely by interaction and persistence, is knowing Sable, without any risk of being truly known yourself.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie4WZCLbtVs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ie4WZCLbtVs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Animal Crossing offers the one thing in this strange landscape of 2020 that it feels a generation is sorely lacking: a sense of safety. As New Horizons is released, communities worldwide have begun social distancing or self-isolating due to the spread of Covid-19. But with this game fortuitously timed, these new islands will give us a place to escape to from the endless scroll of frightening news, when all we can do is stay indoors and hope for the best.</p> <p>These safe, fictional landscapes are a balm. There is no danger lurking beyond the trees, no urgency in your loan repayments, no betrayal from selfish neighbours. When I saw Bijou Bentley performing, it made me realise that Animal Crossing has a life beyond the beyond the DS or Switch. The quiet lives we have had inside this world have connected with our reality. The quiet lives we have had inside those screens have connected with our reality: scenes from these places become more than memes, they become modes of expression.</p> <p>Confined to our homes in real-life, we will compare the different fruits that grow on our trees (some will have pears, others peaches), we\u2019ll compare our neighbours, visit each other\u2019s islands. We will be together safe in the knowledge that every Saturday night when the internal console calendar hits the right time, a white dog named KK Slider will take his guitar and play a gig in all of our virtual towns. We will be united on the dancefloor as he sings in that strange, familiar digital voice. If I could, I would throw bells at his feet like rain.</p> <p>\u2022 Sarah Maria Griffin is an author from Dublin, Ireland. Her most recent novel is Other Words For Smoke. She tweets @griffski.</p>",

As the parents prove incapable of taking care of their remaining three children, the siblings\u2019 fear of and curiosity about death leads them into spirals of magical thinking that involve rituals and sacrifices of increasing violence. Raised in a strict Reformed household, Jas perceives the world through scripture, which she quotes frequently. Her father quizzes his children about the Bible and beats Jas\u2019s brother for taking the Lord\u2019s name in vain. Her mother\u2019s favourite day is Sunday, a day ruled by the \u201cbare essentials\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe love of God\u2019s word and Mom\u2019s vegetable soup\u201d. The rules Jas and her siblings invent for themselves join the many rules their parents and church already impose on them.</p> <p>This is the era of playing Snake on Nokia phones and The Sims on the family computer, a last generation of teenagers without frequent access to the internet. Caught in the no-man\u2019s-land between childhood and adulthood, Jas and her younger sister Hanna experiment with masturbation without recognising what it is, while the sexual games they play with their older brother Obbe become increasingly disturbing, as cruel as the animal sacrifices he asks Jas to make. The children\u2019s ignorance of their own changing desires is unsurprising in a family environment shaped by the twin forces of belonging to an orthodox church and keeping livestock: bodies are there to be useful, to mate and (re)produce. Jas\u2019s ongoing constipation is addressed by sticking soap up her bum \u2013 the same treatment that is handed out to calves. The vet, a frequent visitor, tells Jas she is almost \u201ccomplete\u201d; her father asks her how her breasts are developing, hidden under the red jacket she hasn\u2019t taken off since her brother\u2019s death. This protective layer has now become a part of her identity \u2013 \u201cjas\u201d means \u201cjacket\u201d in Dutch.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c6f6ffb489e658088e3b114f5cc538598ae1019f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6f6ffb489e658088e3b114f5cc538598ae1019f/19_598_3924_2354/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Realistic bleakness \u2026 Marieke Lucas Rijneveld.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Realistic bleakness \u2026 Marieke Lucas Rijneveld.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marieke Lucas Rijneveld tells the story from Jas\u2019s perspective, in the first person and the present tense. This presents a riddle to the reader: the knowingness of the author sits in contrast to the narrator, who is 12 years old by the end of the book. The text is peppered with rhetorical questions (\u201cAre Mum and Dad the pests that keep eating away at us?\u201d) and similes. \u201cWe\u2019re as empty as the Queen Beatrix biscuit tin on the breakfast table we once won on the Postcode Lottery: no one can fill us up,\u201d Jas points out in a moment of characteristic self-contemplation. Everything is filtered through her eyes, a child who believes that her mother is hiding Jewish people in the basement and that killing an animal will save her family. Yet this is also a narrator who is curiously observant of other people. About her father, she remarks that he \u201cstacks his worries like the sticks of kindling: they blaze up in our feverish minds\u201d. Much here is told, not shown, the conclusions spelt out for the reader in metaphors and similes.</p> <p>Rijneveld, whose pronouns are they/them, is also a lauded poet whose debut collection <em>Kalfsvlies</em> (Calf\u2019s Caul) covers similar themes. Rijneveld shares some biographical reference points with their characters, having also grown up in a Reformed farming family and lost an older brother as a child. Now longlisted for the Booker International prize, <em>The Discomfort of Evening</em> was a bestseller and prizewinner in the Netherlands, hailed as a brilliant achievement by a major new talent. In the English translation, the choice to break up longer Dutch sentences into shorter fragments, often by inserting semicolons and colons, subtly changes the tone of the novel, tempering the urgency of Jas\u2019s breathless, slightly dreamy monologue. Translator Michele Hutchison deftly switches between registers and gives Jas a strong, unique voice.</p> <p>Ultimately, the novel will find both admirers and detractors for its poetic, mannered language, realistic bleakness and descent into surreal darkness. The book doesn\u2019t quite keep the promise of its compelling first part, where Rijneveld and Hutchison immerse us in Jas\u2019s world with detailed observations: a dried-up raisin found under a cabinet, skin formed on warm milk. As the tragedies pile up and the narration intensifies, the fascinating characters and themes sometimes lose their immediacy amid dense prose.</p> <p><em> \u2022 The Discomfort of Evening by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld, translated by Michele Hutchison, is published by Faber (RRP \u00a312.99).

  "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/04/scientists-turn-to-tech-to-prevent-second-wave-of-locusts-in-east-africa\">locust crisis</a> that has now reached 10 countries could carry on to endanger millions more people, forecasters have said.</p> <p>Climate change created unprecedented conditions for the locusts to breed in the usually barren desert of the Arabian gulf, according to experts, and the insects were then able to spread through Yemen, where civil war has devastated the ability to control locust populations.</p> <p>It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/26/oman-cyclone-mekunu-people-killed-salalah\">Cyclone Mekunu</a>, which struck in 2018, that allowed several generations of desert locusts the moist sand and vegetation to thrive in the desert between Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman known as the Empty Quarter, breeding and forming into crop-devouring swarms, said Keith Cressman, locust forecasting expert for the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, that\u2019s quite good in itself, but just about when those conditions are drying out and the breeding is coming to an end, a second cyclone came to the area,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat allowed the conditions to continue to be favourable and another generation of breeding, so instead of increasing 400-fold, they increased 8,000-fold.</p> <p>\u201cUsually a cyclone brings favourable conditions for about six months and then the habitat dries out, and so it\u2019s not favourable for reproduction and they die and migrate.\u201d</p> <p>The amount of cyclones in the area seem to be increasing, said Cressman, making it likely that locust swarms will also become more common.</p> <p>The FAO has warned that the food security of 25 million people could be endangered by the locusts, which according to the agency\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info/info/index.html\">locust monitoring service</a> have been spotted in at least 10 countries over recent months. One swarm recently reported in Kenya covered an area the size of Luxembourg.</p> <p>The organisation has requested <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Desert%20Locust%20Crisis%20-%20Appeal%20for%20rapid%20response%20and%20anticipatory%20action%20in%20the%20Greater%20Horn%20of%20Africa%20January%20-%20December%202020%20.pdf\">$140m</a> (\u00a3120m) to help fight the ongoing breeding of the insects, predicting that a continuation through late March and April could see the existing number of locusts grow by 400 times by June.</p> <p>The current crisis is considered the worst in decades, and there are fears it could last longer than previous locust outbreaks.</p> <p>Alongside the climate emergency impact, the war in Yemen is a key factor.</p> <p>Cressman said Yemen is a \u201cfrontline\u201d country for locusts, with the insects typically present throughout the year. But its once effective locust programme no longer has the same impact in cities where control is now divided between the government and Houthi rebels.</p> <p>The head of the locust programme, Adel al-Shaibani, is based in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sana\u2019a.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the war we had a good ability to reach anywhere in Yemen,\u201d he said. \u201cIn current times we\u2019re just able to cover the Red Sea coastal areas \u2013 but not all \u2013 and some areas in the interior.\u201d</p> <p>He explained that there were two separate locust control centres in Yemen but neither was able to combat the outbreak effectively alone.</p> <p>The Sana\u2019a-based centre carried out control operations wherever they could in 2018, but they have been underfunded and have lost some of their vehicles.</p> <p>\u201cIn spite of all our hard efforts, some areas remained out of control due to security reasons near the border with Saudi Arabia. The desert locust outbreak occurred and some swarms formed and moved to other areas,\u201d said Shaibani.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68f99bbad4bb98b1baa0e3d6ae81f07961c9f36a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68f99bbad4bb98b1baa0e3d6ae81f07961c9f36a/0_55_4452_2671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young desert locust without wings is seen on a stalk near Geerisa town, in Somaliland\u2019s Lughaya District\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young desert locust without wings is seen on a stalk near Geerisa town, in Somaliland\u2019s Lughaya district.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By late 2019, the locusts had moved into the Horn of Africa, finding favourable conditions when an unseasonaal cyclone hit Somalia in December. This extended breeding time and allowed them to spread to areas authorities could not control because of the country\u2019s security problems.</p> <p>\u201cThis crisis could be quite long because of the Yemeni and Somali areas that cannot control the populations,\u201d said Cyril Piou, an expert with the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development.</p> <p>He said that in previous decades locust outbreaks had only lasted roughly two years but, without preventive systems, they will last longer, happen more frequently and spread further.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all linked in some way, what is happening somewhere else affects us all,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/04/scientists-turn-to-tech-to-prevent-second-wave-of-locusts-in-east-africa\">Scientists turn to tech to prevent second wave of locusts in east Africa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last comparable locust outbreak was in the late 1940s and 50s, but Cressman said that was in a time when monitoring and reporting was a slow, cumbersome process and chemical pesticides were readily available for control operations.</p> <p>Historically, the Arabian Gulf has very few cyclones. But the past decade has brought a significant increase thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/19/global-heating-supercharging-indian-ocean-dipole-climate-system\">Indian Ocean dipole</a>, a phenomenon linked to flooding in the western Indian Ocean, dry weather in the east and wildfires in Australia.</p> <p>Cressman, part of whose job involves looking at historical conditions to understand current developments, said the climate\u2019s behavioural changes made that difficult.</p> <p>\u201cThis analogous forecasting methodology used to work pretty good up until five years ago, and it\u2019s just not working very well any more at all because of the rainfall, the timing, the distribution. It\u2019s very different,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s an increasingly urgent question for those who still have to travel into work, or to collect supplies or visit vulnerable people \u2013 how can you get around without contracting \u2013 or spreading \u2013 the coronavirus? One answer could be cycling.</p> <p>The immediate caveat to mention is that this is not a call for every trip to be made by bike. If you\u2019re going 25 miles at night to collect 50kg of supplies for a food bank \u2026 well, you could do it with a cargo bike, but for most people it\u2019s a non-starter.</p> <p>But with more than a third of trips in the UK under two miles, and more than 60% of them less than five miles, the scope is there, particularly in urban areas, for many more one person trips to be made by bike (or, indeed, on foot for shorter trips).</p> <p>So why cycle? The coronavirus-specific paradox of a bike is that it simultaneously gets you out onto the streets, in touch with fresh air, the changing springtime climate, and other people, but it\u2019s very rare to be in over-close proximity to others. Even at a rush-hour traffic light in a city, you can almost always stake out a metre or two of your own, away from other riders and drivers.</p> <p>Cycling for everyday transport has not so far been restricted outside places which have imposed hugely draconian containment measures, like China. While Italy and Spain have placed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/7869/spain-bans-cycling-amid-coronavirus-outbreak\">temporary bans on leisure cycling</a>, riding a bike for permitted everyday travel is officially allowed, albeit with reports of some over-zealous police enforcement.</p> <p>On Thursday, the chief executive of British Cycling, Julie Harrington, wrote to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, urging ministers to add cycling to their list of recommended activities during the outbreak.</p> <p>Earlier this week, a group of nearly 50 academics and experts on public health and transport <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RachelAldred/status/1239987645050245121\">wrote an open letter to the government</a>, urging ministers to not discourage walking and cycling amid the pandemic, noting their vital importance in the wider public health issue of combating inactivity.</p> <p>During any lockdown, \u201call of our existing social and health risks do not simply go away\u201d, they wrote.</p> <p>The letter added: \u201cIn a rapidly escalating situation, policy could be adopted that largely confines the general asymptomatic population to their homes, potentially for some time. Confinement, sometimes in overcrowded accommodation with little or no private green space, and particularly during times of anxiety has health risks.\u201d</p> <p>This makes perfect sense. Coronavirus is a very obvious health crisis, and could \u2013 at the best-case predictions \u2013 kill quite a few thousand Britons.</p> <p>But the longer-term, more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2017/sep/17/the-miracle-pill-how-cycling-could-save-the-nhs\">normalised health consequences</a> of people living excessively inactive and sedentary lives \u2013 everything from type 2 diabetes to cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer \u2013 is one of the leading causes of early death around the world, every year.</p> <p>Precise figures are hard to estimate, but one often-quoted statistic suggests that in England alone, 80,000-plus people die early every year due to the health consequences of inactivity.</p> <p>Rather than impeding cycle use, governments should use the coronavirus crisis to make it easier, particularly in cities, so people can avoid public transport. It would take a matter of hours to cone-off lanes to create temporary bike routes so more people could ride safely. The Colombian capital, Bogot\u00e1, has already <a href=\"https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/bogota-expands-bike-lanes-overnight-to-curb-coronavirus-spread-5127\">begun to do this</a>.</p> <p>I\u2019d also strongly argue against any bans on recreational and leisure cycling, which is so good for both physical and mental health. The rationale for these appears to be to take the strain off health services, in case a cyclist is injured and needs treatment.</p> <p>This approaches the issue from the wrong way. Cycling is an inherently safe form of transport where the danger is almost all external \u2013 that is, from drivers and other motor vehicle users. If the intention really is to prevent road casualties, then the best way, surely, would be to reduce speed limits, and urge careful driving.</p> <p>This could be made into a coherent approach. So, for example, big cities could impose blanket 20mph speed limits \u2013 I\u2019d personally go for 15mph \u2013 with space set aside on major roads for cycle use. With so many people working from or confined to home, in many cities traffic levels are falling, even with public transport off limits. This would also make walking more appealing.</p> <p>One of the many effects of the pandemic has been falls in emission levels in many cities, as cars stay at home. Some have even speculated that in some countries, the death toll from coronavirus could be significantly offset by fewer people dying as a result of air pollution.</p> <p>Around the world, governments are taking actions which, even a few weeks ago, they would have dismissed as fantasy. Boris Johnson\u2019s government is currently not dismissing the idea of introducing a universal basic income, an idea which, when raised by the Greens in 2017, was viewed by the Conservatives with derision.</p> <p>So why not make cycling easier, not more difficult? At one stroke, you have people kept distanced during transport, and making them healthier in the long term \u2013 not to mention more likely to be able to see off respiratory infections like Covid-19.</p> <p>It could be time for action.</p>",

We know that you find the wild conspiracies of social media and noisy TV pundits off-putting and confusing; instead, the Guardian brings you the facts you can trust.</p></li> <li><p>We will bring new perspectives and insights to help us understand how the crisis is changing how we live, eat, socialise, travel, connect and care for each other.</p></li> <li><p>We will hold world leaders to account for their handling of the crisis, through investigative reporting and asking the right questions.</p></li> <li><p>We will focus on the challenges facing the poorest: homeless people, workers in the gig economy, those who don\u2019t get sick pay, those who can\u2019t work from home. And we will bring you the personal stories of the people most affected: looking not just at the powerful, but those whose voices are often unheard.</p></li> <li><p>We will pay particular attention to what it is like to be a health worker right now: are they getting the protection and support they need? We are committed to hearing what they tell us.</p></li> <li><p>We will try to understand what\u2019s happening in the economy, using our financial expertise and judgment to work out what the recession means for businesses and workers alike, and what the future holds.</p></li> <li><p>We will bring you international perspectives on how different countries are responding, working out which approaches work best, and why, through our exceptional network of correspondents. In addition, our sizeable teams and localised editions of the Guardian in Britain, the US, Australia and elsewhere across the world mean you receive a truly global understanding of this unprecedented situation.</p></li> <li><p>We will investigate why this pandemic has happened, understanding what caused it, so we can work out how to prevent it happening again. We will pull all our work together in a new weekly email newsletter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-the-week-explained-sign-up-for-our-email-newsletter\">which you can sign up to here</a>.</p></li> <li><p>We will listen to our community of readers: you are asking crucial questions, giving us invaluable insights into what\u2019s happening where you live, and inspiring us with your acts of solidarity.</p></li> <li><p>We will not forget that other issues still matter, most especially the climate crisis; our dedicated teams will continue to bring you their unrivalled reporting on the environment.</p></li> <li><p>And, finally, we will bring some hope. With clarity and imagination, we will find a way to build a better society, and a new and fairer way to live.</p></li> </ul> <p>At the Guardian, we believe that high-quality news should be accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford it.

Italy\u2019s Civil Protection Agency said on Thursday the total number of infections had risen to 41,035 from 35,713 \u2013 a near 15% increase.</p>",
  "<p>On 13 January, a bulletin from Health Protection Scotland was sent to all GP practices in the country describing a \u201cnovel Wuhan coronavirus\u201d. I work in a small clinic in central Edinburgh with four doctors, two nurses and six admin staff. It was the first time I\u2019d heard of the virus. \u201cCurrent reports describe no evidence of significant human to human transmission, including no infections of healthcare workers,\u201d it said reassuringly.</p> <p>I cast my mind back to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\" title=\"\">Sars</a> coronavirus of almost two decades ago, and briefly wondered how quickly the spread of this coronavirus would be stopped, as Sars was. A seafood market had been closed and sanitised. The bulletin said that although Wuhan was a city of 19 million people, there were only three flights per week from there to the UK, and the likely impact was \u201cvery low\u201d. I shrugged, and carried on with my work.</p> <p>Scientists had already discovered that the new virus was fundamentally different from Sars, though still within the family of coronaviruses. \u201cCorona\u201d refers to the spiky little packets of sugared protein stuck all over the surface of the spherical virus, like fleurs-de-lys sprouting from the band of a crown. Under an electron microscope they look like tiny planets, each one buzzing with angry satellites. They\u2019re a similar size to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/24/endless-hunt-for-the-perfect-influenza-vaccine-flu-jab\" title=\"\">flu viruses</a> \u2013 0.1 microns \u2013 and are widespread among many different mammals. Sars came to humans from the Asian civet; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) came via dromedary camels. It seems likely that the new virus has its origin in bats, but whether there was another mammalian intermediary between bats and humans is still uncertain.</p> <p>That evening I met up with a friend, a consultant physician who had recently come back to work after a period of time doing research. She had been stationed at a general hospital around 30 miles from Edinburgh, and was enjoying being back in the thick of clinical work, though startled at how stretched her medical colleagues were. \u201cIt\u2019s the same every year,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder when health boards will realise how many winter beds we actually need.\u201d</p> <p>A week later, Chinese infections stood at 550, and the death toll was 17. A new bulletin arrived reassuring me that the risk of infection was still low, but attaching a specific form to be completed should I suspect someone of having the virus \u2013 specifically anyone flying in from Wuhan. I was disgruntled but not alarmed when one university asked worried Chinese students to seek GP attention. \u201cBy phone!\u201d I wanted them to add, \u201ctell them to seek attention by phone!\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\" title=\"\">announced</a> a global health emergency. The death toll in China reached 170, and the cases that had tested positive there reached almost 8,000. Further cases were reported in India and the Philippines.</p> <p>Coronavirus infects and irritates the lungs. Most cases are mild. In severe cases it leads to breathlessness as the lungs struggle to do their job of oxygenating the blood \u2013 something that can be relieved with oxygen delivered by mask. A proportion of those patients who require oxygen will go on to need ventilation in intensive treatment units. In these early days of the outbreak, I still thought of the virus as something that, like Mers and Sars, would be contained. As GPs we are accustomed to dealing with an annual spike in flu \u2013 the \u201cswine flu\u201d of 2009 turned out to be not much more dangerous than seasonal winter flu \u2013 though in its severity and prevalence, this new virus seemed worse.</p> <p>That same day, another message came in, this time from Lothian health board. It instructed me that masks \u201cand other personal protective equipment\u201d would be sent to the practice shortly, prompting the usual jokes among the staff that we would be sent a paper bag and some of those clingfilm gloves you get at petrol stations. Surgical masks did arrive later that week, along with a roll of tear-off plastic aprons.</p> <p>During the week, I work at my small Edinburgh practice, but at the weekend I sometimes work evening GP shifts at an \u201cout of hours\u201d (OOH) centre in the city, covering a much larger population, with a team of other doctors and nurses. I had an email from the clinical director of the centre advising me to tell any patients from mainland China that they would only need to self-isolate if they had symptoms, adding that those symptoms did <em>not</em> include a sore throat. Until then, I\u2019d been assuming that a dripping nose and a sore throat would be the herald of coronavirus infection, the way they are for most respiratory viruses. My practice started a WhatsApp group to keep one another updated. It proved as good for sharing joke videos as for the latest governmental advice.</p> <p>On 4 February, I flew to the US to give a talk at the New York Academy of Sciences about science, medicine and wonder. United Airlines warned me I would be turned back at the US border if I had been through China. There were a few face masks in use at the airport, but I still thought of this as a problem that the Chinese lockdown and the Wuhan flight ban would address.</p> <p>Radio New Zealand had also been in touch to ask if I would do an interview. The absurd levels to which we are all now interconnected came home to me as I sat down, cross-legged and jet-lagged, in a New York hotel room to talk, via Skype, to a presenter 17 hours into tomorrow. He asked me for predictions on how far this epidemic would spread. I remember saying that I had no crystal ball, but what I\u2019d seen of infection control measures in China seemed impressive \u2013 I hoped very much it would be contained as Sars had been contained, and that isolation measures would be effective. That day it was reported that 425 Chinese patients had died, and infection rates, for those who\u2019d been tested, stood at just over 20,000.</p> <p>Flying out of Newark, I found myself in a departure terminal where every table was festooned with tablet computers on stalks. They flashed like gambling machines, entertainment as well as shopping opportunities. To speak to a companion it was necessary to peer over these screens. All food and all payment was to be ordered by touching the tablets. Maybe they wipe them clean regularly, I thought, as I watched a kid pick his nose then start playing with the screen.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When I got home from New York, in early February, the threat began to feel real. That weekend the number of deaths in China <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51431087\" title=\"\">surpassed</a> those of the Sars epidemic of 2002-2003, at 811. Half-term holidays followed. Along with my wife and kids, I drove north to Orkney to see friends and take up a locum position as a GP on one of the islands for a week. At Kirkwall, on my way to the ferry, a message pinged from one of the NHS Orkney staff. Did I have time to drop by the hospital and be measured up for a \u201cface-fitting mask\u201d? These masks are effective at blocking the droplets of coughs or sneezes that carry viruses. It disturbed me that the request came in such haste \u2013 did they know something I didn\u2019t about the imminence of the outbreak? In Orkney? I had time if I dropped by the hospital right now, I replied, but had only an hour until my ferry was leaving. \u201cIt won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d came the reply, and it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>By the time I got back to Edinburgh eight days later, things were changing fast. The OOH service asked if I could come by and be assessed for a face-fitting mask. But when I tried to set up an appointment, stocks had run out. New guidance appeared that, for the kind of examinations I perform as a GP, it would be enough to wear a \u201cfluid resistant\u201d mask and follow the usual infection control procedures \u2013 aprons, gloves, eye protection. The face-fitted masks were to be preserved for those performing the kind of procedures \u2013 such as intubations and endoscopies \u2013 during which you might be sprayed with saliva, or worse. Some were finding governmental advice infuriatingly inconsistent, but it was clear that tough decisions were having to be made with limited resources, and time was running out. As GPs we were being urged to avoid suspected cases in case we spread it inadvertently to others, though the virus was undoubtedly circulating among our patients at higher levels than were evident in official figures.</p> <p>On 21 February, Lombardy reported its first cases resulting from spread within Italy, rather than among people who had flown in with the virus. They still had only a handful of confirmed cases. My wife is from Lombardy, not far from Pavia, and her parents went into isolation. Italy reported its first deaths the following day, but several patients of mine were still relaxed enough about the virus to fly there for skiing.</p> <p>In the next four days, Italy\u2019s number of reported cases leapt from single figures to 229, and China\u2019s approached 80,000. But China\u2019s were slowing while Italy\u2019s appeared to be gathering momentum: on 25 February, a new bulletin from the public health specialists of NHS Lothian asked me to tell anyone who had been in Lombardy or Veneto within the last 14 days, and who had symptoms, to self-isolate. \u201cFirst of all, for reassurance,\u201d it stated, \u201cwith regards to Italy, the area of concern is only for northern Italy \u2013 north of Pisa, Florence or Rimini.\u201d I was not reassured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bfbe142eebc4a6e702621fddeaac601c2c730c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bfbe142eebc4a6e702621fddeaac601c2c730c6/0_59_3060_1836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An electron microscope image from the US National Institutes of Health of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An electron microscope image from the US National Institutes of Health of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niaid Rml/NIH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I spoke that day with a patient who had returned from Milan, but who had no symptoms other than a slight sore throat, common enough for anyone just off a plane. According to the rules I\u2019d been given, he didn\u2019t have to isolate himself. \u201cHave you got a thermometer?\u201d I asked him, and toyed with the idea of dropping round to see if he had a fever, but then more calls and demands came through, and I didn\u2019t. (He subsequently recovered.)</p> <p>At the OOH centre in West Lothian, in the first week of March, it was evident just how thick the weekly traffic is between Italy and the UK. One among several calls: a man who had flown in a day earlier, from south of Pisa, and who had a cough with a fever. According to the guidance I\u2019d been given, he\u2019d been too far south to be considered as a potential case \u2013 I informed him there was no official need for self-isolation. But the advice made me uneasy, and I asked him, if he could, to stay at home and off work for at least a week.</p> <p>Another call was to a family just back from skiing; according to the location of their resort they <em>were</em> at risk, and they were referred to the public health board for testing. This is done by sending away an official form \u2013 we GPs don\u2019t get to hear who turns out positive and who doesn\u2019t.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In early March, the computer system with which GPs read all medical records, make notes on each consultation and refer patients for specialist care, had new coronavirus codes added. The idea is that anyone registered in the system with Covid-19 is tagged with a special code that will keep track of the spread of the disease, as well as our Covid-19 workload as GPs. At this point, \u201cAdvice given about 2019-nCoV\u201d was the only code that I had much opportunity to use.</p> <p>To carry on with \u201ccontainment\u201d of the virus, it felt like we would need hundreds of call-handlers to decide who should stay put and self-isolate, and who should be tested \u2013 and then hundreds more workers to trace every contact. Drive-through testing was happening now in Edinburgh, though there was only one mention of the virus today among the 30 or so patients I saw face to face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>By now, fear was spreading, with some justification, and the situation was beginning to feel extremely serious. One elderly lady requested a letter for her insurance company, to get her out of her package holiday; I explained that until the government changed its advice, my letter wouldn\u2019t make any difference, and she left, dejected.</p> <p>Watching the news, the measures Italy was taking seemed extraordinary, though necessary. Once, when I worked as an Antarctic expedition doctor, I studied with military medics for a diploma in the medical care of catastrophes. We learned about building makeshift hospitals, about dividing clinics into \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d zones, about planning urgent mass vaccination, about emergency medical supply chains. It felt surreal that those kinds of measures were now being discussed so close to home.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The gravity of the crisis was only just starting to be felt. It seems incredible now that I was so blase, but on Saturday 6 March, I was out with friends, jokes aplenty about nudging elbows instead of shaking hands. I stood in the corner of a pub packed with people watching the rugby. (England were victorious over Wales.) A GP friend in Fife told me that she was convinced the disease was already widespread among her own patients \u2013 she was seeing more viral breathlessness than usual, but none from people who had travelled to the \u201cat risk\u201d areas, and none who fulfilled the criteria for testing. We went together to a sold-out concert at Edinburgh\u2019s Usher Hall \u2013 capacity 2,200 \u2013 crowds singing, people hugging, everyone pretending to forget about Covid-19 for a night.</p> <p>Another friend, a hospital specialist, told me in a crowded pub that night that what we needed urgently was to slow its spread \u2013 allow the government to buy time, get in more ventilators and prepare the hospitals. But he wondered if we were doing too little too late. \u201cWe could run out of ventilators by May,\u201d he said. Evidence from China was showing that if you buy ventilators early and deploy them in new and cleared-out hospitals, you save lives.</p> <p>The following day, Italy went into lockdown, but Britons were still being allowed to fly home. The supermarkets there started offering free delivery to the over-65s. My parents-in-law at least have a garden; a neighbour is passing fresh bread over the fence. They have their chickens, their vegetable patch and a well-stocked garage. There are frightening stories from Lombardy hospitals of insufficient ventilators, and operating rooms used as intensive-care units.</p> <p>I woke up on 10 March to a WhatsApp message from a colleague \u2013 the first few Covid-19 cases from our patch of Edinburgh had been confirmed, all in people returning from Italy. They had a fever, a frontal headache and a dry cough. We were all expecting the news, but it still came like a cold slap. Everything about the way we work would have to change. Planes were still flying in from Italy and France. Websites were telling worried people to phone their GP, while each morning we GPs were picking through emails from local and national health boards for the latest advice. Protective suits were to be saved for hospital staff and paramedics at the bedsides of sick people shedding the virus.</p> <p>We decided to slash the number of appointments offered by 50%, filled the new space with phone appointments, and used a new code in the medical records: \u201cTelephone triage due to Covid-19 restrictions\u201d. All the same, a colleague and I still made five visits that day to frail, elderly, housebound patients \u2013 all of them over 85 (two over 90), and all asking anxiously about the virus, trying with their questions to gauge our own levels of concern. These are among the most lonely, isolated people in our communities. But when any GP might be asymptomatically carrying the virus, trying to assess their problems face-to-face feels like a luxury \u2013 we have to reduce home visiting to a minimum.</p> <p>There were plenty of nervous jokes among my patients that day about the coming \u201ccoronageddon\u201d, but only one who phoned in, drenched in sweat, with a dry cough and a fever of 39C. He hadn\u2019t been abroad for months, and I told him to stay home for at least a week. That evening, my GP colleagues and I had a meeting in the pub that felt like a boozy council of war. We shared stories we\u2019d heard of patients in hospital with the virus, and ideas for how to protect the practice, should we, one-by-one, end up catching it. I remembered planning meetings for the swine flu of 2009, but they were nothing like this, and the threat had felt nowhere near as real.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On 11 March, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">declared</a> Covid-19 to be a pandemic. Events were moving at unprecedented speed. The UK budget was delivered and the NHS was told it would have whatever it needed. We\u2019ll see. Deaths in China continued to drop \u2013 just 19 new infections.</p> <p>A helpful message signed by all the government health departments, health boards, royal colleges and the General Medical Council also arrived on 11 March. It said that I\u2019ll be expected, in the coming weeks, to go beyond what I\u2019m accustomed to dealing with, but that I can be reassured that the GMC and health board will support me and my decisions through the crisis. \u201cClinicians may need to depart, possibly significantly, from established procedures in order to care for patients in the highly challenging but time-bound circumstances of the peak of an epidemic.\u201d It\u2019s good to feel the GMC is at my back, rather than on my back, for a change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7f25699f9a70e3271d0f06bf3828953ef920ed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7f25699f9a70e3271d0f06bf3828953ef920ed8/0_190_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Musselburgh primary care centre on the outskirts of Edinburgh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Musselburgh primary care centre on the outskirts of Edinburgh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among my worried patients were a grandmother with full parental responsibility for all her grandchildren. A mother of a seven-year-old daughter who has a fever and cough asked whether that means she should also be self-isolating. According to official guidance, the answer was still a disquieting \u201cno\u201d \u2013 we were still in the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase \u2013 but I asked people to be pragmatic. If they felt at all unwell, stay in and minimise contact with others. The only unconcerned patient was a man with advanced cancer, spread to the liver, who thought we were all overreacting.</p> <p>By this point, we GPs were doing almost everything over the phone, even if it meant prescribing antibiotics without seeing patients, and making guesses about non-urgent diagnoses \u2013 shunting anything that wasn\u2019t an emergency into an imagined future of normality. Over morning coffee, my colleague joked about getting us beekeeper outfits, visiting only the most seriously ill in their homes while hermetically sealed in our own isolation suits. As jokes go, it wasn\u2019t very funny.</p> <p>I spent the afternoon doing a men\u2019s clinic for the city\u2019s rough sleepers and those with no fixed address, some of whom sleep in Bethany Trust dormitories. In my morning surgery, everyone had asked me about the virus; my homeless patients had, it seems, more pressing concerns. About half went to shake my hand, and thought me cowardly for bumping elbows instead.</p> <p>By the time I emerged from the clinic, Boris Johnson had told everyone with cough and cold symptoms to stay home for a week. \u201cAt last!\u201d I thought. Maybe people will take it seriously. We were again informed that more protective equipment was coming, but the droplet-resistant masks still won\u2019t be available. Everyone with a beard who works with Covid-19 patients has been asked to shave it off, as the masks don\u2019t work if there\u2019s hair between them and the skin. Anyone with religious or cultural objections was told to speak with their line manager.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Friday the 13th, and an atmosphere of dread in morning meeting at the news from Italy. There aren\u2019t enough ventilators to go round, or nurses, and people are being buried without funerals. The practice WhatsApp group has been renamed \u201cDream Team CoronaCombat\u201d in an attempt at levity. There was an air of quiet resignation at what\u2019s coming, but an edge of bunker humour, too. One of the clinic thermometers broke, and I went online to buy another \u2013 \u00a330 versions are changing hands for \u00a3125. But virologists are learning about Covid-19 all the time, and for all their horrors, the Chinese and Italian experiences mean that we\u2019re better prepared in the UK than we might have been.</p> <p>One of my patients that day, a man in his late 80s, told me that the virus is mother nature getting back at us. \u201cToo many people!\u201d he said, and chuckled. \u201cAll us oldies need clearing out!\u201d I didn\u2019t share his glee. Some who have had coughs for weeks, but that have worsened, asked me if they\u2019d got it \u2013 but there\u2019s no way of knowing, and I told them all to stay home for a further week. The lab had stopped accepting viral swabs from GPs, so unless someone is admitted to hospital, they aren\u2019t tested. And also on the 13th, the first death in Scotland, in Ediburgh, was announced.</p> <p>Spain followed Italy into lockdown, planes turning back halfway. The UK attitude of allowing schools to stay open came under attack. It was obvious we needed new ways to slow the spread, particularly among the over-65s \u2013 they\u2019re the ones most at risk from this disease. One of my colleagues has purchased us hazmat suits from eBay for home visiting, just in case. The medical students of Edinburgh University have set up a pet-and-babysitting service for NHS staff.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On Tuesday 17 March, the practice was oddly quiet \u2013 there was a hush on the streets, a sense of anxious anticipation, and my days now feel like a prelude to what is to come. People were stunned by the implications of the guidance delivered by the prime minister on Monday night \u2013 to avoid going out, to avoid restaurants and theatres, to self-isolate for 14 days if anyone in the family has symptoms. Unprecedented, necessary, belated advice. Of the 20 people I spoke to on the phone, a couple almost certainly had the virus \u2013 a new headache, fever, cough, malaise and exhaustion. I coded them \u201csuspected coronavirus infection\u201d and gave advice to stay in with their whole families, and call us if they get worsening breathlessness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk\">Why we need worst-case thinking to prevent pandemics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As healthcare workers, we\u2019ve been told to follow the same advice as everyone else: stay off for 14 days if anyone in our homes has a cough or fever. Practices adjacent to my own are already losing staff, and we\u2019re clamouring for testing. If I develop a cough but test negative, I can go on working. Even better will be some future test that can show if I\u2019ve <em>had</em> the virus, and developed immunity \u2013 then I\u2019ll be able to work overtime through the coming weeks without fear. Hospital clinics are being cancelled wherever possible, all elective surgery postponed. We\u2019re clearing the decks for an onslaught. Yes, it would have been nice to have been better prepared for this pandemic, but though it\u2019s frightening, it could also be worse, and I don\u2019t feel the same anger as some of my colleagues towards the government for its prevarication over such immense and unprecedented decisions.</p> <p>On Wednesday I heard that schools are closing, and so my wife and I will be contending with the competing necessities of the kids, the virus and the NHS. My wife contacted her GP in Lombardy. The situation is, he said, very grave, and he wished us luck with what is to come. I messaged a medical contact in Beijing, the Chinese translator of my books, who said things are improving, with few new cases. \u201cAs you know, isolation is the only effective method to stop the virus,\u201d he added, and asked that I give thought to the mental health of my patients as much as to their physical needs. He ended on a sanguine note: \u201cPeople will have to change their habits for a while.

The South Downs National Park, Forestry England and others have reminded people that our forests and grasslands, woodlands and commons are open for business. With constrained options for leisure and restoration and heightened stress and anxiety levels, this is good news.</p> <p>If you were in any doubt that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/18/what-is-uk-government-advice-on-social-distancing-and-isolation-coronavirus\">it was OK to go outside</a>, while keeping at least two metres away from others, the chief medical officer Chris Whitty told the BBC on Wednesday: \u201cBeing outside in the park is a very good thing to do.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Robust studies are demystifying what many intuitively know \u2013 that we often feel restored when we spend time in nature</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He would know. In the past decade, the scientific evidence that connection with nature has important therapeutic benefits for human mental health has mushroomed. Robust studies from disciplines across the world are demystifying what many intuitively know \u2013 that we often feel restored when we spend time in nature.</p> <p>For a number of years I\u2019ve been researching this mechanism for my book, Losing Eden. I was astounded by the variety and range of the evidence. Time spent in nature is linked to lower stress, restored attention, a balanced nervous system, increased levels of cancer-fighting \u201c<a href=\"https://www.immunology.org/public-information/bitesized-immunology/cells/natural-killer-cells\">natural killer cells</a>\u201d, the activation of neural pathways associated with calm, and decreased levels of anxiety and depression. Phytoncides (compounds emitted from trees and plants), relaxation, stress reduction and awe are known to enhance immune function.</p> <p>And there is an abundance of awe outside right now. The leaves are starting to erupt vivid lemon green. We are at the moment just before the natural world really lets rip.</p> <p>Birds are busy making their nests. The baby-skin softness of an unfurling chestnut bud breaks through Bumblebees potter sleepily. The blues and pinks of lungwort are as psychedelic as a Los Angeles sunset.</p> <p>In this new world of uncertainty, nature can be transportive. Get down on to the earth and you can find a new reality. Spring is legal, free LSD.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a symbol of renewal and regeneration that we need at the moment. In <a href=\"http://ww1lit.nsms.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/collections/item/2875\">February Afternoon</a>, by the poet Edward Thomas, birds symbolise constancy, a reassuring sign that the globe is still working: \u201cWhen one, like me, dreamed how / A thousand years might dust lie on his brow / Yet thus would birds do between hedge and shaw.\u201d Nature is a common element in war poetry.</p> <p>Can spending time in nature help people deal with death and dying today? Over the past few years as I\u2019ve talked to people about their psychological relationship with the Earth, I have been moved by the stories of people who have encountered desperate loss and grief and found a solace in the rest of nature.</p> <p>For those faced with the spectre of the death and suffering of loved ones (and, let\u2019s be honest, that is the fear we are living with), the natural world, with its seasons and changes and weather, reminds us of the facts: death and disease are part of life on Earth, but life goes on. On a run around my local cemetery before dusk yesterday, the sky was glowing and the trees were still winter-stark. The birds were piping up, indifferent to the quieter streets and the panic. Rabbits hopped around the daffodils. Obscene, almost, the sublime-meets-Basingstoke, but also grounding.</p> <p>For the religious who are unable to meet for fellowship, or indeed for those who normally find spiritual solace in pubs, recovery meetings or therapy rooms, the natural world could provide a connection with the numinous that it has done for humans over centuries.</p> <p>What about the most vulnerable in our society, the disabled and chronically ill? National Parks have been doing important work improving access to open spaces for people with limited mobility. <a href=\"http://www.southdowns.gov.uk/accessible-routes-south-downs/?fbclid=IwAR2sATZMzl5Ll-kNaqdPpe8jUsB8Lq-hETNt1-lQeN0WklPl4t8HktVxYnE\">The South Downs</a>, for instance, is creating new routes in an aim to become the most accessible park in Britain.</p> <p>And for those who can\u2019t get outdoors at all? Studies have shown that just looking at a picture of the natural world can give stress reduction and wellbeing benefits. But those who looked through glass window at real nature saw a quicker decrease in heart rate than those who looked at a technological nature window. Pot plants, too, are no small thing. GPs in Manchester have even started to <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/plants-herbs-gp-surgery-hulme-16814037\">prescribe</a> them. Much of nature is fractal \u2013 a self-repeating pattern of a shape that varies in scale, rather than repeats exactly. The leaves on a pancake plant (<em>Pilea peperomioides</em><em>)</em>, for instance, which start small and grow in size but repeat the same shape. Richard Taylor, professor of physics at the University of Oregon, found that these fractals provoked brain waves suggesting a relaxed state which could reduce stress levels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/19/uk-nature-reserves-stay-open-for-springtime-solace-during-crisis\">UK nature reserves stay open for springtime solace during crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thankfully, the dawn chorus has started across the country. At 4.30 this morning, on the busy urban street where I live, there was a magical wall of sound. Crack open a window if you\u2019re sleepless in the early morning, or first thing.</p> <p>In the interwar years and second world war, bird song was early public sonic therapy. In 1924, the <a href=\"http://journal.sciencemuseum.org.uk/browse/issue-04/capturing-the-song-of-the-nightingale/beatrice-harrison-s-nightingale-broadcasts/\">BBC recorded</a> the cellist Beatrice Harrison playing in her garden accompanied by a nightingale. It became a cult hit, and the recording was repeated every spring until 1942. It represented something that we all \u201cunconsciously crave and urgently need\u201d as the BBC\u2019s first director general, Lord Reith, wrote.</p> <p>Of course, the natural world isn\u2019t there to make us feel better. It doesn\u2019t exist for mankind. (Nor is it going to be the panacea for our loneliness, stress and worry.) Are there ways, then, that the relationship can be reciprocal, instead of a one-way street? Perhaps by making our gardens nature-led and more habitable for other species. Supporting initiatives that improve access to nature and biodiversity. Ceremonies, rituals, gratitude. Could reconnecting with nature help us see our environment and origins with new eyes? Could we start to see the trees in our stockpiled loo roll?</p> <p>In Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron, the 14th-century novellas about Florence during the Black Death, some people lived temperately, hoping it would protect their health, secluding themselves from society. Others got plastered round the clock: \u201cseeing death imminent they became reckless with their lives\u201d.</p> <p>But there was a third group who kept a middle course. They carried flowers or fragrant herbs, which they \u201cfrequently raised to their noses, deeming it an excellent thing thus to comfort the brain with such perfumes\u201d. More than 600 years later, we would be wise to take a leaf out of their book, and seek joy in spring.</p> <p>\u2022 Lucy Jones is a journalist and the author of Losing Eden: Why Our Minds Need the Wild<br><br></p>",
  "<p>A raven greets me at the gateway, a tutelary spirit flying low overhead. I\u2019m on the southern path, steep and stony, edged with castles of leggy gorse.

I wanted to believe these incidents were the result of college student immaturity, despite the reports that <a href=\"https://time.com/5775716/xenophobia-racism-stereotypes-coronavirus/\">had come out</a> about similar racist behavior. Clearly, I was in denial. Then suddenly, it was in my face.</p> <p>After our final face-to-face class before, 20 or so of my students and I decided to have one last hurrah at a local pizza parlor since we wouldn\u2019t be seeing each other again for a while. At the time, restaurants were still open and we were still allowed to gather in groups of 100 or less. I had taken students to this restaurant many times before without incident for end-of-the-term celebrations \u2013 parties for completing milestones in our program, and simply for them to get a sense of US dining culture.</p> <p>This time was different. The host asked us to wait, though only a couple tables were occupied. Then the manager \u2013 who is also the owner \u2013 came out, gave our group the once-over, and said that I (a Caucasian woman) could stay, but the others had to leave. I could not understand why, and asked over and over what the problem was; I thought maybe the restaurant\u2019s safety or sanitation had been compromised in some way. My students understood the true reason why before I did. It was one of those moments where my white privilege was obvious to everyone but me.</p> <p>I began to argue with the manager, so angry I could hardly get the words out, until one of my students gently pulled me back and said it wasn\u2019t worth it.</p> <p>Rather than making a scene, my students suggested we try another restaurant. Again, we were denied service even though there were only a few people in the place. This happened four times before we finally found a Chinese restaurant that would seat us. This place was actually quite full, with other east Asian diners. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the same injustice had happened to them at other restaurants in town, but regardless, I was glad these diners had a safe place to go.</p> <p>The owner, who\u2019s from Shanghai, stopped by the table to thank us for coming in. We thanked him in return and told him what had happened at the other restaurants.</p> <p>He shared that business started tanking back in January when people learned where Covid-19 originated. He was even being denied service at local grocery stores, gas stations, car washes, cafes and farmers\u2019 markets because workers either assumed he was a carrier or blamed him for the pandemic because of what he looks like.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My international students are even more isolated and vulnerable than the rest of us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To this day, I\u2019m still hearing stories from my students \u2013 we have been Skyping regularly \u2013 about how people walk in the other direction when they see them. Sometimes strangers get aggressive and say things to them like: \u201cThis is <em>your</em> people\u2019s fault.\u201d They\u2019re afraid to walk into places like Walmart or Target because of this. I fear for their safety beyond the coronavirus itself.</p> <p>One student, whose husband and kids are here in the US with her, just told me a story about going to a PTA meeting at her son\u2019s elementary school. She and her husband sat in the back corner of the room so as not to upset or alarm other parents \u2013 it has happened so often, they have come to expect it. She told me other parents approached the person running the meeting and asked for \u201cthat Chinese couple in the back\u201d to be asked to leave. Thankfully the request was not granted, but my student was still deeply upset by it, understandably.</p> <p>We are all having to go into isolation because of Covid-19, through no fault of our own. But many of us have family, friends, co-workers and other members of our community to lean on as we approach the unknown. Now, simple human interactions like visiting the grocery store or even driving down the street and seeing another human face are a treat.</p> <p>My international students are even more isolated and vulnerable than the rest of us. They are in a country that\u2019s becoming increasingly hostile toward them. Everyone in every part of the world is fearful of this infection and how far it will spread, of how many people it will affect.

Her records show why, 70 years later, her son is now one of a fast-growing band of increasingly successful \u2013 and award-winning \u2013 Swedish winemakers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really quite clear,\u201d said Hansson, 68, a former financier who planted his first vines on the south-facing slopes of what is now the H\u00e4ll\u00e5kra vineyard in 2003, and today has about 22,000 on 6.5 hectares.</p> <p>\u201cWe have an extra month of summer now. And winters are not like what they used to be. That\u2019s why we can make wine, and why 50 years ago, we couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>September, Hansson said, used to be the month when temperatures would plummet, but not any more: \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing daytime temperatures of 24 or 25C, even at the end of the month, with perfect, cool nights. Impossible when I was a kid, and not very different from Burgundy.\u201d</p> <p>Even a decade ago, few would have bet on Scandinavia becoming a serious producer of quality wine. But while temperatures of up to 48C <a href=\"https://www.drinks-today.com/wine/news/europes-heatwave-cooks-french-vines\">grilled grapes on the vine</a> in some traditional wine-making areas of southern Europe last summer \u2013 costing some French growers up to 80% of their crop \u2013 global heating is incubating a whole new industry in the Nordic region.</p> <p>Denmark now has about 90 commercial vineyards, compared with two in 2005, while Sweden has 50. A handful of bold pioneers are growing grapes in Finland, and the world\u2019s most northerly functioning vineyard overlooks Norway\u2019s largest fjord.</p> <p>They are, of course, infinitesimally small beer compared with the more established winemakers of southern and central Europe: according to Sveneric Svensson of the Swedish Wine Association, Sweden has barely 125 hectares of land under vine, against an estimated EU total \u2013 mostly in France, Italy and Spain \u2013 of 3.3m.</p> <p>Output is tiny: Sweden produced less than 450,000 litres of wine in 2019; France alone made more than 4.5bn. \u201cWe are still very much in our infancy,\u201d Svensson said. \u201cBut commercial production is now serious. And the quality of the wine is very encouraging. There\u2019s excellent feedback, from around the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"34209bb509a30509033c1f4e047d6c3334868d88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34209bb509a30509033c1f4e047d6c3334868d88/0_269_3280_4101/800.jpg\" alt=\"Murre Sofrakis at Fl\u00e4die vineyard, near M\u00e4lmo\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murre Sofrakis at Fl\u00e4die vineyard, near M\u00e4lmo.

Created in 1975 in Freiburg in southern Germany, the variety is \u201cparticularly suited to Scandinavian conditions\u201d, Sofrakis said. \u201cIt just really seems to like it here. It\u2019s our insurance policy: even in a bad year, it will make a good wine.\u201d</p> <p>The most common variety for reds is rondo, created in 1964 in the former Czechoslovakia by cross-breeding St Laurent, a classic grape more usually seen in the European Alps \u2013 although several growers, including Hansson, have now also begun successfully producing pinot noir.</p> <p>\u201cUp here, it\u2019s a constant and necessary process of trial and error,\u201d Hansson said. \u201cEach year, we try something new in a small part of the vineyard. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. We now know, for example, that merlot isn\u2019t possible here. Very nice leaves, totally lousy grapes.\u201d</p> <p>One advantage that Scandinavia\u2019s neophyte winemakers have over southern European producers is that their more recently developed grape varieties, grown in a cooler climate make for markedly more disease-resistant vines.</p> <p>\u201cThe wine industry, as a whole, uses a lot of chemicals,\u201d said Sofrakis. \u201cIt\u2019s common practice in France, for example, to spray your vines between 14 and 18 times. Here, I haven\u2019t sprayed once in 18 years.\u201d</p> <p>Hansson, along with several Swedish winemakers, now sells to top restaurants in Sweden as well as exporting to <em>sommeliers</em> and specialist wine merchants in cities such as Berlin, Amsterdam and Paris. But it has not always been easy. In the early days, he said, finding a customer was as hard as producing a good wine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Growing is one thing, but producing something decent is very much another</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWine drinkers here were used to a big, classic, southern European flavour profile, which we obviously didn\u2019t match,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But 15 years on, said Mick Daly, an Australian former engineer who now works with Hansson, the fact that the wine \u201cis local, the product of a <em>terroir</em>, of our specific climate and conditions in Sk\u00e5ne \u2026 it used to be a negative; it\u2019s now a positive. We\u2019re no longer just a novelty. People who used to take a glass now take a bottle.\u201d</p> <p>Cracking the Swedish retail market was doubly hard because low production volumes mean prices are necessarily high \u2013 typically \u20ac25-30 (\u00a323-28) a bottle \u2013 and, unlike in Denmark, only the state-run monopoly, Systembolaget, is allowed to sell alcohol in Sweden. Winemakers cannot sell their product on-site or by mail order.</p> <p>But as the quality of Swedish wines has improved, more official stores have begun selling them. \u201cThe quality is really getting there,\u201d said Joel, an assistant manager at Systembolaget\u2019s central Malm\u00f6 outlet, which now offers a dozen different Swedish white, sparkling, red and dessert wines. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a buzz.\u201d</p> <p>At Bloom in the Park, his Michelin-starred restaurant overlooking the lake in the city\u2019s Pildammarna park, Igi Vidal said he was \u201cproud to introduce diners to Swedish wines as objectively fine as these\u201d. Of the five glasses Vidal serves blind with his chef\u2019s much-lauded five-course tasting menu, at least two will be Swedish.</p> <p>\u201cSome early vintages,\u201d he confesses, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have brushed my teeth with. But over the last five years or so, the quality has soared. People who really know something about wine are gobsmacked. You give them a glass, they love it, then you tell them where it comes from they say, \u2018You\u2019re kidding.

Round, creamy, golden \u2026 Comparable with some of the world\u2019s best.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists say the world\u2019s wine map could be fundamentally changed by global heating, with traditional winemaking regions in southern Europe, as well as Australia, California and Latin America, becoming simply too hot while more northerly areas such as the UK, the Netherlands and Scandinavia boom.</p> <p>That does not mean northern vineyards will find life easy. Rising temperatures may have improved growing conditions, but global heating also means more extreme and unpredictable weather: heavy rain, violent storms and hail. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an advantage,\u201d said Hansson. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, too. We will need to be very good growers.\u201d</p> <p>The challenges in southern Europe, however, look daunting. In Spain and Italy, winemakers are moving to higher altitudes and planting on north-facing slopes to prevent record temperatures ripening grapes too fast, boosting their sugar and alcohol content to unacceptable levels and irreversibly altering their flavour.</p> <p>In France, scientists at the Institut des Sciences de la Vigne et du Vin in Bordeaux are exploring how more heat- and drought-resistant grape varieties from countries such as Georgia, Portugal and Tunisia fare in south-west France against traditional Bordeaux varieties such as merlot, which is thought to be unlikely to survive the coming decades.</p> <p>Faced with global heating, producers in the chateaux of the Bordeaux region are hampered by strict rules governing how their wine must be made if it is to qualify for the Bordeaux appellation: irrigation is not allowed and a true Bordeaux wine can be made from just six authorised grape varieties.</p> <p>As irrigation is not seen as a sustainable option, <a href=\"https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/bordeaux-new-wine-grapes-419730/\">producers voted unanimously last July</a> to experiment with allowing up to 10% of seven new grape types \u2013 including two from Portugal \u2013 in the final blend of certain Bordeaux categories in a historic effort to combat the effects of climate change while retaining the wine\u2019s key characteristics.</p> <p>Nordic growers, meanwhile, see mostly upside to the changes ahead. \u201cSerious money\u201d was now being invested in Swedish vineyards, Sofrakis said, the largest of which now have up to 20 hectares under vine. What was once a retirement hobby has become a career option: ambitious young Swedes are studying winemaking in France and California before returning to work in the industry at home.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a critical mass now, a momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the conditions to produce quality wines; there aren\u2019t many places in the world like this. We\u2019re winning prizes \u2013 and we\u2019re still learning. I reckon it\u2019s a 30-year curve: 10 years to indulge your passion, 10 to gain experience, 10 to professionalise. I\u2019m very confident.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Governments across Africa are rushing to reinforce measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, fearing that fragile health systems will be swiftly overwhelmed if the disease spreads beyond a small number of cases on the continent.</p> \n<p>World Health Organization (WHO) officials have called for a strong response to a \u201ctremendously fast rise in the number of countries with cases being confirmed\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to ratchet up what is being done,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is what is done at this point that will determine the numbers who will become very ill \u2026 I still think it is possible that we will prevent large numbers of people dying but it needs coordination, a huge effort and huge resources.\u201d</p> \n<p>Most infections involve people who have recently been in Europe or other disease hot spots, but the number of cases of internal transmission are rising every day.</p> \n<p>Tedros Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, has warned that official numbers may underestimate the extent of the spread of the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cProbably we have undetected cases or unreported cases,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other countries we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point, so the best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today.\u201d</p> \n<p>Health officials across Africa know that hospitals can deal with only a fraction of those needing care if the virus spreads through overcrowded cities, remote villages and among vulnerable populations such as refugees, the malnourished or those suffering from HIV and other chronic conditions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The WHO is working to establish the exact numbers of ICU beds available across the continent. \u201cWe know [the number] is extremely limited \u2026 It is a huge challenge,\u201d said Moetse. \u201cIt is necessary not to give up on containment .\u201d</p> \n<p>South Africa, which has one of Africa\u2019s best public health systems, has fewer than 1,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, of which 160 are in the private sector, for a population of 56m. In Malawi, there are about 25 ICU beds in public hospitals, serving 17 million people. The main infectious diseases hospital in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare, has none, Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights said.</p> \n<p>Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous state, is scrambling to add isolation beds and provide more specialised medical training and equipment at state hospitals.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur health system is not as strong as we\u2019d like it to be,\u201d said Chikwe Ihekweazu, the head of Nigeria\u2019s Centre for Disease Control. \u201cIt is because we are a bit worried about our capacity to deal with a large outbreak that we are focused so intensively on prevention and early detection.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many states have suspended flights and other transport links with badly hit zones in Europe and Asia, or are strictly controlling entry. Restrictions have also been placed on public gatherings, schools and religious services, and mass events have been cancelled across the continent.</p> \n<p>Jane Ruth Aceng, Uganda\u2019s minister of health, said the country was on \u201chigh alert\u201d as almost all its neighbours have registered cases of Covid-19. \u201cNo country can say they are 100% prepared,\u201d Aceng told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Uganda\u2019s new coronavirus tsar, Atel Kagirita, said the virus \u201cwill not be a big problem ... if we can effectively stop local transmission.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe \u2026 don\u2019t envisage having many cases [needing critical care] because we are putting all our efforts on prevention. We are doing a lot of community awareness campaigns and public education,\u201d Kagirita said.</p> \n<p>Though Aceng said she was confident Uganda has \u201cenough capacity beds, some ICU units and ventilation to handle a possible outbreak\u201d, some fear this is too optimistic. Uganda \u2013 population 44m \u2013 is relying primarily on the 1,500-bed Mulago National Referral Hospital. Its ICU can currently accommodate 60 patients.</p> \n<p>There are also limited facilities for isolation. In South Sudan, devastated by a five-year civil war, the government has just 24 isolation beds, said Dr. Angok Gordon Kuol, incident manager for the outbreak at the ministry of health.</p> \n<p>In Somalia, health minister Dr Fawziya Abikar said the government has established a quarantine facility at Mogadishu airport and was equipping a hospital to deal with Covid-19 cases. \u201cWe are still waiting for more equipment for the hospital to arrive,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Dr Ali Yusuf, one of a team of health officials preventing and controlling the Coronavirus, told the Guardian that facilities were extremely limited. \u201cWe only have 15 tents, with one bed each for quarantine and isolation of suspected cases. Our hospital can accommodate only 100 beds,\u201d Dr Yusuf said.</p> \n<p>Many African countries have extensive experience in controlling highly infectious and potentially lethal diseases. Preparations for an outbreak of Ebola, which killed more than 11,000 people in west Africa between 2013 and 2016, mean that Uganda has already stockpiled protective equipment, drugs and tents, as well as developing a capacity of moving samples around the country to a central laboratory or using mobile testing laboratories.</p> \n<p>Also, the delayed arrival of the virus has allowed governments to work with the WHO to strengthen emergency coordination, improve surveillance, and begin equipping treatment centres.</p> \n<p>But few doubt that if the virus starts to take hold the consequences could be very serious, with health systems rapidly overwhelmed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Prof Pauline Byakika, a specialist in infectious diseases at Uganda\u2019s Makerere University College of Health Sciences, said she was worried that \u201conce its gets here, [coronavirus] was going to spread very fast\u201d.

Currencies such as UK sterling and the Australian dollar were hammered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/britain-faces-economic-emergency-warns-new-bank-of-england-governor-andrew-bailey-covid-19\">as the clamour for safety sucked money into US dollar holdings</a>.</p> <p>US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/18/steven-mnuchin-coronavirus-unemployment-treasury-secretary\">unemployment could rise to 20% in America</a> in what the ratings agency Moody\u2019s said was an \u201cunprecedented\u201d shock to the system. S&amp;P warned this week that these factors would lead to a \u201csurge\u201d in corporate bankruptcies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was OK for companies to build up debt and keep rolling it over when borrowing costs were low</p> <footer> <cite>Angus Coote, investor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Angus Coote, of Jamieson Coote Bonds in Melbourne, said the crisis could soon explode the massive debt bubble inflated by years of low interest rates and cheap money.</p> <p>\u2018These are truly extraordinary times,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s quite sobering. I\u2019ve been in the business for 25 years and this makes the GFC [global financial crisis] look like child\u2019s play.\u201d</p> <p>The problem was particularly acute in the corporate borrowing market, he said, where many companies will struggle to refinance debt due to a repeat of the sudden change in credit conditions that sparked the 2007 credit crunch, banking collapses and then the GFC. The prospect of no revenue for months meant creditworthiness had plummeted in exposed sectors and cut off access to funding.</p> <p>\u201cIt was OK for companies to build up debt and keep rolling it over when borrowing costs were low,\u201d Coote told the Guardian. \u201cBut now the market is not trading at all and companies trying to roll over bonds face higher costs and the result will be bankruptcy events.</p> <p>\u201c$2tn worth of corporate debt is due to be rolled over this year but the market has completely frozen. The market is essentially closed. It\u2019s a disaster.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK on Wednesday, managers of several large property funds banned investors from withdrawing their money. In a sign the crisis could spread through all types of assets, they said the coronavirus crisis had made it impossible to value the buildings they own.</p> <p>The US-based Vanguard investment group <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/investing/extreme-market-stress-puts-us6-4-trillion-etf-sector-under-acute-pressure\">told clients on Wednesday</a> it had been forced to hike its fees for anyone who wanted to withdraw their money from investments known as exchange traded funds (ETFs), blaming a \u201csignificant\u201d rise in trading costs. There is an estimated $6.4tn in ETFs around the world.</p> <p>Lindsay David, of independent consultancy LF Economics, said the coronavirus shutdown had exposed longstanding imbalances in the financial system that had been disguised by more than a decade of ultra-low interest rates and trillions of dollars from quantitative easing schemes in the major economies.</p> <p>\u201cWe know everyone is overleveraged, full bore, full risk,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we were waiting for was a trigger and unfortunately that has come in the form of a health crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Both he and Coote cited the example of the Australian airline Virgin Australia, which has seen its market value more than halve this year to $500m while still saddled with $5bn of debt, which it will need to roll over. \u201cNo one in their right mind is going to lend Virgin Australia money,\u201d Coote said.</p> <p>The situation could be repeated across the world with the US shale oil industry seen as one of the highest-risk sectors after a rapid expansion fuelled by easy credit. S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 head of research, Alexandra Dimitrijevic, said tightening credit \u201cwill likely result in a surge in defaults, with a default rate on non-financial corporates in the US that may rise above 10% and into the high single digits in Europe over the next 12 months\u201d.</p> <p>Banks are also in jeopardy, according to David, and could soon require the kind of bailout packages that saved them in the GFC and which are now looking certain to be rolled out for airlines, carmakers and a whole range of other sectors.</p> <p>A full repeat of the post-Lehman Brothers crisis was on the cards, he said, as banks scrambled to hold on to liquidity.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s say you are a pension fund in Canada and six years ago you gave a bank $1bn. Every year you roll over that bond and the deal remains in place. But now you\u2019re saying, \u2018you know what, can I have that money back now?\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo the problem for the company is, where will I find $1bn? Not from its deposits or its liquidity because it\u2019s now got more money going out than coming in.\u201d<br></p>",

He responded on Twitter to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/westcoastbill/status/1240703534749769733\">post</a> by the venture capitalist Ben Lee that linked to a Daily Wire write-up of an <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/\">op-ed</a> by John PA Ioannidis, a Stanford University professor of medicine and epidemiology. The Daily Wire is the website of rightwing commentator Ben Shapiro. </p> <p>Ioannidis argued in his <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/\">op-ed</a> in the science publication Stat News on 17 March that decisions about Covid-19 were being made with insufficient and unreliable data. Ioannidis did not prescribe or denounce any policies, but did question how long social distancing could be maintained and whether school closures were the right course of action based on the evidence.</p> <p>\u201cImo [in my opinion], this professor is correct,\u201d Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1240707187229380608\">tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Musk also cited statistics which he argued showed that the growth rate of new infections is slowing. The Ioannidis article argued that current data is incomplete and unreliable.</p> <p>Later in the day, Musk also asserted false information about the virus\u2019s effect on children. Children with confirmed cases of Covid-19 have generally experienced milder symptoms than adults, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fchildren-faq.html\">according</a> to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The largest study to date of children with the virus, published online in the journal <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2020/03/16/peds.2020-0702.full.pdf\">Pediatrics</a>, found that a small percentage of children became severely or critically ill with the disease. The study found that young children and infants were especially vulnerable to infection.</p> <p>Musk tweeted that children are \u201cessentially immune\u201d, which is false.</p> <p>Twitter, which on Wednesday announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/twitter-to-remove-harmful-fake-news-about-coronavirus\">new rules banning harmful misinformation</a> about coronavirus, did not immediately respond to queries from the Guardian. Among the categories of misinformation that Twitter specifically said would be banned was: \u201cDenial of established scientific facts about transmission during the incubation period or transmission guidance from global and local health authorities, such as \u2018COVID-19 does not infect children because we haven\u2019t seen any cases of children being sick.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week, Musk drew criticism for keeping the Tesla factory in the San Francisco Bay Area open despite a \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d order from local officials designed to shutter \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses. (Tesla has reportedly agreed to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/tesla-tells-workers-it-awaits-final-word-on-u-s-plant-status\">reduce staffing levels</a> from 10,000 to 2,500 amid the health crisis; workers have expressed concern about their conditions to <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/tesla-fremont-factory-stays-open-coronavirus-sheriff\">BuzzFeed News</a>.)</p> <p>On Thursday evening, the company <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-operational-update\">announced</a> that it would cease manufacturing at the factory on 23 March.</p> <p>\u201cDespite taking all known health precautions, continued operations in certain locations has caused challenges for our employees, their families and our suppliers,\u201d the company wrote in a notice to investors. \u201cAs such, we have decided to temporarily suspend production at our factory in Fremont, from end of day March 23, which will allow an orderly shutdown.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Musk nor Tesla has responded to requests for comment on his or the company\u2019s approach to the pandemic.</p>",

Moscow is rushing to build a new hospital similar to the ones that were built in China at the height of the coronavirus outbreak there. The new hospital will have beds for 500 patients and will be ready in the next month, officials have said. </p> \n  <p>While the government has claimed that its success has stemmed from early border closures with China and quick isolation of suspected cases, there are also concerns that Russia may be underestimating the official numbers of those infected with coronavirus in order to avert public panic. </p> \n  <p>Last week, the Russian business daily RBC reported that registered pneumonia cases in Moscow had grown 37% between January 2019 and January 2020, speculating that a wave of new coronavirus infections could have been registered as cases of pneumonia or other pulmonary diseases. </p> \n  <p>The Kremlin has said that it is protecting Vladimir Putin, 67, from contracting the disease by testing members of his entourage. During a trip to Crimea, the peninsula annexed from Ukraine in March 2014, Putin said: \u201cThank God, we generally have everything under control so far. Hopefully, it will continue in the future.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Russia has closed its borders to most foreigners and has cancelled many flights to Europe and the US.

When the last one started in 2008 it took the Bank of England six months to spot it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/britain-faces-economic-emergency-warns-new-bank-of-england-governor-andrew-bailey-covid-19\">This time it is different</a>. Then it was a financial virus, this time it is the real thing. Commentators often say the economy is hitting the wall or is falling off a cliff on the weakest of evidence.

That is not a recession, it is a collapse surpassing anything in modern times, including the Great Depression.</p> \n  <p>When the banks were bailed out in 2008, it was because policymakers feared precisely what is now happening: a complete shutdown of the global economy. The rescue package worked, but only just. The early indications from China are that the impact of Covid-19 is markedly greater than that of the financial crisis, itself the most severe downturn of the postwar era.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/peacetime-constraints-ditched-in-the-war-for-economic-survival\">Peacetime constraints ditched in the war for economic survival | Larry Elliott</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e73138a8f085e564ad86e93\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T06:47:50.961Z\">6.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dozens of London underground stations are to be closed indefinitely</strong>.

And now, more than ever, we need each other. We need each other for truth, for support, and to feel less alone during a time that can honestly feel quite scary. There are so many around the world who need support right now, who are working tirelessly to respond to this crisis behind the scenes, on the frontline, or at home. Our willingness, as a people, to step up in the face of what we are all experiencing with COVID-19 is awe-inspiring. This moment is as true a testament there is to the human spirit. We often speak of compassion. All of our lives are in some way affected by this, uniting each of us globally. How we approach each other and our communities with empathy and kindness is indisputably important right now. Over the coming weeks, this will be our guiding principle. We will be sharing information and resources to help all of us navigate the uncertainty: from posting accurate information and facts from trusted experts, to learning about measures we can take to keep ourselves and our families healthy, to working with organisations that can support our mental and emotional well-being. In addition, we will focus on the inspiring stories of how so many of you around the world are connecting in ways big and small to lift all of us up. We are all in this together, and as a global community we can support each other through this process \u2013 and build a digital neighbourhood that feels safe for every one of us. We look forward to sharing more over the days and weeks to come...</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/sussexroyal/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> The Duke and Duchess of Sussex</a> (@sussexroyal) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-03-18T15:17:29+00:00&quot;>Mar 18, 2020 at 8:17am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72d7d48f085c6327bc2b31\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T02:27:16.468Z\">2.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Between <strong>400 and 500 foreigners are stranded in Panama</strong> after a \u201ctribal\u201d festival and music event ended with many of them being quarantined at the concert site near the Caribbean beach of Playa Chiquita, an organiser said Wednesday. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b04b92e57ab0a75daa415330a19efa381f78d292\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b04b92e57ab0a75daa415330a19efa381f78d292/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Panama\u2019s health workers check attendees of the Tribal Gathering festival rock in Cuango, Colon province, Panama, on March 18, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Panama\u2019s health workers check attendees of the Tribal Gathering festival rock in Cuango, Colon province, Panama, on March 18, 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luis Acosta/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>At the same time, Panama\u2019s government announced that the <strong>number of coronavirus cases in the country had risen to 109</strong> and that a nighttime curfew would be imposed beginning Wednesday night. <br><br>James Baker of Manchester, England, said those attending the Tribal Gathering included people from Spain, Canada, the United States, Denmark, France, Britain and Hungary as well as Costa Rica, Colombia, Chile and Mexico. <br><br>Baker said authorities in Panama had instituted a requirement that <strong>all those seeking to leave had to prove they had been in Panama for at least 14 days</strong>.

The US has less than 950,000 hospital beds which is the equivalent of 2.8 per 1,000 people - a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html\">lower rate than China, South Korea and Italy.</a> </p> \n  <p>Almost 20% of the US population - or 49million people - are aged over 65. But as this varies hugely by county, it\u2019s important to know where they are, and where the beds are.</p> \n  <p>New research by <a href=\"https://headwaterseconomics.org/equity/hospital-access-seniors/\">Headwaters Economics </a>and <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/north-covid19-crowded-cities-and-lonely-country-see-your-countys-hospital-bed-capacity?utm_source=wcn1&amp;utm_medium=email\">High Country News </a>has found that 1.8 million people 65 years and older - or 4% of all US seniors - live in a county without a hospital. In addition, 86% of counties with no hospital beds have a higher than national average senior population; most of those counties are rural.</p> \n  <p>This snapshot, which uses data from the Department of Homeland Security and Commerce Department, is important as 10 to 20% of those who get infected with Covid-19 could require hospitalization, according to what we\u2019ve seen in Asia and Europe. The vast majority of these are elderly people and/or those with preexisting medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes or respiratory problems.</p> \n  <p>The research identifies stark deficiencies in some regions: over 570,000 people in 11 Western states live in counties without hospitals. The majority are in Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico and Oregon. Whereas in California\u2019s Riverside County, home to the popular retirement community of Palm Springs, there are 10 beds for every 1000 seniors - well above the national average.</p> \n  <p>But, surprisingly perhaps, while many rural communities have no nearby hospital, rural areas in the West actually have more hospital beds on average per person than urban areas.</p> \n  <p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/articles/north-covid19-crowded-cities-and-lonely-country-see-your-countys-hospital-bed-capacity?utm_source=wcn1&amp;utm_medium=email\">here.</a><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e73c2678f088d7575596bc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T19:09:53.359Z\">7.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Senator Lindsey Graham is trying to convince Trump to oppose direct payments in response to the coronavirus crisis, </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1240709683792318464\">according to a Politico reporter</a>.</p> \n  <p>However, the <strong>Trump administration </strong>has expressed openness to the idea, which would be included in the third coronavirus response bill.</p> \n  <p>Treasury secretary <strong>Steven Mnuchin </strong>said this morning that he expected American families to start receiving payments within three weeks of the stimulus bill being passed by Congress.</p> \n  <p>Mnuchin said the administration was looking at providing $1,000 to American adults and $500 to children, so a family of four would receive $3,000. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e73befb8f088d7575596b8e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jessica-glenza\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T18:52:39.143Z\">6.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A researcher who spurred the United States and United Kingdom to action with dire coronavirus modeling has been diagnosed with Covid-19 himself.</p> \n  <p>Professor Neil Ferguson heads modeling at Imperial College London\u2019s MRC centre for global infectious disease analysis.

The number of positive cases increased by 643, or 25%, to 3,269, as local authorities were promised funding for social care and the NHS appealed to retired doctors and nurses to return.</p> <h2>Health secretary could not live on UK sick pay</h2> <p>Matt Hancock admitted he could not survive on statutory sick pay, \u00a394.25 per week, but went on to raise the prospect of further help for some of the most disadvantaged as the economic consequences of the coronavirus took effect. There are fears that some workers may not self-isolate if they experience symptoms because they are worried about losing income.</p> <h2>Trump incorrectly claims drug ready \u2018almost immediately\u2019</h2> <p>The US president sowed fresh confusion about his government\u2019s response to the pandemic by claiming that chloroquine, a therapeutic drug that has not been approved for use against coronavirus, would be available \u201calmost immediately\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-drug-trump-confusion-malaria-treatment-readiness\">only to be swiftly contradicted by officials</a>.

Thirteen elderly people at the same nursing centre died earlier this month.</p> <h2>Netflix to reduce streaming quality to ease internet pressure</h2> <p>Movies, TV episodes and other videos for Netflix users across Europe will temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/19/netflix-to-slow-europe-transmissions-to-avoid-broadband-overload\">have their quality reduced</a> to ease pressure on internet service providers. It is expected that the connection speed will be reduced by 25%.</p> <h2>Brazil to close large majority of border</h2> <p>Latin America\u2019s largest country is to close its borders with most of its South American neighbours \u2013 a decision others had already made and is therefore mainly symbolically significant \u2013 and is treating any patient with symptoms of \u201csevere flu\u201d as a coronavirus case.</p> <h2>UN world food programme director tests positive</h2> <p>David Beasley said he had tested positive for coronavirus after a trip to Canada. The former governor of South Carolina said his symptoms were mild and he was in good spirits. He is working from home and his employees are helping him inform anyone he had contact with during his trip.</p> <h2>Do not forget those fleeing war and persecution, warns UN chief</h2> <p>Filippo Grandi, the United Nations refugee chief, urged states not to block the passage of asylum seekers as countries close their borders to control the pandemic. \u201cThey need \u2013 we all need - solidarity and compassion now more than ever before,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Cannes film festival postponed</h2> <p>This year\u2019s edition of the film showcase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/19/cannes-film-festival-postpones-2020-edition-over-coronavirus-restrictions\">is to be delayed</a> after the French government banned public gatherings of more than 100 people on Friday, then joined the EU-wide lockdown preventing non-EU nationals from entering the Schengen zone.</p> <h2>Plans to encourage Chinese cinemagoers to the movies</h2> <p>Business at Chinese cinemas, when most of its 70,000 screens reopen at the end of March,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/19/chinese-cinemas-detail-plans-to-lure-back-audiences-after-coronavirus\"> is to be kickstarted</a> by Chinese blockbusters American Dreams in China and 2015\u2019s Wolf Totem, along with two patriotic crowdpleasers chosen by the country\u2019s main state-owned distributor.</p>"
