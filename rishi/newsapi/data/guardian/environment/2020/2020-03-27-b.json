In the age of consequences, with the climate crisis and a deadly pandemic bearing down on us, it\u2019s impossible to pretend that we are separate from each other and from the natural world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/the-forest-is-now-terribly-silent-land-set-aside-for-threatened-species-entirely-burnt-out\">'The forest is now terribly silent': land set aside for threatened species entirely burnt out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A pandemic, more than almost any other phenomenon, shows that all our lives are inextricably intertwined, for now and forever, whether we like it or not. It brings into sharp focus the impossibility of trying to keep economics, health, environment, education and social justice treated as separate questions with separate answers. It heightens awareness of our vital need, as social beings, to stay connected to each other as well as we possibly can while keeping our physical distance.</p> <p>It shows how the \u201cefficient\u201d, on-demand world that capitalism has constructed is so incredibly fragile that a series of shocks can bring it to the point of collapse. And with the rules of neoliberal economics being broken by governments the world over, it demonstrates that massive policy interventions, shifting the entire structure of the global economy, are possible.</p> <p>With the complete focus right now on Covid-19, it takes an effort to cast our minds back to this summer\u2019s bushfires. They were, of course, far larger and fiercer than ever before, over a season that started when we were barely out of winter. Where previously bushfires had affected a small number of people, this season the smoke blanketing Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, and the repeated evacuation of summer holiday spots, meant that <a href=\"https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/three-quarters-of-aussies-impacted-by-angry-summer-bushfires\">most Australians</a> were affected.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Covid-19, among other things, shows us the consequences of deregulating markets in health services, food supply and more</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This heralded a shift in thinking that went deeper than personal impact. Perhaps due to the remarkably low loss of human life compared with the scale of the disaster, there was a tremendous focus on the more than a billion mammals, birds and reptiles killed. We mourned the thousands of koalas and the numerous species being pushed towards extinction if their habitats aren\u2019t restored.</p> <p>The true legacy of this summer could be a vital turning point in recognising that \u201cthe environment\u201d isn\u2019t something \u201cover there\u201d. The environment is the air we breathe and the water we drink; it\u2019s the soil in which we grow our food; it\u2019s the animals we identify with and the landscapes imprinted on our souls; the environment is us, all of us, together, integrally connected with everyone and everything else on this beautiful blue marble floating in space.</p> <p>Damage the environment and we damage ourselves. And not just some of us \u2013 all of us together. Continue to think in our compartmentalised, linear fashion, and we\u2019ll keep missing what\u2019s coming, be it weeks of smoke, runs on toilet paper, or deadly pandemics.</p> <p>What started to become clear thanks to the fires was rammed home by Covid-19. We are only as healthy as the least healthy among us. Everything we do relies on extraordinary networks of activity by people we\u2019ve never met, crisscrossing the globe. And responding to a health crisis that was likely <a href=\"https://ensia.com/features/covid-19-coronavirus-biodiversity-planetary-health-zoonoses/\">triggered in part by environmental destruction</a> has world-changing impacts on the economy, on education, on social justice, on geopolitics.</p> <p>The age of disconnection is over.</p> <p>To bring us back to where we started, where does that leave the review of the EPBC Act?</p> <p>We have an opportunity now to not just push for a new generation of environment laws, but to re-evaluate the whole deal, to cultivate a new political settlement based on ecological principles of living well together in harmony with the natural world, understanding our place as part of it as First Peoples did for millenniums, with an economy designed to serve people and planet.</p> <p>As part of this, in the immediate term we need to advocate for vital improvements to the EPBC. It is extraordinary that the Howard legacy of deliberately excluding a project\u2019s climate impacts from the triggers to require assessment still hasn\u2019t been remedied. That must now be fixed, as must the fact that there is no mechanism for assessing the cumulative ecological impacts of various proposals. After this summer\u2019s destruction of huge areas of remaining healthy ecosystems, we need to institute, in both legislation and the practice of assessment, a presumption of protection instead of a culture of managed destruction.</p> <p>All this will, of course, be attacked as \u201cgreen tape\u201d and we have to be ready to actively defend it instead of changing the subject \u2013 and defend it on ecological grounds. Regulation is a vital part of the connective tissue which holds the body politic together. Removing it sees us fall apart. Covid-19 is, among other things, showing us the consequences of deregulating markets in health services, food supply and more.</p> <p>Having that conversation in this way means we won\u2019t just be advocating for marginal improvements, but will be working to change politics. We\u2019ll be building into the political common sense the idea that corporations absolutely should be regulated to enforce environmental and social responsibilities, and that we can no longer consider shareholder profit to be their sole focus. That helps move our politics towards altering the DNA of corporations so they operate as part of the body politic rather than as cancer cells.</p> <p>The flip side of this systemic shift is to institute legal rights for the natural world. If BHP has legal rights, why shouldn\u2019t the Great Barrier Reef? Rights of nature is an increasingly mature legal field, instituted from New Zealand to Bolivia, India to parts of the US. We can and should at least insert them as a normative principle in the goals of the EPBC.</p> <p>While we\u2019re thinking at that level, a new ecological political settlement will need a rethink of federalism. Our system sees national and state governments cooperating to shut out community participation and scientific advice to facilitate destructive development. An effective regime based on a presumption of protection would see federal, state, territory and local governments enabling communities to collectively develop creative ideas at their local level, within the context of expert scientific advice, and coordinating those ideas at a regional and continental level.</p> <p>If we shift environmental regulation from a process that is primarily responsive to demands of developers into a proactive, constructive, community-led system, we can see it morph from a defensive protection stance into one of active restoration, repair and regeneration. It can lead to the greening of cities and towns as we embrace the fact that habitats are not just \u201cover there\u201d but among us. It can create industrial jobs in coalmine rehabilitation. It can support regenerative agriculture, and cooperative sharing of scarce water. It can even open space for community-led conversations about relocation as the overheating world retreats from rising seas and inland desertification is inevitable.</p> <p>Supporting and enabling communities to make decisions is also vital for rebuilding confidence in democracy, which has collapsed in recent years. The ongoing panic-buying response to Covid-19 suggests that the abject failure of government to provide leadership through the fires worsened this further. This is now an opportunity to rethink governance, reclaim agency for communities, build practices of trust and social cohesion, embedded in respect for expert advice.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s important to recognise that with this government we\u2019re not going to get these kinds of changes. At best we might hold off the push to weaken the EPBC even further. But that shouldn\u2019t stop us advocating for what we need. Quite the opposite.</p> <p>Politics, like the natural world it operates within, is a system. It works in complex ways because all it is is the collected actions of humans, influenced by each other and by external impetuses such as the weather. Or viruses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-nature-is-sending-us-a-message-says-un-environment-chief\">Coronavirus: 'Nature is sending us a message\u2019, says UN environment chief</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Donella Meadows, the modern mother of systems thinking, wrote that the most <a href=\"http://www.donellameadows.org/wp-content/userfiles/Leverage_Points.pdf\">effective leverage point</a> to change a system is \u201cthe mindset or paradigm out of which the system ... arises\u201d.

In recent weeks the crisis has become such that even mainstream politics finds it impossible to ignore.</p> <p>At the same time, over this period numerous people decided to just get on with it, without waiting for government.

Hour by hour, there is more propulsion. But we aren\u2019t yet far enough away from pre-pandemic life to have forgotten what it was like to think of something other than am I standing too close to that person, and when was the last time I washed my hands?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/26/australia-is-scared-and-confused-about-coronavirus-is-scott-morrison-the-leader-we-need-for-this-grave-moment\">Australia is scared and confused about coronavirus. Is Scott Morrison the leader we need for this grave moment? | Richard Flanagan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This acceleration of time also suspends the Morrison government between its pre-pandemic identity and the weight of present responsibilities. There are a million ways to chart this. I used one small example last weekend, where the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, laughed raucously at wellbeing only a few weeks ago and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/remember-josh-frydenberg-scoffing-at-a-wellbeing-budget-hes-not-laughing-any-more\">now thinks of nothing else</a>.</p> <p>Robodebt is another issue that strands the government between old mantras and present realities. Five minutes ago, chasing a surplus was so important to this government that it wrongly issued, as my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/27/robodebt-government-admits-it-will-be-forced-to-refund-550m-under-botched-scheme\">reported this week</a>, more than 400,000 welfare debts to vulnerable people that it will now have to refund. Five minutes ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/30/the-robodebt-horror-was-all-about-boosting-the-budget-thats-the-brutal-truth\">chasing those debts was more important</a> than checking whether the income averaging method it was using was lawful.</p> <p>Now, the debt ceiling has been lifted, and we are all Keynesians. The very same government has retooled the welfare system and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/australian-jobseekers-to-get-550-increase-as-part-of-huge-coronavirus-welfare-package\">doubled the unemployment benefit</a> for the next six months, because the health crisis demands that large swathes of the economy go into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/overseas-arrivals-to-australia-to-be-quarantined-in-hotels-for-two-weeks-over-coronavirus\">a period of suspended animation.</a> It is a terrible time to be a small government ideologue.</p> <p>All this shape shifting creates significant questions about what the future looks like. In the moments I can think, which are fleeting right now because of the relentless pace of events, I wonder what Australia and the world will look like five years from now, because only one thing is certain: this crisis will put the world on a different axis.</p> <p>The global financial crisis, which was the biggest global economic shock since the Depression, triggered a fundamental realignment. Nativism and protectionism resurfaced. Cheap jack populists expressed fatigue with experts. Americans, God help them, chose Donald Trump as their president. The far right resurfaced in parts of Europe. Britain retreated from Europe after a convulsion that paralysed one of the greatest democracies in the world for several years.</p> <p>Current indications suggest this pandemic will inflict a more substantial economic shock than the GFC, because our capacity to pump prime domestic economies is curtailed. In the Depression, the government could pay people to go out and build roads and bridges. In the GFC, the government could give people money in the certainty that they would hit the shops and spend for Australia. But in this event, stimulatory measures have to be balanced against public health risks, unless you are a leader like Trump who makes a virtue of endangering his own citizens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/the-unemployment-rate-doesnt-go-back-to-normal-after-a-recession-there-are-long-term-effects\">The unemployment rate doesn't go back to normal after a recession \u2013 there are long term effects | Ken Henry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The thought exercise I\u2019m embarking on this weekend is necessary, but mildly mind-blowing \u2013 what is the post-pandemic outlook for democratic governments?</p> <p>Driven by the pro-market economic orthodoxy that existed pre-GFC, liberal democracies have spent decades shrinking governments. As governments have ceded power, many societies have also lost faith in the political class \u2013 in Australia, particularly over the past decade. The share of the vote going to the major parties has declined. Trust is low. Voters are disillusioned.</p> <p>Yet it has been striking in this crisis how citizens in this country have looked to government as a deeply ingrained reflex. There is a hardwired collective expectation that government will provide a safety net during the economic shock, and also to tell people in clear terms what they should do to minimise the risks of infection.</p> <p>So even though we are disillusioned, there appears to be a durable expectation that government will lead, and there is fury if leadership doesn\u2019t materialise.</p> <p>Also striking over the past 10 days has been the rolling dialogue within the Australian federation. In places like the United Kingdom or New Zealand, national governments just assert that various things will happen, and they happen. In Australia, responsibilities are divided, so the various tiers of government in this countries are forced to engage in an old-fashioned policy deliberation. They are forced to consider, in full public view, the health response and the economic response; as Morrison is fond of putting this exercise, weighing lives and livelihoods.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/overseas-arrivals-to-australia-to-be-quarantined-in-hotels-for-two-weeks-over-coronavirus\">Overseas arrivals to Australia to be quarantined in hotels for two weeks over coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is actually a good thing.

I mean, how bloody ridiculous. We all need to be questioning every decision as constructively as possible rather than lapsing into placid groupthink. The opposition, the media, all citizens.</p> <p>Now is the time for everybody in this nation to care about one another sufficiently to show up and play our respective roles in a democracy, particularly at a time when parliament is suspended, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/australias-civil-liberties-under-coronavirus-advocates-warn-laws-must-be-temporary\">civil liberties are being curtailed</a> in the service of of saving lives.</p> <p>Oppositions and journalists need to engage in good faith and clear heads with the reasoning behind the decisions that are being made, and stress test the various propositions. Governments also need to be transparent about why they are making calls at particular times. For example, neither Morrison nor the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, would give a plain English answer to a question on Friday about what the specific trigger points would be for further lockdowns.</p> <p>While political leaders are acutely conscious at the minute of not pushing deeply anxious people into a full-tilt panic by talking about scenarios of surges of infections as if it were an academic seminar, building confidence in decision making will be assisted by transparency, not by secrecy.</p> <p>Let\u2019s end our thinking this weekend this way.

As politicians grapple with the social and economic carnage caused by the global health crisis, Foster is calling on sport in Australia, now that there is no sport, to unite and pitch in during this extraordinary time of need.</p> <p>\u201cSport is closed down across the country. That is a trauma for many people in itself. But broader society is hurting, we\u2019re all hurting together,\u201d Foster tells Guardian Australia. \u201cOne of the best ways for sport to recover from all this is to connect to each other and to the broader Australian community. Sporting clubs are important social connectors.\u201d</p> <p>Foster is calling on the multitudes connected with community sport in Australia to redeploy their volunteering efforts and play not for points this season, but for lives. It\u2019s a grand concept. And if it sounds like a movement, that\u2019s because it is: the <a href=\"www.playforlives.org\">#PlayForLives</a> movement.</p> <p>\u201cNow that sport is being closed own, we have participants who were training and competing for four to five hours per week,\u201d Foster says. \u201cWe\u2019re asking all of sport to step up and apply that to not only their own community but to the rest of Australia. What\u2019s occurred at community level is that many of the social service delivery agencies, who are making meals, delivering hot meals, driving people around, their funding has dried up and many of them have had to close the doors. The load on those that are still existing has expanded exponentially.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to put sport at the service of the Australian community. Sport has a number of values which are really important: teamwork, solidarity and endurance. The need for volunteering in the last couple of weeks has become more acute than ever. We\u2019re asking all participants who were going to play to put themselves forward to volunteer in some way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Craig_Foster/status/1242659664359092225\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayForLives?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PlayForLives</a> <br><br>Sport\u2019s role now is not to play for points, but lives<br><br>We can no longer play onfield &amp; are putting ourselves at the service of essential services<br><br>Football clubs are volunteering for community organisations &amp; charities including Adam &amp; I<br><br>Get in touch\ud83d\udc47<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WOBFC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WOBFC</a> \u2764\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/R67p5l7cXY\">pic.twitter.com/R67p5l7cXY</a></p>&mdash; Craig Foster (@Craig_Foster) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Craig_Foster/status/1242659664359092225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 25, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Such a call to arms might seem precarious at a time when human movement is governed by social distancing and lockdowns. But Foster envisages a broad spectrum of assistance.</p> <p>\u201cThere are millions of ways we can help. If we create a sporting coalition for humanity, a sporting volunteer workforce, people can add their own professional skills. People are working from home now. The time they would\u2019ve been training and playing they can now use to apply their professional skills as a designer, a lawyer, an IT expert.</p> <p>\u201cSafety is the absolute priority for everyone right now. Nevertheless, the need for people to physically go and help pack boxes, to drive cancer patients to hospital, to drive trucks, to deliver food to refugees and vulnerable families is chronic.</p> <p>\u201cFor some it will be volunteering in community and taking every precaution under government guidelines, for others it might be from home in a digital sense. That\u2019s a matter for the non-government organisations. Red Cross will be interested in delivering digital messaging campaigns, whereas Foodbank and Meals On Wheels will need us packing boxes to get to families that night. There\u2019s a triad of sport, government and NGOs that need to work together right now.\u201d</p> <p>What started out as a good idea that Foster floated to his Waverley Old Boys Over 35s teammates has taken off, with a variety of sporting bodies and public figures pledging their commitment to #PlayForLives.</p> <p>\u201cFootball has responded beautifully. There is a tremendous amount of desire within the game to step forward. I\u2019m expecting that FFA [Football Federation Australia] will be getting involved in the near term. But this need is far too great. One sport can\u2019t cover it,\u201d he says. To that end Foster has succeeded in getting the NSWRL on board, with Brad Fittler and Ben Elias to serve in ambassadorial roles. Foster says discussions with Rugby Australia and the AFL are progressing well, while Liz Ellis has picked up the ball on behalf of the netball community.</p> <p>\u201cWe need both levels of sport involved. We need national level for scale and we need grassroots community for connectedness, for relationships, for personal support. A top-down approach is great because we can scale really quickly and get a lot of information to a lot of people.

There was no new funding for this request, but Hall referred council leaders to an earlier announcement of \u00a31.6bn for local authorities\u2019 Covid-19 response.</p> \n<p>In a significant departure from normal rules, he also stressed that people classified as having \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d (a status given to people who are seeking asylum, or who have a limited immigration status), who normally have no right to housing support or benefits, should also be helped with emergency accommodation. But it was not clear how councils would fund this provision.

  "<p>The motor industry has been accused by campaigners of trying to use the coronavirus crisis to avert stricter environmental regulation, after correspondence showed carmakers had lobbied the EU to defer impending laws.</p> <p>The European carmakers\u2019 association, ACEA, and other groups representing the supply chain called on the EU to delay implementing regulations because the pandemic had affected its \u201cplans to comply\u201d. Laws due to come into effect include tougher targets on vehicle CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p> <p>In a letter to the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, the groups said production and sales of cars had stalled in many countries and companies were facing a cash crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-uk-lockdown-big-drop-air-pollution\">Coronavirus UK lockdown causes big drop in air pollution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While appealing for more financial aid to maintain liquidity, the ACEA said activities such as development and testing would inevitably suffer, which \u201cupsets the plans we had made to prepare ourselves for complying with existing and future EU laws and regulations within the applicable deadlines\u201d.</p> <p>It said: \u201cWe believe therefore that some adjustment would need to be made to the timing of these laws. Please be assured, however, that it is not our intention to question the laws as such nor the underlying objectives of road safety, climate change mitigation and protection of the environment.\u201d</p> <p>European laws on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of new vehicles have applied since 2015 and a further tightening of the rules is due in January 2021. Manufacturers could potentially face huge fines for non-compliance, although the targets have pushed production towards less polluting cars.</p> <p>Campaigners described the call as shameless. <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/\">Greenpeace UK</a>\u2019s executive director, John Sauven, said: \u201cMany industries are facing difficulties during this challenging period that require governments and corporations to protect their workers. But it would be a mistake to use this crisis as a reason to roll back on environmental regulations. One, it won\u2019t suddenly restart car sales, and two, tackling one crisis can\u2019t be done at the expense of another one.\u201d</p> <p>Julia Poliscanova, the clean vehicle director at Transport and Environment, said: \u201cThe priority now is to ensure the health, safety and job security of the workers affected by the current factory closures. While the overall economic recovery is crucial, we shouldn\u2019t let some opportunistic carmakers use the crisis to shamelessly roll back the EU climate targets for cars. Selling less cars won\u2019t impact compliance with the law. What matters is the type of car you sell.\u201d</p> <p>The big German carmakers Daimler, VW and BMW have already indicated they are aiming to comply with the new CO<sub>2</sub> targets regardless of the current situation.</p> <p>The ACEA director general, Eric-Mark Huitema, said the industry was not questioning any specific laws or the underlying objectives of tackling the climate emergency. He said: \u201cThe primary concern of ACEA and all its members right now is to manage the immediate crisis facing the auto industry, which has essentially come to an abrupt halt \u2013 something the sector has never experienced before.</p> <p>\u201cIn this emergency context, it has not yet been possible to undertake a detailed analysis of the implications of this crisis on legislation affecting our industry. [But] there will inevitably be consequences in this domain.\u201d</p> <p>The European commission said it would respond to the letter from the car manufacturers in due course.</p> <p>However, the commission made it clear that the European green deal, announced last December and the flagship policy of von der Leyen, would continue. The green deal will encompass all aspects of European industry, transport and environmental regulation, and require steep emissions reductions to meet the intended bloc-wide goal of net zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \u201cThe commission is determined to use all the policy tools at its disposal to help protect citizens and mitigate the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s severely negative socioeconomic consequences. We must also ensure that the recovery is as sustainable as possible \u2013 both economically and environmentally.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the UK-based Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: \u201cManufacturers are committed to meeting all necessary safety and environmental regulations, but we cannot forecast how this crisis will unfold or what new requirements may be needed.\u201d</p> <p>As governments prepare rescue packages for industry and stimulus packages amounting to trillions around the world, some experts are concerned that emergency stimulus money will prop up fossil fuel companies, and are calling for the spending to come with conditions attached to ensure companies must pursue a greener path.</p> <p>However, the coronavirus crisis has led to calls from some quarters to weaken environmental regulations and ignore CO<sub>2</sub> reduction targets.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Biggest daily rise in UK coronavirus deaths</h2> <p>The <strong>UK</strong> has again recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths. In the last 24 hours, 181 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19. 115 deaths were recorded the day before. The UK death toll stands at 759, with 14,579 confirmed cases.</p> <h2>Matt Hancock, the UK\u2019s health secretary, tests positive</h2> <p>Following the news that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had tested positive for Covid-19, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">confirmed that he too has coronavirus</a>. Both are experiencing mild symptoms and are in self-isolation.</p> <h2>Italy records highest daily rise in deaths and has not yet reached peak, experts say</h2> <p><strong>Italy</strong> also recorded its highest daily rise in Covid-19 deaths, with 919 new fatalities, taking the total to 9,134. The update follows a warning from the head of the country\u2019s national health institute that infections have not yet reached their peak and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/27/italys-delivery-drivers-on-lockdown-photo-essay\">lockdown measures</a> will have to be extended.</p> <h2>France extends lockdown by a fortnight</h2> <p>France has extended its lockdown until 15 April, the prime minister announced in a speech. Edouard Philippe said it was clear that the country was \u201cjust at the beginning of this epidemic wave\u201d.</p> <h2>Four dead on cruise ship after outbreak</h2> <p>Four people have died on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of <strong>Panama</strong> after a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the boat\u2019s owners have confirmed.</p> <h2>US approves $2.2tn economic stimulus package</h2> <p>Congress has given final approval for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">$2.2tn </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">financial package</a> designed to rush federal aid to workers, businesses and a healthcare system ravaged by the virus, after politicians united to overcome a last-minute attempt to delay its passage.</p> <h2>Death toll in the Netherlands and Switzerland rises</h2> <p>In the <strong>Netherlands</strong>, the death toll has risen to 546 after 112 new deaths. The number of confirmed cases of infection increased by 1,172 to 8,603 \u2013 a 16% rise. Meanwhile, in <strong>Switzerland</strong>, the death toll had reached 197, the health ministry said, up from 161 on Thursday.</p> <h2>UK doctors are crowdfunding for protective equipment</h2> <p>A group of doctors has <a href=\"https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/masks4nhsheroes\">set up a crowdfunder</a> to get vital protective equipment to medics who are dealing with coronavirus cases, amid concerns that NHS trusts are struggling to protect frontline workers because of a lack of supplies.</p>",

It could be that we have good transport links between London and Wolverhampton \u2026 it could be the impacts of deprivation \u2013 we have had historically high levels of smoking and industry across the Black Country and we know there is a gap in health in the region.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"76ecb2e1-d843-41f6-8e05-8151306c4429\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WM0gHwIjlUk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Earlier this week the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/sharp-rise-in-number-of-coronavirus-cases-in-west-midlands\">government said it was investigating</a> the reasons behind a hotspot emerging in the region. Anecdotal evidence suggested people\u2019s religious convictions and fears of social isolation could be leading to a sharp rise in the number of transmissions in the area.</p> \n<p>Carter agreed that slow uptake of the government\u2019s social distancing guidelines could have contributed to the anomaly. \u201cIt could be that high levels of community transmission which went undetected, and then the impacts of lack of social distancing a few weeks ago, could also have contributed.\u201d</p> \n<p>One doctor working at a hospital in the Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS trust said that, although it was unsurprising Birmingham had emerged as a hotspot, being the second biggest city in the country, a number of factors might have intensified the crisis.</p> \n<p>The doctor, who is self-isolating after contracting the virus, pointed out that a sizeable international student population, large numbers of residents commuting to London, and the fact the region was home to deprived areas where levels of spoken English were low may have contributed to the problem.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-pandemic-visualising-the-global-crisis\">The coronavirus pandemic: visualising the global crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The medic, who wanted to remain anonymous, added that the issue had been compounded by the fact that under government guidance doctors are not allowed to wear surgical masks when not working on wards with coronavirus patients. </p> \n<p>\u201cEven for a sick patient likely to have Covid-19, until the swab comes back, the government says to just wear a surgical mask, no FFP3 [respirator],\u201d the doctor added. \u201cWe think we should be wearing surgical masks for all patients, to protect us and them.

In the vast majority of cases, we are now seeing results coming through within 48 hours. We fully appreciate that there have been delays in testing, but we are hopeful that they will be resolved, if they have not been resolved already,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Robin May, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Birmingham, maintained that the numbers were as expected due to population numbers in urban parts of the country. \u201cThis is essentially what we were expecting \u2013 that there would be a significant rise in numbers across the UK. It is in tune with what we envisaged at the start of this curve, that it would go up in major urban centres like Birmingham and London,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>Until a couple of weeks ago, the idea of waiting in an Ocado queue of 73,735 shoppers, or of supermarkets rationing milk and baked beans, would have sounded like satire. For too many people in the UK, food scarcity is the norm, with mothers and fathers going hungry to ensure their children are fed. But others have grown used to an absurd abundance: strawberries and peaches in midwinter, or 20 types of mustard alongside three score of pasta. When such bounty overflows, it seems self-evident that supplies are both plentiful and reliable \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/millions-to-need-food-aid-in-days-as-virus-exposes-uk-supply\" title=\"\">until suddenly they aren\u2019t</a>.</p> <p>In fact, warns Tim Lang in his new book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/tim-lang-interview-professor-of-food-policy-city-university-supply-chain-crisis\" title=\"\">Feeding Britain</a>, our food system is \u201cstretched, open to disruption and far from resilient\u201d. It is easy to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-uk-panic-buyers-urged-to-think-of-frontline-workers\" title=\"\">castigate panic buyers</a> for empty shelves. But while shopping responsibly will help others to get the food they need, only a few people are squirrelling away vast stocks. Research firm Kantar says the average spend per supermarket trip has risen by 16% to \u00a322.13 month on month \u2013 not surprising when households realised they were likely to need lunches at home, including for children no longer in school, and could have to self-isolate for a fortnight.</p> <p>The underlying problem is that just-in-time supply chains can struggle to cope with even relatively small shifts, and that a handful of retailers dominate the market. The top eight account for <a href=\"https://www.kantarworldpanel.com/grocery-market-share/great-britain\" title=\"\">more than 90% of all grocery sales</a> in Britain, with Tesco alone accounting for 27%. The efficiencies that have kept food prices low, and the long and complex global chains that bring us such variety, come at a price.</p> <p>Border closures due to the virus as well as sickness could yet hit agriculture and delivery. Farmers say they face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/uk-farmers-fear-huge-labour-shortfall-despite-interest-in-land-army\" title=\"\">huge labour shortages</a>, though Britain, France and others are discussing new \u201cland armies\u201d to bring in crops normally harvested by migrant workers. Some countries are imposing limits on exports of staples to ensure they can feed their own populations. Only half the food we consume in Britain is produced here.</p> <p>The hardest hit will be those who suffer at the best of times. Food charities have warned that millions will need food aid in the coming days. The government says military planners are organising a food delivery system for the 1.5 million people most vulnerable to coronavirus, and is developing a scheme to support the 1.6 million children who rely on free school meals \u2013 probably in the form of supermarket vouchers.</p> <p>This reliance on big retailers is shortsighted. While officials consult with business bosses, local authorities such as Newham in London have the information, experience and resources to reach people in need, but say they cannot get the cash they require. Other efforts, both commercial and social, need support, like the independent shops (in many cases still well stocked) which are launching local delivery services, or the restaurants offering to help feed the isolated.</p> <p>Relying on market forces has created many of the problems we now face. The pandemic is exposing our food system\u2019s fragility: a crucial warning in a world where other shocks \u2013 notably from climate change \u2013 will be heading our way. In a time of crisis, we must adapt fast. But there are still choices. This could be an opportunity to diversify our supply chain, promote sustainable agriculture, benefit local businesses and find new ways of serving communities. If it instead entrenches the hold of the supermarket giants it will not only be a missed opportunity, but will also leave us in a more precarious position to face the next crisis.</p>",

But his current world record is not the one he had been seeking in his four expeditions to Antarctica, the first a training run in late 2012. Parks has been chasing a world record they say will never be broken.</p> <p>In 2011, his friend Christian Eide of Norway skied the 715 miles from Hercules Inlet on the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole in an astonishing 24 days, smashing the previous record of 39. The reason no one expects it to be broken is that the conditions were perfect throughout. Good weather is not something to rely upon in Antarctica, the driest, windiest and coldest continent.</p> <p>Parks, in that sunny Antarctic summer of 2011, was on the first two legs of his adventurer\u2019s grand slam and testifies the weather has deteriorated since, becoming snowier, wetter and warmer. Despite the conditions, in 2014, he became the second-fastest skier to the South Pole, in a time of 29 days.</p> <p>The magnitude of the challenge beggars belief. A month\u2019s worth of supplies and equipment must be hauled on a sled weighing roughly 70kg, as the challenger skis uphill from the coast to the Antarctic plateau, 3,000m above sea level, the height of an average Alp.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7df8632363beb22be0a65a5308c099c8680cc43b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7df8632363beb22be0a65a5308c099c8680cc43b/100_613_4499_2426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parks talking polar sled design and wind tunnel testing with Cardiff Met product design students ahead of his expedition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"539\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parks talking polar sled design and wind tunnel testing with Cardiff Met product design students ahead of his expedition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Richard Parks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Parks expended the calorific equivalent of two marathons a day in the most hostile environment on earth. Forced to abandon his second record attempt last year, because of even worse weather than usual, this year he skied for 16 hours a day, and slept for three, as he lowered his British record to 28 days in January. At halfway he was on course to break Eide\u2019s world record. Then, sure enough, the weather turned, the wind howling at him from the pole with a chill factor of -45 degrees. By the time he finished, he had lost 14.5kg.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m genuinely at peace with it,\u201d he says of the knowledge the speed record seems out of reach in the current climate. \u201cThere are some things I can\u2019t control.

  "<p>The mass clapping event (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/millions-of-britons-clap-for-carers-on-coronavirus-frontline\" title=\"\">Millions of Britons clap for carers on coronavirus frontline</a>, 26 March) was bittersweet and loaded with irony. It was an unprecedented show of collective gratitude, inspired by a Dutch woman living in the UK, by a nation whose Brexit vote caused a shortage of medical staff as it sent EU citizens away. A clapping nation whose government created a \u201chostile environment\u201d to banish the Windrush generation, who made vital contributions to the NHS.</p> <p>I also thought of supermarket workers on low wages now risking life and limb, generally with no gloves or masks. There is little consideration for their safety. If it weren\u2019t for them we would not be eating.</p> <p>The clap was a show of appreciation by a public that elected a government that has been rapidly privatising the very service we were applauding. But it also showed the nation\u2019s longstanding and deepening love for the NHS, and acknowledged our dependency on it. The clap strangely transcended the bitter rows of the last few years. It expressed a rare but precious sense of community.<br><strong>Corinne Fowler</strong><br><em>Birmingham</em></p>",

Here are some of the nearly 150 stories we received. Thanks to everyone who got in touch.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Laughton, 38, playwright and TV writer<br></strong>My play, One Jewish Boy, opened in the West End on 10 March \u2013 a huge step up for me. I had TV deals lined up, a movie deal on the cards, another play about to start in New York. The play managed to stay open for one week. It got us to press night, and much like its original fringe run, was a critical success \u2013 four and five stars, and that first week was packed out. It was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for. But I knew what was coming \u2013 a moment I hoped I would cherish for ever was tinged with crushing defeat. It felt as if everything we had worked for \u2013 all the abuse (my play is about antisemitism and I was on the receiving end of a lot of it), all the hard work, the blood, joy, sweat and tears \u2013 just faded away. The next day it got worse: I didn\u2019t quite take in the monumental loss of having every gig I had lined up, cancelled. In the short term, I\u2019m pretty screwed, the financial loss from the cancellation of two plays, a TV and a film gig has hit the tens of thousands. That makes it sound as if I always earn at this level \u2013 I don\u2019t and I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve been working hand to mouth and now, when it looked as if I might finally be able to breathe, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll get paid again. I just need to find a way to keep my head above water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a92854a377758e3fb59aa7da01ce1ad46c5e1843\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a92854a377758e3fb59aa7da01ce1ad46c5e1843/0_0_3525_4406/800.jpg\" alt=\"Near-empty scenes in front of Tate Modern this week.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The near-empty scene in front of Tate Modern in London this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Michael Heggett, 59, lighting engineer<br></strong>My entire work calendar for 2020 went away in the three days from 16 March. I lost the Pet Shop Boys world tour and the Olympic Games, which amounts to nine months of solid work and around \u00a360,000 gross turnover. I have no other work on my books until November, which is a UK tour with Tim Minchin \u2013 if it goes ahead. As venues are closed and also gatherings of people banned and film sets closed, I will not be able to earn a living for the foreseeable time. My business and livelihood are completely destroyed.</p> <p><strong>Matthew Reed, 40, comedian<br></strong>I had a full diary of gigs, a full summer of festivals and various clubs around the country, then overnight nothing, wiping out every penny for the foreseeable. My agents, Getcomedy, have been brilliant, but there\u2019s no work, so they, too, are in a terrible situation. I\u2019m a compere and in demand \u2013 I play every major club on the circuit and have done for years. So to go from every weekend full and plenty of midweek gigs to zero has been terrifying. The fragility of my situation has y crept up on me, and it\u2019s also shown how little people really care. At a comedy night, if you do well you\u2019re told: \u201cWell done\u201d, back slapped, thanked for a good night. \u201cCouldn\u2019t do what you do mate. It takes balls.\u201d Now my entire income has gone I\u2019ve been told, \u201cWell, you\u2019re just a comedian!\u201d and, \u201cGet a proper job.\u201d I\u2019ve had \u201cproper\u201d jobs \u2013 I\u2019ve worked very hard to be where I am and comedy is a job. I\u2019ve travelled miles for 20-minute sets, and the pay has been the same since I started \u2013 our wages haven\u2019t gone up with inflation. People assume we are on a fortune, which just isn\u2019t true. I absolutely love being a comedian, and this has been the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to me professionally. But apparently it\u2019s not as valid as an office worker losing their \u201cproper job\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Anonymous, actor for 37 years<br></strong>After a good five months in theatre and television and feeling as if I was turning a corner after a difficult period, I found the rug pulled from under my feet. Future work cancelled. Income owed not likely to be received. No hope of working in my career for many, many months to come. I am already writing this year off. My industry has been decimated and the aftermath will be catastrophic. I do not know how I will survive this with no savings behind me. I love my job, but I feel totally broken and my mental health is very, very fragile.</p> <p><strong>Denise Francis, 55, director of theatre education company Firehorse Productions<br></strong>I had three actors on contract for a five-week tour in June and July \u2013 this has now been cancelled, as schools are shut. There may be a slight chance we can scramble a three-week tour for November, but it is the two autumn tours that sustain us throughout the year, and not being able to produce them jeopardises the future of Firehorse. Two years ago, I also established the charity Afan Arts, giving the opportunity to pupils from surrounding schools to work alongside professional actors and film crews. Our third project Same But Different, two years in the planning, was due to begin at the end of July, but this has had to be cancelled. The year 11 pupils were devastated, another thing they have missed out on. We invest in our actors, love to see them grow and flourish \u2013 now we will not see that this year. It has been like watching your world crumble.</p> <p><strong>Anonymous, 37, actor<br></strong>On 16 March, a couple of hours before our cast were due on stage, we were told our show was cancelled that evening with immediate effect. Since then, it has become apparent that the production will not reopen anytime soon, and as yet we have no clarity on whether we will continue to be paid. My biggest fear is that our producer may be forced to use the <em>force majeure</em> clause in our contracts, allowing them to terminate our employment with immediate effect. Were that to happen, I would be left \u00a340,000 out of pocket, that figure representing what I would have earned during the remainder of the show\u2019s run.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67ffc8e04cbb79f66f185f74434767f9641e5361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67ffc8e04cbb79f66f185f74434767f9641e5361/0_0_4210_2908/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty Shaftesbury Avenue in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty Shaftesbury Avenue in the heart of West End theatreland, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Colette Meacher, writer, editor and lecturer<br></strong>I\u2019ve had mild symptoms of Covid-19, but as I effectively work on zero-hours contracts I\u2019m not eligible for statutory sick pay. And, as it\u2019s now the Easter break, my teaching hours are finished and my freelance editing and writing work has dried up, meaning that I don\u2019t have a single commission or job on my desk. I\u2019m stressed, sick and skint \u2013 but I\u2019d still be working if I could as I urgently and desperately need some money for the mortgage, bills and, heck, even just to be able to go out and buy some food. It\u2019s been nearly four weeks since I last got paid, and that was a grand total of \u00a3600 \u2013 pretty good by most months\u2019 standards.</p> <p><strong>Mike Nichamin, 56, live audio systems engineer<br></strong>All touring is off as venues have closed and large gatherings banned. I was on tour in Europe at the time with the show An Evening with Whitney Houston, a hologram tour. I have now applied to Tesco as a delivery driver for \u00a39 an hour, which won\u2019t even cover my expenses.</p> <p><strong>Bethany, 20, dancer<br></strong>I\u2019m supposed to be moving to Greece at the end of March for a seven-month contract, but obviously with no flights this has been postponed for the foreseeable. This is extremely distressing as for dancers a summer season can sometimes be their only income for the year. With so much uncertainty, I\u2019m not sure if I will ever get there to complete the season, and in the meantime I\u2019m stuck in the UK with no income.</p> <p><strong>Anonymous, 30, artist<br></strong>As a self-employed artist, my work is piecemeal and precarious. I don\u2019t have a fixed income and my earnings fluctuate month to month. I\u2019m still in receipt of the ghostly working tax credits, which has been a lifeline in more difficult times but at \u00a354 a week are not enough to live on. Occasionally I sell a work, pick up some teaching hours or am successful with a funding application. While the financial impact of Covid-19 is massive on those working in the arts, the impact of coronavirus goes beyond the loss of wages \u2013 it affects our visibility. Projects which have been in the pipeline for many months are put on hold, or no longer possible. Perhaps they lose their relevance as this global crisis escalates as it has. Galleries and cultural spaces rearrange their programmes, pushing an already competitive workforce into greater competition for places. This situation is complicated for us all, but without support, we risk a whole generation of artists slipping away.</p> <p><strong>David, 32, artist and gallery worker<br></strong>Many artists work freelance as either an assistant to a more established artist, or as a technician/handler for museums and galleries. I fall in this latter group. I love the work \u2013 we do anything from packing up prints to building gallery walls or making bespoke elements of the exhibition. With museums and galleries closed until further notice, the workforce who build and hang the exhibitions are simply not required. The work is always seasonal, and so we have large chunks of work booked months ahead, knowing that we have a two- to three-month gap in work while the exhibition is open to the public. I\u2019ve had a mixed response to coronavirus closures. One gallery has said that it will honour booked work and pay freelancers regardless of whether we are physically able to complete the job. This is absolutely wonderful and will help hugely. It is, however, an exception rather than the norm. Most galleries and museums have cancelled work \u2013 I\u2019ve lost work equivalent to two and a half months\u2019 pay, and from talking to friends, that seems quite light.</p> <p><strong>Jonny Byers, 39, cellist<br></strong>I had a full diary of work, and every single concert until at least July has been cancelled or, at best, postponed. An entire tour of a Handel opera; a week of Beethoven symphonies; concerts at smaller venues such as the Wigmore Hall. A completely empty diary, which means \u00a30 coming in. Many of the groups I perform for won\u2019t have a large amount of financial reserves so are now walking an even thinner tightrope attempting to ride out this storm. I have bills, instrument insurance, not to mention food buying, and many other outgoings to attempt to cover with no idea how it\u2019s all going to pan out. Sadly, everyone is in the same boat right now, but once orchestras are gone, they\u2019re gone, and we\u2019ll need music more than ever after this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4fd1c67bbb321033659d882b78096f3a39566b4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fd1c67bbb321033659d882b78096f3a39566b4b/0_0_5800_3859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French opera tenor Stephane Senechal performs from his window in a locked-down Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French opera tenor Stephane Senechal performs from his window in a locked-down Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Lopez/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Dan, 37, stage manager<br></strong>One show was cancelled mid-run and we were told not to come in the next day. The following job, which was supposed to take me to July, was postponed until 2021. All income has stopped and with no help from the government so far, we have had to contact our landlords and bill providers to plead for a payment break. We will get to a point where we have to choose between paying bills and eating. There is no safety net. I am also in the unfortunate situation that I have a very sick relative in hospital which, added to the worry about no income and possible eviction, is having a huge detrimental effect on my mental health.</p> <p><strong>Anonymous, 30, freelance stage manager<br></strong>So far, I have lost out on thousands. Last week, the tour that I was working on was cancelled after the government urged people not to go out. There were no compensation measures as all insurances were void when the WHO declared the virus a pandemic. The promoter took their fee back, tickets were refunded and the artist made a huge loss. All future bookings have been postponed too. A two-month project that I was meant to start on 1 April has been pushed back, but we don\u2019t know when that will be rescheduled. Festivals have been cancelled. My next working day is currently 1 July, but that could also be postponed. That\u2019s three and a half months of loss of earnings \u2013 and to add salt to my wounds, I\u2019m due to get married overseas in September.</p> <p><strong>Clare, 51, self-employed art tutor</strong><strong><br></strong>As a result of the current situation I closed the studio last week. Many of the artists who attend are over 70, and although the classes are small I can\u2019t guarantee safety. I have set up a WhatsApp group to keep us all in touch with each other \u2013 we share experiences, jokes and thoughts as well as art-related articles. Today, I launched an online art class to which nearly 40 of the group have signed up. So far, it seems to be working despite my lack of techie knowledge \u2013 think Acorn Antiques level of production. I hope this will provide some income to tide me over until I can reopen the studio, and will keep the social element of the group together.</p> <p><strong>Anonymous, 45, community artist<br></strong>I work full time in the community and all my work is on freelance contracts. In two days, every project I have got cancelled as they are all people-based. I have no income, no sick pay, and my work diary is a black hole. I am used to uncertainty and flexibility in my work, but now I feel totally baffled as to how I will get an income. I don\u2019t know when or if these projects will ever be rescheduled, and I worry about some of the people I work with who depend on the social aspect of these arts projects \u2013 one project I worked on involves making artworks for a recovery garden, for people with addictions, and I worry about how they are coping alone. We will be needed to help restore community spirit when this crisis is over \u2013 arts are never valued by the government, yet people are surviving these hard times through creativity and resourcefulness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e063a795e23054068c4f6e6b13995badd1a962c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e063a795e23054068c4f6e6b13995badd1a962c/0_0_3500_2504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outside the National Gallery this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"715\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deserted \u2026 Outside the National Gallery this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Peter, 44, freelance opera singer<br></strong>The theatres are shut. I\u2019m fortunate enough to have current extra chorus contracts honoured, but future ones are undecided. With schools, each one has its own safeguarding policy and setting up teaching from home is problematic \u2013 hours are down already. All of the concerts I\u2019ve had lined up are postponed or cancelled, auditionstoo. Regular chorister work in synagogue has stopped and the church that I regularly sing at are paying up to June. My private teaching has stopped \u2013 even though it\u2019s a few students, over time you really start to feel it. I\u2019m losing more than half of my income, with projected expectations that the industry will suffer longer and there will be less work in the future. I will need to adapt and find other sources.</p> <p><strong>Gillian Garrity, 48, theatre producer<br></strong>My business partner, Margaret-Anne O\u2019Donnell, and I started our own producing company, Raw Material Arts, two years ago. We have worked in the theatre industry for more than 20 years each, touring theatre within the UK and across the world. A UK/Australian co-production that was due to tour to 12 venues across Scotland beginning next month has been cancelled; a tour to an arts festival in Egypt has been cancelled; an artist residency due to take place in Nepal has been cancelled; we have three mid/large scale co-productions with three Scottish venues now on hold; a New York transfer of a current production on hold. Our potential to earn income has frozen. We work with and employ directors, lighting designers, sound designers, actors, stage managers, costume designers and many more freelance artists. We have received support from Creative Scotland to pay our team for projects that have taken place and/or are already funded, but we cannot deliver. We have no means to rehearse or present any work, meaning we have no potential to earn income.</p> <p><strong>Anonymous, 39, stage manager<br></strong>I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s still working, the entire industry has gone. The theatres all shut once Boris Johnson advised people not to go \u2013 there was no more work to do. I went to help clear the rehearsal room we had been using and that was that. I\u2019ve worked since I was 17, I\u2019ve never not had a job. I\u2019ve always paid my taxes and I\u2019ve used the benefits system once to cover a gap of five weeks between contracts back when I first moved to London in 2009. Now I don\u2019t know what to do. My partner is in the same position and has lost a year\u2019s work, as has my sister, as have most of my friends. We have a little bit of a buffer, probably enough to survive the next month or two, but beyond that things are pretty scary. I\u2019m happy to do whatever I need \u2013 I\u2019ve handed out CVs in supermarkets, filled out forms online, but so far no replies. I just think people see theatre on a CV and don\u2019t know what to do with it, or assume you\u2019ll be some kind of luvvie who moans about breaking a nail. The reality is we\u2019re used to 16-hour days, 50-plus hour weeks, hard physical work, problem solving and team working, not to mention working under pressure to a deadline. After all, the show must go on.</p>",
  "<p>Pity the people of America. They do battle now with one of the greatest challenges in their history, led by a man who is not only among the worst ever occupants of the White House but whose character makes him the last person on the face of the Earth you would nominate to be in charge at this moment. On Thursday the US reached the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-outbreak-us-latest-trump\">top of the global league table for coronavirus infections</a>, edging ahead of its closest rival for that honour, China. No law of nature dictated that outcome. Much of it is directly attributable to one dreadful fact: that Donald Trump is president of the United States.</p> <p>It\u2019s become a commonplace to note Trump\u2019s lack of basic human empathy, his tendency to be <a href=\"https://washingtonpress.com/2020/03/06/trump-fails-to-offer-any-sympathy-after-being-told-that-a-young-boys-whole-family-had-been-killed\">unmoved by others\u2019 loss</a>. But that gap in his mindset matters now far beyond an inability to offer consolation to the bereaved: it is warping his approach to a lethal disease.</p> <p>\u201cWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241935285916782593\">he tweeted</a> in caps lock at the start of the week, shortly after Steve Hilton, one-time adviser to David Cameron, had made that same argument on his Fox News show. (If you look up the word \u201cchutzpah\u201d in the dictionary, it now directs you to a clip of Hilton <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aljwhite/status/1241991593806217216\">warning on that same broadcast</a> that austerity policies in the UK caused an extra 130,000 deaths \u2013 failing to mention that he was at the right hand of the prime minister who imposed that austerity.) </p> <p>Trump and his outriders contend that, while mass death is not ideal, it\u2019s better than allowing the US economy to stall. Some, like Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick, are explicit, urging the elderly to risk their lives so that their grandchildren might enjoy the fruits of uninterrupted American capitalism. \u201cIf that\u2019s the exchange, I\u2019m all in,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/coronavirus-texas-patrick-abbott.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes\">Patrick said</a>. He was taking his cue from Trump who, while not putting it quite as baldly, has been quite clear. If coronavirus is a stick-up artist asking America, \u201cYour money or your life\u201d, Trump\u2019s response has been: \u201cTake the lives of the old and the weak: I want the money.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An imbecile at the head of the US government would always be a problem. But this is a calamity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, no such choice is available. Even if Trump were to get his way, ditching social distancing and having the US open for business by Easter, the disease would not politely confine its appetite to the groups Trump has deemed dispensable. Instead the virus would run rampant, infecting an estimated half the population. Not that Trump would know or recognise that, thanks to a second character trait that, like the void where his sense of compassion should be, is so fatefully, and fatally, determining the US response to this pandemic: namely, his disregard for science.</p> <p>\u201cThis is just my hunch,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/5/21166031/trump-hannity-coronavirus-who-death-rate\">he said</a> as he dismissed a projection of the likely Covid-19 death rate by the World Health Organization as \u201ca false number\u201d. On Thursday, he said \u201c<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/trump-coronavirus-ventilators-new-york-state_n_5e7d651cc5b6256a7a27c911?ri18n=true&amp;ncid=engmodushpmg00000004\">I have a feeling</a>\u201d that New York would need far fewer ventilators than the tens of thousands the state has requested. \u201cYou know, you go into major hospitals sometimes, they\u2019ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they\u2019re saying can we order 30,000 ventilators?\u201d An imbecile at the head of the US government would always be a problem. But an imbecile so narcissistic that he elevates his own stunted knowledge above the judgment of medicine and science is a calamity.</p> <p>The effect is to undermine whatever public health effort the professionals can mount, as they try to work around the man they serve. At its most visual, it\u2019s the daily press briefing where Trump fails to observe the social distancing measures his administration is demanding of the American public, with himself standing at the centre of a cluster of speakers bunched together by the podium. Note the initial insistence that corona was nothing to worry about, that it was no more than flu, that it would soon disappear, like a \u201cmiracle\u201d. All of that succeeded in lowering Americans\u2019 guard.</p> <p>Since then, it\u2019s been the daily grouching at the stay-at-home directives, the hint that they\u2019ll be relaxed soon, the absurd promises that a vaccine is \u201cvery close\u201d. The impact is plain to see, in data that confirms that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/21/upshot/coronavirus-public-opinion.html\">Americans break down on partisan lines</a> even over the most basic matters of mortality. One in four Republicans still say they are \u201cnot concerned at all\u201d about the virus \u2013 while only 5% of Democrats are similarly unbothered. Only 14% of Democrats trust Trump for information on the virus, <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/03/24/who-americans-trust-covid\">compared with 90% of Republicans</a>. Put simply, there is a body of Americans who do not take this threat as seriously as they should, and the blame for that lies with the president.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s dishonesty matters here too. He was rightly derided in 2016 as a \u201csnake-oil salesman\u201d, and the cliche is so well-worn it\u2019s easy to forget what it originally refers to: the 19<sup>th-</sup>century hawkers who sold bogus cures to the gullible. Recall that Trump rushed to tell people a pre-existing drug would cure Covid-19, leading to <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/africa/chloroquine-trump-nigeria-intl/index.html\">a shortage of </a><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/africa/chloroquine-trump-nigeria-intl/index.html\">a medication</a> that was needed for other illnesses, and several deaths, as desperate people rushed to buy tablets that, for them, proved lethal. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-us-live-news-trump-stimulus-vote-house-thomas-massie-latest-updates\">Coronavirus US live: Trump invokes Defense Production Act in urging GM to make ventilators</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The US president always was capricious and vengeful, but now that character flaw is a matter of life and death. State governors are crying out for federal help, not for themselves but for the people they represent: the nurses and doctors who need protective equipment and testing kits, the patients who need ventilators. But instead of leaping to their aid, Trump tells the governors it\u2019s their responsibility, even though they have a fraction of the procurement power of the US government \u2013 adding that if they want help, they\u2019d better grovel. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-way street,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/us-governors-coronavirus-trump\">Trump said this week</a>. \u201cThey have to treat us well.\u201d Even when lives are on the line, his ego with its paper-thin skin comes first.</p> <p>Americans are paying the price for his lack of foresight, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html\">his closure of a pandemic task force</a> for no better reason than it was established by Barack Obama \u2013 he hates anything with his predecessor\u2019s name on it \u2013 and his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html\">failure to heed the warnings</a> of a pandemic preparedness exercise, codenamed Crimson Contagion, that identified glaring gaps as recently as last October. Yet still he repeats the line that nobody could have known what was coming. And they are paying the price for his weakness, as he demands steadfastness in a war against an \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d, only to leave heavy hints that he\u2019s ready to<strong> </strong>fold after a week, apparently<strong> </strong>deciding that 15 days is too long to stay at home.</p> <p>America is lucky it has a federal system that means not all power lies with the president, that at least some rests in the hands of responsible mayors and governors, the likes of New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo. The nation is lucky too that the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats, who crafted a $2.2tn economic bill from what would otherwise have been a trough into which Trump\u2019s corporate pals could sink their snouts.</p> <p>But these are small consolations for America and indeed for the world, which needed the leadership only a US president has the clout to provide. Instead, the world\u2019s peoples now look at the US and comfort themselves with the small solace that they, at least, face only a lethal disease, and not the malignancy that is Donald Trump.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</em></p>",
  "<p>Libyan armed factions have defied a UN call for a <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-03-23/secretary-generals-appeal-for-global-ceasefire\">\u201cglobal ceasefire\u201d</a> by escalating fighting across the country, with forces loyal to eastern warlord Gen Khalifa Haftar claiming to have gained control of a string of towns in the north-west.</p> <p>A spokesman for Haftar said his forces, the Libyan National Army (LNA), had also repulsed an offensive by the UN-backed government of national accord designed to capture its key airbase \u2013 the failure of which will increase the fragility of the Tripoli government and its dependence on its Turkish backers.</p> <p>The two sides in a conflict that has raged since 2014 briefly agreed last weekend to a humanitarian truce, but within 24 hours fighting resumed at an even more intense pace. Both sides seem to believe that with international actors distracted by the coronavirus pandemic now is the right moment to try to take decisive steps in the civil war.</p> <p>Tripoli, the capital, has seen some of the worst bombardments since Haftar launched a renewed offensive in April last year, prompting the government there to launch a rare counter-offensive operation to try to seize Haftar\u2019s al-Wutiya airbase. The bombardment of Tripoli continued on Thursday night.</p> <p>Turkey has started to use drones deeper into LNA-controlled territory in an effort to disrupt the Haftar offensive.</p> <p>The LNA\u2019s spokesperson, Maj Gen Ahmad Al-Mismari, claimed it had captured several areas in north-western Libya, including the towns of Jumail, Regdalein, and Zultun, so surrounding Zuwara 62 miles (100km) west of Tripoli from three sides. He also claimed more than 100 Syrian fighters brought to Libya by Turkey had been killed in the last 72 hours.</p> <p>The upsurge in fighting, probably the worst since the current phase of the civil war began, came as the first coronavirus case was revealed in the country and led to yet another UN security council call for both sides to end the fighting. But the UN\u2019s credibility in Libya is at rock bottom with weapons embargoes openly breached and the UN special envoy, Ghassan Salam\u00e9, quitting in disgust at competition in the country by the big powers.</p> <p>In a statement after closed video discussions and a briefing on Thursday by the acting UN special representative, Stephanie Williams, the UN said it was concerned at \u201cthe significant escalation of hostilities on the ground in Libya\u201d.</p> <p>Jonathan Allen, the UK senior diplomat at the UN, warned it was \u201cnext to impossible for the brave doctors and medical professionals in Libya to do what they need to do to save people\u201d. He added that the generals and politicians were only deluding themselves by claiming there was a military solution to Libya\u2019s political disputes.</p> <p>The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, also signalled a tougher US approach to the conflict, saying suspending military operations in Libya, especially in Tripoli, is a key goal of US diplomacy.</p> <p>He told Arab Weekly: \u201cThose who say that they are concerned about the rise of Muslim extremism or the rise of militias in Tripoli and use this as a justification for the offensive on Tripoli miss the point that the offensive is having precisely the opposite effect. It is empowering militias. It is making the government more dependent on militias. It is giving extremist voices a greater say in what happens.\u201d</p> <p>He also hinted that Washington was piling pressure on external actors \u201cwhose role has sometimes helped to fuel the conflict\u201d. He added: \u201cFor them, a tougher approach is on the cards. It is time to name names.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile the EU reached an agreement on Thursday to launch a naval mission in the Mediterranean Sea to enforce a UN-mandated arms embargo on Libya. Opposition to the mission, mainly from Austria, was overcome.</p> <p>The goal of the mission \u2013 named Operation Irini, the Greek word for peace \u2013 potentially puts the EU at risk of confrontation with Turkey, which is sending its weaponry by boat, while the United Arab Emirates, backers of the LNA, sends its support by air and so is unlikely to come across any EU interdiction.</p> <p>The previous naval mission, Operation Sophia, was discontinued as countries such as Austria and Italy argued that it acted as a \u201cpull factor\u201d for refugees, encouraging migrants attempting to reach Europe via Libya to set out to sea in the hope of being rescued.</p> <p>Greece offered its ports as disembarkation points for migrants saved at sea by the mission\u2019s warships, a Greek government official said. The previous refusal of any country to make this gesture led to the Austrian and Italian objections to the new operation.</p> <p>Libya\u2019s preparation for a coronavirus outbreak comes as the country\u2019s financially debilitating oil stoppage has also continued from January, costing the nation nearly $4bn (\u00a33.2bn) so far, the Libyan National Oil Corporation has said.</p> <p>The recent collapse in the worldwide oil price will make it more difficult for the country to stem its deficits once oil production starts.</p>",

  "<p>Who can fail to have been moved by all the images of people on their doorsteps clapping for the NHS last night? They filled TV screens and news websites, presenting a warming picture of solidarity in enforced solitude \u2013 all alone yet all together. But there are some far less reassuring images circulating on social media. Some people are saying we now all exist inside an Edward Hopper painting. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter which one.</p> <p>I assume this is because we are coldly distanced from each other, sitting at our lonely windows overlooking an eerily empty city, like the woman perched on her bed in Morning Sun, or the other looking out of a bay window in Cape Cod Morning.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all Edward Hopper paintings now,\u201d according to a WhatsApp compilation of Hopper scenes: a woman alone in a deserted cinema, a man bereft in his modern apartment, a lonely shop worker and people sitting far apart at tables for one in a diner. As is the way with memes, it\u2019s hard to tell if this is a serious comment or a glib joke with a side order of self-pity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c40ad91f760f067c5233feaa0dd86949c184b40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c40ad91f760f067c5233feaa0dd86949c184b40/0_0_5600_3056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Hopper, Nighthawks, painting, 1942\" width=\"1000\" height=\"546\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coldly distanced \u2026 Edward Hopper\u2019s Nighthawks, 1942.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But let\u2019s take it seriously. If we really are all Edward Hopper paintings now, a crisis of loneliness is impending that may be one of the most fraught social consequences of Covid-19. The loss of direct human contact we\u2019re agreeing to may be catastrophic. This, at least, is what Hopper shows us. This painter born in New York state in 1882 made solitude his life\u2019s work. In the 1920s, while F Scott Fitzgerald was chronicling the party animals of the jazz age, he painted people who looked as if they had never been invited to a party in their lives.</p> <p>Modern life is unfriendly in the extreme for Hopper. It doesn\u2019t take a pandemic to isolate his poor souls. Cold plate-glass windows, towering urban buildings where everyone lives in self-contained apartments, gas stations in the middle of nowhere \u2013 the fabric of modern cities and landscapes is for him a machine that churns out solitude. Nor do his people find much to do with themselves.</p> <p>In older art, being alone has its benefits. In paintings titled Saint Jerome in His Study, a scholarly hermit looks perfectly at ease in his well-designed home office with his books, his cool desk \u2013 and his pet lion. In another way, the Romantic out for a walk in Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s painting The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog actively seeks splendid isolation so he can absorb sublime nature without human disturbance. He\u2019s happy by himself \u2013 terrifyingly so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f1326e544e3755d9306e6f320bdfaf4f6bc7b284\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1326e544e3755d9306e6f320bdfaf4f6bc7b284/0_0_3130_2211/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Hopper - Morning Sun, painting, 1952\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atomised individuals \u2026 Edward Hopper\u2019s Morning Sun, 1952.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s not such images of contented or chosen solitude that are being shared today. It\u2019s Hopper\u2019s horrors \u2013 and that isn\u2019t too strong a word. One of the painter\u2019s biggest fans was Alfred Hitchcock, who famously based the Bates mansion in Psycho on a Hopper painting of a strange old house isolated by a railroad.</p> <p>We all hope to defy Hopper\u2019s terrifying vision of alienated, atomised individuals and instead survive as a community. But, ironically, we have to do that by staying apart and it may be cruelly dishonest \u2013 the empty propaganda of the virus war \u2013 to pretend everyone is perfectly OK at home.</p> <p>For the message of Hopper is that modern life can be very lonely. His people are as isolated among others in a diner or restaurant as they are at their apartment windows. In this he is typical of modernist art. Edvard Munch had already shown in his nightmarish Evening on Karl Johan Street that a crowd can be a very isolating place to be.</p> <p>Today, we\u2019re simply better at hiding the isolation that these artists thought defined the modern condition. In normal times, we sit alone in cafes, too, except we\u2019ve now got mobile phones to make us feel social. The fact is that modernity throws masses of people into urban lifestyles that are totally cut off from the gregariousness that was once the norm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cf63cc133bc7952c76bcfda10a8fe71d45627f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cf63cc133bc7952c76bcfda10a8fe71d45627f9/0_0_5500_3727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edvard Munch, Evening on Karl Johan Street, painting, 1892\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lonely in a crowd \u2026 Edvard Munch\u2019s Evening on Karl Johan Street, 1892.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In pre-industrial times, Bruegel\u2019s scenes of peasant life show a world in which it was practically impossible to be alone.

But now the art of Hopper poses a tough question: when the freedoms of modern life are removed, what\u2019s left but loneliness?</p>",
  "<p>On the eastern edge of Kolkata, near the smoking mountain of the city\u2019s garbage dump, the 15 million-strong metropolis dissolves into a watery landscape of channels and lagoons, ribboned by highways. This patchwork of ponds might seem like an unlikely place to find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/25/kolkata-west-bengal-india-cites-fish-farming-sewage-food-demand-real-estate\">inspiration for the future of sustainable cities</a>, but that\u2019s exactly what Julia Watson sees in the marshy muddle.<br><br>The network of pools, she explains, are <em>bheris</em>, shallow, flat-bottomed fish ponds that are fed by 700m litres of raw sewage every day \u2013 half the city\u2019s output. The ponds produce 13,000 tonnes of fish each year. But the system, which has been operating for a century, doesn\u2019t just produce a huge amount of fish \u2013 it treats the city\u2019s wastewater, fertilises nearby rice fields, and employs 80,000 fishermen within a cooperative.</p> <p>Watson, a landscape architect, says it saves around $22m (\u00a318m) a year on the cost of a conventional wastewater treatment plant, while cutting down on transport, as the fish are sold in local markets. \u201cIt is the perfect symbiotic solution,\u201d she says. \u201cIt operates entirely without chemicals, seeing fish, algae and bacteria working together to form a sustainable, ecologically balanced engine for the city.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9cd407a0257bd198c7342d601bcab6fa398d660\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9cd407a0257bd198c7342d601bcab6fa398d660/0_0_4134_2756/1000.png\" alt=\"\u2018A lot of the answers are already there\u2019 ... a small hut in the East Kolkata Wetlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A lot of the answers are already there\u2019 ... a small hut in the East Kolkata Wetlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brett Cole</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The wastewater <em>bheris</em> of the east Kolkata wetlands are one of the many examples of light-footed ecological practice that Watson has brought together in a new book, <a href=\"https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/04698/facts.julia_watson_lotek_design_by_radical_indigenism.htm\">Lo-TEK: Design by Radical Indigenism</a>.

We just have to look.\u201d<br><br>Many of the phenomena were never intended to be solutions to ecological breakdown, but simple responses to local circumstance, practised for generations. Some are bound up in millennia-old mythologies and religious practice, while others, such as Kolkata\u2019s thriving aquaculture system, were the result of happy accident. According to local legend, in the 1920s a cultivator named Bidu Sarkar realised untreated wastewater from sewage pipes had started to flow into his fish pond. He expected disaster, but instead of killing his fish, the effluent doubled his yields.</p> <p>Others took note and followed his lead, realising the combination of sewage in the water and sunshine broke down the effluent and allowed plankton, which fish feed on, to grow exponentially. The fishponds now cover around 3,000 hectares, holding 300 fish farms, and the technique has caught on elsewhere in the world \u2013 in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Thailand, Germany and France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9fb7c5ebf4498a8fea61604d1d103362100e4d2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fb7c5ebf4498a8fea61604d1d103362100e4d2f/0_0_2756_4134/667.jpg\" alt=\"Going underground \u2026 a line of evenly spaced spoil craters snakes along the desert towards the Plains of Iraq, evidence of a subterranean man-made water stream called a qanat, first constructed by the Persians.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Going underground \u2026 a line of evenly spaced spoil craters snakes along the desert towards the Plains of Iraq, evidence of a subterranean man-made water stream called a qanat, first constructed by the Persians.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alireza Teimoury</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs landscape architects,\u201d says Watson, \u201cwe are asked to design artificial wetlands in cities all the time.

In a practice dating back to 100BC, the sinuous roots of rubber fig trees are trained over a scaffolding made from betel nut tree trunks, their centres hollowed out to provide a protective casing for the roots. Dangling aerial roots are woven into truss-like supports, then flat stones are laid across to form a solid deck.</p> <p>Over the course of their growth, the roots respond to the natural forces of the turbulent monsoon rivers, growing thicker and rooting deeper, making them extraordinarily efficient at load bearing. It is a form of slow infrastructure, with bridges planned a decade in advance, as rubber fig trees are planted at critical crossing points along rivers. This strategic planting is then used by future generations.<br><br>The tradition has survived, in part, because it is inextricably linked with the origin story of the Khasi, who believe their ancestors descended from a living root ladder that connected heaven and Earth, made of a rubber fig tree. The tree is considered sacred and, with it, the practice of bridge-building and ladder-weaving has been perpetuated in a fusion of mythology and technology that preserves culture, ecology and a way of life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"202a753198f2c01f3646171b7a353f5a77cc8142\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/202a753198f2c01f3646171b7a353f5a77cc8142/0_0_1938_2546/761.png\" alt=\"Water temple method ... subak rice terraces on steep volcanic hills in Bali.\" width=\"761\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water temple method ... subak rice terraces on steep volcanic hills in Bali.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Lansing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watson describes how a similar spiritual reverence for the natural landscape has helped to conserve <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1194/\">the subak rice terraces in Bali</a>. In the steeply sloping volcanic hills, planting cycles are coordinated by a network of water temples, whose priests determine irrigation schedules according to calendrical rites. Before a fallow period, upstream temples release water into channels that feed a network of tiered terraces below. When all the fields are emptied simultaneously, pests migrating in search of food are eradicated.</p> <p>The effectiveness of this traditional system became all too apparent when the Indonesian government implemented a <a href=\"https://rethink.earth/resilience-lessons-from-a-water-goddess/\">Green Revolution</a> in the 1970s, bringing the use of massive quantities of fertiliser and pesticide to the rice terraces and ignoring the role of the water temples. Within a few seasons, yields plummeted, soil structure degraded, biodiversity diminished and the pests returned. The policy was abandoned in 1988, allowing the farmer-priests to return to their customary methods, and the area received Unesco World Heritage status in 2012. (This has come with its own set of problems, triggering an influx of tourists and stimulating development nearby.)</p> <p>The indigenous wisdom goes on.

  "<p>A stampede for an unproven \u201ccure\u201d for Covid-19 is clearing the pharmacy shelves of a medicine that is vital for up to 5 million people around the world suffering from lupus, as countries bow to populist pressure and abandon the trials that would show whether hydroxychloroquine works against coronavirus infection.</p> \n<p>Both Italy and France have said doctors can now prescribe hydroxychloroquine \u2013 a less toxic version of the malaria drug chloroquine \u2013 even though there is no robust evidence to prove that it is effective against Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Popular pressure for access to the drug has been ramped up by pronouncements from presidents Donald Trump in the US and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, both of whom have claimed it is a cure. An Australian businessman, the former politician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/experts-condemn-clive-palmer-funded-ads-claiming-hydroxychloroquine-can-cure-coronavirus\">Clive Palmer, has pledged to fund 1</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/experts-condemn-clive-palmer-funded-ads-claiming-hydroxychloroquine-can-cure-coronavirus\">m</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/experts-condemn-clive-palmer-funded-ads-claiming-hydroxychloroquine-can-cure-coronavirus\"> doses</a> \u201cto ensure all Australians would have access to the drug as soon as possible\u201d.</p> \n<p>But the drug is already running out for people with lupus, a disorder of the immune system, who rely on it to stay well. Shortages are being reported from the UK to Thailand to France. India, which manufactures the raw ingredient, has banned all exports of the chemical to safeguard its own supplies and recommended all health workers to take the drug to protect themselves from the virus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe are incredibly concerned at the moment,\u201d said Paul Howard of Lupus UK. \u201cWe started receiving inquiries from patients across the UK about a week ago. That\u2019s been rapidly increasing \u2013 more and more people each day.\u201d</p> \n<p>For 90% of the more than 60,000 people in the UK with lupus, hydroxychloroquine is the mainstay of their treatment, preventing their immune system making too many antibodies, which can otherwise attack the body\u2019s organs \u2013 mainly the kidneys and the skin, but also the heart, lungs and brain.</p> \n<p>\u201cTheir local pharmacies don\u2019t have any stocks available on the shelves,\u201d said Howard. \u201cThey have no date for when they can expect stocks to arrive.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is no good alternative, he said. Other immunosuppressants have toxic side-effects and may put people at greater risk of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>A nationalistic scramble is now on around the world to secure supplies of hydroxychloroquine in spite of the absence of rigorous evidence in the treatment of the coronavirus. One small trial in China produced good results, but was far from sufficient to show that it works.</p> \n<p>In France, the government caved to pressure from a doctor who ran his own <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996\">very small and rapid trial</a> of the drug combined with an antibiotic in 26 people, using methodology that has been seriously criticised. Dr Didier Raoult, a professor of infectious diseases who works at La Timone hospital in Marseille, then declared in a video on YouTube that chloroquine was a cure for Covid-19 and should be used immediately.</p> \n<p>Raoult walked out of the scientific advisory committee advising the government. A social media frenzy began, with allegations that the government was being influenced by the big pharmaceutical companies which wanted to block hydroxychloroquine because it was cheap, being out of patent. People queued outside Raoult\u2019s hospital to be tested and get the drug, defying the lockdown. Finally, the French government gave way and decreed that hospitals could prescribe it for any Covid-19 patient. They can also give the anti-HIV medicine which is supposed to be in global trials for Covid-19, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/china-trials-anti-hiv-drug-coronavirus-patients\">Kaletra</a>, which is a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir.</p> \n<p>Italy has followed suit. The government announced on Friday that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could be used to treat all Covid-19 patients and paid for entirely by the Italian national healthcare system. It would also pay for Kaletra.</p> \n<p>The impact on the global trials to find out what really works is serious. Nick White, a professor of tropical medicine at Mahidol University in Thailand and at the University of Oxford, says the problem is enormous \u2013 not so much for malaria, where the drug is now less used, but for lupus patients and for hopes of finding out what works and sharing it globally.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom Fauci [US government infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci] to the head of the World Health Organization, everyone says trials. It may be worse than nothing. We don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe nationalistic shuttering down of export and import of drugs is serious. Drugs are manufactured in relatively small numbers of places and have to be moved to other places.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe indirect harm could be worse than the impact of Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cit is not just the drugs that might work. It is all drugs. Italy, for instance, is a major source of drugs for the NHS. This is a very big area. It is getting bigger by the minute. And the opportunity to answer the sensible question \u2013 do these things work, yes or no? \u2013 is narrowing as countries become more nationalistic in terms of hoarding drugs.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Since the coronavirus outbreak reached the UK, I\u2019ve only seen my boyfriend for five minutes, when he dropped off some baba ganoush and paracetamol at my flat. I was scared I might infect him, so we had an emotionally charged conversation at two metres\u2019 distance, which felt like a combination of a chaste Regency courtship drama and a young adult dystopian romance. It\u2019s a strange situation: six months into our relationship, we\u2019re having to weather the obstacle of a global pandemic, and the potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/26/your-place-or-mine-coronavirus-forces-couples-to-choose\">role our romance could play</a> in spreading it. I can say with certainty that neither of us planned for this.</p> <p>But we feel like there isn\u2019t much choice other than to get on with it. Earlier this week, Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/budding-couples-in-uk-told-to-live-together-or-stay-apart\">made an announcement</a> that sent a chill down the spine of the nation\u2019s commitment-phobes. Speaking to the BBC, she suggested that couples currently living in separate households should either remain apart or \u201ctest the strength of their relationship\u201d by moving in together. British couples are now faced with a stark choice between spending far too much or far too little time with one other. It\u2019s hard to think of a less promising context in which to progress a relationship.</p> <p>Even if you are really keen on the idea of experiencing the slow death of love while confined to a zone-3 houseshare, the fact is that for most young renters moving in together isn\u2019t as straightforward as that. Most young people live with flatmates, who could reasonably object to a new person shedding hairs down the drain \u2013 and that\u2019s before you even take into consideration the, you know, virus going around.</p> <p>Renters can\u2019t just dip in and out of their contract, either. Even during a pandemic, your landlord is unlikely to accept \u201cI just really think it\u2019s time me and my boyfriend get serious \u2013 it\u2019s been six months!\u201d as a valid breakout clause. This means that, for many couples, moving in together simply isn\u2019t an option, no matter how willing they are to test the strength of the relationship. And that\u2019s without even considering the numbers of couples where one half is in a high-risk group and already isolating.</p> <p>Some of us might just have to accept that we\u2019re not going to see our significant other for some time. I am of the exact demographic that Harries is addressing, having not seen my boyfriend for several weeks. I\u2019ve been self-isolating with a fever that comes and goes, along with a shortness of breath that could possibly be imaginary (these days being a hypochondriac is a moral responsibility). It\u2019s one of those situations where I probably don\u2019t have Covid-19 but it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/act-like-you-have-coronavirus_l_5e721aafc5b6eab7793fc120\">better to act as if I do</a>, particularly because I\u2019ve internalised the idea that practising anything less than perfect physical-distancing ethics is \u201cTory\u201d. I\u2019d rather live as a hermit than face such a charge. Now I\u2019m recovered, we have been plunged into a sudden \u201clong distance\u201d relationship, with all the yearning and frustration that entails, despite living within walking distance of one another.</p> <p>Ultimately, it feels churlish to complain given how much worse our situation could be. But being separated from my partner is still difficult. I miss him in a way that texting or Skyping doesn\u2019t satisfy. There have been moments when I\u2019ve struggled to get my breath or woken up drenched in sweat and wished I wasn\u2019t alone. The situation I\u2019m in feels potentially endless, given the impossibility of getting tested \u2013 something that has become an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-prince-charles-covid-19-test-old-divisions\">elite status symbol</a> reserved for public figures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/cry-coronavirus-lockdown-emotions\">I cry, I panic, I bounce back: this coronavirus lockdown is triggering all my emotions | Emma Brockes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What makes it so difficult is that at times like this, a relationship comes in handy. In the absence of any kind of structure or routine, some of us need another person around to shame us, just with their presence, into being a functioning human being. Otherwise, it\u2019s all too easy to slip into a parody of adolescence: eating too much cereal or staying up till 2am in lieu of any reason to wake up the next morning. While I receive a lot of epistolary support from being in a relationship, I need a warden as much as a penpal.</p> <p>If you do find yourself separated from your partner, maybe the best thing to do is acclimatise, treat it like a long-distance relationship, and embrace the various digital channels through which you can approximate intimacy. Video chat is of course the closest thing you get to a face-to-face conversation. It\u2019s important to speak every day, even if you\u2019ll eventually stop asking, \u201cWhat have you been up to?\u201d; all you\u2019ll ever have done is feel anxious while hunched over a laptop at an angle guaranteed to give you lifelong back problems. At least there\u2019s the ongoing collapse of the global economic order, which should keep conversation ticking over for a while.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve run out of things to say to each other, you can load up <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/26/set-netflix-party-streaming-12460503/\">Netflix Party</a>, recreating the magical experience of sitting in silence and watching a terrible made-for-streaming romcom with an original soundtrack by Selena Gomez.

  "<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has suspended its enforcement of some environmental laws during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>In an extraordinary move that has stunned former EPA officials, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-03/documents/oecamemooncovid19implications.pdf\">the Trump administration said</a> it will not expect compliance with the routine monitoring and reporting of pollution and won\u2019t pursue penalties for breaking these rules.</p> <p>Polluters will be able to ignore some environmental laws as long as they can claim in some way these violations were caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the event of an imminent threat to public health, the EPA will defer to the states and \u201cconsider the circumstances\u201d over whether it should intervene.</p> <p>There is no end date set for this dropping of enforcement.</p> <p>Andrew Wheeler, administrator of the EPA, said that coronavirus had made it difficult for businesses to protect workers and the public while adhering to clean air and water rules.</p> <p>\u201cThis temporary policy is designed to provide enforcement discretion under the current, extraordinary conditions, while ensuring facility operations continue to protect human health and the environment,\u201d Wheeler said.</p> <p>The new stance has caused uproar among former EPA officials and environmental groups who warn that the sweeping will pose a further risk to public health amid the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cEPA should never relinquish its right and its obligation to act immediately and decisively when there is threat to public health, no matter what the reason is,\u201d said Cynthia Giles, who was head of EPA enforcement during the Obama administration.</p> <p>\u201cI am not aware of any instance when EPA ever relinquished this fundamental authority as it does in this memo. This memo amounts to a nationwide moratorium on enforcing the nation\u2019s environmental laws and is an abdication of EPA\u2019s responsibility to protect the public.\u201d</p> <p>A letter sent to the EPA by Giles and a number of other environmental advocates states that while it may be \u201creasonable in limited circumstances\u201d to relax certain enforcement during the crisis, the blanket waiver of environmental requirements poses a danger to the American public.</p> <p>There is particular concern over air pollution emitted by industrial facilities, which are predominantly located in communities with large numbers of low-income people and people of color. Covid-19 attacks the respiratory system, with its spread causing states to scramble for more ventilators to prevent thousands of infected people from dying.</p> <p>The air pollution that industrial plants will not have to monitor damages the respiratory system, which is especially dangerous for already at-risk populations who may also become infected with Covid-19, which attacks the lungs.</p> <p>\u201cExcusing the potential release of excess toxic air pollutants and other pollution that exacerbates asthma, breathing difficulty and cardiovascular problems in the midst of a pandemic that can cause respiratory failure is irresponsible from a public health perspective,\u201d the letter states.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not about reporting and paperwork,\u201d said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re flying blind because you\u2019re not monitoring for pollution and the public\u2019s flying blind because you\u2019re not reporting it, a lot of problems that come to light when you do those things are going to stay hidden,\u201d Schaeffer said.</p> <p>In one example, oil refineries will not be compelled to report on and reduce their carcinogenic <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbusiness%2F2020%2Ffeb%2F06%2Fus-oil-refineries-exceeding-limits-for-cancer-causing-benzene-report-finds\">benzene emissions</a>. Ten refineries, most of them in Texas, have already been exceeding limits.</p> <p>The relaxation of environmental laws follows lobbying from the American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas industry group, which sent the EPA a letter this week calling for the suspension of rules requiring repair of leaky equipment as well as monitoring of pollution.</p> <p>The EPA\u2019s move goes even further than this request, although the regulator said it expects businesses will comply with laws \u201cwhere reasonably practicable\u201d and that it will not tolerate flagrant, intentional breaches of the law.</p> <p>However, Michael Brune, executive director of Sierra Club, indicated that the move may be challenged in the courts. \u201cWhile there may be no limit to the lengths Trump and Wheeler are willing to go for corporate polluters, there is a limit to what the public will allow,\u201d Brune said. \u201cThis illegal and reckless action will not go unchecked.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on 8 May 2020 to clarify that it is only the enforcement of some environmental laws that has been suspended.</p>",

But what has so many people wondering tonight, [is] why Bill Ackman, who maybe has the right idea, or very good intentions, would put on such a ridiculous show and cause such damage to an already panicked market. That\u2019s what\u2019s puzzling.\u201d</p> \n<p>The puzzle appeared to have been solved this week when Ackman revealed in a letter to his shareholders that since late February he had been buying \u201ccredit protection\u201d hedges \u2013 bets that the markets would fall.</p> \n<p>Those hedges have paid off and Ackman\u2019s fund used the gains to buy shares in \u201ccompanies we love at bargain prices\u201d.</p> \n<p>While people around the world have been watching their savings shrivel, and 3 million Americans lost their jobs last week alone, Ackman\u2019s deals made him and his shareholders $2.6bn.</p> \n<p>Ackman was already rich. His net worth before the crisis was estimated by Forbes at about $1.3bn. The son of the boss of one of New York\u2019s premier real estate financing firms, Ackman has inherited a love for luxury property. He splits his time between a $22m 13-room two-storey penthouse in the Upper West Side and a three-house complex on the beach in the Hamptons.</p> \n<p>In 2015 he bought the penthouse of the 1,005ft skyscraper One57 for $91.5m as a \u201cfun investment\u201d. He uses the apartment on the 75th and 76th floors for extravagant parties to entertain his business and celebrity friends. Ackman planned to hold on to the six-bedroom, eight-bathroom penthouse with views of Central Park for a few years before \u201cflipping it\u201d \u2013 selling it at a huge profit in a few years.</p> \n<p>Ackman, who studied for both his undergraduate history degree and MBA at Harvard University, set up his first hedge fund Gotham Partners with a fellow Harvard grad, David Berkowitz. The fund closed in 2002 shortly after the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) investigated alleged market manipulation in Gotham\u2019s shorting of shares in investment firm Municipal Bond Insurance Association (MBIA). The regulator found no evidence of wrongdoing, but six days of embarrassing public disclosures left the firm\u2019s reputation in tatters.</p> \n<p>Ackman was not deterred though and went on to establish Pershing Square Capital with $54m of investment. It now has more than $8bn under management.</p> \n<p>He prided himself on the diversity of the funds hires, with early recruits reportedly including a fishing trip guide, a tennis coach and a guy he had met in a cab.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On Thursday night Ackman <a href=\"https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/03/26222617/Pershing-Square-Capital-Management-L.P.-Releases-Letter-to-Investors-March-26-2020.pdf\">released a statement defending himself</a> against charges that his CNBC appearance was designed to spook the markets. \u201cOn CNBC, I disclosed my beliefs to the best of my ability,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I got somewhat emotional as I talked about protecting my immune-compromised father from the ravages of the virus. </p> \n<p>\u201cBut I had become bullish because of my belief that the entire country would soon go into lockdown, and that would be the fastest and best way to minimise the impact of the virus. And that was why I explained that we were buying stocks. I also wanted to shout from the rooftops about the importance of taking the virus seriously so that we would build a consensus to lockdown the country as soon as possible.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn light of our concerns we had two choices: we could either sell all of our investments or hedge our portfolio. We chose to hedge coronavirus risk rather than sell because we are long-term investor, and we believe that all of our companies would eventually recover, and create substantial value over the long term.\u201d</p> \n<p>The bet revealed this week is not the first time Ackman has profited from the coronavirus pandemic. He made a $650m gain selling a 1.1% stake in Starbucks at the end January for about $85 a share shortly after the chain closed half of its stores in China in the early stages of trying to contain the pandemic. Starbucks shares fell to $58 during his CNBC appearance. He has since bought back into the stock.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cYou are free to go on to the streets of Paris as you please,\u201d says Tim Gunn, the former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/15/project-runway-fashion-as-day-job-christian-siriano-dom-streater-all-stars\">Project Runway</a> host who joins his fellow defector Heidi Klum to front the new fashion competition Making the Cut. Ah. Well. About that \u2026</p> <p>Making the Cut is up against it on a number of fronts, not just because it is a reality show with obscenely deep pockets that is dedicated to luxury and consumption and has arrived in the middle of a global firestorm that makes all of that look less palatable than it might have four months ago. There is also the matter of the competition to the competition. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/29/next-in-fashion-review-alexa-chung-and-tan-frances-outrageously-ott-reality-tv\">Netflix\u2019s Next in Fashion</a>, which arrived earlier this year, had a more suitable warm-and-winning approach to its trade, and it makes this look brutish by comparison.</p> <p>Making the Cut is keen to differentiate itself from any competitors from the off, however. As with Next in Fashion, the designers are experienced professionals looking for a launchpad to the next stages of their careers, but there is no doubt that Amazon is going all out here. The extravagance of proceedings would have been jaw-dropping at the best of times. The prize for the overall winner is $1m (\u00a3825,000). The first challenge takes them to Paris, to put on a catwalk show in front of an international icon. But enough about Naomi Campbell \u2013 the show takes place in front of the Eiffel Tower. </p> <p>One innovation is that the winning design of each episode will be available to buy through \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Amazon, right after that episode goes live. The enormous emphasis on the no-expense-spared indulgence of the show has a curious effect: it places every decision and judgment through a commercial lens rather than a creative one. Is it the best garment or will it make Amazon the most money on its site? The two are very rarely going to overlap, although there is a small concession to this \u2013 each of the 12 designers has to design two looks: one for the catwalk and one that is more \u201caccessible\u201d.</p> <p>It is tough to conjure up much enthusiasm for any of it, partly because it all feels so familiar. There are a couple of twists on the format, but mostly it is (big) business as usual. Early on, only one or two characters get picked out as a focus for our attention. There are 12 contestants, so that makes sense, but it also dampens the sense of competition, because it is hard to care about the people we are yet to meet. The contestants are each assigned a seamstress to free them up to design, not sew. The seamstress works off-screen, so there is little to show in the way of creation, only conceptualising, which is hard to lift, as a spectacle, for the screen.</p> <p>And there is a brutality to the judging, which I wasn\u2019t expecting, perhaps because I had been lulled into a false sense of security by the supportiveness of Next in Fashion. Maybe that is down to the money, too. Dismissing one contestant, who looks crushed, Klum continues to tell that person what went wrong. They are already going home, Heidi! Don\u2019t kick the sad designer when they are down. \u201cYou guys are so nice!\u201d she says, incredulous when the other designers cheer for the first winner. But nice, as the guest judge Carine Roitfeld points out, is the new normal in fashion, and it is what everyone is aspiring to be. Making the Cut just hasn\u2019t got there yet.</p> <p>The presence of Roitfeld is too brief, given that she is one of the show\u2019s saving graces; having Roitfeld, Joseph Altuzarra, Nicole Richie and Naomi Campbell as guest judges for the first challenge does up the ante somewhat. Klum is amusingly waffly and over-the-top, particularly when she learns a new word: \u201ctitillating\u201d. (\u201cSounds naughty!\u201d) And some of the designers really do seem like talents who just needed to step into the spotlight. But given those ingredients, it should emerge as something far more lively than the flat, lethargic show it manages to muster.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t quite hold together as a gripping competition, then, but there should have been plenty of potential for mind-numbing escapism. Most of those taking part are American, but there is an international flavour, too, and it brings out the comedy in an otherwise largely humourless affair.</p> <p>I enjoyed the Berliner, Esther, asking how to translate the German for an instruction to her seamstress. It turns out that, in the US, \u201cin the shadow of the seam\u201d becomes \u201cstitch in the ditch\u201d. Isn\u2019t language beautiful? She is an early favourite, along with Martha, from Richmond, Virginia, a Paris Hilton lookalike with an eye for designs that are \u201cbright and funky and pretty loud\u201d. Her resistance to advice and the done thing is delightful. If only the show had taken a similar approach, then it might have made the cut.</p>",

He writes long and riveting insights into his psychology that sometimes left me worrying about his mental health. But he reassured me that writing is a way of controlling his torment.</p> <p>\u201cIt just makes me feel better, bro,\u201d he told me, \u201cand I like to write.\u201d</p> <p>I still found it striking that a boxer, who had once been an 11-year-old coerced into carrying drugs in south London while boys just a little older than him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkwcTn2cOy0\" title=\"\">were stabbed to death</a>, wrote with such sensitivity and eloquence.</p> <p>\u201cHell is a perception,\u201d Chamberlain wrote last November. \u201cOr perhaps it\u2019s a nightmare. What\u2019s hell to you could be mediocre to someone else. For some people fighting is hell to them. For me, inactivity has caused me more depression and made me drown in my own perception of hell \u2026 I\u2019m not talking about the physical and what you can see.

I\u2019m in the ground now, buried. Sitting in my room on Christmas Day. But I will rise. Deep down an undeniable force is driving my actions. I must embrace it.\u201d</p> <p>On 4 January, after moving into a hostel in Miami, Chamberlain sent me a photograph of him in a white vest standing against a grimy bunk bed. \u201cIn prison,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>His messages over the next eight weeks were much more cheerful. Chamberlain confirmed that he had signed a five-year deal with the British promoter <a href=\"https://www.worldboxingnews.net/2020/02/18/isaac-chamberlain-future-world-champ\" title=\"\">Mick Hennessy</a>, who steered Carl Froch and Tyson Fury to their first world titles. His upbeat mood continued as he spoke enthusiastically about how much it would mean to be back in the ring again. When I texted him news of my plan to write about him for the Guardian he replied: \u2018Amazing my brooooooo \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>But then, on 17 March, he attached the official news that both his fights were off and that there would be no boxing for many months. Chamberlain is back in Britain but, as the lockdown intensifies, we have to do this interview remotely. I can hear the breath catch in his throat when I ask how he felt after he received the crushing, if hardly surprising, news. \u201cI was fighting back tears on the train, trying not to show anyone I was so upset. I was thinking, \u2018What more do I need to do? Why, just when I have my big break, does this happen?\u2019 But almost straightaway I told myself, \u2018Let\u2019s not be selfish here. The coronavirus is affecting everyone. It\u2019s bigger than me. Other people are suffering more than me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Chamberlain sighs. \u201cBut you\u2019re fighting with your mind because you think how different it should have been. In my last week of sparring I was knocking guys out. I was that ready I was knocking guys out with 20oz gloves. I was destroying them.\u201d</p> <p>He had been meant to spar in Miami against Yuniel Dorticos, the Cuban IBF world champion. \u201cI didn\u2019t in the end,\u201d he says. \u201cI sparred one of his guys and lit him up. That put them off. They want to have spars that build the fighter\u2019s confidence. I respect that. I get that. They\u2019re not going to want this crazy, hungry, young kid from London destroying Dorticos\u2019s confidence. I would have lit him up, 100%. So they would say to me, \u2018No sparring today\u2019 or \u2018He\u2019s not feeling so well.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/russian-boxers-post-videos-that-appear-to-flout-self-isolation-rules\">Russian boxers post videos that appear to flout self-isolation rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 26-year-old seems much more philosophical than I had expected him to be after another big setback. \u201cHow can I stop when I\u2019ve got this far? It\u2019s also been better because Mick Hennessy and his team are such great guys. I can talk to them and I never had that sort of relationship with [Eddie Hearn\u2019s] Matchroom. They really appreciate me and I have a lot of love for them because of the way they\u2019ve treated me.</p> <p>\u201cBefore, I was going through so much shit on my own. Now I have these people around me, consoling me, saying, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Isaac. We\u2019ve got you. It\u2019s going to be OK.\u2019 It feels good for someone else to pick you up. It\u2019s not me picking myself up all the time.</p> <p>\u201cI also still feel really excited about the Hennessy deal. All their shows are free-to-air TV. There\u2019s a gap in the market because you can utilise that free audience of about three million viewers on average. Imagine if I turn it into four or five million viewers? That would be massive. I\u2019m charismatic. I can talk. I can fight. People were coming to see me because I was starting to sell both venues out.\u201d</p> <p>When does Hennessy expect boxing to resume? \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019ve spoken to some very important people. I think the next show will probably be in September.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Fucking hell \u2026. six months.\u2019 But then I calmed down. I just need to keep in good shape. It was so hard in Miami, so it\u2019s time for a little rest.\u201d</p> <p>Chamberlain seems better equipped than many people to adjust to the lockdown. \u201cEveryone is talking about isolation and how they\u2019re struggling. Well, I\u2019ve been isolated in Miami for months. I was isolated from hope or any guarantee. It was hard but I got through it. I remember when I came back from Miami the time before this one I was so weak. I hadn\u2019t spoken to anyone for so long. I was really isolated. When people recognised me and friends spoke to me I thought, \u2018Oh, crap.\u2019 Now it\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>Chamberlain is cushioned by his Hennessy contract and also by the sponsorship he receives from the TCA clothing line. Another company, Vonder Europe, have provided an apartment for him in north London during the lockdown. But he will not be immune to the uncertainty of the coming months. \u201c100%,\u201d Chamberlain says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been very poor before. Even when it was tough in Miami I dealt with those conditions. If all my money went, it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world. I\u2019d find a way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1e076c4df151c8930b65c682faf82512b5a67b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1e076c4df151c8930b65c682faf82512b5a67b3/0_0_1099_1119/982.jpg\" alt=\"Isaac Chamberlain, at age twelve, escaped Brixton\u2019s gangs and drugs and was saved by boxing.\" width=\"982\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isaac Chamberlain, at age twelve, escaped Brixton\u2019s gangs and drugs and was saved by boxing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isaac Chaimberlain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boxing has already been his salvation. \u201cI got into boxing when I was about 11,\u201d he remembers. \u201cAround then I was still dabbling inside that street life where I was being manipulated [into delivering drugs] by older guys.</p> <p>\u201cWe grew up in Brixton and my cousin, Alex Mulumba, got stabbed in the heart after he\u2019d passed his GCSEs. It was a very sad time for the family. My mum brought me to the boxing gym because she didn\u2019t want me going down that road. I had started to become a product of the environment, hanging around those types of people. A lot of my friends from that time are dead or in prison on life sentences.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as I got into the gym, it was euphoria. I was like, \u2018What is this? People hitting each other. This stuff is normal?\u2019 It was crazy, the sweaty gym walls and the stinky gloves. I loved it. I would be in there all day, every day. I\u2019m the type of person, especially as a kid, that if I liked something I would be obsessed with it. I\u2019m still like that. I\u2019ll just keep training hard even though I wouldn\u2019t know where my career was going.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I loved most about boxing was that it lifted me up. I\u2019d never had those words of encouragement. People were saying, \u2018You could be a champion.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Shit, these people think I can be something.\u2019 I\u2019d never had that from teachers, not from my mum, not from anyone. I kept coming back so I could hear those words again because it felt so good. So boxing saved my life, big time.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the worrying and surreal times, Chamberlain sounds strong. I also point out that he has not been writing. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m not depressed. I only write when things are getting on top of me. I\u2019m still very optimistic.</p> <p>\u201cI still feel I will become a world champion. The world title belt I want is the WBC one. It\u2019s beautiful and it\u2019s my phone wallpaper. I look at it when I wake up and before I go to sleep. The current champion is Ilunga Makabu, from the Congo, and if we fight I\u2019ll destroy him. The cruiserweights out there are getting old and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that good.\u201d</p> <p>On Chamberlain\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IChamberlain_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Twitter masthead</a> it says \u201cThe Path To Paradise Is Through Hell\u201d.</p> <p>He laughs softly and then, as is his way, Chamberlain offers fresh hope all over again. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Whatever you\u2019re going through, you can get past it. If you feel you\u2019re in hell right now, why would you stay there? That\u2019s why it\u2019s very important to keep going and keep pushing, no matter what life throws at you. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. Keep working, keep believing, and you will come through it. I\u2019m a living testament to that. We can all get through this time.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>In a few weeks\u2019 time, when British hospitals become overwhelmed by coronavirus cases, one group should feel a particular sense of shame: tax avoiders. In Italy, the recriminations have already started. In an article in La Repubblica last week entitled \u201cThe things I am learning\u201d, Fabio Fazio, a leading TV journalist, <a href=\"https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/03/16/news/le_cose_che_ho_imparato-251384470/?ref=RHPPTP-BH-I251364842-C12-P22-S2.4-T1\">wrote</a>: \u201cIt has become evident that those who do not pay their taxes are not only guilty of a crime, but of murder: if the beds and the respirators are not there they are partly to blame.\u201d</p> <p>That particular lesson was quoted in full by none other than the pope in an <a href=\"https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/intervista/2020/03/18/news/papa_francesco_coronavirus_intervista-251572975/?ref=twhr\">interview</a> with the same paper.</p> <p>As the shutdown of the global economy threatens to cripple entire industries, there is no doubt some companies that for years decided paying taxes was not for them are suddenly waking up to the importance of the welfare state.</p> <p>One of the first to seek a government bailout has been the <a href=\"https://thehustle.co/the-economics-of-cruise-ships/\">cruise ship industry</a> in the US. For decades, its ships have flown the colours of Panama, Liberia and other flags of convenience to skirt minimum wage laws as well as get out of paying taxes. Some companies have achieved corporate tax rates that even Google would envy.</p> <p>In the UK, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/ryanair-cancels-80-per-cent-of-flights-and-does-not-rule-out-full-grounding-coronavirus\">airline industry</a> quickly followed suit, with Virgin Atlantic, a company owned by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/13/richard-branson-tax-exile-virgin\">tax exile</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-airlines-call-for-multibillion-bailout-to-survive-covid-19-crisis\">writing to the government</a> to say the entire industry may need support to the tune of \u00a37.5bn. This letter came in the week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/time-is-running-out-aviation-industry-warns-government\">easyJet paid a dividend</a> of \u00a360m to its founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/10/whos-who-britain-legal-offshore-tax-avoidance-james-dyson\">tax resident in Monaco</a>. Any support to the airline industry will no doubt flow through to aircraft leasing companies based in low-tax Ireland.</p> <p>So far, the government has chosen to implement a programme of broad, sector-wide support programmes rather than grant bailouts to individual industries. But the comprehensive nature of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">government response</a> to the crisis means that, inevitably, money will end up in the hands of people who refused to pay into the system when they had the means to do so. That is an injustice many ordinary taxpayers will find hard to swallow. Given the extraordinary nature of this crisis, swallow it we must, but the important thing is to ensure we stop this from happening again.</p> <p>One idea, floated by the former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, is to require any company receiving state support to agree to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arusbridger/status/1241656143295975424?s=20\">scrap any artificial tax avoidance arrangements</a>. As a starting point that is a good one, but ensuring that we emerge from the crisis with a more robust tax system to fund the recovery requires more structural change.</p> <p>The coronavirus outbreak will not bring about the end of the world, but it may well bring about the end of the world as we know it. Within business there will be winners as well as losers.</p> <p>Some of the winners are already starting to become apparent, and many of them have a well-known history of tax avoidance. Amazon in the US is looking <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/16/816704442/amazon-to-hire-100-000-workers-to-meet-surge-in-demand?t=1585070943115\">to hire 100,000</a> workers to cope with the extra demand for its home delivery service.</p> <p>Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime Video have seen such a surge in demand that they have had to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/03/20/amazon_youtube/\">downgrade their streaming services</a> in the EU to help the internet cope.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/there-is-no-trade-off-between-the-economy-and-health\">There is no trade-off between the economy and health | Jonathan Portes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shift to home working and months of self-isolation for large parts of the population will only help to accelerate the digitisation of our economy. In those circumstances, the reform of digital taxation becomes even more urgent.</p> <p>In addition, we will also need a wide and comprehensive review of tax reliefs. Research by my organisation, Tax Watch UK, has found that some <a href=\"https://www.taxwatchuk.org/reports/gaming-the-tax-system/\">video games companies</a>, another sector that should do well from the crisis, are receiving vast amounts of public subsidy despite paying nothing in tax and making hugely profitable games.</p> <p>Owners of infrastructure companies such as Heathrow airport, which may well need support over the coming months, have for years implemented <a href=\"https://www.taxwatchuk.org/reports/2-2/\">complex debt structures</a> that take advantage of generous tax exemptions, and faced minimal tax bills despite making substantial operating profits.</p> <p>Whatever happens over the next few months, the sheer scale of the government\u2019s intervention to support the economy through this difficult time will leave a substantial bill to pay. If one industry should be put out of business in this crisis it is the tax avoidance industry. After all, if those who stand to benefit from this crisis \u2013 either through government support or by increased market share \u2013 cannot contribute to the recovery, then who will?</p> <p>\u2022 George Turner is director of the thinktank Tax Watch UK</p>",

All recent events that tell us how disconnected populations have been brought together as global targets for anti-Muslim activism. Like the militant Muslims who inspire and enrage them, these activists invoke lengthy histories of conflict spanning the world, the narrative of one being used to justify that of the other in a paradoxical partnership.</p> <p>In fact, anti-Muslim feeling was sporadic and lacked a global dimension until recently. Despite having been classified by colonial governments in religious terms, the immigrants who came to European countries after independence neither asserted their religious identities nor experienced discrimination based on it. In the United Kingdom, Hindu, Muslim and Sikh migrants from India, Pakistan or Bangladesh rarely defined themselves by religion in public life, and were seen by government as well as anti-immigrant movements in racial or national terms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Rushdie affair laid the groundwork for an anti-Muslim rather than an anti-Asian or anti-immigrant response in Europe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When and why did religious identities come to define public debate and social conflict in so many parts of the world? The answer has to do with the larger processes of globalisation \u2013 economic, cultural and political \u2013 within which such identities have been transformed since the 1990s. That decade saw a worldwide surge of religious \u201cfundamentalism\u201d, of which Islam has emerged as the most prominent example. And the story of how this happened begins with the cold war.</p> <p>For Europe, North America and Australia, the chief destinations for those leaving Asia and Africa starting in the 1950s, Islam did not become a political issue until the cold war ended. Islam impinged upon the west in events such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iranian-revolution\" title=\"\">Iranian </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iranian-revolution\" title=\"\">revolution</a> of 1979, but it was the mobilisation 10 years later against Salman Rushdie\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/11/salman-rushdie-satanic-verses\" title=\"\">The Satanic Verses</a> that established its global credentials. Starting in the UK, the protests over Rushdie\u2019s novel moved on to India, Pakistan and thence to the rest of the world.</p> <p>Mobilising Muslims without ideological or institutional connections, the protests spread through television but were made possible by the new global arena brought to light with the cold war\u2019s end. Emerging from the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, this was an arena defined by global communications and supply chains tethered to the uninterrupted march of capitalism. No longer divided into rival hemispheres by the two superpowers and their allies, the global arena had been emptied of its political character, and so was free to be occupied by cultural and civilisational disputes.</p> <p>But Muslim movements became globalised in this arena out of weakness not strength, because they were unable to prevail against the post-colonial dictatorships of Asia and Africa. This was acknowledged by al-Qaida\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/2005-11-01/far-enemy-why-jihad-went-global\" title=\"\">repudiation</a> of the \u201cnear\u201d for the \u201cfar\u201d enemy: its decision to attack the western countries enabling Middle Eastern regimes such as Saudi Arabia. But Islam\u2019s globalisation only signals its fragmentation, as exemplified by such militant outfits, whose members lack a common origin and are disconnected from traditional religious authorities.</p> <p>The Rushdie affair also laid the groundwork for an anti-Muslim rather than simply an anti-Asian, anti-Arab, anti-Turkish or anti-immigrant response in Europe. Starting with accusations of extra-territorial loyalties, and followed by charges of fanaticism, terrorism and even desire for world conquest, anti-Muslim feeling came to be defined in historical terms as a \u201cclash of civilisations\u201d. But Muslims were not the first group to be elevated into a global target of this kind, having been preceded in this role by Africans and Jewish people.</p> <p>While anti-black discrimination possesses a varied past in many cultures, it was globalised as part of the history of capitalism, with people of African origin understood as labour reduced to its ultimate form, part animal and part machine. If Africans represented the dehumanisation of labour for Europeans, the anxious recognition of which had to be disavowed by its racialisation, Jews came to represent another kind of racialised anxiety, about the dismantling of cultural and other boundaries as part of capitalism\u2019s global reach.</p> <p>The previously theological status of Jews as \u201cChrist killers\u201d in medieval Europe or treacherous subjects in the Muslim Middle East was subordinated to that of the \u201ccapitalist bloodsucker\u201d in modern antisemitism, a phenomenon that is no longer confined to any religion or geography. The portrayal of Jewish people as a conspiratorial minority working behind the scenes to deceive and master the world depends upon the trope of invisibility, just as the demographic threat posed by a black population rested on its hyper-visibility.</p> <p>The term Islamophobia was coined during the 1990s, referring neither to labour, as with anti-black racism, nor capital, as with antisemitism, but a global arena without a politics of its own. Islamophobia has not supplanted its racist predecessors, but energised them in a context where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/05/demise-of-the-nation-state-rana-dasgupta\" title=\"\">nation</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/05/demise-of-the-nation-state-rana-dasgupta\" title=\"\"> states</a> seem unable to display political mastery against non-state forces, whether environmental, economic or civilisational.</p> <p>The global arena remains politically imponderable: the human race that has emerged as its true subject, in an age of terrorist panic, pandemic and climate change, has no way either of representing or debating itself institutionally. But this arena can be familiarised by taking the European past as a universal model, and dehumanising newly global enemies such as Islam with a historical genealogy that links the Arab conquest of Spain to Islamic State. Islam is thus conceived as a totalitarian ideology, or the kind of religious fanaticism that western civilisation has not seen since the wars of religion. Even Americans repudiate their exceptionalism when it comes to Islamophobia, linking 9/11 to a history stretching from the Crusades to the Ottoman siege of Vienna.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/10/islamophobia-racism-tories-far-right-british-society\">Islamophobia and racism aren\u2019t restricted to a few Tories and far-right thugs | Omar Khan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the version of history presented by Islamophobes is banal, lauding the Reformation or Enlightenment and proposing not some radical new vision of society, but familiar liberal virtues such as free speech and gender equality. These virtues, they argue, can be defended only by the exclusion, expulsion and even extermination of Muslims. Increasingly associated with violence in the west, however, Islamophobia\u2019s brutality is most readily seen in Asia, a continent awaiting its recognition as capitalism\u2019s new home.</p> <p>Here anti-Muslim violence emerges from the globalisation of older conflicts. In India, domestic narratives about Hindus and Muslims as brothers who betray each other but can always reconcile are being replaced by new stories about alien and permanent enemies. This may not alter the violence deployed against Muslims, but it buries even the myth of coexistence in some imagined future. As its own influence wanes, in other words, Europe offers the global arena a history with which to imagine a politics for the future.</p> <p>\u2022 Faisal Devji is professor of history at the University of Oxford</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> \n<p>So here is how my typical day begins. I wake up early and for a brief nanosecond all is well with the world. Then my mind turns to the nightmares I have consistently experienced for some months now and to the reality of the coronavirus pandemic. Anxiety electrifies me. It\u2019s not just some sense of existential dread, it\u2019s a parasitical physical entity that takes over my entire body.</p> \n<p>My shoulders and upper arms tingle with fear, there is a ball of dread in my guts and my legs cramp. I am literally immobilised for the best part of an hour. I know I should be getting out of bed, but I am too afraid to do so. Frequently, I close my eyes in a feeble attempt at mindfulness, repeat the serenity prayer \u2013 all those years in Narcotics Anonymous have paid off despite my having no belief in God \u2013 and hope that when I open them again I will somehow have acquired the willpower to get up.</p> \n<p>When I have eventually found the courage to get up, I do two sets of 20 press-ups. Partly as a way of staying fit, but mostly as it\u2019s the best way I\u2019ve found of releasing some of the terror-tension in my upper body. I repeat this at least eight times during the remainder of the day. Then breakfast, which is a piece of toast that I have to force myself to eat. At times of high anxiety, my appetite falls away. Still, I should be losing weight. Only after all this do I manage to catch up on the news and go back to my bedroom. At present I can\u2019t face being in my study at home. I feel too alone and unsafe. Bizarrely, having gone through this routine \u2013 though I can still scarcely read more than a page of a book at a time as my concentration levels aren\u2019t up to it \u2013 my mind settles a little and I can start work. Writing gives me, if not a momentary illusion of control, then at least a welcome distraction from my self. Until first thing the following morning \u2026</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

The new rules are more or less the same ones I imposed on myself two weeks previously, when I started working from home and not seeing friends and family. It just feels like reality has finally caught up with my own sense of neurosis and anxiety. Which may be deeply worrying for most ordinary people, but is somehow almost reassuring for me. Almost.</p> \n<p>Not that I\u2019m not feeling a profound sense of loss. My children, other family members and friends feel unbearably distant despite the discovery that the phone can also be used as a phone, and I also miss all my Guardian friends \u2013 they are more than colleagues \u2013 with whom I have shared an office in Westminster for more than six years. I\u2019d also like to update you on one battle. Last week I wrote that I was at least looking forward to spending some of the refunds I would be getting on opera tickets already booked \u2013 the companies made a huge error in asking whether you wanted your money back or would donate the total ticket price as a gift; I would happily have donated 20% but there wasn\u2019t that option \u2013 and that my wife was insistent it be put towards mending things around the house that had been broken for years. Well, tough. I went out and bought a pot instead. At times like these, things of beauty win hands down.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> \n<p>I should be pleased that I am not one of the 1.5 million people who have been advised by the government to self-isolate due to underlying health conditions. But my paranoia levels are now so high, I am worried that I may have been left off the list by accident and that the NHS has forgotten that I once had pneumonia when I was 16 and that I nearly had to have my leg amputated after my knee replacement became infected.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s also crossed my mind that the government may actually want to have me killed \u2013 sketch writers are probably high on Dominic Cummings\u2019 hit list \u2013 and has deliberately kept me misinformed. Anyway, I\u2019m taking no chances. Nor am I entirely reassured by reports from Spain and Italy that under-60s are getting preferential treatment for ventilators. If anyone knows how to doctor a birth certificate, please get in touch.</p> \n<p>Otherwise I am coping reasonably well, sticking to the rules and cycling up and down the same half-mile hill. I prefer my exercise to be mindless and repetitive, so that suits me fine. The one member of the household to be finding the new restrictions annoying is the dog. Initially he was thrilled to have both my wife and I at home, but now he is getting fed up with being taken for extra walks on the common. He\u2019s also taken to social distancing from us. Normally when we go to bed, he\u2019s the first up the stairs to nab the prime spot on the duvet. Now he\u2019s taken to sleeping at the bottom of the stairs. He needs a bit of me time. It\u2019s come to something when I\u2019m needier than the neediest dog in the world.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cf04950a0a9ce812ccbc26910877b7cfe63d9ef\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cf04950a0a9ce812ccbc26910877b7cfe63d9ef/0_236_3177_1906/1000.jpg\" alt=\"guinea pig in face mask\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve never wanted to be a guinea pig less than I do now.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergey Kozlov/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> \n<p>These are strange times to be a sketchwriter. The only story is coronavirus \u2013 who\u2019d have guessed Brexit could take a back seat so quickly? \u2013 and there is nothing remotely funny about the pandemic. So I\u2019ve often agonised over what tone to take. Most readers who have got in touch seem to think I have got it about right, but there are some who feel I should be less critical and get more behind the government. My feeling is there should always be room for light relief \u2013 I\u2019m using Shakespeare as my role model here \u2013 and that now, more than ever, journalists should be allowed to ask members of the government the tough questions. As such, my sketches have tended not to focus on the measures the prime minister has taken but on the ones he hasn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>I may be more health-anxious than many, but it seemed to me almost inevitable that what was happening in China back in January would be coming to Europe down the line. And yet the government did almost nothing except argue whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/jan/31/britain-leaves-the-eu-to-virtual-bongs-and-god-save-the-queen-video\">Big Ben should bong for Brexit</a>, fail to deal with the floods and take 10 days off over the half-term break. Ministers may have been working flat out for the last three weeks, but if they had started a couple of months earlier we might have had a more coherent plan in place. Not to mention more coronavirus tests, ventilators and protective equipment for NHS workers. There\u2019s also been an undeniable sense of pathos to my sketches.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/lucky-man-sunak-dishes-the-dosh-and-eyes-up-johnsons-job\">Lucky-man Sunak dishes the dosh and eyes up Johnson's job | John Crace</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Boris has always longed to see himself as the next Churchill, but his response to the coronavirus was initially one of appeasement. He has frequently misjudged the tone of his addresses to the nation and his messages have often been contradictory and confused. Unbelievably, though, his personal ratings appear to be soaring. So what do I know?</p> \n<h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> \n<p>Shortly before 8 o\u2019clock last night, my wife and I rather self-consciously opened the front door and went out into the front garden expecting almost no one else to be around. Instead, nearly all our neighbours were out too and the applause for NHS staff \u2013 not to mention the klaxon that came from the balcony of the flats opposite \u2013 was prolonged and deeply moving. It was a wonderful moment of unity and I was only sorry that our next-door neighbour, who is a paramedic, wasn\u2019t also outside to hear how much he was appreciated. I\u2019m guessing he was working.</p> \n<p>Perhaps we should make this kind of thing a regular Thursday night event. We need all the community we can get. With so much terrible news, I\u2019ve started to appreciate the small things all the more. While out walking the dog, my wife pointed to some green shoots that we had passed the day before and had grown just a little more. Stuff I would ordinarily miss but am now training myself to observe. My garden is also coming back to life: I have recently given the lawn its first mow of the year, and almost all my bananas, ferns and architectural plants appear to have survived the winter, though it\u2019s still too early to remove their fleeces. One echium bush, covered with budding blue spiral thingies (a technical term), has already grown far bigger than I expected and really needs moving, except I can\u2019t bear to replant it in case I accidentally kill it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fded3c2070dc8dc96ab5e784cf6b16fd5aed234\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fded3c2070dc8dc96ab5e784cf6b16fd5aed234/0_66_480_480/480.jpg\" alt=\"One echium bush\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One echium bush</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Crace/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But my real highlight of the coming weekend will be the clocks going forward an hour so that it won\u2019t get dark till 7.30. It\u2019s a yearly milestone that never fails to fill me with hope even at times of deep despair. The extra evening daylight does wonders for my soul and I look forward to celebrating with a Diet Coke out on the patio. Even if it\u2019s raining.

  "<p>When Doug Paton burst from his trailer on a warm spring afternoon, he expected to confront yet another stray dog agitating the livestock on his sister\u2019s farm outside Victoria, a city on Canada\u2019s west coast. Instead, standing barefoot in the grass, he found himself face to face with a wolf.</p> <p>\u201cIt stopped dead in its tracks and it stared me down,\u201d he says. Then, as quickly as it appeared, the wolf trotted away, pausing once to stare back at Paton before clearing a five-foot metal gate and vanishing.</p> <p>\u201cJust like a person, you might not remember a name, but you never forget a face,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that face as long as I live.

From there, the wolf swam nearly two miles towards a scattering of tiny islands within sight of the city.</p> <p>In the eight years that followed, the wolf \u2013 named Takaya (the Lekwungen word for wolf) by the Songhees, a local First Nation whose territory encompasses the islands \u2013 quickly became a legendary figure, drawing fans from around the world captivated by stories of the resilience \u2013 and tenderness \u2013 of the young predator.</p> <p>But his life ended in tragedy on Tuesday, in a series of events that laid bare both the cold uncertainties of life in the wild and the limits of an often-strained bond between humans and wild animals.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Tayaka was a rare species of canine known as the coastal or sea wolf. These predators thrive in marine environments and have become adept at living off a diet of salmon, shellfish and seals instead of deer. Fifty years ago, there were few coastal wolves in the region, victims of overhunting and habitat degradation. Today an estimated 250 of them roam the 12,000 sq miles of Vancouver Island, a remarkable turnaround for the embattled predators.</p> <p>Two years after Paton\u2019s experience, Cheryl Alexander got her first glimpse of Takaya, in May 2014. Like many of the 370,000 residents of greater Victoria, the environmental consultant and photographer was curious about how the wolf could survive among the wind-battered trees of the tiny islands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ccdb3c7432740770756519eefb13aecad04cd2ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccdb3c7432740770756519eefb13aecad04cd2ea/0_0_5286_3529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Takaya at the edge of Vancouver Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takaya swam two miles to a scattering of tiny islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She saw Takaya emerge from the ocean briefly and slip into the trees. The piercing howls that followed were a chilling and powerful experience. \u201cIt had emotions associated with it that were very melodic,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone was almost moved to tears.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Much of the excitement surrounding Takaya came from the unlikeliness of his journey. Few wolves have ever traversed the heart of Victoria, and the islands Takaya took up residence on were tiny, 10 times smaller than the narrowest known range for a wolf pack in the wild.</p> <p>Most notably, he arrived alone. Wolves almost always live in nuclear families; two parents and their pups. Occasionally, one will break away to form a new group. But the dangers of hunting \u2013 the sharp antlers and stomping hoofs of panicking animals \u2013 are often fatal for a lone predator. That Takaya travelled solo \u2013 and seemed content to remain alone \u2013 added to the myth and excitement.</p> <p>In recent years, new housing developments have marched steadily outwards from Victoria, swapping land that was once forested and wild for cul-de-sacs and two-car garages.</p> <p>But the chain of islands close to the city is a rare enclave of untamed nature. Pine and fir, punctuated by the rich amber hues of arbutus trees, create thick inland forests. Seals haul themselves on to the shores and small mammals \u2013 mink and otter \u2013 scurry among the rocks.</p> <p>Takaya quickly got to work, feasting on the seals and otters and sharpening his ability to catch fast-moving fish. But with no permanent streams on the island, he also had to use his ingenuity to survive. Drizzly winters created temporary wetlands, but summers in the region are dry. In a move that astounded biologists, he began digging wells on the island.</p> <p>\u201cHe really pushed the envelope of what\u2019s possible ecologically, both in terms of how he made his living, and the small amount of space that he actually required to do so,\u201d says Chris Darimont, a wolf expert at the University of Victoria and the Raincoast Conservation Foundation. Takaya was an \u201cextreme data point\u201d on the spectrum of anything researchers had previously encountered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6089046a3deaefe33a9a670b61c67786fdd0288b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6089046a3deaefe33a9a670b61c67786fdd0288b/0_0_2947_1965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Takaya lying on a rock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takaya was known to dig wells to find drinking water in the dry summers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People began paddling out to the islands, hoping to catch a glimpse of this miraculous wolf thriving in the ever-vanishing wild around them.</p> <p>But as his popularity grew, fed by a steady flow of stories in the local media, government authorities feared a dangerous encounter with humans had become inevitable and in the summer of 2012 and winter of 2013, conservation officers set up a series of traps. But Takaya seemed untrappable, ignoring the bait laid out for him.</p> <p>Plans to capture Takaya put the province at odds with the Songhees First Nations, who vigorously protested the idea of removing the wolf. Long a symbol of the Lekwungen people, there was an excitement among the community that a wolf had finally returned.</p> <p>Resistance to capturing the wolf also unearthed longstanding grievances over control of the islands. Known as Ti\u2019ches in Lekwungen, the archipelago has long been a source of natural medicines found in the woods and fish in the surrounding waters. When the colonial government enacted a ban on traditional indigenous ceremonies in the 1800s, the Songhees would travel to Ti\u2019ches to practise in secret.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.discoveryisland.ca/\">Archival photographs</a> show large wooden structures along the shore, all of which have long disappeared; dismantled, destroyed or stolen over the years. Today the Songhees own all of Chatham Islands and share a portion of Discovery Island with the province of British Columbia. But even the name of the area \u2013 Oak Bay Islands Ecological Reserve \u2013 remains a vestige of colonialism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-zip/giv-3902ZX7t06JDDhXQ/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-zip/giv-3902ZX7t06JDDhXQ/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a huge piece of culture that\u2019s not known or appreciated,\u201d says Mark Salter, the former tourism manager for the Songhees Nation, who has worked to educate the public about the history of the islands. On numerous occasions, he has had to put out fires left by campers and pick up garbage left on the shore. \u201cPeople invite themselves out here, not knowing this is reserve land. But they\u2019re not welcome.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, a group ignored a ban on bringing pets to the islands, travelling with their two dogs. As they walked through the forest, they soon realised they had acquired a third canine in their group. The group panicked and scrambled on to the roof of a nearby lighthouse building, where they called coastguard rescue. Armed conservation officers also arrived, prepared to deliver a fatal shot if needed. Takaya was spared, but the encounter chilled Salter, who worried the wolf\u2019s fame, which only increased over time, could be his undoing.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Howls still echoing in her mind, Alexander began boating around the islands, eager to repeat her first encounter. This time she came prepared with telephoto lenses. Her early sightings of Takaya were rare and infrequent. He was ghostlike, quickly vanishing from view.</p> <p>\u201cThere was something very captivating about him,\u201d she says. \u201cFor whatever reason, I felt a really intense connection. I just wanted to learn about his life.\u201d She returned to the islands week after week. With permission from the Songhees Nation, Alexander was able to set foot in the forests where Takaya often hid. Walking gingerly among the pine and fir, she could sense his presence, even as he remained camouflaged among the trees and tall grass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ce75afa63a5781c171c8ea85704667def02f6a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ce75afa63a5781c171c8ea85704667def02f6a8/0_159_4896_3105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheryl Alexander speaks with Thomas Riemchen and Sheila Douglas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographer Cheryl Alexander, centre, with biologists Thomas Riemchen and Sheila Douglas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leyland Cecco</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He began appearing \u2013 and vanishing \u2013 more frequently. In their hundreds of encounters \u2013 including one in which he sat just three feet from her \u2013 Alexander felt drawn to his tenderness. \u201cWolves want what we want,\u201d she says. \u201cThey play. They touch. They care deeply about other members of their family.\u201d It was these human-like characteristics that moved people the most. His lonely howls could often be heard from the city during calm weather. Wolves, like humans, crave companionship in some form. As Takaya aged, outliving most wild wolves, he did so alone.</p> <p>No wolf had ever been recorded living alone for so long, says Darimont. And lone wolves typically avoid howling, so as not to draw the attention of nearby packs. Nearly everything about Takaya, it seemed, was exceptional.</p> <p>In 2019, a documentary featuring Takaya that Alexander helped produce aired in Canada and on the BBC, further cementing his fame.</p> <p>Then, in February 2019, a lone female was spotted on the rocky shores of the mainland, across from where Takaya made his swim. Experts doubt she swam the channel \u2013 but her presence ignited hope that Takaya might soon be reunited with one of his own.</p> <p>\u201cThere was something about his aloneness \u2026 his alienation from his own kind \u2026 that spoke to people\u2019s own feelings of alienation and aloneness in the world,\u201d says Alexander. \u201cPlus, we\u2019re all hopeless romantics.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2053d955437284cbeb0d83303fedd8eec7e5bc99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2053d955437284cbeb0d83303fedd8eec7e5bc99/0_0_5003_3340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Takaya howling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takaya\u2019s howls could be heard in the city on calm days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others found strength in the wolf\u2019s solitude. Paton, whose spring encounter in 2012 was likely the first recorded sighting of Takaya, was locked in a bitter custody battle and divorce when the two crossed paths.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to fight any more. And then I saw this lone wolf and thought, \u2018If he\u2019s healthy \u2013 if he\u2019s doing fine by himself, then so can I,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cFrom that day forward, I just changed my attitude towards things. I stopped feeling sorry for myself. I felt more invigorated than ever to get things right in my life. And I never looked back.\u201d</p> <p>Soon after, Paton had the words \u201cLone Wolf\u201d tattooed on his forearms in permanent tribute.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>With all the success Takaya had enjoyed on the islands, no one is sure why, on 25 January this year, he dipped his 10-year-old body into the swirling emerald waters one last time and swam towards the city.</p> <p>Emerging from the ocean on the opposite shore, he was greeted by a scene of parks and forest, interrupted by condominiums and family homes. Darimont believes the most likely reason, despite the popular conception of Takaya as a lonely figure, was that he was overcome by the annual hormonal urge to mate, which occurs in January.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect he gave up tranquil retirement on the islands to go find a mate,\u201d he says. Conservation officers have their own theories. They believe a string of intense storms in the winter months, which had blown fierce winds across the islands, might have disrupted Takaya\u2019s access to food. The greenery of city parks across the water and the potential of a new source of food might have been enough to lure a hungry wolf.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22e7d03a9170b48a461d39e120436f0419052ee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22e7d03a9170b48a461d39e120436f0419052ee5/0_0_4557_3038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beacon Hill park in Victoria city\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takaya was spotted in Beacon Hill park, a sprawling green space in downtown Victoria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leyland Cecco</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexander, however, rejects mating and food loss as likely explanations for Takaya\u2019s journey. In the days leading up to his departure, trail camera images showed a healthy, robust wolf. And if the previous nine years of hormones hadn\u2019t been enough to move him from the island in search of a mate, she wondered why \u2013 at nearly 11 years old \u2013 he suddenly felt the urge to leave. Instead, she feared he might have misjudged the swift ocean currents and been swept towards the mainland. Or that the sound of poachers on the island \u2013 hunting ducks in the winter \u2013 might have prompted the skittish wolf to seek refuge in the water.</p> <p>\u201cI doubt that he was intending to leave permanently. I just can\u2019t see it. It was his territory. It was really the only thing he knew. He\u2019d been there all of his life,\u201d she says.</p> <p>For nearly 48 hours, Takaya, briskly trotting through parks and along sidewalks, led police on a wild chase through the city.</p> <p>The city remained transfixed as police posted the wolf\u2019s progress on social media. Alexander remembers a night riddled with anxiety as she received constant updates on the chase. Eventually police tracked Takaya to a house, finding him wedged between a garage and a fence. Alexander pleaded with officials to let her see Takaya, but was held back. \u201cI was nearby and I believe that he could smell me,\u201d she s ays.</p> <p>Takaya was sedated and carried upside down, his tongue hanging from the side of his mouth, and placed into a metal barrel.</p> <p>After snapping photos of his limp body being carried away, Alexander returned home to celebrate her husband\u2019s birthday and then went to bed. \u201cThe next morning, I just woke up, and cried,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Two days later Takaya was released back into the wild, emerging from the stupor of drugs on a gravel logging road. Conservation officers decided to relocate him more than 100 miles from the islands. He was moved inland, where the forest is thick and impenetrable, along the rugged west coast of Vancouver Island.</p> <p>Away from the familiarity and comforts of his small islands, Takaya faced a daunting list of new threats. Packs of wolves in the area might kill him if their paths crossed. Leg-hold traps, laden with bait, might prove too tempting to a starving wolf. Even the new prey \u2013 elk and deer \u2013 were unfamiliar. \u201cThere was tons of stuff that he hadn\u2019t had to deal with in his life,\u201d says Alexander. \u201cI was very worried.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b951b8e94ba2bd204293873fa54c54012a7a674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b951b8e94ba2bd204293873fa54c54012a7a674/0_0_4768_3576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Takaya on Vancouver Island\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takaya on Vancouver Island.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNature is nature and you can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said conservation officer Mark Kissinger, who tranquillised Takaya and set him free, at the time. \u201cBut hopefully things go well for him.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Each time she visited the islands in the weeks that followed, Alexander was struck by an overwhelming sense of emptiness. \u201cThere\u2019s an absence now of energy. There\u2019s an absence of possibility,\u201d she said, steering her boat through a narrow channel one sunny February afternoon.</p> <p>\u201cHe gave us a portal into the wild and into nature \u2013 and into something that we often don\u2019t get to see. And if we do, it\u2019s only just a glimpse.\u201d</p> <p>Then, at the end of February, Alexander received an email from a woman who had spotted a wolf while out<strong> </strong>walking near the fishing community of Port Renfrew.<strong> </strong>It had peered at her from the forest and showed no signs of aggression when her dog approached it.</p> <p>Alexander travelled to meet the woman but returned home without any sightings. Then, that night, she was sent a photograph from a man who had a series of trail cameras in the area. Alexander took one look at the picture, and recognised Takaya. A bright yellow tag was pinned in his ear \u2013 a souvenir from his experience with conservation officers.</p> <p>Alexander travelled back to Port Renfrew, this time bringing her own trail camera. Checking it a few days later, the video showed Takaya walking past. The sighting, so close to a populated area, immediately concerned Alexander.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"76e482cf0f8df069f50090768fa060a1c1a49d43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76e482cf0f8df069f50090768fa060a1c1a49d43/0_0_5900_3939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Takaya traverses rocks at sunset\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Takaya\u2019s adventures ended when he was shot by hunters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cheryl Alexander/Wild Awake Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have that fear instilled in him that humans are bad. He\u2019s trusting. It worries me he may find himself in a situation where humans are not all good and don\u2019t have his interests at heart. It really scares me; it worries me,\u201d said Alexander following the sightings.</p> <p>Her instincts proved right.</p> <p>On 24 March, Takaya was shot and killed, nearly 30 miles from where he was released. In the weeks before his death he had been spotted with increasing frequency, raising fears an encounter might prove fatal.</p> <p>On his final day he came too close to a hunter\u2019s dogs. In the end, it was his curiosity, built up from years of protection offered by the islands, that was his undoing.</p> <p>British Columbia\u2019s Conservation Officer Service told Canada\u2019s CTV news: \u201cWe understand many British Columbians and people around the world shared care and concern for the wellbeing of this wolf and this update will affect many people.\u201d</p> <p>None more so than Alexander, who said simply: \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d<br></p>",

And we will learn.\u201d A California geographer and urban explorer, Garrett has spent the past four years researching his book <em><a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/308/308185/bunker/9780241336014.html\">Bunker: Preparing for the End Times</a></em>, which will be published in August. The research has involved hanging out with millenarian fruitcakes, disaster profiteers and the uber-rich, not to mention tooled-up, swivel-eyed anarcho-libertarians from America to Australia.</p> <p>Garrett became known in 2012 for climbing the Shard before it opened. As part of his ethnographical research into hidden aspects of cities he joined a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/09/shard-explorers-new-targets-london\">group of trespassers called London Consolidation Crew</a>. In 2014, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/22/oxford-university-academic-shard-jail-place-hacker-garrett\">pleaded guilty to committing criminal damage</a> during sorties into disused London Underground tunnels and published <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/20/urban-exploration-robert-macfarlane-bradley-garrett\">Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City</a></em>.</p> <p>The catalyst for his new book lies below Wiltshire. As part of his place-hacking adventures, Garrett had visited the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/dec/16/a-cinema-a-pool-a-bar-inside-the-post-apocalyptic-underground-future\">Central Government War Headquarters</a>, a 35-acre cold war bunker just outside Bath. The complex, called Burlington Bunker, under RAF Corsham, includes 60 miles of roads, 100,000 lights, sleeping quarters, a bomb-proof radio station, laundries, a drinking water reservoir, and a library from which Garrett nicked a few empty notebooks. \u201cI kept the notebooks with me, waiting for a story worthy of them. I finally saw my chance in 2016, when the secret city was listed for sale, put on the market for \u00a31.5m.\u201d One of the prospective buyers was Robert Vicino, whom Garrett calls a doomsday realtor, and who markets bunkers to survive whatever apocalypse you might dread. \u201cWhat these guys are selling is time,\u201d Garrett says. \u201cYes, they\u2019re selling space, but that\u2019s the wrapper.

Hall transformed this Kansas facility into a 15-storey inverted skyscraper called Survival Condo, where up to 75 individuals can weather a maximum of five years inside. Half-floor apartments cost $1.5m, full-floor apartments $3m, while a 335-square-metre two-storey penthouse has sold for $4.5m. One resident made a year-long video film of the view from her Manhattan loft apartment over Central Park, during all four seasons, day and night, together with the cacophonous sounds of urban life.

I\u2019ve got three plane tickets I\u2019ve destroyed because I can\u2019t travel. It\u2019s so nice, really, not to go to the conferences.

Burlington Bunker in Corsham, Wiltshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bradley L Garrett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re doing this interview over Skype \u2013 me in London lockdown, he at his 78-year-old mother\u2019s house in the hills above Los Angeles: he\u2019s looking after her while she convalesces from surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s in a gated community, which for a long time I\u2019ve thought typifies social atomisation and despised. But I\u2019ll tell you something \u2013 it gives me solace right now.\u201d</p> <p>Garrett tells me that he began work on the book expecting to meet \u201cthe kind of people who are so rich that, after they\u2019ve bought the second and third homes and the yacht they wonder what other real estate to buy. Hence bunkers.\u201d But he also met people who regard survivalism as an antidote for an ailing species poised to plummet into an abyss of its own creation. Most are evangelical Christians. Among them are a group of women in Tennessee who live off-grid, crafting and repairing stuff rather than buying it. They, too, are readying themselves for the apocalypse, whether brought on by AI, nuclear catastrophe or Covid-19.</p> <p>There is a collective noun for all the people preparing for the end \u2013 preppers \u2013 and 1% of the United States population, or 3.7 million people, self-identify as such. Not that they form a homogeneous group. In fact the bunker crowd are despised by a sub-group called prepsteaders. \u201cStockpiling guns and food buckets is only going to get you so far,\u201d Daisy Luther, the self-styled Organic Prepper, told Garrett. \u201cSoon you\u2019ll need people who know how to build things, grow things. We\u2019ve all become consumers that don\u2019t produce anything. We\u2019ve got to flip that logic on its head.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b48cf5f4f6fff97acd0ae49fdcda76ce36da9480\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b48cf5f4f6fff97acd0ae49fdcda76ce36da9480/0_0_1689_1127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The library in Survival Condo, Kansas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disaster reading ... the library in Survival Condo, Kansas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SurvivalCondo.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/time-to-join-preppers-survive-climate-change-apocalypse\">Preppers use acronyms</a> that Garrett helpfully explains in his book\u2019s glossary: they are, for instance, ready for TEOTWAWKI (The End of the World as We Know it). Many have packed Inch bags (I\u2019m Never Coming Home), and believe that when the government isn\u2019t providing essential services, it\u2019s best to be a Yoyo (You\u2019re on you own).</p> <p>Spending time with preppers has changed Garrett. He recently spent two months driving more than 11,000 miles across Australia in a Jeep Wrangler bug-out vehicle with his partner, Amanda, imagining the apocalypse. And now he\u2019s ready to leave at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201cI always reverse my car into the garage,\u201d he says. And instead of keeping his Inch bag under the bed, he has it \u2013 tent, basic supplies, stove, sleeping bag \u2013 stowed in the boot for a quick getaway. \u201cCities are not the place to be in extremis. When the shit goes down, better to be in Idaho.\u201d He cites the French Marxist Paul Virilio, who worried that as space and distance were compressed by speed and connectivity, we would become more vulnerable to disaster. \u201cIn other words, progress and disaster go hand in hand,\u201d Garrett explains.</p> <p>He also draws on the wisdom of Drew Miller, whom he interviewed for the book. Miller\u2019s slogan is \u201cprepare for the worst, enjoy the present\u201d and the former USAF colonel\u2019s business model involves constructing 12 survivalist encampments across the US, each for 50-500 people, and built to repel attacks by roaming post-apocalypse hordes. By buying into Miller\u2019s scheme, for $1,000 a year, members can use the spaces to holiday, and then retreat to them as disaster strikes.</p> <p>Miller, whose staff call him Captain Paranoid, wrote the chillingly titled novel <em>Rohan Nation: Reinventing America After the 2020 Collapse</em> and published a paper arguing that cities are bad for you. Unlike \u201cthe largely rural, resilient population that weathered the 1918 flu pandemic \u2026 our urbanised society, dependent on electricity, daily deliveries of food\u2026 is a dependent population that may face both a much worse virus and economy in total collapse with widespread loss of law and order\u201d. Garrett is sympathetic to such doom-mongering, writing in <em>Bunker</em>: \u201cThe 1918 Spanish flu pandemic alone infected 500 million people, killing off 3-5% of the world\u2019s population. If such a pandemic tore through the world\u2019s major cities today, spreading via international trips by plane and sea, we\u2019d lose a lot more that 500 million people.\u201d</p> <p>One thing that appeals to him about prepping is a newfound sense of agency. \u201cWe\u2019re all familiar with dread, aren\u2019t we? Well, dread is unbearable because it has no object, so you can\u2019t do anything about it. Overcoming the dread is what it\u2019s about. When we give shape to the things we dread, we make them manageable.\u201d Having agency in the face of disaster is particularly appealing to Americans in 2020, he argues. Garrett grimly offers a reminder of the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/11/donald-trump-barack-obama-legacy\">Trump in 2018 dismantled</a> the Obama-created National Security Council directorate charged with preparing for a pandemic. \u201cWhen the government doesn\u2019t prepare for emergencies, you do it yourself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"027cecdc88c794f45d239fbc0dac06970d7bcbd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/027cecdc88c794f45d239fbc0dac06970d7bcbd0/0_0_7861_5243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prepper long-term food storage.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lunch buckets ... prepper long-term food storage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bradley L Garrett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Garrett\u2019s suggestion is that behind such ill-advised cutbacks lurks the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/06/steve-bannon-far-right-radicalise-europe-trump\">uber-disruptor Steve Bannon</a>, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist. For Bannon, short-term disaster is to be welcomed, perhaps even provoked, since it can be used to leverage power. Garrett notes that Bannon would arrive for White House meetings with a book called <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/04/white-house-agenda-collapse-global-order-war\">The Fourth Turning</a></em> under his arm. That book, by William Strauss and Neil Howe, proposed a cyclical understanding of history called generational theory, which holds that major events take place in 100-year cycles. Each cycle is made up of \u201cseasons\u201d lasting roughly 25 years: growth (The High), maturation (The Awakening), entropy (The Unravelling), and destruction (The Crisis). For the past 20 years, the US has been in entropy. But after entropy, narcissism and spiritual decay comes revivifying destruction. At least, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/steve-bannon-spirit-revolt-democrats-gave-up\">Bannon argued in his 2010 film </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/steve-bannon-spirit-revolt-democrats-gave-up\">Generation Zero</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/10/steve-bannon-spirit-revolt-democrats-gave-up\">.</a></p> <p>But if cultivating chaos for political ends sounds like a manifestation of American exeptionalism, Garrett suggests we should consider what happened in 2017 at a hotel in London. Bannon and Jacob Rees-Mogg met to discuss how to further the conservative cause in the UK. Garrett writes: \u201cIt seems no small coincidence that both men were the puppet masters behind what we might call \u2018pro-collapse governments\u2019 in both the US and UK. Leaders in these movements see chaos as an opportunity to seize wealth and power.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s more, Garrett reminds us, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/09/mystic-mogg-jacob-rees-mogg-willam-predicts-brexit-plans\">Rees-Mogg\u2019s father, William, was one of the authors</a> of the 1997 neoliberal text <em>The Sovereign Individual: How to Survive and Thrive during the Collapse of the Welfare State</em>, which opens with the quote \u201cThe future is disorder\u201d, from Tom Stoppard\u2019s play <em>Arcadia</em> and predicts that digital technology will make the world hugely more competitive, unequal and unstable.</p> <p>I suggest to Garrett that it is not only neoliberals who yearn for disorder to revolutionise the world but a certain type of Marxist, too. \u201cExactly. And prepping is caught in the middle of those narratives. On the one hand prepping is to do with living communally and on the other it\u2019s shooting at people who want to get into your bunker.\u201d As many businesses shut in the US last week, footage emerged on social media of long queues outside LA weapons stores as residents flocked to buy guns.</p> <p>For those of us without millions to sink into silos, there is an alternative. \u201cBloom where you\u2019re planted,\u201d Daisy Luther says. Sustainability, self-sufficiency and community, Garrett agrees, are the keys to survival. The lesson he takes from the preppers he met is that \u201cdisasters aren\u2019t ends but irreversible transitions \u2026 They\u2019re always something less than an extinction. Catastrophe, by its very nature, falls short of finality. It\u2019s the end of <em>something</em> but never the end.\u201d</p>",

Since England\u2019s visit to Sofia last October, however, the 24-year-old\u2019s time in the country has been repeatedly soured by racist abuse, leaving him isolated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/29/bulgaria-ordered-to-play-next-two-matches-behind-closed-doors-over-england-racism\">Bulgaria ordered to play one game behind closed doors over racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Monkey chants were aimed at England players, resulting in the game being stopped twice and a large group of home supporters being ejected. Uefa fined Bulgaria \u00a365,000 and forced the national team to play two games behind closed doors (one suspended for two years). Solomon-Otabor has since been targeted by fans of CSKA Sofia and other Bulgarian clubs with monkey chants and via racist messages on social media.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t watch the game but the moment I got off the plane my phone started buzzing,\u201d Solomon-Otabor says. \u201cEveryone was like: \u2018Is this what you go through?\u2019, \u2018You need to come home\u2019, \u2018You need to get out of there\u2019. I was surprised because it\u2019s happened but up until that I had never experienced it; I had never heard it or seen it. When England came, it was just some stupid people. It is just ignorant people who don\u2019t have knowledge or education. I had never experienced it and was never conscious of it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hardest part is I am alone, and I feel uncomfortable</p> <footer> <cite>Viv Solomon-Otabor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During a cup tie at Arda in early December, Solomon-Otabor was the victim of monkey chants from home fans. The stadium announcer called for the abuse to stop, saying the game would otherwise be abandoned. Arda were fined \u20ac18,000. \u201cI was warming up when I was racially abused by the Arda fans, so that was quite difficult,\u201d Solomon-Otabor says. \u201cI keep getting abusive messages, which is not nice. A fan told me to go home and I can\u2019t say the words that he said.\u201d</p> <p>Solomon-Otabor spends much of his free time at home in Sofia because of the regularity of the abuse, focusing on training and playing before returning to his flat for the remainder of the day. Although he has not suffered racism while out in the city, Solomon-Otabor does not want to put himself at risk.</p> <p>\u201cThe hardest part is that I am alone. I\u2019ve not lived in another country before and not feeling too comfortable when being out because of what happened to me on the pitch. That is the most difficult thing. I tend to just keep to myself and stay at home.</p> <p>\u201cI have had no problems on the streets or anything like that. I think it\u2019s just a mental thing; it\u2019s just how it is. In the club everyone is fantastic. It\u2019s a great club with great history. Everyone at the club is proud of it and really respect the club, so it\u2019s massive to them. Everyone is nice and welcoming but there are stupid people who ruin these things, which is not nice for a young boy coming from England. I have never gone through something like this where you do not feel comfortable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39e2dd64a131bfa7a399bbcaae58dde112554686\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39e2dd64a131bfa7a399bbcaae58dde112554686/0_7_1712_1027/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s manager, Gareth Southgate, speaks to the referee during the qualifier in Bulgaria that was halted because of racism last October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s manager, Gareth Southgate, speaks to the referee during the qualifier in Bulgaria that was halted because of racism last October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Solomon-Otabor feels he has become a target for locals regardless of his attitude or performance. Insults via social media have included being called the N-word and being sent monkey emojis. As a black English player in Bulgaria, it appears he has become the target for those looking to avenge the punishment that followed the Euro 2020 qualifier.</p> <p>\u201cI get sent silly, racial messages on Facebook. I try not to look any more. There are ones when they message you, you open the request and see a message and think: \u2018Here we go.\u2019 Now I just block them and move on.\u201d</p> <p>CSKA Sofia have offered constant support to Solomon-Otabor. In a statement in December they said: \u201cWe stand firmly behind our football player Viv Solomon-Otabor, who has been attacked and insulted on this basis in our recent matches.\u201d The club, however, were fined \u20ac19,000 at the start of March for their fans racially abusing the Tsarko Sofia midfielder Dylan Bahamboula during a match.</p> <p>Coming back from Singapore was supposed to be a time of celebration for Solomon-Otabor, having proved his bold decision to head to Bulgaria had paid dividends by earning international recognition. To be part of a group facing Brazil was a career highlight, even if he failed to make it off the bench.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt was surreal to be in the squad and in training.

I assume another opportunity will come. Obviously, seeing world-class players like Neymar and Coutinho, alongside talented youngsters like Jesus and Casemiro, it was a very exciting moment for me personally and a very proud moment for my family.\u201d</p> <p>In Bulgaria, as in most places, things are on hold but Solomon-Otabor is aiming to refocus on football soon enough. \u201cMy hopes now are just to continue working hard to play and to see what happens. I just want to progress and go higher.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A new national wildlife charity called Heal Rewilding is planning to buy ecologically depleted land across Britain and give it back to nature.</p> <p>The charity, which launches on Monday, is crowdfunding and will seek former farms, green belt or lower-grade land where wildlife can recover. The sites will be within easy reach of large towns and cities to benefit more people.</p> <p>Heal intends to let the land recover naturally rather than by planting nursery-grown trees.</p> <p>The charity\u2019s chair, Jan Stannard, said the launch followed two years of research and would go ahead despite the coronavirus crisis and any related economic hardship, insisting there was no time to delay in tackling the UK\u2019s continuing wildlife declines.</p> <p>\u201cWe face a brutal environment, but we are resilient,\u201d she said. \u201cNature cannot wait. Everywhere I look, I see absence of wildlife. But each one of our sites will help hundreds of species.\u201d</p> <p>The initial \u00a37m, 500-acre project will be in the southern English lowlands on a site yet to be announced, avoiding wildlife-rich land. The site will grow wild from its seed bank, animal seed dispersal or by spreading seeds from nearby land.</p> <p>Similar to the Knepp estate in West Sussex, Heal will reintroduce semi-wild grazers such as pigs, ponies, longhorn cattle and deer to sustain a mosaic of grassland, scrub, wooded areas and possibly wetland zones that will together support a richer mix of species. They will also provide education and accommodation.</p> <p>\u201cWe urgently need everyone together to help make nature\u2019s recovery happen,\u201d said Stannard. \u201cOur sites will be places where wildlife can return and thrive, but they will also become sanctuaries for people. Our vision is to heal the land, heal nature and heal ourselves.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Their aim fits in with <a href=\"http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/6105140258144256\">the government\u2019s Nature Recovery Network</a>, a pledge to support thousands more acres of land becoming wildlife reservoirs.</p> <p>There has been <a href=\"https://ecohustler.com/nature/the-race-to-rewild/\">a surge in public interest in wildlife habitat creation</a> in recent months<em>.</em></p> <p>The RSPB\u2019s director for conservation, Martin Harper, welcomed Heal\u2019s plan: \u201cWith <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/03/populations-of-uks-most-important-wildlife-have-plummeted-since-1970\">15% of UK species at threat of extinction</a>, our incredible wildlife needs all the help it can get. Nature habitats provide amazing benefits for people too.\u201d</p> <p>However a National Farmers\u2019 Union spokesperson questioned where enough spare land could be found: \u201cRewilding vast tracts of British farmland would mean reducing UK food production and importing food from other parts of the world, potentially produced to standards that would be illegal to produce here in the UK. Any broad scale changes to farmland in the UK need to be properly thought through.\u201d</p> <p>The Friends of the Earth trees campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: \u201cA wilder green belt filled with trees, scrub, and wildlife is precisely what the UK needs. It would reconnect more city-dwellers with nature and help fix the climate and ecological emergencies.</p> <p>\u201cRewilding is an inspirational idea, but risks becoming pigeon-holed as something only wealthy landowners in remote locations can afford. It\u2019s great that new organisations are springing up to show we can also bring nature back to our doorsteps, using crowdfunding to tap into public enthusiasm for restoring lost species.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The tragic effects of our battle with the novel coronavirus are seemingly endless. But arguably the most mind-blowing is this: the very pandemic that threatens to infect and kill millions is simultaneously causing many to also lose their health coverage at their gravest time of need.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how: the virus has caused a public health crisis so severe that people have been forced to stay home, causing businesses to shutter and lay off workers. And with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/30/20891305/health-care-employer-sponsored-premiums-cost-voxcare\">roughly half of Americans</a> getting their health insurance from their employer, these layoffs mean not only losing their income but also their medical coverage. In other words, just as our need for medical care skyrockets in the face of a global pandemic, fewer will have health insurance or be able to afford it. According to one recent report, the cost of treatment for Covid-19 <a href=\"https://time.com/5806312/coronavirus-treatment-cost/\">can run around $35,000</a>. As the patient in the report exclaimed: \u201cI was pretty sticker-shocked. I personally don\u2019t know anybody who has that kind of money.\u201d</p> <p>So, how did we get to such a dire place? Many will sadly lose their jobs over the coming weeks \u2013 with one estimate projecting <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/488924-st-louis-fed-chair-says-us-unemployment-rate-could-hit-30-percent\">as many as 30%</a>. And as they do, Americans are about to learn something horrifying: how irrational and irresponsible it is for so many to be dependent on employers for health insurance. Take it from me. I\u2019m a former health insurance executive who once profited from this system. It\u2019s time for it to stop.</p> <p>America needs to finally get out of the business of linking health coverage to job status. Even in better times, this arrangement was a bad idea from a health perspective. Most Americans whose families depend on their employers for coverage are just a layoff away from being uninsured. And now, when many businesses are shutting down and considering layoffs, it\u2019s a public health disaster. Across the country we\u2019re seeing reports of layoffs in almost all industries. As we approach a global recession, some analysts suggest that a million or more US workers will lose their jobs in April alone. Consider what this means for health care in this country.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen this before. During the last big recession, researchers at Cornell University found that 9.3 million Americans <a href=\"https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2011/12/economists-9-million-lost-health-insurance-recession\">lost their health insurance</a> between 2007 and 2009. Why? As people lost work, their employer-provided insurance went away. During this time, roughly six in 10 Americans who lost their jobs <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/insurance/millions-lost-health-insurance-recession-few-replaced-it-12789627\">became uninsured</a>. And this problem compounds itself. If the reason you lost your health insurance is that you no longer have steady employment, how are you now going to be able to afford monthly premiums for some other private health care plan? This problem becomes particularly acute when you consider that premiums for health plans sold on exchanges are projected to soar, as well, due to \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ab_ibarra/status/1242160479193026560?s=21\">unexpected Covid-19 costs</a>\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that even in good times, the employer-based model fails to cover enough of us, with the number of Americans covered through an employer steadily dropping in general. Since 1999, the percentage of those with job-based coverage has <a href=\"https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/long-term-trends-in-employer-based-coverage/\">declined by nine points</a>. And it most certainly will drop like a rock in the coming weeks and months.</p> <p>It\u2019s now clear that this system cannot handle our current reality. With so many Americans sadly on the verge of unemployment, the number that will lose health coverage will be crushing. As we rebuild our country\u2019s economic base and reimagine the roles various industries play in our new future, we must also begin a difficult conversation about health care. If we\u2019re dependent on jobs in order to have it, a lot of us will be left out in the cold. And at a time in our nation\u2019s history where more will need quality care than ever before, the human cost will simply be too much to bear.</p> <ul> <li><p>Wendell Potter, a former vice-president for corporate communications at Cigna, is president of Business for Medicare for All</p></li> </ul>",

Yet our economy today is dramatically different from that of the early 20th century.</p> <p>American goods and services are reliant on the output of other countries around the world, whose production is in turn dependent on the output of still other nations, and so on. We can\u2019t successfully put American companies back to work unless other countries simultaneously do the same with their domestic industries.</p> <p>Production of US automobiles, for example, simply won\u2019t be feasible until <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2020/03/06/coronavirus-covid-auto-parts-supply-chain-china/4964022002/\">nations that produce required components</a> also reopen. And if US automakers can\u2019t source the materials they need for domestic production, related service companies \u2013 like marketing firms \u2013 won\u2019t have much work, either. If marketing companies have little to market, online advertising giants such as Google and Facebook will in turn see limited revenues.</p> <p>Our global economy is remarkably <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/global-value-chains.htm\">interconnected</a>. Pull out an important thread, and the whole tapestry of our production system <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-20/a-covid-19-supply-chain-shock-born-in-china-is-going-global\">unravels</a>.</p> <p>This economic interdependence necessitates all parts working in harmony. Unfortunately, the pandemic is asynchronous \u2013 it hits countries at different times with different rates of growth and severity. While China is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-autos-parts/as-one-of-chinas-detroits-reopens-worlds-automakers-worry-about-disruptions-idUSKBN20V14J\">reopening</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52024239\">India</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/opinion/coronavirus-trump-lockdown.html\">US</a> are shuttering. If portions of Chinese production require unavailable intermediate goods from India or the US, such production won\u2019t be possible. Even if China can produce items for export, if their normal buyers in the US are closed, who will they sell to? And what happens when China \u2013 still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/chinas-premier-warns-local-officials-not-to-cover-up-new-covid-19-cases-as-hubei-reopens\">lacking herd immunity</a> \u2013 needs to close its economy again right when India or the US are looking to reopen and use Chinese inputs?</p> <p>The staggered nature of the virus outbreak coupled with worldwide production presents a <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/simchi-levi-supply-chain-covid-19-0325\">remarkable</a> \u2013 and quite possibly insurmountable \u2013 global coordination problem. Globalized on-demand supply chains simply aren\u2019t well suited for a worldwide pandemic.</p> <h2><strong>Political hurdles</strong></h2> <p>The economic argument for reopening US production assumes that it would be broadly socially acceptable to sacrifice the lives of Americans to save our economy \u2013 and that politicians will therefore be willing to pursue it. We suspect, to the contrary, that premature reopening will soon be revealed as political suicide.</p> <p>Once the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-12/grim-toll-of-virus-deaths-will-get-worse-even-as-outbreak-wanes\">lag in deaths</a> catches up to the exponentially increasing number of cases in the US, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/03/24/covid-19-italian-priest-who-donated-his-ventilator-has-reportedly-died/2906351001/\">myriad</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/coronavirus-deaths-united-states.html\">heart-wrenching</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/coronavirus-death-brooklyn-school-principal.html\">stories</a> of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/coronavirus-georgia-mom-who-worked-hospital-found-dead-home-her-n1168386\">the</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-woman-21-with-no-health-issues-dies-from-covid-19-family-say\">lives</a> of those lost will ensue.

Before the virus arrives, it can seem abstract, distant and even unthreatening to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/world/asia/coronavirus-risk-interpreter.html\">an</a> <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762386\">uncritical</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect\">or</a> <a href=\"https://qz.com/1812664/the-psychology-of-coronavirus-fear-and-how-to-overcome-it/\">untrained</a> eye. Yet its speed and severity take many by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-italy-lessons-countries-crisis-information\">surprise</a> as it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/820009377/italy-witnesses-relentless-rise-in-covid-19-deaths\">rapidly</a> runs through communities. The marked difference between expectations and reality exacts a heavy psychological toll.</p> <p>Once the coronavirus touches citizens\u2019 lives, they are quite <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gates-on-trump-call-for-quick-end-to-lockdown-its-tough-to-tell-people-keep-going-to-restaurants-go-buy-new-houses-ignore-that-pile-of-bodies-over-in-the-corner-2020-03-24\">unlikely</a> to immediately switch back into status-quo behavior. Even if officials were to remove restrictions on movement and social gatherings, we suspect most people will continue to limit non-essential outings. How many residents of <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-they-call-it-the-apocalypse-inside-italys-hardest-hit-hospital-11960597\">Bergamo, Italy</a>, want to spend time in crowded shops or restaurants right now? Our guess is: very, very few. If you knew coronavirus was still ravaging your city, would you head out to the barber shop or go to a concert?</p> <p>Many normal activities, from the enjoyable to the mundane, now produce some level of anxiety. That association won\u2019t be undone overnight, and fear is a remarkably powerful deterrent to economic activity.</p> <p>So, should we restart our economy while the virus is still rapidly spreading? Regardless of whether it\u2019s a necessary evil or a terrible atrocity of an idea, we probably can\u2019t.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://nickobradovich.com/\">Dr Nick Obradovich</a> is a PhD political and data scientist who trained at UCSD, the Harvard Kennedy School, and the MIT Media Lab.

Getting the sewing machine out, with YouTube videos to hand, and mending or altering clothes. Listening to podcasts while also doing some mindfulness colouring, or Zentangle that I have newly discovered.</p> <p>Evening is cooking and TV with my husband like any regular evening, but maybe now we\u2019ll play some card games to shake it up. Making sure I get up early and go to bed at a reasonable time like I would for work is really important, I am trying really hard not to fall into the bad habits of late sleeping and hours of TV like I\u2019ve done in the past during periods of unemployment.

Current easterly winds are bringing additional pollution from continental Europe to Britain.</p> <p>The data shows drops in tiny particle pollution of a third to a half in London, Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff, falls of about quarter in Manchester, York and Belfast, with smaller declines in Glasgow and Newcastle. For nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution, the data also shows declines of a third to a half in London, Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff, and drops of 10-20% in the other cities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-26T16:43:36/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Particulate matter pollution graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/mar/2020-03-26T16:43:36/embed.html\">Particulate matter pollution graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Air quality improvements have been seen in nations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\">around the world from Italy to China</a>, as much transport and industry has ground to a halt.

Lee also compared the period after the outbreak with the average of the same period over the last five years. Both comparisons showed large cuts in pollution.</p> <p>The analysis is preliminary as full calibration of the data takes time, but Lee said it was very clear there had been a significant fall in pollution. The biggest factor is the reduction in road traffic, as other contributors such as gas power station operations, heating for buildings and emissions from farms are unlikely to have changed overall.</p> <p>One pollutant \u2013 ozone \u2013 has risen. This is because chemical interactions in the air normally result in NO2 and small particles reducing ozone levels. So as they have fallen, ozone has risen.

  "<p>Netflix was supposed to be the great democratizer. The streaming platform\u2019s most ardent fans have argued in its favor as a level playing field, instantaneously providing a global audience of millions to smaller independent films that would otherwise never reach them. Critics of the service\u2019s business model have posited that dropping little-known films into such a vast library with little-to-no marketing or promotion would damn those titles to an obscurity even more severe. Just one of the cases in point for the latter school of thought: The World Is Yours by Romain Gavras, a sly crime comedy that Netflix acquired for the US after a positive premiere at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, then allowed to languish for six months before unceremoniously dumping it into the unending sea of content (it\u2019s available on Amazon Prime in the UK). The release hardly made a blip that December, and in the year-and-change since, its reputation hasn\u2019t grown much.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/25/the-shining-ive-never-seen-kubrick\">I've never seen \u2026\u00a0The Shining</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a grave injustice that should be easily remedied, seeing as Gavras follows in a popular tradition of roundly, generously enjoyable gangster mischief. There\u2019s a little Scorsese and a little Ritchie in his fleet-footed stylizing, which whisks audiences through a caper and its attendant double-crosses with a roving, restless camera. Gavras comes from the world of music videos (he directed the nine-minute clip for M.I.A.\u2019s Born Free, in which riot troopers carry out a genocide against redheads), and applies many of the same techniques to long-form narrative. But where many talents making that creative migration in the past have hidden behind slow-mo, format changes and other slickness \u2013 \u201clike a music video\u201d still gets the occasional workout as a stock critical diss \u2013 Gavras folds it all into a story with the substance to justify its sumptuous flash.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZqfRKKZYfc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AZqfRKKZYfc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Kind and merciful, Far\u00e8s (Karim Leklou, his round face perfectly non-threatening) doesn\u2019t belong in the criminal demimonde, and he knows it. He\u2019s finally set up the job that he hopes will provide him with enough seed money to go legit as the chief provider of ice pops to the Maghreb region of north Africa, and to reject the life of ruthlessness foisted on him by his ice-cold mother (Isabelle Adjani). She\u2019s just one of the unstable quantities trifling with Far\u00e8s\u2019s plan, an ensemble including an Illuminati conspiracy-monger, a rage-prone Scotsman, his eight-year-old daughter and a pair of trigger-happy idiots with Tony Montana fantasies that lend the film its title. You know at least part of the drill; no one can be trusted, things go wrong and yet there\u2019s something unexpected and satisfying about who gets to clinch their happy ending, and how.</p> <p>A spiky political subtext also sneaks up on a viewer while they\u2019re busy chuckling at the gallows humor. (The aforementioned morons get the bleakest laugh when one imagines killing their boss and retiring in luxury together, then the other immediately envisions the same scenario frame by frame, except he also shoots his partner and keeps the loot for himself.) Much of Far\u00e8s\u2019s scheme hinges on the xenophobia against Muslims and African immigrants currently festering in France and Spain. The climactic heist plays something like a well-told joke, its punchline being that the gang-averse Spanish police can be readily manipulated into action with even the faintest whiff of terrorist activity.</p> <p>In another world, this would be something of an event on the international cinema circuit, between its high-wattage cast (Adjani and co-star Vincent Cassel rank as two of the bigger names in France\u2019s industry) and Gavras\u2019s instinct for crowd-pleasing. He does everything bombastically; he likes musical interludes, whether that\u2019s a karaoke rendition of Toto\u2019s Africa or clutch soundtracking from the of-the-moment electronic virtuoso Jamie xx. His major set pieces \u2013 a boatjacking that ends in flame, a bomb scare at a water park \u2013 have a zest and ambition absent from many film-makers of his relative greenness. It\u2019s just the sort of hidden treasure an adventurous watcher would\u2019ve once picked up at a video store, or wandered into at an arthouse theater. It\u2019s much harder to stumble upon in the endless scroll of the streaming format; until a better system devises itself, we\u2019ll have to pick up the slack of spreading the word.</p> <ul> <li><p>The World Is Yours is available on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UK</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The fight to ban plastic bags, many of which end up polluting oceans and rivers, has taken a step backward as conservative US think-tanks exploit the fear of Covid-19, campaigners have said.</p> <p>Articles warning that reusable tote bags are worse than plastic ones for spreading coronavirus have been linked to major rightwing nonprofits such as the Manhattan Institute, and contain misinformation aimed at defeating or repealing plastic bag bans, said Greenpeace USA.</p> <p>The effort \u201crisks further confusion\u201d amid a global public health crisis, it said.</p> <p>Recent studies have found that Covid-19 could be stable on plastic and steel for <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?query=featured_home\">up to three days</a>, compared with 24 hours for cardboard and four hours for copper. The studies have not examined how long the virus remained on tote bags and there is little scientific evidence comparing reusable bags with plastic.</p> <p> Last week a number of US states and cities nevertheless took the decision to roll back plastic bag bans, citing the coronavirus. Maine repealed its ban. The governor of New Hampshire went further by issuing an order banning reusable bags, saying they risk spreading coronavirus. The governor of Massachusetts banned reusable bags and lifted plastic bag bans. And New York state, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/01/new-york-plastic-bag-ban-starts\">implemented its plastic bag ban</a> on 1 March, will <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/governor-bans-reusable-shopping-bags-10-new-coronavirus-cases-reported-in-nh/ar-BB11w3nC\">delay enforcement</a> until June.</p> <p>The moves follow articles by researchers at the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) \u2013 a libertarian nonprofit instrumental in persuading the Trump administration to abandon the Paris climate agreement \u2013 suggesting reusable grocery bags are riskier than plastic, and in a journal published by the Manhattan Institute suggesting sustainable bags can carry viruses for up to nine days.</p> <p>While nonprofits are not required to disclose their donors, both have reportedly received money from fossil fuel companies. Among the sponsors for a CEI gala last year were the Charles Koch Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers association, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/climate/nyt-climate-newsletter-cei.html?auth=login-facebook\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Greenpeace USA criticised the Manhattan Institute and the CEI for a series of articles suggesting that reusable bags are a higher risk for transmitting coronavirus than plastic bags, misrepresenting recent research that shows the virus survives at least as long on plastic.</p> <p>Such misinformation is already being used to lobby state legislatures to defeat or repeal plastic bag ban legislation, it said.</p> <p>John Hocevar, Greenpeace USA\u2019s oceans campaigner, condemned what he described as industry groups that have \u201cseen the crisis as an opportunity to exploit people\u2019s fears around Covid-19 to push their pro-pollution agendas\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEven in the short term, plastic does not inherently make something clean and safe, and we should not confuse corporate public relations with factual medical research,\u201d Hocevar said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11b67b5579d63120dc8eeba7e42fdd3a19625d29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b67b5579d63120dc8eeba7e42fdd3a19625d29/0_0_5165_3098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio distributes reusable bags in Union Square Park on 28 February 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York was the third US state to outlaw non-biodegradable carrier bags, but the ban is yet to be enforced.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similar moves are under way in Britain, where the environment secretary, George Eustice, has waived the 5p charge on plastic bags for supermarket shoppers online. Eustice said it was a temporary measure aimed at reducing potential cross-infection between delivery workers and those in isolation, and to speed up deliveries.</p> <p>Plans to further reduce single-use plastic, under the environment bill, have been put on hold due to Covid-19.</p> <p>The timing of the Welsh government\u2019s plans to restrict single-use plastics is also under review, it told the Guardian.</p> <p>In the US, the misinformation campaign against reusable bags ramped up after two recent studies. The first, from the University of California, published last month in the Journal of Hospital Infection, reported that viruses similar to Covid-19 could remain on plastic for up to nine days. The <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?query=featured_home\">second</a>, published on 17 March in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that Covid-19 could be stable on plastic for up to three days. The viruses could be inactivated by disinfection. Neither study examined reusable bags.</p> <p>However, the day after the first study was published, the Plastics Industry Association wrote to the US Department for Health and Human Services, urging the government to make a pronouncement supporting single-use plastic. The association claimed \u201cstudy after study\u201d showed reusable bags to be a health risk. It did not mention the University of California study.</p> <p>Then on 12 March, the City Journal, published by the MI, ran an article claiming: \u201cThe \u2018sustainable\u2019 bags that environmentalists and politicians have been so eager to impose on the public \u2026 can sustain the Covid-19 and flu viruses and spread the virus throughout the store.\u201d</p> <p>The piece, headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/banning-single-use-plastic-bags-covid-19\">Greening our way to infection</a>\u201d and written by John Tierney, cites unnamed research that Tierney claims showed viruses and bacteria can survive on tote bags for nine days. It offers no evidence to back this claim \u2013 in fact, it links to a study showing viruses <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/how-long-coronavirus-last-surfaces.html\">can remain on plastic for nine days</a>.</p> <p>The piece also quotes <a href=\"https://www.neha.org/node/60021\">a 2018 study</a> published in the Journal of Environmental Health where researchers found traces of a surrogate virus on surfaces and the hands of shoppers and store staff high enough \u201cto risk transmission\u201d. They recommended in-store hand hygiene and washing reuseable bags. They did not compare the risk of reusable bags with new plastic bags.</p> <p>Another piece by Tierney, with a similar argument, appeared in the New York Post entitled \u201cUsing tote bags instead of plastic could help spread coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Washington Examiner published a piece by Angela Logomasini of the Competitive Enterprise Institute on 18 March, a day after the New England Journal of Medicine study, headlined: \u201cPlastic bag bans aren\u2019t helping us fight against coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>Logomasini quotes the same 2018 study as Tierney, as well as a 2011 study on reusable and plastic bags that looked at bacteria, not viruses, and was partly funded by the American Chemistry Council.</p> <p>Ivy Schlegel, a researcher at Greenpeace USA, said: \u201cThis is a classic PR tactic. After new studies showing Covid-19 lasts longer on plastic, they have pulled back into their bag of tricks to redeploy old studies, linking them to legitimate public fear of the coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>Hocevar said: \u201cThe truth is that we don\u2019t have all of the answers to this Covid-19 emergency yet, and for industry to use this as an opportunity to increase profits for the fossil fuel and plastics sectors is dangerous and irresponsible.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we do know is that there is no substitute for strict hygiene. Just because a material is made from single-use plastic does not make it less likely to transmit viral infections during use; in fact, plastic surfaces appear to allow coronaviruses to remain infectious for particularly long periods compared to other materials.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe decisions we make for our families in this health crisis should be based on science and the advice of medical professionals, not lobbyists for the fossil fuel and plastics industries.

  "<p>Land-clearing approvals in New South Wales have increased nearly 13-fold since the Coalition government relaxed laws in 2016, according to a secret report to the state cabinet by its Natural Resources Commission.</p> <p>The report, marked \u201cCabinet in Confidence\u201d, was commissioned by the government in January 2019 under an agreement between the Liberals and Nationals to review land clearing if applications exceeded 20,000ha a year.

The government had promised to protect between two and four times as much land as it cleared, but had failed to do that in the majority of the state.</p> <p>It also highlighted the lack of an effective monitoring and compliance regime to ensure laws were enforced. In a six-month stretch between August 2017 and January 2018 there was 7,100ha of unexplained land clearing. It was 60% of the clearing in that time.</p> <p>Field said it was \u201cunacceptable and unforgivable\u201d that the government had held back a report that showed land clearing was continuing at record rates while posing a risk to biodiversity across the state. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that, in the current Covid-19 crisis, unacceptable rates of land clearing are going to continue unabated and without enforcement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Nature Conservation Council of NSW said the report showed the National party was incompetent.

One of those is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/05/a-room-of-ones-own-writers-virginia-woolf-creativity\" title=\"\">Asheham House, near Beddingham, which Virginia and Leonard Woolf</a> rented in 1912, before they bought Monk\u2019s House, in nearby Rodmell, in 1919. Leonard aptly described it as \u201cromantic, gentle, melancholy, lovely\u201d. When we visited in the autumn, the trees around this remote and austerely beautiful house, with its elegant Gothic windows, were bare and echoing with the raucous calls of rooks. Locals had told Virginia that Asheham was haunted and it became the subject of her story \u201cThe Haunted House\u201d.</p> <p>Woolf\u2019s biographer, Hermione Lee, visited Asheham in 1993, the year before it was demolished. By then it was deserted and boarded up and she \u201csnuffed up the atmosphere of silence, decay, and forlorn beauty\u201d. Lee admits that of all Woolf\u2019s homes, this is the one that \u201chaunts me most\u201d.</p> <p>Together with her fellow life-writer Kate Kennedy, Lee has co-edited a rich and eclectic collection of essays about the role houses play in people\u2019s lives and our fascination with the homes of our creative heroes.

Our motivation is often confused: \u201ca mixture of awe, longing, desire for inwardness, and intrusive curiosity\u201d. Indeed, the reality is often deeply disappointing, as Keats discovered when visiting the birthplace of Robert Burns: \u201cO the flummery of a birth place! Cant! Cant! Cant!\u201d</p> <p> Although most current owners are welcoming and even proud of the literary associations of their homes, some are not. When Lee visited Talland House in Cornwall \u2013 Woolf\u2019s much-loved childhood summer house \u2013 the then owner was far from pleased to see yet another of the novelist\u2019s acolytes on his doorstep. He told her that when he bought the house he had \u201cnever heard of the bloody woman\u201d. Now, he complained, \u201cevery time you turn round, there are Americans in the living room! Australians in the bathroom!\u201d</p> <p>The fascination with the homes of literary and other luminaries is not new. Robert Douglas-Fairhurst describes how in the late 19th century there was an atmosphere of \u201cliterary stalking and door-stepping\u201d from which the Poet Laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson, suffered more than most. On one of his regular walks he took flight at the sight of what he thought was a crowd of fans advancing on him, only to discover it was in fact a flock of sheep. But even Tennyson was not immune from the fascination, and once visited the \u201clow dark room\u201d that had been Goethe\u2019s \u201csacred study\u201d. In his poetry however, he rebelled against the sentimental Victorian idea of home, and Douglas-Fairhurst detects a desire to \u201cwrite poems that stop us feeling too much at home\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2015/may/04/temples-of-literature-writers-houses-in-pictures\">Temples of literature: writers' houses \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her essay, Elleke Boehmer looks beyond conventional ideas about \u201cplace, home, writing and belonging\u201d. For a time in 1976, after his rustication from New College for various misdemeanours, the Zimbabwean writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jan/07/survey-short-story-dambudzo-marechera\" title=\"\">Dambudzo Marechera</a> lived in a tent beside the Thames on Oxford\u2019s Port Meadow. It was in this bucolic setting that Marechera, a \u201cthin young black man, his hair in short spirals, sitting cross-legged within the tent\u2019s open flap\u201d, typed drafts of the stories that became <em>The House of Hunger</em> (1978), for which he won the Guardian fiction prize. A migrant author who became one of Zimbabwe\u2019s greatest post-independence writers, Marechera was \u201chomeless both actually and in terms of a national tradition to call his own\u201d, reshaping the landscape of African literature with his \u201csophisticated, intertextual, wayward\u201d writing.</p> <p>WB Yeats only ever owned one house outright: the tower house at Ballylee, near Gort, County Galway. Yeats described it as an \u201cold square castle\u201d. It was derelict, with no roof and prone to flooding. But his poetic education had been full of towers in which lonely scholars wrote by candlelight and where, as Roy Foster says, \u201ctragic princesses were immured\u201d. Ezra Pound scorned such romantic notions, describing it as a \u201cphallic symbol on the bogs \u2013 Ballyphallus or whatever he calls it with a river on the first floor\u201d.</p> <p>Yeats bought it in May 1917, together with two cottages and some land, for \u00a335. The restoration of his \u201cCastle\u201d took several years and he loved the process of using historic materials. His 1928 collection, <em>The Tower</em>, has an exquisite illustration of it on the cover by Sturge Moore. This Romantic tower-house \u201cinspired some of Yeats\u2019s greatest poems\u201d, allowing him to explore his \u201crelation to the violent past and the unknown future\u201d. Declared a National Monument in the 1960s, Seamus Heaney called it \u201ca sacramental site\u201d. Still prone to flooding, it is, Foster says, \u201cas atmospheric as ever\u201d, and a potent monument to Yeats\u2019s unique sensibility.</p> <p>In this collection there are two wonderful pieces on WH Auden. The first is by Seamus Perry on Auden\u2019s New York apartment, at 77 St Mark\u2019s Place on the Lower East Side, to which he moved with his partner Chester Kallman in February 1954. He stayed there until 1972, \u201cmaking it his longest single habitation\u201d. The chaos in which Auden lived was famous. A friend recalled his rooms being littered with \u201cempty bottles, used martini glasses, books, papers, phonograph records\u201d. Stravinsky once said \u201che is the dirtiest man I have ever liked\u201d. When Edmund Wilson reproached him for this, Auden responded: \u201cI hate living in squalor \u2013 I detest it! \u2013 but I can\u2019t do the work I want to do and live any other way.\u201d</p> <p>In 1958, Auden bought a house (the only one he ever owned) in the sleepy and provincial Austrian village of Kirchstetten. His decision to do so was, Sandra Mayer says, \u201cone of the quirkier turns in literary history\u201d. He spent the last 15 summers of his life there. It was \u201can environment that must have seemed both mind-bogglingly alien and alienating\u201d. Yet Auden felt at home in this unlikely location, an hour from Vienna in his yellow VW Beetle (once used by one of his lovers in a series of robberies). Although he attended Catholic Sunday mass, he did not try to fit into village life. But the villagers respected \u201cHerr Professor\u201d and turned a blind eye to his and Kallman\u2019s lifestyle \u201cwhich included regular visits from Greek boyfriends, Viennese rent boys, and petty criminals\u201d.</p> <p>The sequence of poems \u201cThanksgiving for a Habitat\u201d, included in his 1965 collection <em>About the House</em>, explores each room of the house, from the study to the privy. In it Auden revealed that finding a house that unexpectedly became a home occasionally moved him to \u201ctears of gratitude and surprise\u201d: \u201cWhat I dared not hope or fight for / is, in my fifties, mine: a toft-and-croft / where I needn\u2019t, ever, be at home to / those I am not at home with.\u201d Now his house at Hinterholz 6 is owned by the community and is a museum to Auden, drawing visitors from around the world to see where he composed his poems.</p> <p>In his study \u2013 or \u201cCave of Making\u201d, as he called it \u2013 is his Olivetti Portable and a letter by him to the Austrian tax authorities, \u201cwhich is really a veiled theory of poetry and reveals Auden\u2019s sharp intellect and brittle humour\u201d. Auden is buried near the home he loved, his grave marked by a simple iron cross and a plaque: \u201cW. H.

The US Congress has just voted for a $2tn stimulus package. The UK has had four big budget announcements in little more than two weeks. The eurozone has abandoned fiscal austerity and embraced a \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach.</p> \n<p>By contrast, Africa is living off scraps. The World Bank has announced $14bn of financial support; the International Monetary Fund has a war-chest of $10bn available for countries in difficulties through a rapid response fund.

Africa, it is said, is too warm for Covid-19 and its young population will be able to cope with the pandemic without the death rates seen in countries with a higher proportion of old people, such as Italy. Neither argument really stacks up. The number of cases in Florida suggests that Covid-19 can spread where the weather is hot; and being young in Africa is not the same as being healthy. Malnutrition and malaria are rife: the coronavirus kills through viral pneumonia and 400,000 African children die from pneumonia every year.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The priority is to use the small window of opportunity to prepare sub-Saharan Africa for a health emergency</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The warning signs are clear.

There are shortages, not just of ventilators but of more basic kit such as medical oxygen. Africa is not equipped to cope with a public health emergency and it is now a race against time to prevent the pandemic taking hold. What\u2019s more, what happens in Africa will have global implications. There is little point in developed countries sorting out their own problems only to find that the virus is reimported from Africa, as it almost certainly would be.</p> \n<p>To prevent this from happening, testing needs to be rapidly scaled up, the relatively small number of people infected need to be isolated and their contacts traced. Shortages of diagnostic equipment, medical staff and medical oxygen have to be addressed.</p> \n<p>There is, though, not the remotest prospect of the world\u2019s poorest region being able to do this on its own. Low-income African countries are seeing demand for their exports collapse as a result of simultaneous recessions in the world\u2019s three biggest markets \u2013 China, the US and the eurozone. Many of them are already struggling with high levels of debt and \u2013 unlike in developed countries \u2013 the option of borrowing more money to invest in health systems doesn\u2019t exist. In the west, states can borrow at historically low interest rates; for indebted low-income countries rates are punitively high, and rising.</p> \n<p>So what needs to be done? First, the rich developed nations have to realise that Africa\u2019s looming crisis will eventually be their crisis. Second, there needs to be a coordinated international response rather than the current mishmash of funding commitments and initiatives, which lack any real coherence. The World Health Organization should identify what is needed in each country and the IMF and World Bank should provide the necessary resources. This is going to require the leadership the UK showed in 2005 but doesn\u2019t any longer, and a lot more money.</p> \n<p>While welcome, the scaling up of financial support seen so far is not remotely commensurate with the scale of the threat. The World Bank needs extra resources to be able to deliver support through soft loans and grants. The IMF needs to be able to respond to the biggest flight of capital from developing countries on record by issuing new special drawing rights. These are reserve assets that increase the amount of money flowing round the global economy and provide member states with extra protection against speculative attack.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/25/africa-leads-calls-for-debt-relief-in-face-of-coronavirus-crisis\">Africa leads calls for debt relief in face of coronavirus crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Together, the World Bank and the IMF need a comprehensive debt-relief plan, rather than the limited scheme announced this week. This would involve the debts owed to all governments, including the large sums owed to China, and repayments on money borrowed from the World Bank and the IMF. Measures to prevent private investors from preying on indebted countries are also required.</p> \n<p>The priority is to use the small window of opportunity to prepare sub-Saharan Africa for a health emergency. Beyond that, the fiscal response should involve strengthening health systems and targeting resources at those who need them most through cash transfers. Africa needs redistribution more than it needs helicopter drops of money.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s certain is that financial help needs to arrive and arrive soon. Otherwise the world is sleepwalking to catastrophe.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Larry Elliott is Guardian economics editor</p>",
  "<p>Millions of people in the UK will need food aid in the coming days, food charities are warning, as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to quickly spiral into a crisis of hunger unless the government acts immediately to reinvent the way we feed ourselves.</p> <p>In just a few weeks, experts say, the pandemic has exposed the extraordinary fragility of the food system. And they worry whether it will withstand the growing pressures expected in the coming weeks and months.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DKrcpa8Z_E\">Supermarket distribution systems</a>, based on \u201cjust in time\u201d supply chains, are struggling to cope with a sudden surge in demand since Covid-19 took hold. The most pressing concern is finding a way to feed the country\u2019s most vulnerable and isolated people.</p> <p>Figures produced by the <a href=\"https://foodfoundation.org.uk/\">Food Foundation</a> using government statistics suggest some 17 million people fall into the higher risk category for coronavirus because they are elderly, have underlying health conditions, or are pregnant. At least 860,000 people in this category were already struggling to afford enough food before the crisis. And at least 1 million of them report always or often being lonely, and therefore may struggle to find people to deliver food to them.</p> <p>Anna Taylor, the Food Foundation\u2019s director, said that between 4 million and 7 million people in lower risk categories are also affected by severe food insecurity or loneliness, so having to self-isolate could tip them into crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThese numbers show the massive scale of the food aid challenge from Covid-19,\u201d she said. \u201cGovernment leadership to deliver a properly coordinated response with local authorities, charities and businesses is desperately needed.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, London, and a former government adviser, said ministers have worked on the assumption that feeding Britain can be left to the market and big retailers. While ministers have been in discussion with supermarket chief executives during the pandemic, Lang argues they are failing to grasp the structural weaknesses in the food system and the scale of food poverty.</p> <p>\u201cThe official line has been that it\u2019s all seamless and would be fine if only stupid consumers would stop panic buying. It is not,\u201d he said. \u201cThe just in time system is breaking. Government were only talking to a narrow range of people in industry rather than local authorities and community groups, who know where vulnerable people are.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2020/mar/26/delivering-food-parcels-craigend-glasgow-in-pictures\">Delivering food parcels, Craigend, Glasgow - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c79bce042fd239982b87c582d9fb6e79264f9368\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c79bce042fd239982b87c582d9fb6e79264f9368/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fare, an action group in Glasgow, has been delivering food parcels to vulnerable families and self-isolating elderly people.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fare, an action group in Glasgow, has been delivering food parcels to vulnerable families and self-isolating elderly people.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lang added: \u201cBorders are closing, lorries are being slowed down and checked. We only produce 53% of our own food in the UK. It\u2019s a failure of government to plan.\u201d</p> <p>In normal times, about 30% of calories are eaten outside the home each day, in restaurants, cafes and canteens. The lockdown has significantly increased the amount of food people are eating at home, most of which is sourced from supermarkets.</p> <p>Shortages have eased in recent days, but many products are still out of stock and supermarket shelves are unlikely to look the way they usually do for a long time.</p> <p>\u201cSome \u00a31bn extra food and groceries were bought by households in the last two to three weeks. That\u2019s like Christmas but worse because it\u2019s gone on for three times as long,\u201d said Andrew Opie, director of food at the <a href=\"http://www.brc.org.uk/?language=en-uk\">British Retail Consortium</a>, the supermarket trade association.</p> <p>The problem, Opie says, is \u201csheer logistics\u201d. There is food, but not the capacity in terms of trucks, drivers, packers and pickers in warehouses to deliver it faster. Supermarkets are recruiting thousands more workers, running trucks through what used to be curfew hours, and editing down their ranges so there is less choice. \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near a wartime economy but supermarkets will not look the way they did in 2019 [for the foreseeable future],\u201d Opie added.</p> <p>Supermarkets have built supply chains of immense complexity and sophistication over the last four decades, affording customers a choice of more than 40,000 lines from around the world \u2013 from dozens of different kinds of pasta to a permanent global summertime of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p> <p>They have done this by developing long international supply chains and keeping little actually in stock. Shelf space is constantly replenished from centralised distribution centres where, every 24 hours, thousands of products are trucked in from suppliers to be unloaded, reorganised, reloaded and sent out again to stores.</p> <p>The logistics are controlled by barcode scanning and complex algorithms, with little slack in the system, so a sudden rise in demand can be unmanageable.</p> <p>The consequences of a disrupted supply chain will be most acute for the millions in households whose incomes are so low that they have depended on food banks or free meals at school or in daycare centres, which have now closed.</p> <p>Local authorities and other food poverty organisations who want to step in to deliver food directly to vulnerable people have expressed frustration at the lack of clear guidance or funding from central government. They are calling for ministers to keep alternative networks to the supermarkets open, and to use the army if necessary to make sure food reaches people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5b65687ff7a5cc56084b109a541e34643091493\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5b65687ff7a5cc56084b109a541e34643091493/0_0_5040_3360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meat processors warn factories and supplies are at risk if staff go sick or into quarantine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meat processors warn factories and supplies are at risk if staff go sick or into quarantine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Morgan/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFood banks will not be able to cope with the extremely high level of need and are not the answer when people are being asked to minimise contact with others,\u201d said Kath Dalmeny, head of Sustain, the food and farming alliance. \u201cThe most important thing is for the government to staunch the flow of people needing food aid by giving low-income households money directly to buy it for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe may need the army to oversee biosecurity as caterers, for example in school kitchens, supply hubs and to enforce social distancing as people collect food from them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/major-new-measures-to-protect-people-at-highest-risk-from-coronavirus\"> </a>last weekend that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/major-new-measures-to-protect-people-at-highest-risk-from-coronavirus\">the government had identified some 1.5 million </a>people in England who were most vulnerable to Covid-19 and was advising them to stay at home at all times over the next 12 weeks, promising that military planners would be helping to set up a new system to deliver food to those who did not have family support.</p> <p>The first wave of food parcels is expected to go out soon to about 300,000 people identified from prescriptions, but the Food Foundation said these represented just \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d of need.</p> <p>The government has also been working on a scheme for parents of the 1.6 million children who had been on free school meals, with vouchers which can be redeemed in supermarkets. Campaigners, however, argue the vouchers should be usable for nutritionally-balanced meals from school kitchens, which could be kept open.</p> <p>They point out that this would also make use of the tonnes of food that got stuck in the wholesale system when companies that supply pubs, bar, cafes and restaurants were forced to close and lost their business overnight.</p> <p>This stock cannot be diverted to retailers because it is packed in bulk and labelled in the wrong way. \u201cThe whole food service sector is working hard to find a way to get this food to market, but you are asking it to redesign a whole supply chain in real time. It\u2019s not like throwing a switch,\u201d said Andrew Kuyk, director general of the Provision Trade Federation.</p> <p>The industry can see other threats on the near horizon. The British food system is largely built on a cheap and highly flexible labour force, which can be turned on and off like a tap. Now that is drying up as Brexit, travel restrictions and fear of illness are keeping away the migrants who have typically done that work.</p> <p>Out\u2013of\u2013work Britons have been responding to calls from farmers and food processors to plug the gaps with a new land army, but with the harvest season only weeks off, many labour providers say they are still facing huge shortages. The <a href=\"https://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/Article/2020/03/19/Meat-supplies-in-question-due-to-coronavirus\">British Meat Processors Association </a>has also warned that red meat and poultry factories are at risk of serious disruption if, as predicted, up to 20% of their staff go sick or into quarantine.</p> <p>The London borough of Newham, an area with high food insecurity, is one of several local authorities that has been scrambling over the last week to set up a new food distribution system.</p> <p>It is creating around eight new hubs from which children in low-income families and isolated adults can have food delivered to their doors. \u201cWe have the data to identify people who are likely to be struggling and have mobilised staff,\u201d said its director of public health, Jason Strelitz, but the council was still waiting for government to commit money.<br><br></p>",

  "<p>Chinese president Xi Jinping has called on Donald Trump to take \u201csubstantive actions\u201d to improve relations between the two countries, as China prepared to shut its borders to foreign arrivals amid fears of infections coming from abroad.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping held a phone call about the coronavirus outbreak in an attempt to repair strained relations, following weeks of traded barbs over the virus. According to state media, Xi told Trump in a phone call on Friday that US-China relations had reached an \u201cimportant juncture\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWorking together brings both sides benefits, fighting hurts both. Cooperation is the only choice,\u201d he said. Xi said he hoped the US would take \u201csubstantive actions\u201d to improve US-China relations to develop a relationship that is \u201cwithout conflict and confrontation\u201d but based on \u201cmutual respect and mutually beneficial cooperation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has continued to call the disease \u201cthe Chinese virus,\u201d despite protestations from Beijing. Chinese diplomats have in turn pushed the idea that the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, originated in the US.<strong><br><br></strong>Xi also said he hoped the US would take \u201ceffective measures\u201d to safeguard the lives of Chinese citizens in the US, describing the pandemic as the \u201ccommon enemy of mankind.\u201d He said: \u201cOnly by united can the international community defeat it.\u201d</p> \n<p>After the phone call, Trump said he had a \u201cvery good conversation\u201d with Xi. He wrote on Twitter that China had \u201cdeveloped a strong understanding of the virus\u201d and was working with the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1243407157321560071\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China.

The ban comes as the country reported its first locally infected coronavirus infection in three days and reported 54 imported cases. The move was greeted with broad support inside China.</p> \n<p>The measure applies to those with valid visas or residence permits and amounts to China shutting its borders, inviting criticism given that Beijing previously <a href=\"https://qz.com/1795806/china-compares-israel-coronavirus-controls-to-holocaust/\">condemned other countries</a> for similar moves. At the time, World Health Organization also advised countries not to shut their borders to Chinese travellers.</p> \n<p>China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration said late on Thursday that 90% of international flights would be suspended. The number of incoming passengers would be cut to 5,000 a day, from 25,000. China has also ordered local airlines to maintain only one route per country, once a week, as of 29 March.</p> \n<p>Some say the new measures are unwarranted given already strict screening of arrivals and the fact that many incoming carriers of the virus are Chinese citizens. Vice foreign minister Luo Zhaohui said at a press conference this week that 90% of imported cases were Chinese passport holders.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/do-not-relax-covid-19-measures-in-wuhan-too-soon-scientists-warn\">Do not relax Covid-19 measures in Wuhan too soon, scientists warn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In Beijing, all overseas arrivals must undergo quarantine at government-designated centres.

In a post-Covid-19 world, that\u2019s beginning to look slightly more feasible. \u201cWe propose planet before industry as a radical idea in which the health and survival of our planet Earth is given precedence over business interests,\u201d they write.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has brought into stark focus the fact that business as usual can be stopped in its tracks. Anything, it seems, is now possible.

This is not about tinkering around the edges of the existing way of working, creating \u201csustainable\u201d collections or clothing recycling schemes: Earth Logic attacks the very root of the problem: the existing economic model itself. This means a shift from production to the maintenance, use and care of existing clothes. It means reducing the volume of clothes we produce, and in turn, the amount of resources we are using. It means moving from globalised, tangled and unsafe supply chains to small production centres based around the needs and desires of local communities. \u201cWe need to find a role for industry scattered across communities,\u201d says Fletcher, with multiple local hubs for people to be educated, to make and repair their clothes. </p> <p>Patriarchy and growth logic are inextricably intertwined, says Tham. The same sorts of people are making the same sorts of decisions. According to Earth Logic, there would be respect for \u201cfashion in non-western geographies. We can train the focus of fashion on supporting race and gender equality. Each perspective offers new models and practices for relating with fashion as well as broadening and diversifying the base of fashion expertise.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4978ee74618f5ca82131b537889d6a07d35a3d16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4978ee74618f5ca82131b537889d6a07d35a3d16/52_76_1228_737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Academics Kate Fletcher and Mathilda Tham, who wrote the new report, Earth Logic, a Fashion Action Research Plan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Academics Kate Fletcher and Mathilda Tham, who wrote the new report, <a href=\"https://earthlogic.info/\">Earth Logic</a><a href=\"https://earthlogic.info/\">, a</a><a href=\"https://earthlogic.info/\"> Fashion Action Research Plan</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These are all points the next generation coming into the industry is demanding, too. \u201cThe questions students are asking are very different now,\u201d says Tham, who teaches fashion and economics students at the Linnaeus University, Sweden. How we design clothes must connect with the needs of society and the environment and work with them, not against them. We are seeing this happening with designers looking for ways to help make protective equipment and gowns for medical teams. These new positive role models must be allowed to lead the way forward.</p> <p>We have uncertain and painful times ahead. But Fletcher says: \u201cIt\u2019s about trying not to look away when the going gets hard.\u201d We are seeing that in times of real emergency, people\u2019s behaviour has to change. Even pressing pause on fashion\u2019s relentless cycle for a season (possibly two) will have a profound effect. Already, so much has changed. The cycle of fashion for fashion\u2019s sake has been broken. We must use this time to rethink how this industry can be redesigned with respect for the planet and the health of the people who work in it. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like turning a kaleidoscope and seeing new patterns emerge,\u201d says Tham. \u201cThere are so many possible patterns. Things can change very quickly when we have a new perspective. It is not impossible.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>If the first casualty of war is truth, the second may very well be something the entire world values highly right now: healthcare.</p> <p>Families fleeing conflict, or currently in its crosshairs, know that medical assistance is a rare and precious privilege in war zones.

  "<p>Of the dozens of places where a coronavirus vaccine might be born, one is DIOSynVax, a small company started by a Canadian pathologist named Jonathan Heeney. In ordinary times, I\u2019d have visited Heeney in his office, in a stately red-brick building in Cambridge. I\u2019d have met his team and his Aria III cytometer, which looks like as if might brew a strong, space-age espresso but which, in fact, uses its four lasers to separate cells marked with fluorescent dyes as they flow through the machine at 10,000 cells per second. I\u2019d have tried to wangle my way into the lab designated <a href=\"https://mrc.ukri.org/documents/pdf/ssr/standards-for-containment-level-3-facilities/\" title=\"\">containment </a><a href=\"https://mrc.ukri.org/documents/pdf/ssr/standards-for-containment-level-3-facilities/\" title=\"\">level 3</a>, the highest-but-one level of biosafety security, where Heeney\u2019s biologists investigate pathogens such as the West Nile virus or the tuberculosis bacterium. These would be so lethal if they escaped that the lab is nearly hermetic. The joints along the walls, floor and ceiling are sealed and re-sealed; the steel panels in the walls, according to government guidelines, have to be \u201cof the type used in the nuclear industry\u201d; a flow of air must constantly be forced in if the door is open, to prevent the germs inside from drifting out. I would have even seen the coronavirus vaccine candidates themselves: samples of clear liquid, held in glass vials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/13/its-a-razors-edge-were-walking-inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-podcast\">'It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Heeney couldn\u2019t take the risk. Understandably, he didn\u2019t want anyone carrying Covid-19 into his lab and infecting his staff. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge already, because when they go home to their families every day, you don\u2019t know who they\u2019re passing on the bus or the train,\u201d he said when I first spoke to him last week. At the time, Heeney was considering quarantining himself. A Cambridge college had offered him a room, so that he could shuttle between lab and bed, meeting as few people as possible. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to get sick,\u201d Heeney said. He runs his company out of Cambridge University\u2019s department of veterinary medicine, where he is a professor. He\u2019s just a 12-minute bicycle ride from where I live, but we video-conferenced on Zoom.</p> <p>Since 2016, Heeney has been honing a set of methods \u2013 a platform, in vaccine parlance \u2013 that can be used to fashion vaccines that destroy whole families of viruses. Last year, he won a Gates Foundation grant of $2m (\u00a31.6m) to fund research into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/24/endless-hunt-for-the-perfect-influenza-vaccine-flu-jab\" title=\"\">universal flu vaccine</a> \u2013 one that will prevail against every kind of flu virus. \u201cIt\u2019s the mother of all challenges, the holy grail,\u201d Heeney said. In January, he kept an eye on a new disease that was flying across eastern China. After two weeks, when Chinese scientists published the coronavirus\u2019s genetic sequence, Heeney told me his team decided: \u201cLet\u2019s do with this what we\u2019re doing with the flu.\u201d</p> <p>Defeating Covid-19 will call for more than vaccines; it will involve quarantines, social distancing, antivirals and other drugs, and healthcare for the sick. But the idea of a vaccine \u2013 the quintessential silver bullet \u2013 has come to bear an almost unreasonable allure. The coronavirus arrived at a ripe moment in genetic technology, when the advances of the past half-decade have made it possible for vaccine projects to explode off the blocks as soon as a virus is sequenced. These cutting-edge vaccines don\u2019t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ\u2019s genetic code \u2013 its DNA or RNA \u2013 which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.</p> <p>Thus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf\" title=\"\">in development</a> around the world \u2013 in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins\" title=\"\">moved into</a> human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a \u201cworld indoor record\u201d, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cNothing has ever gone that fast.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c6068963952d884702689af1e873ed51e5604dae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6068963952d884702689af1e873ed51e5604dae/83_0_7834_4700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronaviruses are named after the corona (crown) of surface proteins (outer dots) that are used to penetrate a host cell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coronaviruses are named after the corona (crown) of surface proteins (outer dots) that are used to penetrate a host cell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pasieka/Getty/Science Photo Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until this century, crafting a vaccine for even a long-familiar pathogen such as the polio virus, ushering it through trials and bringing it to market could take as long as 10 or 20 years. The first of these three stages is now staggeringly quick; a scientist at one company, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, told <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2237742-how-soon-will-we-have-a-coronavirus-vaccine-the-race-against-covid-19/\" title=\"\">New Scientist magazine</a> that her team had a preliminary model for a Covid-19 vaccine after just three hours of work.</p> <p>The thrust of this revolution \u2013 the capacity to create an infinitesimal part of an already minute virus, without handling a virus specimen at all \u2013 can seem godlike. But the next two stages \u2013 testing vaccines in humans and then manufacturing them for wide use \u2013 remain mortally slow. This is especially so because these newest types of vaccines \u2013 DNA or RNA vaccines \u2013 have never yet been licensed for use on humans. Outside a lab, they are completely unproven. With Covid-19, both contagion and vaccine are so new that there\u2019s no telling what human trials will reveal, or how long they will take. Every scientist, policymaker and researcher I spoke to said that we\u2019ll be lucky to have a vaccine for use within 12-18 months.</p> <p>If a DNA or RNA vaccine against Covid-19 is ever approved, it will be a watershed moment \u2013 not just because it will bear out the promise of this technology, but also because the technology will fortify us against future pandemics. Over the past few years, epidemiologists, risk analysts and policymakers have made concerted efforts to sharpen research and rethink the industrial model of vaccine production, all in preparation for the hypothetical disaster they call Disease X: any unknown disease that springs suddenly into our species and races ruinously through it. Covid-19 is the first Disease X to arise since the term was invented, but it won\u2019t be the last. The climate is warming, we\u2019re hacking down forests, our population is expanding and our skills at waging biological warfare are improving. The odds that we\u2019ll keep encountering more and more Disease Xs are increasing. We will need all the vaccines we can make.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Heeney was spending part of his winter break with friends in Canada when he first read about an outbreak in China. \u201cI\u2019m a scientist,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t help but follow this kind of news, even on holiday.\u201d Back then, it seemed like a version of flu or pneumonia that might stay in Wuhan. A few days into the new year, though, the disease\u2019s eagerness to travel became evident, and by the time Heeney rejoined his team in Cambridge, the nature of the pathogen had become clear, too. \u201cWe thought: \u2018OK, this is a coronavirus. It\u2019s going to be a tough one.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The first time Heeney encountered coronaviruses was in 1988, as an HIV researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US. Heeney had initially trained as a vet, so his boss asked him to investigate a flurry of coronavirus cases in an unusual group of patients: a pack of cheetahs. \u201cSome collector out in Oregon was trying to preserve the species by breeding them in a captive colony,\u201d Heeney said. The cheetahs lost weight, their gums swelled and their livers and kidneys struggled to function. They moped about their park, depressed and ill. Later, Heeney found that the feline coronavirus had been passed to the cheetahs by a domestic cat. For the next couple of decades, Heeney remained an HIV scientist. He didn\u2019t work much with animal viruses again until 2007, when he came to Cambridge to study diseases that spilled from animals to humans, and to develop vaccines for them.</p> <p>In its essence, even the most advanced vaccine functions on the same premise as the earliest mode of immunisation: cotton pads soaked in smallpox pus that were stuffed into the nostrils of healthy children in 16th-century China. The principle of vaccination is still to bluff the body: to slip in weakened germs, or even parts of germs, that do no harm but induce the release of antibodies that grant long-lasting immunity. The inducements have grown more sophisticated, but they continue to rely on the body\u2019s biological defences. Humankind has developed no system of immune response more effective than the one that\u2019s been inside us for hundreds of thousands of years.</p> <p>The latest class of vaccines \u2013 the type that Heeney works on \u2013 hold genetic material such as DNA or RNA; these are the kind that have never yet been licensed for use. They can be developed quickly, and they jog our immunity in distinctly different ways from everything that came before. The oldest method of vaccination involves dosing a person with inactive or enfeebled forms of the pathogen. For most of the past century, sourcing these was a laborious affair. For decades, scientists depleted the strength of viruses by growing them in human cell strains kept in labs at low temperatures; once the virus was sufficiently weak, it was safe to be sent into the human body in a vaccine. One line of lung cells, sourced from an aborted foetus in Sweden and multiplied again and again in lab cultures in the US, helped inoculate 300 million people against rubella, rabies, mumps and several other diseases.</p> <p>In the 1980s, researchers learned to mass-produce sub-units of a virus, each fragment assembled out of proteins and sugars. This might be a toxin or a part of the viral shell \u2013 just a signature whiff of the pathogen that can trigger immune reactions when introduced into the body. These molecular fragments are called antigens, because they generate antibodies that target them. Despite this technological advance, all these antigens still had to be cultivated in labs or factories.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until this century that the real leap occurred, propelling scientists towards DNA and RNA vaccines of the kind that Heeney and others develop. Once computers became powerful enough to sequence the genetic code of a pathogen quickly and cheaply, scientists were able to easily create snippets of its genes, which could then be sent into the human body. These snippets, using our own cells as miniature factories, can manufacture their antigens within us. As soon as a germ\u2019s gene sequence is known, scientists can begin concocting a vaccine for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1dec4b762566ae17faaf4ea53e316eb39c06ff12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dec4b762566ae17faaf4ea53e316eb39c06ff12/0_0_4419_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scientist in a lab in Rockville, Maryland working on a vaccine for Covid-19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scientist in a lab in Rockville, Maryland working on a vaccine for Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s what happened with Covid-19. On the last day of 2019, Wuhan\u2019s health authorities reported the strange pneumonia variant to the World Health Organization. By mid-January, Chinese scientists had <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947\" title=\"\">posted</a> online the full, machine-readable genome of the Covid-19 virus: all 29,903 nucleic bases that comprise its sequence of RNA \u2013 ribonucleic acid, its genetic material.</p> <p>For scientists around the world, this was the starter pistol being fired. By studying the published genome, they could single out sets of genes that make specific proteins in the Covid-19 virus: the S-protein making up the spikes on the virus\u2019s outer envelope, for instance, or the phosphorus-laden protein in the walls of an inner capsule, packaging the RNA within.</p> <p>Shortly after the coronavirus\u2019s sequence was published, Heeney\u2019s team set to work. The central question in their research is this: what antigens \u2013 what portions of the virus \u2013 can be found that are similar across a range of coronaviruses? If scientists discover these and, by deploying them in vaccines, drill our immune systems to recognise them, we will have given ourselves a way to fend off several kinds of coronavirus diseases, including Covid-19. The spike proteins jutting out of all these viruses, giving the appearance of a fringed crown, are a prime example of such antigens. Every coronavirus uses its spikes to invade human cells. Once our immune systems engineer antibodies in reaction to a vaccine of spike-protein antigens, they will have not just a method to identify coronaviruses, but also a prospective point of attack to cripple them.</p> <p>The first thing Heeney\u2019s team did was compare the genetic sequences of the Covid-19 virus and other coronavirus strains, to figure out what structural commonalities they might use as antigens. This approach put me in mind of a captain of some medieval army, who had obtained the plans of the castles he planned to attack and was now studying them to see if they all contained the same weak drawbridges, so that he could order up a single siege engine to knock them all down.</p> <p>When, after a few days, they had selected their antigens \u2013 the spike protein, but also some others \u2013 the biologists in Heeney\u2019s lab looked for their \u201cblueprints\u201d: the genes that direct the virus to construct each of these antigens. These lie in the gene sequences of the coronaviruses: one section of genetic code that holds the information to make a spike protein, another section for a different antigen, and so on. In late January, the lab sent these sections of code electronically to a German company, which built them out into synthetic genes \u2013 made artificially, but otherwise consisting of the same sugars and other material as our own DNA.</p> <p>These minuscule lengths of DNA were sent back to Cambridge suspended in vials of colourless, viscous fluid. In any eventual human trials, this DNA will be injected into the body to do what it\u2019s meant to do: construct antigens to prod the immune system into action. This is all meticulous, elaborate work, but the power of modern computing can hurry it along at astonishing speed. By the first week of February, Heeney said, his scientists were carrying out trials in mice.</p> <p>In all of this, no one in Heeney\u2019s team handled the coronavirus itself; in fact, until the synthetic DNA arrived from Germany, most of their work was on computers. This would have been unimaginable for earlier generations of vaccine scientists, who took in full-strength pathogens and then, with immense care, whittled down their potency. Heeney longed to know, first-hand, how the virus behaves in cells and what kinds of antibodies respond to it. For weeks, he said, \u201cno one outside China had isolated the virus\u201d. Then, towards the end of January, scientists at the University of Melbourne announced that they\u2019d grown cultures of the virus.</p> <p>Braving the uncertainties of travel, Heeney flew via Thailand to Australia, arriving in time for the first inoculation of a mouse with the cultured virus on 19 February. \u201cI wanted to establish some collaborations with these teams. They\u2019ll be important for us down the line,\u201d Heeney told me. In a bygone time, he might have brought back a vial of virus with him. \u201cWhen I was a youngster, people would just put samples in their briefcases, or in the breast pockets of their coats. But the biosecurity protocols are intense now, so you can\u2019t do that any more.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Heeney\u2019s project, which takes on a whole family of viruses, most vaccine projects are targeting just the virus causing Covid-19, but they follow the same basic, still-experimental approach: synthesise DNA or RNA, tuck that genetic material into a vaccine and have it build antigens once it\u2019s shot into the body. (I found only a couple of projects that are working the older way, using a weakened form of the whole virus in a vaccine.) Heeney is fully aware that these DNA and RNA vaccines may all still collapse in trials. \u201cThere are graveyards full of failed viral vaccine candidates,\u201d he said. But if even one succeeds, \u201cthen we\u2019ll be entering a brave new world of vaccines\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>To an outsider, the design of a DNA or RNA vaccine in a lab seems like cool, ordered science, conducted by computers, technicians in sterile oversuits, and machines that hum quietly. The next stage \u2013 when the vaccine has to negotiate clinical trials \u2013 is rife with all the messy uncertainties of human biology. In other words, while genetic technology has dramatically shrunk the first leg of the process from years to weeks, the second leg remains as long as ever, so that vaccine development now resembles a pair of misshapen trousers.</p> <p>Regulatory trials take months or even years because, for one, they can\u2019t go faster than the rate at which humans metabolise vaccines. But they\u2019re also time-consuming because so much is at stake, and because it\u2019s impossible to predict how our complex physiology will react to a new vaccine. These trials determine if a vaccine is safe, what its dosages should be, how effective it is, and what its side effects are. In the US, 90% of drugs fail to make it past these trials. The overriding purpose of the process is abundant caution; a vaccine that unexpectedly proves harmful is the industry\u2019s worst nightmare.</p> <p>In the literature, past mishaps flash like red warning signals. In 1942, a yellow fever vaccine contaminated with a hepatitis B virus was given to more than 300,000 American troops; nearly 150 of them died. The field\u2019s classic reference text, Plotkin\u2019s Vaccines, by the physician Stanley Plotkin, refers sombrely to \u201cthe Cutter incident\u201d \u2013 a 1955 episode in which a manufacturer named Cutter Laboratories failed to properly deactivate the virus in its polio shot. The faulty vaccine caused roughly 40,000 cases of polio, paralysed 260 people and killed 10.</p> <p>The US\u2019s strict rules to regulate vaccines <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/\" title=\"\">emerged</a>, in part, because of Cutter Laboratories. The company survived, but paid out millions in civil damages. The Cutter incident set a precedent for more lawsuits during the next three decades, in which parents argued that their children had been disabled by malfunctioning vaccines. Some pharma firms, worried about multimillion-dollar claims settlements, abandoned vaccines altogether; others hiked their prices to cover any future legal costs. To keep vaccines cheap and vaccinations regular, the US government had to set up a compensation fund that eased most of the liability on vaccine companies.</p> <p>In the midst of a pandemic, so many forces tug at the vaccine development process \u2013 politics, industry, science, money, fear, hope \u2013 that there\u2019s a perpetual hazard of clinical trials being hurried or of a poorly planned vaccination scheme being rushed out. One historical analogue is found in 1976 \u2013 like 2020, an election year. That February, a bout of swine flu broke out in an army post in New Jersey, and one soldier died. In comparison to Covid-19, the outbreak now seems minor, but it jolted President Ford\u2019s government, which was already suffering from the second-hand shame of Nixon\u2019s resignation just two years earlier. The administration fretted that, in the autumn, at the height of flu season, the virus would exact a huge loss of life; one government estimate figured that 1 million Americans would die.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Ford announced a plan to vaccinate everyone in the country, and had the Centers for Disease Control draft a $136m plan to do it. He ignored Albert Sabin, one of the heroes of the polio vaccine, who advised against immunisation, believing that no epidemic was imminent. Ford also ignored the warnings coming out of clinical trials, in which one of the four manufacturers was found to have formulated some unknown number of its 2.6m doses with a different flu virus altogether. Congress exempted all these companies from liabilities if their vaccine harmed anyone. Beginning in October, 40 million Americans were vaccinated, but by mid-December, it emerged that the shot came with a slightly increased risk of contracting Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an immobilising neurological condition.</p> <p>The vaccine campaign was scrapped soon after; by that time, close to 450 people had been afflicted with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9. It was impossible to say how many of these cases were seeded by the vaccine. And if the vaccine really did prevent a swine flu epidemic, there was no way to know; the counterfactual \u2013 no vaccination, a ravaging pandemic \u2013 was hidden from view. This vaccine\u2019s legacy, in public memory, was the paralysis of those hundreds of people.</p> <p>Already, the temptation to accelerate the trials of Covid-19 vaccines is becoming apparent. Earlier this month, Donald Trump suggested using \u201ca solid flu vaccine \u2026 on corona\u201d. Not possible, scientists informed him. When he declared that a vaccine would be available within a few months, he had to be told that, in that time, vaccines would only be ready for testing. Ordinarily, human trials come after many phases of animal testing, but at least two companies \u2013 one of them Moderna \u2013 have decided to do both in parallel. The scientists I spoke to, though, kept telling me that testing couldn\u2019t be rushed. \u201cThere will be many trials, and we need to be ready for some failures,\u201d Heeney said. He leaned in towards his webcam as if to push his point physically through the internet to me. \u201cWe have to avoid overpromising, because if there\u2019s an accident with one of those first vaccines \u2013 if someone gets ill and it gets into the Daily Mail, \u2018New vaccine threatens survival\u2019 or some ridiculous headline \u2013 then people won\u2019t want to take even the later vaccines that do work. It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking here.\u201d</p> <p>Among the peculiarities of this pandemic, moreover, is the fact that we, the general populace, might determine how well human trials go. If huge swathes of society become infected before the vaccine is ready to test on humans, the trials will be difficult to conduct, said Sarah Gilbert, an immunologist at the University of Oxford\u2019s Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research. Gilbert\u2019s team also has a vaccine candidate for Covid-19, based on an earlier vaccine it had devised for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or Mers, another coronavirus disease. In mid-March, Gilbert had to put an auto-response on her email. When her team was ready to recruit subjects for vaccine trials, it would be advertised on the website, she wrote. \u201cPlease do not contact me about volunteering.\u201d</p> <p>Gilbert\u2019s worry is that, at the peak of infection, the virus will be bouncing so frantically around the population that \u201cyou can\u2019t screen your volunteers. By the time you get their results back, they may have been exposed.\u201d Organising trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have cultivated a natural immunity by then. Transmission will have dropped as well, Gilbert said \u2013 it\u2019s hard to know how well a vaccine trial is going if the subjects aren\u2019t being exposed to the virus at all. \u201cThis is herd immunity \u2013 good for the population, but it makes testing a vaccine more difficult,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>The best possible scenario involves delaying the pandemic\u2019s peak \u2013 pushing it through the summer towards August, to buy scientists a few extra months to run their trials. \u201cSo we\u2019d really be pleased,\u201d Gilbert said sternly, \u201cif everyone will just do what they\u2019re being told and stay at home.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>At some point in March, Heeney\u2019s sense of time started to grow muddled. Things happened so fast, and his weeks were so full, that dates lost their meaning; once, while speaking to me, he had to thumb back through his email to recollect even roughly when a particular step in his research had happened. \u201cThe coronavirus dominates our days,\u201d he said. He wakes before dawn to pore through feeds of scientific data and journal articles. \u201cThere are conference calls, there\u2019s all this paperwork to fill out so we can deal safely with pathogens, there\u2019s the need to scale up the lab to work on the vaccine. There\u2019s just no routine anymore. It feels like the wild west right now.\u201d</p> <p>Like every other scientist, Heeney spends part of his days worrying about funding. All these vaccine projects hurtling towards trials may yet be drawn to a screeching halt by a lack of money. Trials are expensive; so is the outlay on manufacturing and marketing vaccines. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make enough doses for the whole world, you\u2019re going to need billions and billions of dollars,\u201d Heeney said. Earlier this week, the Wellcome Trust put an exact number on it: a further $3bn, across the industry, to fund and produce enough vaccines to beat the pandemic.</p> <p>Most of this money will go towards trials and production, the costs of which are now frequently borne by drug companies. After the 80s, when a series of mergers left the pharma industry in the hands of a few behemoth companies, vaccines fell thoroughly under the sway of market forces, subject to the kind of logic that prompted Goldman Sachs, in a 2018 report, to wonder: \u201cIs curing patients a sustainable business model?\u201d (It isn\u2019t, the analysts <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/curing-disease-not-a-sustainable-business-model-goldman-sachs-analysts-say/\" title=\"\">concluded</a>.)</p> <p>Diseases that are borne out of poverty, and that require cheap vaccines, such as cholera, are largely ignored, says Peter Jay Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So are diseases that are uncommon, or diseases that have come and gone. Taxpayers fund most vaccine research, but the pharma titans that can make them at scale are reluctant to commit to a vaccine if the likelihood of profit is meagre. \u201cWe have a broken ecosystem for making vaccines,\u201d Hotez told me.</p> <p>If the business wasn\u2019t set up this way, Hotez thinks, he\u2019d have a Covid-19 vaccine to offer, based on an earlier project that wilted from lack of funding. The story of Hotez\u2019s vaccine is a parable for this field, and it foretells one highly possible future for all the exciting vaccine work currently underway against Covid-19.</p> <p>When Sars broke out in 2002, scientists and companies rolled up their sleeves to deliver a vaccine. But after 2004, no Sars cases were reported, so research flagged; one vaccine, from Sanofi, never made it past clinical trials. Ideally, Hotez says, vaccines would still have been run through the first few steps of trials and kept in reserve for future emergencies. Between 2011 and 2016, Hotez and his team designed a potential vaccine for Sars, and had the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research make 20,000 doses, to test on humans. But none of Hotez\u2019s usual funders gave him a grant for these trials. \u201cSars dropped off their list of priorities,\u201d Maria Elena Bottazzi, one of Hotez\u2019s collaborators at Baylor, told me. \u201cWe had other situations, like Ebola or Zika.\u201d The industry\u2019s attention is easily diverted, Hotez said. \u201cIt\u2019s like little kids playing a football game. The ball goes in one direction and all the kids run after it. Then it goes in another direction and all the kids run that way.\u201d</p> <p>So much about Covid-19 is still unclear that companies can\u2019t yet gauge the profit margins on a vaccine. Will the disease fade before a vaccine is approved? Will DNA or RNA vaccines even work? Will everyone be inoculated \u2013 a bumper payday from billions of doses \u2013 or will vaccines go to just a few at-risk groups, such as healthcare workers or anyone over 40? \u201cAt some point, there will be a go/no-go decision to make for companies,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine policy scholar at Yale. \u201cAnd then they\u2019ll have to figure out if it\u2019s worth the risk.\u201d One way to make it worthwhile is to engage in price gouging, which drug companies have always been happy to do. Earlier this month, the US <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/13/big-pharma-drug-pricing-coronavirus-profits/\" title=\"\">passed</a> a coronavirus spending bill that deliberately left out controls on vaccine prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d7c7fd093581e39edb35d088209056ac2824f8fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7c7fd093581e39edb35d088209056ac2824f8fd/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Equipment in a Biocad lab, a Russian biotechnology company, working on a Covid-19 vaccine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Equipment in a Biocad lab, a Russian biotechnology company, working on a Covid-19 vaccine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Biocad Press Office/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, pharma companies are indispensable, said Charlie Weller, who heads the vaccines programme at the Wellcome Trust. (When Weller spoke to me one evening on the phone, she had to break off for a minute to comfort her little daughter, who\u2019d burst into tears after learning that, as the child of a key worker, she\u2019d have to keep going to school even while her friends stayed home.) Pharma firms pay for most clinical trials, invest in experts and equipment, and bring drugs to market. They assume the right to set prices and decide what vaccines to sell because they claim to bear the most financial risk. \u201cIf we have to be ready for more Disease Xs, we need to rethink this whole underlying structure,\u201d Weller told me. \u201cWe have to do it so that the risk is shared.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) was founded to do just this: to allay some of the financial risk of research, and to keep this research going even in the troughs between epidemics. Cepi\u2019s funding \u2013 about $740m \u2013 comes from a combination of philanthropists and governments. Melanie Saville, its director of vaccine development, told me that they were funding eight ongoing Covid-19 vaccine projects. But Cepi\u2019s own money for Covid-19 was going to run out by the end of March. Without more donations, none of its funded vaccines would progress beyond the first phase of clinical trials.</p> <p>One of Cepi\u2019s ambitions is to create its own \u201cinvestigational stockpile\u201d of vaccines \u2013 vaccines that have passed the first two out of three stages of clinical trials, and that then bide their time in cold storage. Everyone hopes they will never be required, but if necessary, they can be brought forth, hustled through the final clinical trial stage \u2013 which must be conducted in a real outbreak \u2013 and launched into production. Saville said Cepi has no storage or clinical facilities of its own, and that the stockpiles would reside individually with manufacturers. This disappointed me; for a second, I\u2019d dreamed of a vaccine storehouse nestled somewhere in the Arctic \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/20/the-doomsday-vault-seeds-save-post-apocalyptic-world\" title=\"\">a Svalbard</a> against sickness, a vault so titanic that it dwarfed the germs it intended to fight by zillions of orders of magnitude.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>A week after I met Heeney on Zoom, I called him again. He gave me a phone number in his Cambridge college; he had decided to self-quarantine himself in a room after all. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been at risk, but if one of us goes down, we all go down like dominoes,\u201d he said. He was full of praise for his team \u2013 \u201call these bright, talented individuals who are still living at home but are otherwise trying to live isolated lives, like monks in a monastery\u201d. When Heeney moved into his room, he wiped down all the surfaces. One day, he went to get a cup of coffee, and when he came back to his room, he saw that two men had come in to change the batteries in the fire alarm. \u201cIt was crazy. I thought: \u2018Here I am trying to keep the risk factor low. Does this have to happen now?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His lab is still running trials in mice. It\u2019s a long process, he said. \u201cYou take tissue cultures from the mice and you study them. We\u2019re getting all this data, so that we can see what works and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s too early to tell which of the vaccine projects out there will succeed, he said. \u201cYou know, I think it\u2019s pretty amazing that humans have got vaccines in trials already,\u201d Heeney said. \u201cThe trials will tell us what we need to know. My worry is that the devil is in the details with this coronavirus. But I hope I\u2019m wrong. I really hope I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>We keep hearing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/we-are-at-war-coronavirus-pandemic\">this is a war</a>. Is it really? What helps to give the current crisis its wartime feel is the apparent absence of normal political argument. The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">goes on TV</a> to issue a sombre statement to the nation about the curtailment of our liberties and the leader of the opposition offers nothing but support. Parliament, insofar as it is able to operate at all, appears to be merely going through the motions. People are stuck at home, and their fights are limited to the domestic sphere. There is talk of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/covid-coalition-government-considered-by-senior-conservatives\">government of national unity</a>. Politics-as-usual has gone missing.</p> <p>But this is not the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-parliament-to-close-early-for-easter-amid-coronavirus-fears\">suspension of politics</a>. It is the stripping away of one layer of political life to reveal something more raw underneath. In a democracy we tend to think of politics as a contest between different parties for our support. We focus on the who and the what of political life: who is after our votes, what they are offering us, who stands to benefit. We see elections as the way to settle these arguments. But the bigger questions in any democracy are always about the how: how will governments exercise the extraordinary powers we give them? And how will we respond when they do?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Though the pandemic is a global phenomenon, its impact is greatly shaped by decisions taken by individual governments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These are the questions that have always preoccupied political theorists. But now they are not so theoretical. As the current crisis shows, the primary fact that underpins political existence is that some people get to tell others what to do. At the heart of all<strong> </strong>modern politics is a trade-off between personal liberty and collective choice. This is the Faustian bargain identified by the philosopher Thomas Hobbes in the middle of the 17th century, when the country was being torn apart by a real civil war.</p> <p>As Hobbes knew, to exercise political rule is to have the power of life and death over citizens. The only reason we would possibly give anyone that power is because we believe it is the price we pay for our collective safety. But it also means that we are entrusting life-and-death decisions to people we cannot ultimately control.</p> <p>The primary risk is that those on the receiving end refuse to do what they are told. At that point, there are only two choices. Either people are forced to obey, using the coercive powers the state has at its disposal. Or politics breaks down altogether, which Hobbes argued was the outcome we should fear most of all.</p> <p>In a democracy, we have the luxury of waiting for the next election to punish political leaders for their mistakes. But that is scant consolation when matters of basic survival are at stake. Anyway, it\u2019s not much of a punishment, relatively speaking. They might <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/12/lost-seat-parliament-westminster-britain-working-class\">lose their jobs</a>, though few politicians wind up destitute. We might lose our lives.</p> <p>The rawness of these choices is usually obscured by the democratic imperative to seek consensus. That has not gone away. The government is doing all it can to dress up its decisions in the language of commonsense advice. It says it is still trusting individuals to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/businesses-ask-for-clarity-confusion-uk-lockdown-open-staff\">show sound judgment</a>. But as the experience of other European countries shows, as the crisis deepens the stark realities become clearer. Just watch the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/this-is-not-a-film-italian-mayors-rage-coronavirus-lockdown-dodgers\">footage of Italian mayors</a> screaming at their constituents to stay at home. \u201cVote for me or the other lot get in\u201d is routine democratic politics. \u201cDo this or else\u201d is raw democratic politics. At that point it doesn\u2019t look so different from politics of any other kind.</p> <p>This crisis has revealed some other hard truths. National governments really matter, and it really matters which one you happen to find yourself under. Though the pandemic is a global phenomenon, and is being experienced similarly in many different places, the impact of the disease is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/trump-accuses-media-of-wanting-to-keep-economy-shut-to-hurt-his-reelection\">greatly shaped by decisions</a> taken by individual governments. Different views about when to act and how far to go still mean that no two nations are having the same experience. At the end of it all we may get to see who was right and what was wrong. But for now, we are at the mercy of our national leaders. That is something else Hobbes warned about: there is no avoiding the element of arbitrariness at the heart of all politics. It is the arbitrariness of individual political judgment.</p> <p>Under a lockdown, democracies reveal what they have in common with other political regimes: here too politics is ultimately about power and order. But we are also getting to see some of the fundamental differences. It is not that democracies are nicer, kinder, gentler places. They<strong> </strong>may<strong> </strong>try to be, but in the end that doesn\u2019t last. Democracies do, though, find it harder to make the really tough choices. Pre-emption \u2013 the ability to tackle a problem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/health-expert-brands-uks-coronavirus-response-pathetic\">before it becomes acute</a> \u2013 has never been a democratic strength. We wait until we have no choice and then we adapt. That means democracies are always going to start off behind the curve of a disease like this one, though some are better at playing catch-up than others.</p> <p>Autocratic regimes such as China also find it hard to face up to crises until they have to \u2013 and, unlike democracies, they can suppress the bad news for longer if it suits them. But when action becomes unavoidable, they can go further. The Chinese lockdown succeeded in containing the disease through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">ruthless pre-emption</a>. Democracies are capable of being equally ruthless \u2013 as they showed when prosecuting the total wars of the 20th century.</p> <p>But in a war, the enemy is right in front of you. During this pandemic the disease reveals where it has got to only in the daily litany of infections and deaths. Democratic politics becomes a kind of shadow boxing: the state doesn\u2019t know which bodies are the really dangerous ones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/parliament-shuts-democracy-suspended-political-scrutiny\">It's right that parliament shuts \u2013 but democracy can't be suspended | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some democracies have managed to adapt faster: in South Korea the disease is being tamed by extensive tracing and widespread surveillance of possible carriers. But in that case, the regime had recent experience to draw on in its handling of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/28/south-korea-mers-virus-outbreak-is-over\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/28/south-korea-mers-virus-outbreak-is-over\">ers outbreak of 2015</a>, which also shaped the collective memory of its citizens. Israel may also be doing a better job than many European countries \u2013 but it is a society already on a permanent warlike footing. It is easier to adapt when you have adapted already. It is much harder when you are making it up as you go along.</p> <p>In recent years, it has sometimes appeared that global politics is simply a choice between rival forms of technocracy. In China, it is a government of engineers backed up by a one-party state. In the west, it is the rule of economists and central bankers, operating within the constraints of a democratic system. This creates the impression that the real choices are technical judgments about how to run vast, complex economic and social systems.</p> <p>But in the last few weeks another reality has pushed through. The ultimate judgments are about how to use coercive power. These aren\u2019t simply technical questions. Some arbitrariness is unavoidable. And the contest in the exercise of that power between democratic adaptability and autocratic ruthlessness will shape all of our futures. We are a long way from the frightening and violent world that Hobbes sought to escape nearly 400 years ago. But our political world is still one Hobbes would recognise.</p> <p>\u2022 David Runciman is professor of politics at Cambridge University</p>",
  "<p>It was tempting fate, but I had to try. In recent years, whenever I looked in at the old pond at Cressbrook Mill, I\u2019d see the electric arc of a kingfisher zipping along the water\u2019s edge, like a blue slit in the air\u2019s fabric. It was something to lift the heart, especially on days of trial and doubt. This time: nothing.</p> <p>Never mind. There was no shortage of interest: a mandarin duck at the pond\u2019s distant end and a pair of coots bustling along, white faces like Venetian masks, their proud look belying their gleeful abandon when at intervals they ducked under the water. Near my feet was a clump of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/08/marsh-marigolds-bawdy-song-wenlock-edge\">marsh marigolds</a>, vibrantly yellow and lusciously green. And beside that a sparkling clear torrent that sank from view into a tunnel heading for the old water-powered cotton mill on the other side of the road.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f9ba10b80521d16bd6f63f50be1d9ea11d11b7a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9ba10b80521d16bd6f63f50be1d9ea11d11b7a9/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The old, water-powered Cressbrook Mill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The old, water-powered Cressbrook Mill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Nellist/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cotton transformed this quiet corner of Derbyshire. There was no Cressbrook Mill before the 18th century; the name itself only came into being at this time. A local businessman called John Baker, a hosier from nearby Litton, took over the land when it was first enclosed, cleared undergrowth and planted watercress around the stream, peppermint and lavender beds, and, on the hillside above, fruit trees and filberts. The cress did well, and so a place once known as Grassbrook became Cressbrook. Then Baker sold out to Richard Arkwright and cotton took over. The handsome mill that stands here now was built in 1814.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/mar/18/22-great-spring-walks-in-uk\">It's blooming spring! 22 great UK walks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Staring at the stream below, I became absorbed in the elegance of the tunnel\u2019s stonework, pondering the hours it must have taken, and the sweat.

  "<p>A bacterium that feeds on toxic plastic has been discovered by scientists. The bug not only breaks the plastic down but uses it as food to power the process.</p> <p>The bacterium, which was found at a waste site where plastic had been dumped, is the first that is known to attack polyurethane. Millions of tonnes of the plastic is produced every year to use in items such as sports shoes, nappies, kitchen sponges and as foam insulation, but it is mostly sent to landfill because it it too tough to recycle.</p> <p>When broken down it can release toxic and carcinogenic chemicals which would kill most bacteria, but the newly discovered strain is able to survive. While the research has identified the bug and some of its key characteristics, much work remains to be done before it can be used to treat large amounts of waste plastic.</p> <p>\u201cThese findings represent an important step in being able to reuse hard-to-recycle polyurethane products,\u201d said Hermann Heipieper, at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research-UFZ in Leipzig, Germany, who is one of the research team. He said it might be 10 years before the bacterium could be used at a large scale and that in the meantime it was vital to reduce the use of plastic that is hard to recycle and to cut the amount of plastic in the environment.</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/19/plastic-pollution-risks-near-permanent-contamination-of-natural-environment\">8bn tonnes of plastic</a> has been produced since the 1950s and most has ended up polluting the world\u2019s land and oceans, or in landfill dumps. Scientists say it threatens a \u201cnear permanent contamination of the natural environment\u201d.</p> <p>The research, <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00404/full\">published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology</a>, identified a new strain of <em>Pseudomonas bacteria</em>, a family known for its ability to withstand harsh conditions, such as high temperatures and acidic environments.</p> <p>The researchers fed it key chemical components of polyurethane in the laboratory. \u201cWe found the bacteria can use these compounds as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy,\u201d Heipieper said.</p> <p>Fungi has been used before to break down polyurethane, but bacteria are much easier to harness for industrial use. Heipieper said the next step would be to identify the genes that code for the enzymes produced by the bug that break down the polyurethane.</p> <p>Scientists revealed in 2018 that they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/16/scientists-accidentally-create-mutant-enzyme-that-eats-plastic-bottles\">accidentally created a mutant enzyme</a> that breaks down plastic drinks bottles, which are made of PET, potentially enabling the complete recycling of bottles for the first time. One of the team behind this advance, Prof John McGeehan, the director of the Centre for Enzyme Innovation at the University of Portsmouth, England, praised the new work.</p> <p>\u201cThe breakdown of certain polyurethanes can release toxic additives, which need to be handled carefully. This research group has discovered a strain that can tackle some of these chemicals,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile there is still much work to be done, this is exciting and necessary research that demonstrates the power of looking to nature to find valuable biocatalysts. Understanding and harnessing such natural processes will open the door for innovative recycling solutions.\u201d</p> <p>Heipieper said: \u201cWhen you have huge amounts of plastic in the environment, that means there is a lot of carbon and there will be evolution to use this as food. Bacteria are there in huge numbers and their evolution is very fast.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, this certainly doesn\u2019t mean that the work of microbiologists can lead to a complete solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main message should be to avoid plastic being released into the environment in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Previous research has also shown that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26291558\">some fungi can break down PET plastic</a>, while wax moth larvae \u2013 usually bred as fish bait \u2013 can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/24/plastic-munching-worms-could-help-wage-war-on-waste-galleria-mellonella\">eat </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/24/plastic-munching-worms-could-help-wage-war-on-waste-galleria-mellonella\">up polythene bags</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Out of a desperate desire to avoid the doom-and-gloom news reel for at least a few hours a day and with Covid-19 keeping me confined at home, I have become interiors-obsessed. There\u2019s no more pleasant distraction than searching for the perfect rug to really pull a room together, debating variations of patterned wallpaper, or agonizing over exactly how many scatter cushions are <em>too </em>many scatter cushions.</p> <p>An hour or two a day can easily be wiled away planning a whole-house refurbishment. The only problem is, like most young people, I don\u2019t actually own a home that I can decorate. Instead, I\u2019ve been sucked into the world of decorating apps, and their creators have been expecting people like me \u2013 permanently renting millennials, AKA \u201cGeneration Rent\u201d.</p> <p>The popularity of interior design apps is understandable. Although <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/4403/millennials-and-real-estate-in-the-us/\">80% of millennials</a> would like to eventually own a home, homeownership rates among people under 35 in the US have <a href=\"https://www.valuepenguin.com/changing-homeownership-trends\">fallen by 20%</a> in the last decade. The economic uncertainties that we are facing today \u2013 with mounting student debts, the rise of the gig economy and a seemingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/prepare-for-the-coronavirus-global-recession\">impending recession</a> \u2013 make mortgages seem even more out of reach. Personalizing a house may have been a luxury that older generations enjoyed in real life, but for many young people tapping away at our phone screens may be as close as we can get.</p> <p>This less-than-perfect reality has spurred a meteoric rise of apps to fulfill us digitally. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/design-home/id1010962391\">Design Home</a> is one of the most popular interior design apps, with over 75m downloads and at least 1 million daily users. Players are given daily \u201cchallenges\u201d of decorating different rooms, with a vast range of furniture to choose from. Virtual cash and rewards are handed out daily, and can also be won based on a rating system.</p> <p>Although the app is free, users can also purchase in-game currency to perk up lackluster rooms with more expensive items \u2013 and there\u2019s certainly the temptation to do so. After all, players\u2019 designs are directly pitted against each other, as users vote for their favorite designs of the day, with top designs receiving more highly prized rewards. Enter enough challenges, and you\u2019ll receive the requisite amount of points to be able to decorate an entire house, a much-prized reward that can take weeks of playing steadily to acquire. There are scores of similar apps currently on the market, each racking up hundreds of thousands of users carefully crafting their own <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/DesignHomeGame/photos\">video-game-style homes.</a></p> <p>\u201cNow, more than ever before, people are spending more time at home \u2018nesting\u2019, and surroundings can make a difference in our happiness,\u201d explains Design Home\u2019s creator Chris McGill. \u201cPeople may not be able to decorate and customize their own homes, but still wish to cultivate their creativity and express themselves through interior design.\u201d</p> <p>As social media have encouraged us to share pictures of perfectly color-coordinated rooms with total strangers, our homes are no longer a private space \u2013 they are frequently photographed and regularly fill up our feeds with #instagramworthy style. Interior design apps fill the gap between our increasingly high aesthetic aspirations and the reality of rentals.</p> <p>\u201cI think [interior design games] satisfy our need to see beautiful design and interact with it in a very personal way,\u201d explains Alessandra Wood, a design historian and the vice-president of Modsy, an online interior design service that allows buyers to see digital renderings of their room before they make purchases. \u201cOver the past few years, as home design has shifted into the spotlight thanks to Instagram and Pinterest, interior design games allow users to play and experiment with interior design \u2013 two things nearly impossible to achieve without time, effort and money in real life.\u201d</p> <p>It seems that home decorating apps have arisen at a culturally serendipitous time for their creators. Interior design for the masses has become mainstream at the very moment that homeownership has plummeted, and apps like Design Home have sprung up in its place. But Design Home also experiments with new models of marketing, raising interesting questions about how game play and consumerism could interact in future. Many of the items available in the game are also for sale in the real world, with users able to click through to connect to various websites to purchase items.</p> <p>\u201cDesign Home is changing the way consumers connect, learn and engage with the interior design industry and how brands meaningfully reach consumers through creative gameplay,\u201d explains McGill. \u201cWith any new product, it\u2019s important to start with a thesis about an unmet consumer need. Interior design is already a creative passion for millions of people but may not be accessible in people\u2019s daily lives. Creating Design Home was a way to connect players and makers; giving players access to styles and furniture from all over the world and exposing furniture makers to passionate customers.\u201d</p> <p>With large swaths of Design Home\u2019s audience seemingly drawn to the app by the limitations of their own living situation, and with scant information currently available on the success of the model, it is unclear how much interior design apps manage to monetize this marketing scheme, or whether most of their income is made through small in-app purchases, with users upgrading their digital inventory rather than their real-life homes. But one thing seems sure: as the housing market continues to be inaccessible for young people, homeownership will become an ever more distant fantasy \u2013 perhaps one increasingly enacted on digital devices.</p> <p>McGill is optimistic that the world of virtual decorating will continue to grow. He thinks in the future Design Home will be more than just a distracting game, but a means of blurring the already indistinct lines between fantasy and reality, as well as game playing and marketing.</p> <p>\u201cDesign Home will continue to transform the interior design and gaming industries by connecting retailers and consumers in an empowering and innovative gaming playground, giving players deeper visibility into an array of home decor, including boutique brands with no retail presence,\u201d he says. \u201cDesign Home brings a positive light to people\u2019s lives, allowing them to relax, be creative and learn and then put the game away and apply those learnings to their real-life decorating skills. In light of the current situation, people are looking for this creative outlet more than ever.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>$11.50 for a kilogram of broccoli. $8 a bunch for fresh celery.

  "<p>An Iranian scientist who was exonerated in a US sanctions trial but remains jailed by immigration authorities said the conditions in detention were filthy and overcrowded \u2013 and officials were doing little to prevent a deadly coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>Dr Sirous Asgari, a materials science and engineering professor, was <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/2019/11/cleveland-federal-judge-dismisses-trade-secrets-fraud-charges-against-iranian-professor-during-trial.html\">acquitted</a> in November on federal charges of stealing trade secrets related to his academic work with a university in Ohio. Although the US government lost its case on all charges, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has kept him indefinitely detained since the trial. Now he\u2019s speaking out about the \u201cinhumane\u201d treatment that could cost him his life.</p> <p>Asgari, 59, told the Guardian that his Ice holding facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, had no basic cleaning practices in place and continued to bring in new detainees from across the country with no strategy to minimize the threat of Covid-19.</p> <p>In a phone call from the Alexandria Staging Facility (ASF), he said he believed the only safe option would be to shut down the facility due to the deplorable conditions. ASF is a 400-bed site where people are supposed to be detained for no more than 72 hours, typically a final stop before they are deported. But with Covid-19 travel restrictions and flight cancellations, Ice has been holding people for days on end in cramped bunkbeds alongside new arrivals who may have been exposed to the virus.</p> <p>Asgari arrived at ASF on 10 March and has been seeking to voluntarily \u201cself deport\u201d to Iran. Ice has refused to let him fly home or be temporarily released with his family in the US. He alleged:</p> <ul> <li><p>Detainees have no hand sanitizer, and the facility is not regularly cleaning bathrooms or sleeping areas. Asgari and a few other detainees have devised a schedule to try to clean surfaces themselves with the minimal soap available.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Detainees lack access to masks. For two weeks, ASF also refused to let Asgari wear his own protective mask, which he brought with him to the facility, and it has refused to supply one, despite his history of serious respiratory problems.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Detainees struggle to stay clean, and the facility has an awful stench. Because the facility is supposed to be temporary, there is no laundry available and detainees are stuck with the clothes they were wearing upon arrival, sometimes after long journeys.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>There are no physical distancing guidelines at the facility. It appears no procedures or practices have changed in response to Covid-19 since Asgari\u2019s arrival, even as Louisiana state and federal officials have urged people to isolate.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cThe way Ice looks at these people is not like they are human beings, but are objects to get rid of,\u201d said Asgari, a professor at the Sharif University of Technology, a public university in Tehran. \u201cThe way that they have been treating us is absolutely terrifying. I don\u2019t think many people in the US know what is happening inside this black box.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05009d61b31de4718779674479b53b7c6237df32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05009d61b31de4718779674479b53b7c6237df32/0_66_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Sirous Asgari, seen here in a family photo, was acquitted of stealing trade secrets but remains in detention.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Sirous Asgari, seen here in a family photo, was acquitted of stealing trade secrets but remains in detention.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Asgari family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The situation is particularly worrying for Asgari, who is at risk of getting pneumonia if an infection like Covid-19 reaches his lungs.

He arrived in the US in 2017 with his wife and with valid passports and visas but upon arrival discovered he was being prosecuted by the US government for alleged violations of sanctions law.</p> <p>Asgari, a father of three, has deep ties to the US. He completed his materials engineering PhD at Drexel University in Pennsylvania, and two of his children live in the US. But the FBI surveilled him and ultimately he was charged with fraud and trade secret theft relating to his work with a university in Ohio.</p> <p>During a long trial, Asgari won his case and was acquitted in November 2019, with a judge ruling the government\u2019s evidence was insufficient. But because the US had revoked his original visa, he was then taken into Ice custody and has remained imprisoned since. He has asked Ice to let him buy his own ticket back to Iran, but he has not been able to go before an immigration judge and has not been granted bond to at least wait in the US with his daughter.</p> <p>\u201cIt is so egregious. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d said Mehrnoush Yazdanyar, an attorney and sanctions law expert who is helping Asgari\u2019s family and facilitated the Guardian\u2019s interview behind bars. \u201cThis is someone who is being unlawfully detained. Now if he gets corona, his chances of survival are slim to none.\u201d</p> <p>The stakes of his case escalated dramatically after he was taken to ASF on 10 March, just as the coronavirus was officially declared a global pandemic. The professor said the conditions at the facility were unbearable for long-term stays. New detainees are brought in at all hours, meaning it\u2019s impossible to get sleep in his pod, where there can be up to 100 people in bunk beds in a single room. He puts toilet paper in his ears but has struggled to get any rest and now has a sleep disorder.</p> <p>Asgari said there was not enough food.

Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the illness as a fantasy and media \u201chysteria\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>However, despite Lula\u2019s call for impeachment, political specialists believe most members of the opposition oppose such an attempt to unseat Brazil\u2019s far-right president fearing - as was the case in the United States with Donald Trump - that it would allow him to pose as the victim of a political conspiracy.</p> \n  <p>In an article published earlier this week the Brazilian commentator and former communications minister Thomas Traumann said many Bolsonaro opponents believed it was better to let Bolsonaro destroy his political career by himself.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNever interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake,\u201d he wrote, quoting Napoleon Bonaparte.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T12:34:04.162Z\">at 12.34pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c9a218f08af215f6fb9ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jennifer-rankin\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T12:06:02.646Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>European Union</strong> member states have been rebuked by Brussels for only \u201clooking out for themselves\u201d in the early phases of the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p>Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European commission, told the European parliament that too many countries had failed to help their neighbours when the virus first struck Europe.

It came as Russia posted record growth for confirmed coronavirus cases for the second day in a row. Russia now has 840 cases, a rise of 182 in 24 hours. The Kremlin has halted all international air traffic, both for airlines and charter flights, excluding flights repatriating Russian citizens to the country.</p> \n  <p><strong>US deaths exceed 1,000 as Senate approves $2.2tn package</strong></p> \n  <p>US deaths from the coronavirus pandemic have topped 1,000. Worldwide, the death toll climbed past 21,000, according to a running count kept by Johns Hopkins University, and the US had 1,046 deaths and nearly 70,000 infections.

The plan also provides $130bn to hospitals, and expands unemployment insurance.</p> \n  <p><strong>Senators overwhelmingly voted to pass the legislation, approving it 96-0.</strong></p> \n  <p>The House is expected to vote on the bill on Friday. \u201cWe are working to ensure that those who are unable to return to Washington will be able to express their views on this legislation remotely,\u201d said the House leader Steny Hoyer in a statement.</p> \n  <p>Lawmakers scrambled on Wednesday to smooth over snags as they rushed to pass the legislation, which provides direct payments to American families, and loans and grants to businesses. A last-minute amendment, from Republican senators who complained that the bill would incentivize workers to collect unemployment payments rather than take a job, failed.</p> \n  <p>After casting her vote Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat of Massachusetts, said: \u201cThis is not the bill I wanted, but its immediate investments are vital.\u201d \u201cThey are also insufficient,\u201d she added. \u201cWe will need to do more \u2013 and soon.\u201d</p> \n  <p>McConnell similarly reflected on the compromises that Republicans and Democrats made to arrive at the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, hard road, with a remarkable number of twists and turns,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for the sake of millions of Americans, it will be worth it. It will be worth it to get help to millions of small businesses and save tens of millions of jobs.\u201d</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">US Senate passes historic $2tn relief package as coronavirus devastates economy</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:57:09.372Z\">at 3.57am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c27148f08af215f6fb69d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:53:23.661Z\">3.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>CNN reports the vote is 96-0, with four senators absent but nobody opposed. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1243022358539091968\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BREAKING</a>: After a furious partisan fight and days of hard-fought talks, the Senate comes together amid a coronavirus crisis gripping the country and fears of an economic recession, clears rescue package 96-0. \u201cThis is a proud moment for the United States Senate,\u201d McConnell said</p>\u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1243022358539091968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c26778f08af215f6fb698\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:50:24.102Z\">3.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1243018122556211200\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Senate Clerk: \"No Senator voted in the negative.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/0TwOZFsUxb\">pic.twitter.com/0TwOZFsUxb</a></p>\u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1243018122556211200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c24f68f0878a2a48aa5fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:44:44.884Z\">3.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>House members will attempt to approve the package on Friday over the phone. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c23f68f0878a2a48aa5f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:42:12.058Z\">3.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Senate majority leader McConnell is speaking in the press gallery now.</p> \n  <p>Voting isn\u2019t quite done \u2013 there are only 95 senators present \u2013 but McConnell says <b>the package has been passed unopposed. </b></p> \n  <p>The gavel has not come down yet.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T06:33:22.475Z\">at 6.33am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c233a8f081e5eda236ec2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T03:36:43.550Z\">3.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The US Senate vote comes as coronavirus-related deaths in the US pass 1,000. </p> \n  <p>Confirmed infections are also rapidly increasing: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1242961154793750528\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Increase over yesterday in detected coronavirus cases.

Every large car production plant in Europe is now closed as governments try to limit the spread of the disease.</p> <p>The SMMT warned that the production hit could be significantly larger than 200,000 vehicles if the shutdowns last longer than a few weeks. A larger fall could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/22/smmt-car-production-figures\">potentially rival the weakness of 2009</a>.

If we\u2019re to keep this sector alive and in a position to help Britain get back on its feet, we urgently need funding to be released, additional measures to ease pressure on cashflow and clarity on how employment support measures will work.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>I want to talk to Mark Manson about intimacy, a recurring theme throughout the blogger-turned-author\u2019s new Audible Original audiobook, Love Is Not Enough. But the three publicists listening in on our call (another sent her apologies) are killing my vibe. I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re here because of tightened security, put down to Manson\u2019s obscene level of authorial success (his 2016 book The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck has sold more than 10m copies) or if everyone is so enthralled by his wisdom that to sit in is an opportunity too good to pass up.</p> <p>\u201cThank you all for gathering,\u201d one says. Also, \u201cPretend like we\u2019re not even here.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s a deliberate and ingenious metaphor for the blockages that we install in our romantic relationships. After all, the five interviewees that populate Manson\u2019s audiobook have a habit of seeking out shadowy partners \u2013 be they adulterous, narcissistic or just remote \u2013 or they fantasise or self-medicate themselves to a safe distance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/14/love-at-first-sight-narcissism\">Struck dumb: why love at first sight is just another kind of narcissism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s Manson\u2019s mission to reach those who are terrified of intimacy but who are turned cold by traditional self-help speak; hence his penchant for tough-love titles. Like that of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. Its hi-vis orange cover was hardly necessary \u2013 the book seemed to be the most popular accessory of the year. The 2019 follow-up, Everything is F*cked: A Book About Hope, was packed with the same kind of no-frills insights.</p> <p>The Love Is Not Enough audiobook is a return to older territory. Manson started his brand almost by accident in his 20s, when \u2013 inspired by Neil Strauss\u2019s 2005 book The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists \u2013 he started posting tips on PUA (that\u2019s pickup artist) forums. Finding popularity in that, he moved into dating coaching through the site Practical Pickup.</p> <p>\u201cThe online life coaching was a new, exciting thing that was happening on the internet,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI was a young single guy, and so most of the people I was working with were young single people. It really wasn\u2019t until I got older and the audience got bigger that the scope of work expanded into relationships and marriages.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can\u2019t help somebody if you\u2019re judging them</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Manson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2010, after five years in the PUA space \u2013 which was increasingly getting a reputation for misogyny and even inciting violence against women \u2013 Manson made a public exit, and posted on his website a critique of The Game. He self-published the book Models: Attract Women Through Honesty in 2011, then pivoted into more general life guidance for men with the site Post Masculine.</p> <p>So Manson got out early \u2013 and gracefully. A few years later the more controversial PUA organisation Real Social Dynamics followed suit by deleting much of its pickup material and moving into self-development, but not before its founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/11/pick-up-artists-women-targets-julien-blanc-desperate-men-uk-visa\">Julien Blanc, had his Australian visa revoked by Scott Morrison</a> after outcry at footage of him grabbing nonconsenting women. And by 2015 Strauss had written The Truth: An Uncomfortable Book About Relationships, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/10/neil-strauss-the-game-book-truth\">telling the Guardian that he felt \u201ca healthy sense of shame\u201d</a> about The Game.</p> <p>When asked if his change of heart was a 180 or a natural evolution, Manson says, \u201cEarly on, when I was writing dating advice, I was frustrated because I kept running up against the pickup artist stuff. I kept talking to these young guys who had read The Game and these other books, and were just going out and saying and doing the stupidest things. Finally, at some point, a bunch of people told me, \u2018You need to write the antidote to The Game.\u2019 And so that\u2019s that\u2019s where my self-published book came from.\u201d</p> <p>But the big transition didn\u2019t come until 2013, when Manson came to the conclusion that he was repeating himself and not digging deep enough.</p> <p>\u201cI realised that relationship problems don\u2019t happen in a vacuum,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t start dating a married man out of nowhere; there are self-esteem issues, there are identity issues, there are deep insecurities that translate over into other parts of your life.

Vanessa\u2019s voice shakes in her interviews, maybe because the admission of an affair tends to whip up storms of incomparable outrage (as comments in response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/i-had-an-affair-with-my-husband-but-he-has-now-betrayed-me-mariella-frostrup\">letters received by the Guardian\u2019s advice columnist Mariella Frostrup will testify</a>). But Manson joins the ranks of the therapist Esther Perel, who wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/28/esther-perel-the-relationship-guru-who-thinks-infidelity-isnt-all-bad\">The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity</a> and the author Wednesday Martin, who wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/04/untrue-wednesday-martin-review\">Untrue</a>, in tackling the topic analytically.</p> <p>\u201cI was very conscious that you can\u2019t help somebody if you\u2019re judging them,\u201d he says, \u201cand I genuinely believe that the awful things we do in our relationships, we don\u2019t do them because we\u2019re evil or mean, we do them because we\u2019re scared or hurt.\u201d</p> <p>Thus he sees his role as getting to the bottom of that. We can hear the interviewees keen to discuss the minutiae of a situation, as if this is where the mystery lies. Instead, Manson dives beneath the surface, into the murkier waters of values, boundaries and fears. Sometimes, as he says, the stories wind up resolved and tied up in a neat bow; sometimes not.<br><br>Manson allows some transparency about his own life; in his books, in interviews, and also in his live shows, in which he\u2019ll perch informally on the edge of a stage, or sit cross-legged.

In any case, Strauss defined that as \u201cpeacocking\u201d \u2013 wearing something outlandish to set you apart and provide an interesting talking point \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t do at all.</p> <p>Even so, I wonder how he avoids en masse \u201ctransference\u201d \u2013 the Freudian term for when someone projects their feelings for a parent on to their therapist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/14/game-over-why-havent-dating-guides-woken-up-to-new-sexual-politics\">Game over: why haven't dating guides woken up to new sexual politics?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople have this sense that they know me, like they\u2019re friends with me, so it\u2019s more like hanging around after the show and trying to go get a drink with me, or asking what hotel I\u2019m staying at and if I want to hang out,\u201d he says. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve had to learn throughout my career is to manage that relationship with my audience and set boundaries. So I am transparent with the public [in that] I am willing to talk about my life but also I\u2019ve learned the lines that I won\u2019t cross.\u201d</p> <p>As we wind up, I mention the unavoidable fact that we\u2019re going through a global transition period, a time forcing us to accept and adapt. In The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Manson wrote that everything positive has some associated sacrifice or cost. But might we feel under undue pressure to have some earth-shattering epiphany about our lives right now?</p> <p>\u201cI think epiphanies are overrated,\u201d he says. \u201cI think most of our important life changes are actually just a series of tiny 1% changes that compound over time. And then, instead of recognising all of the little decisions that added up to the big change, we just look back and invent the story for ourselves \u2013 \u2018Oh yeah, it was that one time where my dad got in the car accident that changed everything.\u2019 And that\u2019s very rarely the case.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022<em> <a href=\"https://www.audible.com.au/pd/Love-Is-Not-Enough-Audiobook/B084NZBQBZ\">Love Is Not Enough by Mark Manson</a> is out now through Audible Originals</em></p>",
