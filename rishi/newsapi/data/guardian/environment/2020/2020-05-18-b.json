On Monday, the country posted 8,926 new cases, the lowest in weeks.</p> \n  <p>But concerns about the actual death toll of the disease have grown amid worrying reports from Dagestan and several other regions of hundreds of deaths from pneumonia, many of whom may have been infected with coronavirus but not tallied due to Russia\u2019s conservative autopsy standards. The country has tallied just 2,722 deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>The health minister of Dagestan, a southern Russian region of nearly three million people, said on Sunday that while officially 29 people in the republic had died of Covid-19, another 657 people had died of \u201ccommunity-acquired pneumonia,\u201d a sickness often contracted by those infected with coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>He also confirmed that more than 40 medics in Dagestan had died since the coronavirus crisis began, a concern that had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/painful-to-see-rise-in-russian-medics-falling-prey-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-questioned\">raised concerns across Russia</a>, but claimed that many had died of causes other than coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Other regions also appeared to indicate that death rates from pneumonia were many times higher than from coronavirus. The St. Petersburg governor also announced late last week that 694 people had died from pneumonia since 1 March, while just 63 people had officially died of coronavirus and been added to Russia\u2019s tally of deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s mortality rate from the disease is considerably lower than other countries with more than 100,000 infections. The Kremlin has said that is attributable to the country\u2019s medical system, while critics have noted that deaths are tallied differently than in most countries in Europe and North America. New data from Moscow last week indicated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-russia-defends-its-exceptionally-precise-covid-19-death-data\">nearly 1,600 people with coronavirus</a> had died since the outbreak began, but that just 639 were included on official death tolls from the disease after autopsies found other causes of death.</p> \n  <p>Many academics believe that excess death rates are the best way to evaluate the total death toll from the disease.

the situation is stabilising. </p> \n  <p>Health officials reported 8,926 new infections in the last 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s total to 290,678, the second-highest in the world after the <strong>United States</strong>. </p> \n  <p>It was the lowest number of new virus cases since 1 May, when Russia announced 7,933 cases. </p> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s consumer health watchdog chief,

At least 315,187<strong> </strong>people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</li> \n   <li><strong>US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%. </strong>US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan </strong><strong>falls into recession. </strong>Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data on Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared with the previous quarter.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. </strong>South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement.

Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. </strong>In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile, Spain<strong> </strong>recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period.</li> \n   <li><strong>Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps, says UN chief. </strong>Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. </li> \n   <li><strong>WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion. </strong>The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">which opens virtually on Monday</a>, before one of its committees. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room.</li> \n   <li><strong>India extends lockdown by another two weeks. </strong>India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states.

The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. Meanwhile Spain<strong> </strong>has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared.

The Mensa-botherers among you may have deduced that, with this being a liveblog about a match between Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen, the answer is likely to be either a) Werder Bremen or b) Bayer Leverkusen.</p> <p>This is the 57th season since the Bundesliga was introduced in 1963-64. Bremen have been involved in 56 of them, one more than Bayern Munich and Hamburger SV. They\u2019ve won it four times, too, so it\u2019s pretty shocking to see the mess they\u2019re in. (You may not have been aware of this mess until two minutes ago, but it\u2019s okay: we\u2019re all Bundesliga experts now.) </p> <p>Bremen are second from bottom, have been for a while. They are nine points off complete safety and five off a relegation play-off place. And while they have two games in hand, one of them tonight, their points-per-game ratio so far this season suggests those matches are worth precisely 1.5 points.</p> <p>They have a tough game tonight against a Leverkusen side whose form between the winter break and spring break was almost as good as Bayern Munich\u2019s. It\u2019s probably too late for a title challenge but they are are right in contention for next season\u2019s Champions League. Leverkusen have some outstanding young players, including Jonathan Tah, Leon Bailey and <em>the </em>Kai Havertz, who may fill in up front in the absence of the injured Kevin Volland.</p> <p>Bremen might benefit from the lack of a home crowd, because their form at the Weserstadion has been abysmal. They haven\u2019t won a Bundesliga game there since the start of September; they haven\u2019t even drawn one since the start of November. Not even a two-month absence due to a global pandemic can polish those statistics.<br></p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>7.30pm BST, 8.30pm CET.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T17:22:00.072Z\">at 6.22pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

The third stage would see matches resume behind closed doors. The league said it would send inspectors to training grounds to ensure the protocols were followed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/18/premier-league-will-be-allowed-to-ride-shotgun-into-unknown-frontier\">Premier League will be allowed to ride shotgun into unknown frontier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The date of any first fixture looks to have been pushed back, perhaps to the end of June, which would mean a mid-August finish, but following the successful Bundesliga relaunch this past weekend Premier League plans are gathering pace.</p> <p>Whenever matches resume, however, fans will still be missing from grounds for some time afterwards, according to the league\u2019s medical adviser Mark Gillett, who has been involved in talks with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve sat on the DCMS group [directing the return of elite sport] with a very high level of medical input from Public Health England and the chief medical officer\u2019s department,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve made it very clear that the social situation, the public health situation is not going to change over the next six to 12 months. It is important that people understand that.\u201d</p> <p>Asked to confirm that the league expects fans to be missing next season, the league\u2019s chief executive, Richard Masters, said: \u201cWe have to plan for all eventualities.\u201d</p> <p>Monday\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting saw agreement on a plan in which \u201csafety in the working environment\u201d was key, according to Gillett. It would allow players to return to training in small groups but they would be forced to maintain physical distancing at all times. </p> <p>These measures were the easy part. The difficulties begin with contact training and Masters confirmed that a frantic period will follow in which drafts for a second set of protocols will be completed, shared with players and managers then debated and likely voted on by clubs.</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked to the players or even to the clubs yet about a return to contact training, in terms of the fine details of protocols,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re anticipating we can do that in the next week to 10 days.\u201d</p> <p>Steps are being taken to make sure clubs do not breach the guidelines. Richard Garlick, the league\u2019s director of football, said an \u201cindependent audit inspection team\u201d would visit on a \u201cno-notice basis\u201d and added: \u201cGradually, we aim to ramp that up so we can have an inspector at every training ground. That will enable us to give confidence the protocols are being complied with.\u201d</p> <p>Regarding concerns over the greater risks posed to black, Asian and minority ethnic players from Covid-19, Gillett said the league would be monitoring the situation. \u201cWe will do everything we can to mitigate against it \u2026 as more information becomes available,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the risk in young fit athletes is still very small and I think that is an important factor.\u201d</p> <p>Should contact training be approved, work would move in short order to a third stage: the matches themselves. Gillett admitted that current Public Health England advice could require players to enter quarantine 14 days before any match. Masters, meanwhile, confirmed that discussions were continuing with police and government over venues, but noted that there were no problems caused by fans outside Bundesliga grounds.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a good start,\u201d Masters said of German football\u2019s return and the Premier League was watching closely. Masters said they have plans to deliver a different television product, though, with a working group generating ideas for how to create an atmosphere despite the empty grounds.</p> <p>Even though any resumption will be on TV, clubs look set to pay broadcasters a rebate on their fees, despite many being against it. \u201cThey appreciate the situation football finds itself in,\u201d Masters said of Sky and BT. \u201cWe also appreciate the situation that they are faced with as well.\u201d</p> <p>Masters was less conciliatory on the future of the football pyramid. The EFL has called on the Premier League to provide a financial rescue package for stricken lower-league clubs, a call apparently backed by government last week. But Masters, faced with his own financial crisis, did not offer his colleagues much hope of a bailout.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are able to play our games and securely start season 2020-21 then we will have hopefully managed to some extent the financial issues facing the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there will still be significant losses in terms of central revenue and to Premier League clubs because of the loss of match-day revenue. So it\u2019s a complicated situation, but we want to continue to support the EFL and make good our community commitments.\u201d</p>",

The chores included walking the family dog, picking up dry cleaning and making dinner reservations.</p> <p>The details of the errands were first published by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fired-state-department-watchdog-was-looking-whether-pompeo-made-staffer-n1208981\">NBC News</a> and the investigation into the Saudi arms sales was first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/18/trumps-purge-just-got-much-more-corrupt-heres-whats-coming-next/\">Washington Post</a> on Monday.</p> <p>\u201c[Linick\u2019s] office was investigating \u2013 at my request \u2013 Trump\u2019s phony declaration of an emergency so he could send weapons to Saudi Arabia,\u201d Eliot Engel, the Democratic chair of the House foreign affairs committee said in a written statement.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the full picture yet, but it\u2019s troubling that Secretary Pompeo wanted Mr Linick pushed out before this work could be completed.\u201d</p> <p>Pompeo claimed he was unaware he was being investigated by the inspector general and insisted he called for Linick\u2019s firing because he was \u201cundermining\u201d the state department\u2019s work.</p> <p>\u201cI went to the president and made clear to him that Inspector General Linick wasn\u2019t performing a function in a way that we had tried to get him to, that was additive for the state department, very consistent with what the statute says he\u2019s supposed to be doing,\u201d Pompeo told the Washington Post. \u201cThe kinds of activities he\u2019s supposed to undertake to make us better, to improve us.\u201d</p> <p>Pompeo did not provide evidence but a state department official, Brian Bulatao, said there had been a pattern of leaks of draft inspector general reports.</p> <p>Pompeo\u2019s claim to have no knowledge he was under investigation conflict with a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/18/linick-administration-arms-sales-saudi-arabia-265024\">report in Politico </a>on Monday that he had refused to sit for an interview with the inspector general\u2019s office about the Saudi arms sales. </p> <p>In his letter on Friday, announcing Linick\u2019s dismissal, Trump said he no longer had full confidence in him. On Monday, he said he had never heard of Linick before being asked to fire him.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him. Never heard of him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut they asked me to terminate him. I have the absolute right as president to terminate. I said who appointed him, and they say: President Obama. I said: look I\u2019ll terminate him.\u201d</p> <p>The president ridiculed the allegations against Pompeo as trivial, saying his secretary of state could have been too busy to do domestic chores himself.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s negotiating with Kim Jong-un about nuclear weapons so that he said: \u2018Do you mind walking my dog \u2013 I\u2019m talking to Kim Jong-un,\u2019\u201d the president said, adding that he had been unaware of the investigations when he fired Linick. \u201cI think this country has a long way to go. The priorities are really screwed up.\u201d</p> <p>Engel and the lead Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Menendez, launched an investigation on Saturday into Linick\u2019s firing.</p> <p>\u201cReports indicate that Secretary Pompeo personally made the recommendation to fire Mr Linick, and it is our understanding that he did so because the inspector general had opened an investigation into wrongdoing by Secretary Pompeo himself,\u201d Engel and Menendez said in a joint statement. \u201cSuch an action, transparently designed to protect Secretary Pompeo from personal accountability, would undermine the foundation of our democratic institutions and may be an illegal act of retaliation.\u201d</p> <p>Engel called for all relevant state department records to be turned over to Congress by Friday.</p> <p>Pompeo has been under scrutiny for his behaviour in office for several months. Last July, congressional Democrats launched an inquiry into the use of diplomatic security agents to run family errands like collecting the family dog from the grooming salon and picking up Chinese food. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/pompeo-democrats-whistleblower-claims/index.html\">CNN reported</a> the bodyguards were complaining of being treated like \u201cUberEats with guns\u201d.</p> <p>The head of the diplomatic security service at the time denied the agents had been asked to do anything \u201cinconsistent with our professional obligation to protect the secretary 24 hours a day, seven days a week\u201d.

Clubs are cultural assets. Their good health is important. Football supports a large associated workforce outside the better-off elite players. But it is also in everyone\u2019s interest to be clear on the sense of commercial urgency that lies behind every decision taken along the way, including those successfully voted through at Monday\u2019s Premier League meeting.</p> <p>It is a gentle first step. As of Tuesday afternoon clubs can return to carefully managed individual training, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/11/england-players-expected-to-complete-cricket-based-work-in-pairs\" title=\"\">same process England\u2019s cricketers</a> will shortly begin, and the same kind of thing that is happening in parks all around the country.</p> <p>The next phase will involve training in groups of up to six, possibly from next week. Finally clubs will look to agree 11-versus-11 training, presumably with the kind of token restrictions seen in the Bundesliga over the weekend, with masks for substitutes and prim attempts to enforce physical distancing.</p> <p>After which the Premier League will look to restart close to, on, or slightly after its current flag in the sand, 15 June.</p> <p>There will of course be extreme reactions to this process. Understandably so: we are in an extreme situation. The first of these is the obvious response that it is unsafe to consider playing professional football right now, and that all attempts to do so will put lives at risk.</p> <p>The other main objection is that the football produced will be a shabby, synthetic imitation, a shotgun wedding before an empty congregation; and that it will therefore be unfair on those who stand to lose (ie experience relegation) given the skewed sporting environment.</p> <p>Both of these objections are unarguably valid. At the same time both are, in some sense, immaterial to what is about to happen.</p> <p>Firstly, on risk. There is no doubt that football\u2019s return will be hurried through ahead of what can be deemed absolutely safe, and that thanks to its clout and profile the Premier League will be allowed to ride shotgun into this unknown frontier.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/16/germany-borussia-dortmund-schalke\" title=\"\">Bundesliga may have returned successfully</a> last weekend, but there are good reasons for this. Germany has a quarter of the UK death toll to date. Germany has six times fewer new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed every day. Germany has a mature, competent leadership with a clear and transparent plan.</p> <p>The Bundesliga itself still has its 51% ownership rule, still retains a community aspect at the top level, and still seems able to act in a climate of general good faith. Germany has earned its place at the front of this queue, although even then there are plenty with misgivings about the resumption.</p> <p>These include some medical professionals. There are concerns Covid-19 remains essentially a mystery disease, one whose long-term effects on the body are unknown. Footballers often have brittle immune systems due to the high intensity of their training. What is certain is that English football is a ruthless business that will push its component parts as far as they can go. Would you trust its opinion on your pre-scandal asbestos roof, or the smoking \u201chealth-scare\u201d? Would you trust it with a trunk full of plutonium?</p> <p>It is also worth being clear about who exactly is most at risk from the Premier League resuming. According to official figures the highest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/manual-workers-likelier-to-die-from-covid-19-than-professionals\" title=\"\">death rate from Covid-19 up to 20 April</a> was among men working in low-skilled leisure and service occupations; or in other words those on the periphery, those who make the industry work as opposed to those making the decisions.</p> <p>Cleaners, carpenters, electricians, manual workers, security guards, transport drivers: these are the people who have died in large numbers with this disease, not CEOs or athletes. These are the people football will vote to put further at risk as the return to action approaches.</p> <p>And yet, at the same time it is self-evident that this is going to happen. And that in pressing forward the Premier League is simply following the tide of British society\u2019s governing and corporate classes. Every decision taken right now involves an appalling balancing act, between virus control and total economic collapse. Every decision is by definition pragmatic and flawed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/saudi-regime-newcastle-united-jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman\">The Saudi regime murdered my fiance. It can't be allowed to buy Newcastle United | Hatice Cengiz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Against this background it would be absurd to expect English football and the Premier League to make sense of it all, to set some noble and self-sacrificing example. This is a league whose members, we hear via noises off, are concerned their fraternal brothers in arms will lie about infection rates to get matches cancelled (the Maya Angelou quote about believing someone when they tell you who they are springs to mind).</p> <p>This is an organisation lashed together by shared self-interest, whose members have spent the last two months scrabbling for handholds like the doomed ship\u2019s crew on the Raft of the Medusa as it slips beneath the waves. Don\u2019t expect caution or selflessness when these are scarcely present elsewhere in society. And perhaps, who knows, there is something to be said for simply ploughing ahead when all is uncertain.</p> <p>Against this background it seems absurd to object that the rejigged season\u2019s end will be either artificial or unfair. This may well be the case, but on the other hand the basic stitching of society is also coming apart, so there\u2019s that too.</p> <p>And let\u2019s face it, elite level football is already unfair. Football isn\u2019t unfair because of an absence of home fans for a few rescheduled matches. It\u2019s skewed because of its ludicrous finances, because the rich can dominate and get richer. This is not a function of an unexpected bat virus.</p> <p>At which point, with best wishes and fingers crossed for all involved, it is now all systems go for Phase One. A few things seem certain at this point. It\u2019s going to be divisive, messy and worrying in so many ways. Or in other words, it\u2019s going to be quite a lot like football.</p>",
  "<p>The first results from human trials of a vaccine against Covid-19 have given a glimmer of hope after a US firm\u2019s study produced positive results in a group of eight volunteers.</p> <p>These results \u2013 which come a day after the UK government revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/17/uk-plans-38m-centre-to-start-production-of-coronavirus-vaccine\">a deal to secure 30m doses </a>of a rival Oxford University vaccine, should it be successful \u2013 showed that each of the participants produced an antibody response on a par with that seen in people who have had the disease.

The higher the vaccine dose, the more antibodies the volunteer produced.</p> <p>However, as with antibody tests, there will still be questions over whether this response is enough to prevent people from being infected by the virus.

Robin Shattock, professor of mucosal infection and immunity, who is leading the Imperial trials, said the Moderna findings were encouraging. \u201cWhile it will be important to scrutinise the actual data, the reported findings are in line with expectations that vaccine candidates should provide levels of neutralising antibodies that are at least equivalent to convalescent subjects,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a promising start, but efficacy data will be key followed by an ability to scale in a manner that provides global access should this vaccine be successful.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, also gave the news a cautious welcome. \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t bad news and there are a number of good points that suggest optimism that this vaccine may work,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/14/they-know-what-theyre-doing-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-trial-volunteer-praises-staff\">'I felt guilty': volunteer on signing up for Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oxford University has published results of safety trials in macaque monkeys.

  "<p>Why is the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/tories-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-key-workers-with-immigration-bill\" title=\"\">pressing ahead</a> with an immigration policy that was designed for a world that no longer exists? Brexit\u2019s strident rhetoric posited falsehoods about migrant workers being behind depressed wages, housing shortages and stressed public services. But that was before coronavirus. Many Britons have woken up now to the fact that vital sectors in the NHS, social care and food production have been kept going by low-paid EU and non-European workers of the kind whose numbers the home secretary, Priti Patel, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52701843\" title=\"\">plans</a> to restrict.</p> <p>Ms Patel\u2019s immigration bill claims it is introducing a points-based system, but it is more an income-based one. She proposes to end freedom of movement from the EU and apply the same salary threshold and skills requirement to prospective migrants wherever they come from. The rules are due to take effect in January and it is estimated that <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/news-and-media/press-releases/immigration-plans-analysis-two-thirds-of-current-eu-migrants-in-health-and-care-sector-would-have-been-found-ineligible\" title=\"\">two-thirds</a> of EU migrants now classed as key workers would not qualify for a work visa next year. The bill fails because the crisis has shown that salary alone is a poor guide to a person\u2019s value to society.</p> <p>The political argument for a tough regime is also fading. The public was warming to immigration before the pandemic struck and there was outrage over the injustice perpetuated on a generation of Caribbean migrants in the Windrush scandal. Polls show <a href=\"https://twitter.com/britishfuture/status/1262389476128690176?s=20\" title=\"\">widespread public sympathy</a> for low-paid foreign employees in the NHS and care sector.</p> <p>The economic case for revisiting the policy is even stronger. The coming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/uk-economy-shrank-2-in-first-quarter-record-monthly-plunge-ons-cfovid-19-lockdown-gdp\" title=\"\">recession</a> is unlikely to make Britain attractive to migrants. Travel is also probably going to remain restricted, limiting the scope to find work. Foreign students, the lifeblood of many universities and the towns that house them, will not rush back to Britain. The disruption to travel is expected to be lasting: <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52436741\" title=\"\">Airbus has cut plane production by a third</a>. It\u2019s hard to see the sense in continuing with a bill to limit immigration when the shutdown has done that anyway.</p> <p>In an era of high unemployment, jobs that British workers have been able to choose not to do might be more attractive than they previously were. There has been a jump in applications to <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-28/surge-in-applications-to-work-for-nhs-during-pandemic/\" title=\"\">work in the NHS</a> during the pandemic. The government will need to put more money into training and pay. It is obvious why there are so few local workers in social care when \u2013 after a decade of local government austerity \u2013 hourly pay in a largely private sector is lower than in <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2019/08/average-pay-for-care-workers\" title=\"\">supermarkets</a>.</p> <p>Ms Patel ought to be generous and relax the proposed restrictions. She could do so without incurring political cost, as polls show support to exempt lower-paid frontline migrant workers. She did not take the opportunity in the Commons on Monday. This was a mistake. It is also wrong for Ms Patel to force foreign health staff to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/priti-patel-nhs-fees-foreign-health-staff-immigration-surcharge-a9517356.html\" title=\"\">pay extra to fund the NHS</a>. Large-scale immigration changes rarely work as intended \u2013 and one this size delivered in just seven months looks no different. Labour\u2019s Nick Thomas-Symonds was right to caution that widening the scope of ministerial sway over immigration amounted to an executive power grab.</p> <p>A blitzkrieg advance by ministers over immigration would be expected after Brexit, which remains the glue that holds Boris Johnson\u2019s government together. But the Covid-19 pandemic has made the public understandably fearful. When people are anxious they tend to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit\" title=\"\">re-evaluate their beliefs</a>. The shock of the virus has opened the political conversation to ideas beyond Brexit about what sort of society will work for all. For the sake of the country, the government ought to embrace them.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>What are bank and agency temporary care staff?</strong></h2> <p>Some care-home providers employ a bank of care workers who are available to send into short-staffed homes. They are often employed on zero-hours contracts, work across several homes in one area and make up about 10% of the social care workforce. Agency care workers are also paid by the day and tend to earn slightly more than staff, who on average receive just \u00a38.10 per hour \u2013 less than shop workers and cleaners. Care homes are three times more likely to rely on staff supplied by agencies than other parts of the labour market, according to the Office for National Statistics labour force survey.</p> <h2><strong>Why are they needed?</strong></h2> <p>Care homes went into the Covid-19 crisis with about 120,000 vacancies. The low pay and lack of prestige associated with the job has made recruitment hard. This is partly down to low levels of public funding for social care, which have fallen in real terms over the last decade. Tight margins for operators mean that using zero-hours and temporary workers is more attractive in business terms than having surplus permanent staff. Eighty percent of care workers are women and the average age is 43, so they often have responsibilities looking after children and elderly parents, which can require last-minute shift changes.</p> <h2><strong>What has their role been during the pandemic?</strong></h2> <p>Care homes have been beset by staff absences, with up to 25% of workers having to self-isolate during the peak weeks of the crisis. The national volunteering push focused on asking people to help the NHS, so care providers have turned to agency and bank staff. Care UK, a chain of homes which has lost 586 residents to confirmed or suspected Covid-19, said it used agency staff as \u201ca last resort to avoid falling short of safe staffing levels\u201d. Bupa, which has lost 198 residents to confirmed cases, also used agency staff but said it asked them to first confirm they did not have symptoms and had not been in an environment with confirmed or suspected cases in the last two weeks. However, the Public Health England study of care homes found evidence that asymptomatic staff were passing on the virus.</p> <h2><strong>How easy will it be for care homes to operate without them?</strong></h2> <p>Testing of asymptomatic care home staff, which is becoming more widespread, will increase absences, so the need for temporary staff will grow in the short term. HC-One, the UK\u2019s largest provider of private care homes, which has had 903 residents die from confirmed or suspected Covid-19, said it had \u201cbegun to allocate bank staff to a home so they are not moving from home to home\u201d. It has also started talks over the exclusive use of agency staff, but these are not finalised. It has 24,000 staff, but 1,500 are already off work because of the pandemic. Recruitment campaigns are under way to find more permanent staff from the hospitality and retail sectors where unemployment has soared. But care leaders argue it will take time, better pay and training to reduce vacancies and create a more stable workforce.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>The famous Canova cafe, in Rome\u2019s Piazza del Popolo, was once Federico Fellini\u2019s preferred spot for a morning coffee. On Monday the Canova was in the spotlight again as it reopened its doors, in glorious sunshine, after two and a half months of lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful, exciting day,\u201d said Valentino Casanova, one of the cafe\u2019s barmen, whose words <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists\" title=\"\">were reported</a> around the world.</p> <p>The reopening this week of Italy\u2019s restaurants and bars \u2013 albeit with tight restrictions in place \u2013 is undoubtedly an uplifting moment. Italy alerted the rest of Europe to the gravity of the Covid-19 pandemic; the return of its <em>osterie</em> and <em>trattorie</em> feels like a triumph of civilised pleasures over the annihilating bleakness of the virus. But no one in Italy is hailing a restoration of <em>la </em><em>dolce </em><em>vita</em>, as shutters are raised and tables are laid out in piazzas once more. In places such as Canova, seating capacity will have to be reduced by at least 40% for the foreseeable future. Running at around half capacity, with extra safety measures to pay for, many are likely to go the wall.</p> <p>The bigger economic picture is equally challenging. At the weekend, Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-18/the-man-few-thought-would-last-steers-italy-in-worst-of-times?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">told fellow citizens</a> that the country was taking a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d by loosening the lockdown, but that it could not afford to wait around for a vaccine. After 20 years of stagnation, racked by huge public debt and heading for inevitable recession, Italy\u2019s economy now faces the fight of its life.</p> <p>The European commission forecasts a downturn of more than 9% this year. That would send the country\u2019s public debt soaring to over 155% of GDP \u2013 easily the highest ratio, after Greece, in the eurozone. Yet with business on its knees, the government has been obliged to up the ante on spending. Mr Conte\u2019s government <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-stimulus/italy-finally-approves-economic-stimulus-package-in-virus-fight-idUSKBN22P2YE\" title=\"\">signed off</a> last week on a stimulus package worth $59.6bn. This injection of cash, combined with a steep fall in tax revenue, is likely to drive the annual budget deficit up to more than 10% of GDP.</p> <p>Governments across Europe are, of course, facing similar problems, after sending economies into hibernation. But Italy\u2019s debt levels make it uniquely vulnerable. There are ominous signs that the markets are beginning to turn the screw. One ratings agency recently reduced Italy\u2019s credit status to one notch above junk, and government bond yields are steadily <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-18/italy-s-huge-debt-load-is-at-risk-of-becoming-unmanageable?sref=ihi5JR1z\" title=\"\">creeping upwards</a>.</p> <p>It is in this menacing context that the European Union may soon have a crucial judgment to make. Along with the leaders of eight other countries, including France, Spain and Portugal, Mr Conte <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/italys-conte-threatens-to-block-next-eu-summit-over-eurobonds/\" title=\"\">has called for</a> a new common EU debt instrument to raise funds to assist recovery. Germany and the Netherlands have resisted this idea, pointing to existing options such as the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19870747\" title=\"\">European stability mechanism</a>, which allows for countries in difficulty to receive guaranteed loans.</p> <p>At root, this is a debate about how much Europe\u2019s stronger economies should share risk with weaker members of the eurozone, in the context of an unforeseen public health emergency. How it plays out could have significant political consequences. Recent polls have indicated that Italian Euroscepticism is on the rise: the country felt let down by a <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-aims-better-control-coronavirus-responses/\" title=\"\">lack of solidarity</a> in the early weeks of the crisis, as EU capitals failed to respond to urgent requests to send personal protective equipment, such as face masks.

It went on for longer than usual, and covered a wide range of topics. Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Downing Street has played down prospects of its new contact tracing system being up and running nationwide this month. </strong>The system is being piloted in the Isle of Wight. At one point Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that he wanted to have the whole system up and running by the middle of May. But, when the prime minister\u2019s spokesman was asked when it would be fully operational, he just said that this would happen \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that 17,000 contact tracers were already in place and that the government was \u201cvery confident\u201d of getting the numbers up to 18,000 by the end of this week, as planned</strong>. The contact tracers are getting a range of training, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>A decision is likely this week as to whether the government will go ahead with plans for some primary school pupils in England to start going back on 1 June (a fortnight today), the spokesman signalled.</strong> The UK government\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan said Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils would go back \u201cno earlier than Monday 1 June\u201d. The spokesman confirmed that this was still the position, but he accepted that 1 June (the Monday after half term, for many pupils) remained an ambition. Asked when the government would be able to say if this would be the date, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can see from the discussions that have taken place ... that we are working to seek to resolve this as soon as we can.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When it was put to him that in practice this meant a decision this week, because next week is half term, the spokesman did not challenge this assumption. He said that the safety of pupils came first, but that the government was also aware of the damage being done to children from their not being in education.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the government would publish its scientific advice about the safety of children being in school \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.</strong> On Friday the government published<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/885631/Overview_of_scientific_advice_and_information_on_coronavirus_COVID19.pdf\"> an overview on this topic (pdf)</a>, he said. But the teaching unions want to see the full scientific advice. Asked when they would get it, the spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Sage [Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] papers are being published in batches, and the DfE papers will be published as soon as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government does not necessarily need to have its new contact tracing system operational nationwide for it to move to the \u201cstep two\u201d stage of the lockdown relaxation measures set out in its plan, the spokesman suggested.</strong> He said various factors would be taken into account before the government moved to step two, such as the reproduction number. But he said the government had not made having the contact tracing system up and running an essential condition.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The quarantine rules being imposed on new arrivals to the UK will be reviewed every three weeks, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. </strong>He confirmed that the government is planning to issue more details of how the scheme will work \u201cin due course\u201d. But when the quarantine rules are introduced, they will be \u201csubject to rolling review every three weeks\u201d, the spokesman said, to ensure that they are in line with the latest scientific advice. That suggests that they will be reviewed in parallel with the existing lockdown regulations, which also have to be reviewed every three weeks. Those rules are next being reviewed on 28 May. The spokesman would not say whether this meant the quarantine rules could come into force on that date.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman insisted that there had never been an exemption for France.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb84a3c8f08c0a2409bb2ea#block-5eb84a3c8f08c0a2409bb2ea\">A joint statement from the British and French governments</a> on the night of the PM\u2019s TV broadcast clearly implied that an exemption for France was being planned. But the spokesman rejected this. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There was never an exemption for France. All the statement ever said was that there would be no quarantine in relation to France at this time. It was never correct to suggest that there was going to be an exemption for France only.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The spokesman claimed the original statement had been misreported by the media.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman defended the government\u2019s decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">to maintain the immigration health surcharge</a> - a charge paid by immigrants to cover their possible use of the NHS. </strong>This has become particularly controversial because it applies to people who are actually working themselves for the NHS. Asked to justify the charge, the spokesman said that the government committed to increasing it in its election manifesto and that it had raised \u00a3900m directly for the NHS by the end of the 2018-19 financial year.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that latest data showed that 38% of care homes in England have had a coronavirus outbreak. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that the decision to add loss of smell to the official list of coronavirus symptoms (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-trains-rail-work-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec261f98f08a1782fa7cbae#block-5ec261f98f08a1782fa7cbae\">11.29am)</a> was expected to increase the number of cases by 2%.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that the NHS Nightingale hospital at the Birmingham NEC was now on standby. </strong>Like the one at the ExCel centre in London, it has effectively been mothballed. The spokesman said that the Manchester one has patients. But another three of the seven in England, in Harrogate, Bristol and Sunderland, are open but without patients, he said. He said an eighth was being built in Exeter and would be operational at the end of the month.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman rejected suggestions that Boris Johnson was responsible for people not realising that Wales now has tighter lockdown rules than England. </strong>At the weekend <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2020-05-17/police-turn-away-people-travelling-to-pembrokeshire-from-england-over-weekend/\">English people travelling to Wales to walk in the countryside were turned away</a>, even though this is allowed in England. When Johnson announced the rules were being relaxed in his TV address, he was criticised for not being more explicit about how this only applied to England. But, when asked if he was responsible for English people being fined by Welsh police, the spokesman did not accept that. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We were very clear from the outset that people would need to respect the rules in Wales.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said the prime minister was feeling \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d.</strong> Asked why the PM was not taking more press conferences himself (like Nicola Sturgeon, who almost always leads the Scottish government\u2019s one), the spokesman said: \u201cNot for a specific reason. The PM did the press conference last week and I\u2019m sure you will see him again shortly.\u201d </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, will take this afternoon\u2019s press conference, the spokesman said.</strong> Raab will appear with Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman indicated that the PM was happy about Sir Mark Sedwill being cabinet secretary and national security adviser.</strong> Some MPs reportedly want him to separate the two roles. In the Spectator last week <strong>James Forsyth</strong> wrote:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One hawk in government says that this issue has been compounded by cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill staying on as national security adviser. They complain that in a well-functioning system the national security adviser would have challenged the cabinet secretary on the Huawei decision, but that can\u2019t happen when the national security adviser and the cabinet secretary are the same person. A break-up of Sir Mark\u2019s empire looks inevitable.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But the spokesman said today that Sedwill had been \u201csuccessfully fulfilling both roles since June 2018\u201d. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T15:13:59.530Z\">at 4.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec27f8a8f0886ce4f5d5ac6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/stevenmorris\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T12:29:06.472Z\">1.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Welsh first minister has denied his government has been slow to offer Covid-19 tests to everyone in care homes in Wales.</p> \n  <p>Opposition politicians said the original decision not to test all residents and staff in care homes should be the subject of a future inquiry.</p> \n  <p><strong>Mark Drakeford</strong> insisted the government\u2019s position had been led by the science and initially the focus needed to be on care homes where there had been confirmed or suspected cases.

  "<p>The Eternal City absent of traffic and chaos is something we\u2019ve dreamed of. In my lifetime in Rome, I\u2019ve experienced the city almost empty on a few occasions: usually late-night and early-morning walks home, but nothing like the past two months.</p> <p>On 11 March, Rome was silenced. Doors were closed, residents stayed inside and the pace of a frenetic city slowed to that of a faint beat. For 54 days there was no traffic, no street-side chatter and no tourists. The only movement was that of the delivery bikes and scooters passing in the streets below the apartment.</p> <p>On 4 May, when the <em>centro storico</em> reopened, we returned to our city. The oval-shaped Piazza Navona became a jogging track, Piazza della Rotonda turned into a great training ground for fledgling cyclists and Corso Vittorio Emanuele II was commandeered by skateboarders. For two weeks, we lived in our own utopia \u2013 it was just us and Rome. Even the former golden boy of Italian football, Roma\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbtmsd7VmCU\">Francesco Totti, and wife Ilary, </a>enjoyed the empty streets. </p> <p>As of 18 May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists\">Italy\u2019s bars, restaurants, shops and beauty salons c</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-italy-reopens-cafes-as-spain-prepares-for-return-of-tourists\">ould open for business</a>. So, at 10 am, I walk out of my palazzo in Rome\u2019s historic centre and into a street scene that could be any typical Monday morning: couriers run along the road, handfuls of people enter and exit the tram, and there is a long line for the post office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2ac83e8bf22e92692a81005078ec71df07166af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2ac83e8bf22e92692a81005078ec71df07166af/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedestrians take to Rome\u2019s streets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedestrians take to Rome\u2019s streets</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erica Firpo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I call my cousin Giovanna who lives in Prati, a nearby neighbourhood.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird. It feels like we\u2019re back to normal. Everyone\u2019s at the bar downstairs all <em>baci abbracci</em> (kisses and hugs) but with masks on,\u201d I tell her.</p> <p>I bike to my local market. On via dei Giubbonari, shopkeepers are setting up and residents are walking around. People sit, socially distanced, at the tables of an outdoor cafe. Mostly everyone is wearing a masks. Reality sets in by the time I arrive at Campo de\u2019 Fiori where there are only a handful of vendors, far fewer than there usually are.</p> <p>Pippo and Anastasia Nicosia, flower vendors, came back to Campo on 4 May \u2013 and were here this morning at 7am. \u201cIt\u2019s much quieter, fewer people. But we\u2019ve been given a chance to see a Rome that perhaps we lost for a while,\u201d Anastasia says. \u201cWill it pick up? We need to wait before we have an idea what reality will be like \u2026 before we have <em>equilibrio</em>.\u201d</p> <p>She is talking about balance, because right now there is none. The main streets of Rome, such as Via del Corso and Via dei Condotti, are misleadingly busy. There are even buskers, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qcfSBR9ItU\">Luiza Constantin</a>, but shoppers are few. On Via dei Condotti, I bump into Arthur, who came out to be the first to enjoy the boutiques before the return of the crowds. I like his positivity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9824a0efb42de47e19ecceaa8beb64c5fc67a5da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9824a0efb42de47e19ecceaa8beb64c5fc67a5da/0_61_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luiza Constantin busking.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luiza Constantin busking</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erica Firpo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At <a href=\"http://www.ciampini.com/\">Ciampini Caff\u00e8</a>, on Piazza di San Lorenzo in Lucina, I smile when I see that about half of its outdoor tables have customers. \u201cI think people are cautious,\u201d says waiter Vicenzo Macri, \u201cWe just need to wait a few weeks to see what things will be like. And I have hope that they will be better.\u201d</p> <p>On side streets, shopkeepers anxiously await patrons but other shops are closed, protesting against the government, the pandemic and the lack of clear-cut protocols. Some restaurants will open, like <a href=\"http://lucianocucinaitaliana.com/en/home-eng/\">Luciano Cucina</a> - which has set up distinct dining shifts \u2013 but others have opted to remain shuttered while they plan a strategy for survival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df86981d9f7b9e21818679bdd6719106f28dc14a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df86981d9f7b9e21818679bdd6719106f28dc14a/0_296_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cicli di Bartolomei\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cicli di Bartolomei</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erica Firpo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only my local cycle shop, <a href=\"http://www.ciclidibartolomei.it\">Cicli di Bartolomei</a>, on Piazza di Santa Caterina della Rota, seems to be kicking into a higher gear at reopening \u2013 and rightfully so. Rome is finally attempting to make good on its promise to turn the city into a bike-friendly one, with economic assistance for those who buy bicycles, push- and electric scooters and e-bikes. Alessandro di Bartolomei tells me his retired mother has had to come in to the shop and help out, as it has been so busy since they reopened on 4 May.</p> <p>I make my way home, meandering the side streets. At the Pantheon, a woman takes the perfect Instagram photo of her mother, two businessmen walk quickly across the square and a man enters a sandwich shop, all set to a melodic, live soundtrack of birds chirping. It feels like Ferragosto, the 15 August public holiday, AKA Rome\u2019s beautiful full stop.</p> <p>Rome is trying to find her equilibrio.</p>",
  "<p>One in ten Australians who have lost their jobs during the coronavirus crisis fear they will never work again according to the latest Guardian Essential poll \u2013 and a significant majority of the sample worries the Covid-19 outbreak in China is worse than official statistics suggest.</p> <p>The latest survey of 1,073 respondents suggests the economic shock caused by the pandemic has shaken people\u2019s faith in their short and medium term labour market prospects, with low optimism about wages growth and prospects for promotion once the crisis has passed.</p> <p>Rising levels of concern are unsurprising. More than six million Australians are currently on the jobkeeper wage subsidy and more than a million are on unemployment benefits, known as jobseeker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/australian-jobseekers-to-get-550-increase-as-part-of-huge-coronavirus-welfare-package\">which has been effectively doubled during the crisis</a>.</p> <p>Treasury is forecasting that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/coalition-expects-coronavirus-to-send-australias-unemployment-soaring-to-10\">unemployment will peak at 10%</a>, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/unemployment-rate-in-australia-jumps-to-62-due-to-covid-19-as-600000-jobs-lost\">last week reported that around 2.7 million people</a>, or one in every five person employed in March, either left employment or had their hours reduced between March and April.</p> <p>States and territory governments are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/08/scott-morrison-details-australias-three-step-path-out-of-coronavirus-lockdown\">gradually easing the public health restrictions</a> which led to lockdowns of non-essential services in March \u2013 lockdowns that triggered mass unemployment. While the staged return of retail and hospitality will see many people resume employment, there are concerns the gradual return to normalcy could trigger a second wave of infections in Australia. The chief medical officer Brendan Murphy <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-11/coronavirus-update-australia-covid19-death-toll-brendan-murphy/12233110\">said recently</a> that prospect kept him up at night.</p> <p>The latest survey indicates that less than one in five people in the survey who have lost their jobs because of Covid-19 believe they\u2019ll be back in work straight away (18%) once the crisis has passed. Around a third of the sample (36%) believe it will take them a long time to find paid work once the economy begins to recover and 10% worry they will never find paid work again.</p> <p>The cohort that has remained employed during the crisis is bleak about their personal prospects during the economic recovery. Just 21% agree either strongly or somewhat that they will get a pay rise after the worst has passed, and only 22% think there will be an option for promotion. Just under half the sample thinks their wages will not keep place with inflation, while 19% of the sample thinks wages growth will return during the recovery.</p> <p>The group in the survey who were already unemployed before Covid-19 hit are also pessimistic. Just under half, 43% of people in this category, believe they won\u2019t be able to find a well-paying job in their field at their level of experience, and less than half the group believes there will be appropriate jobs for them.</p> <p>Anxiety in the survey is not limited to people\u2019s material circumstances. It also extends to China, and whether the regime is suppressing relevant information about the virus.</p> <p>A solid majority, 77%, agrees with the statement: \u201cThe outbreak in China is actually much worse than the official Chinese statistics show\u201d. Men and women in the sample hold this view almost equally. Voters aged over the age of 55 are more likely to hold that view than voters aged between 18 and 34.</p> <p>A solid chunk of respondents (39%) also agrees with the statement: \u201cThe Covid-19 virus was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/australia-hits-back-at-us-claim-linking-coronavirus-to-wuhan-lab\">engineered and released from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan</a>\u201d. An equal number of respondents rejects that idea. Again the split between men and women is almost identical, but younger voters are more likely to believe the virus started in a lab than voters aged over 55.</p> <p>The Australian government has pushed back at persistent claims from the Trump administration the coronavirus may have originated in a Wuhan. The government has also determined that a \u201cdossier\u201d giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document, but an open source compilation.</p> <p>Survey respondents this week were asked questions about the various conspiracy theories that have accompanied the global pandemic, with substantial majorities rejecting many of the high rotation hypotheses. More than 70% disagreed with the statement: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-death-overcount-anthony-fauci\">The number of Covid-19 deaths have been exaggerated by the media and governments</a> to scare the population\u201d. 20% of respondents thought that was true.</p> <p>More than 70% (71%) disagreed with the statement: \u201cBill Gates played a role in the creation and spread of Covid-19\u201d. 13% of the sample thought that was true. Close to 80% (79%) disagreed with the statement: \u201cThe Covid-19 virus is not dangerous and is being used to force people to get vaccines\u201d. 13% thought that was true.</p> <p>More than 70% (75%) disagreed with the statement: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/12/vaccines-5g-bill-gates-why-are-australians-gathering-to-spread-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories\">The 5G wireless network is being used to spread the Covid-19 virus</a>\u201d. 12% thought that was true.</p> <p>This week\u2019s survey indicates the crisis has changed public attitudes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there has been a surge in support for health workers. Over half of respondents now feel more positive towards health and care workers (56%).</p> <p>People are also more sympathetic to people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/australian-government-pledges-extra-48m-to-combat-mental-health-impacts-of-coronavirus\">struggling with their mental health</a>. Around one in five respondents also feels more positive towards people who are unemployed (21%) and homeless (21%).</p> <p>The survey continues to suggest Australians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/essential-poll-australians-warm-to-easing-of-covid-19-restrictions-but-are-divided-on-schools\">remain sanguine about experimenting with winding back the lockdowns</a>. Just a quarter (25%) of the sample now feels it is too soon to consider easing restrictions. Women and voters aged over 55 are more worried about the end of lockdowns than other cohorts. It also indicates people remain happy with the performance of their governments \u2013 federal and state \u2013 during the crisis.</p> <p>The margin of error for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/the-guardian-essential-report\">the Guardian Essential poll</a> is plus or minus 3%.</p>",
  "<p>The Morrison government has promised new measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including introducing an incentive scheme to allow big industrial polluters to earn revenue by emitting less than an agreed limit.</p> <p>It also plans to allow businesses to bid for funding from its main climate policy, the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, for projects that capture emissions and either use them or store them underground.</p> <p>Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, said the government had agreed to 21 of 26 recommendations in a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/coalition-scrambles-for-carbon-cutting-solutions-as-paris-targets-move-further-out-of-reach\"> review headed by former Business Council of Australia president Grant King</a>, who was charged with coming up with new ways to cheaply cut emissions.</p> <p>The appointment in October of the panel of business leaders and policy experts was not publicly announced, and was seen by observers as an effective concession the <a href=\"http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/ERF/About-the-Emissions-Reduction-Fund\">emissions reduction fund</a>, now rebadged as a climate solutions fund, was failing to cut national pollution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/coalition-scrambles-for-carbon-cutting-solutions-as-paris-targets-move-further-out-of-reach\">Coalition quietly appoints expert panel to salvage emissions policy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/examining-additional-sources-of-low-cost-abatement-expert-panel-report\">his response to the review</a>, Taylor said the government would open up new opportunities to cut emissions across the industrial, manufacturing, transport and agriculture sectors using the fund.</p> <p>He said it would build on the government\u2019s \u201ctechnology not taxes\u201d approach to cutting emissions that encouraged voluntary emissions cuts without imposing a cost for releasing carbon dioxide.</p> <p>Recommendations agreed by the government included allowing carbon capture and storage projects to qualify under the fund, a step the government said it had began consulting with industry on last month.</p> <p>In a shift likely to be criticised by clean energy advocates, the government gave in-principle support for two agencies, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), to be given a \u201ctechnology neutral remit\u201d to support \u201cthe widest possible range of technologies that reduce emissions\u201d. The Greens previously accused the government of planning changes to the CEFC <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/08/greens-warn-clean-energy-finance-corporation-overhaul-a-trojan-horse-for-coal-and-gas\">to allow it to fund more fossil fuel projects</a>.</p> <p>The panel also recommended changing the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d, a policy that was promised to stop industrial emissions rising but that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/23/smoke-screen-how-australias-biggest-polluters-have-been-free-to-increase-emissions\">in practice has led to a 12% increase in pollution</a> from the sector.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/23/smoke-screen-how-australias-biggest-polluters-have-been-free-to-increase-emissions\">Smoke screen: how Australia's biggest polluters have been free to increase emissions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The King review suggested introducing a \u201cbelow-baseline crediting mechanism\u201d, which would reward companies that reduced emissions below a limit, known as a baseline.</p> <p>To qualify, companies would have had to undertake \u201ctransformative\u201d projects that reduce emissions intensity \u2013 the amount they emit per unit of production \u2013 so they were not rewarded for just producing less or shutting down.</p> <p>In its response, the government said it agreed and would establish a \u201clow-emissions technology deployment incentive scheme\u201d. It said there would be substantial consultation with industry on how best to implement it.</p> <p>The proposal could be a step towards transforming the safeguard mechanism, which has been criticised as a pointless policy that did little to limit emissions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/23/smoke-screen-how-australias-biggest-polluters-have-been-free-to-increase-emissions\">into what it was initially intended to become</a>: an emissions trading scheme under which companies could buy and sell credits to each other. Whether that was the government\u2019s intention was not immediately clear.</p> <p>Experts have said the safeguard mechanism could become a meaningful policy that cuts pollution, but it would require setting emissions baselines at lower levels and reducing them over time as the country increasingly moved away from fossil fuels. Failure to tighten baselines below current levels could lead to companies being paid incentives without cutting pollution.</p> <p>Taylor said the government would also develop a co-investment program with business to accelerate cleaner technologies in difficult sectors, such as heavy industry and transport.</p> <p>Other changes recommended by the panel and agreed by the government included allowing companies to propose new methods under which they could be paid to reduce emissions, working with state and territory governments to encourage greater use of carbon offset credits generated using the emissions reduction fund, and subsidising the prohibitive cost of measuring emissions reductions through storing carbon in soil.</p> <p>Taylor said the recommendations aligned with the government\u2019s plan to release a \u201ctechnology investment roadmap\u201d. He said the roadmap would be out soon for public consultation.</p> <p>Analyses have found the government is not on track to meet the 2030 emissions target set at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement\">Paris climate summit</a>, a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/07/coalition-claims-it-will-meet-paris-climate-targets-but-only-by-using-accounting-loophole\">without using a carbon accounting loophole</a>.

These reforms will position Australia to overachieve on our 2030 Paris target while maintaining a strong economy,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/24/australia-carbon-emissions-fall-industrial-pollution-surges-electricity-agriculture-lng\">Australia\u2019s emissions had largely flatlined</a> since 2014, when the Coalition repealed a national carbon price scheme, but are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/12/global-carbon-emissions-to-slump-but-australias-electricity-grid-flatlines\">expected to dip this year</a> due to the economic shutdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>",

After Prof Tim Spector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/weird-hell-professor-advent-calendar-covid-19-symptoms-paul-garner\">warned</a> that Britain\u2019s failure to list all 14 primary symptoms of the virus meant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-tests-advised-for-people-who-lose-taste-or-smell\">between 50,000 and 70,000</a> people with Covid-19 were wrongly not being told to self-isolate, the government dashed to add \u201closs of sense of smell\u201d to its official list of symptoms. But expressing uncertainty is alien to ministers who were selected for an absolutist Brexit cast of mind.</p> <p>One report last week said that Johnson had warned the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers that they faced an agile opposition and a \u201c<a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/columnists/boris-johnson-analysis-1922-committee-tory-mps-coronavirus-crisis-2855468\">slippery opponent</a>\u201d. How revealing: there\u2019s nothing slippery about Starmer. But Johnson, captain of the chancers with his hand-picked crew of fly-by-nights, fibbers and fabricators, fears being shown up in unflattering contrast to Labour\u2019s frontbench of serious, earnest policy heavyweights. Politics is not a game for them, as it always has been for Johnson, but he\u2019s bereft when his old bluster can\u2019t beguile away deaths.</p> <p>Trust is ebbing away just when it\u2019s most needed to persuade anxious parents to send their children to school; it\u2019s frittered away on slippery pledges made to fill front pages for a day, but that are bound to be exposed soon after. We could walk down the well-trodden path: the government tacking wildly between herd immunity, tracking and tracing, then neither tracking nor testing, then locking down, then relaxing it but only to visit estate agents and garden centres, but not family. \u201cOnly following the science,\u201d ministers claim, or as one wit put it, the political science. But they get that political science badly askew.</p> <p>Take Matt Hancock\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1261329991708684294\">dumbfounding claim</a> on Friday: \u201cRight from the start we\u2019ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes \u2026 we\u2019ve made sure care homes have the resources they need.\u201d What sentient voter doesn\u2019t know that to be a flat-out lie? No testing and no PPE, as care homes \u2013 some close to bankruptcy \u2013 were pressured to take untested, possibly infected, hospital patients, without enough doctors, staff, training or isolation space. Taking the public for fools destroys trust.</p> <p>No government could have been fully ready as the tsunami of horror swept in. No reasonable voter would have expected everything to have been waiting, just in case. True, a decade of cuts had left us exceptionally unprepared and the government preferred failed private companies to handle PPE, testing and tracing over better equipped local authorities. Yet it might have kept the public\u2019s trust with honesty and transparency, consulting everyone, publishing everything, admitting failures.</p> <p>But on it goes, the absurd targets missed and lied about, graphs of global comparisons hastily dropped. Hancock promises all staff and residents of care homes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52684700\">will be tested</a> by early June \u2013 but will that be every week, with prompt results?</p> <p>\u201cFollowing the science\u201d often means ducking behind the scientists to let them take the flak: Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, are, after all, civil servants, not independent. The most hapless figure giving cover to ministers has been the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries. Before lockdown she <a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2020/03/11/uk-is-following-the-science-in-not-banning-mass-gatherings-health-chief/\">backed </a><a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2020/03/11/uk-is-following-the-science-in-not-banning-mass-gatherings-health-chief/\">Johnson\u2019s plan</a> not to ban large gatherings, noting: \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at what sorts of interventions might help manage this as we go forward, push the peak of the epidemic forward, and in general, those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect. So we don\u2019t want to disrupt people\u2019s lives.\u201d She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/uk-governments-coronavirus-response-beset-by-mixed-messages-and-u-turns\">defended</a> a fatal halt to tracking and tracing: \u201cThere comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.\u201d She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/19/uk-coronavirus-live-lifting-lockdown-restrictions-boris-johnson-death-tollcovid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9c70008f080ee110447c85\">called</a> the UK \u201can international exemplar in preparedness\u201d and told doctors to have a \u201cmore adult\u201d conversation about the lack of PPE. She <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenKentish/status/1260699964784750598\">reiterated advice</a> that it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d care homes would be infected.</p> <p>This government of world-class spinners and top-dollar public opinion manipulators are learning nothing: on Friday Hancock\u2019s disingenuous figures on how many tests had been carried out \u2013 almost double the number of individuals actually tested \u2013 were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCRealityCheck/status/1261338261236019202\">instantly tripped up</a> by the BBC\u2019s Reality Check. As trust evaporates, why keep setting new targets the government will miss?</p> <p>Politicians in a panic grab for two life rafts: internal fall guys and public enemies. Internally cabinet secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/no-10-under-pressure-as-it-is-revealed-whitehall-chief-mark-sedwill-had-coronavirus\">Mark Sedwill</a> is taking a beating, while Hancock protests it\u2019s not fair he\u2019s being blamed. But finding public enemies is their favourite of the two. Despite a surge of public appreciation, the BBC is battered in the rightwing press. Teachers were set up for the enemy role, and are being bounced into opening schools at an arbitrary date. Gove extols the Danes for a smooth reopening: they did it with extensive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/17/denmark-can-teach-england-safe-reopening-of-schools-covid-19\">union consultation</a>. When the British Medical Association <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\">backed the teachers</a>, doctors came under attack: that certainly won\u2019t end well.</p> <p>Local authorities and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations are as ever cast as enemies, too, with none of them consulted. But if \u201clevelling up\u201d is still Johnson\u2019s aim, councils ask why extra funds are flowing to richer places rather than poorer ones \u2013 for example, to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyBurnhamGM/status/1261922521177260034/photo/1\">Wiltshire more than to Knowsley</a> on Merseyside. Sadiq Khan, meanwhile, is the Tories\u2019 favoured regular enemy, as they force him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/14/london-faces-bus-and-train-cuts-without-urgent-funding\">raise</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/14/london-faces-bus-and-train-cuts-without-urgent-funding\"> public transport fares</a> in London.</p> <p>But political aggression towards public servants is as tin-eared a response to public sentiment as Priti Patel\u2019s refusal to lift the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">\u00a36</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">25-a-year NHS surcharge</a> on foreign health and care staff for the privilege of caring for us: doesn\u2019t she hear the clapping? Brexit negotiations heading for no deal are, ministers hope, a winner \u2013 but they may not succeed in hiding chaos at the ports and a fall in GDP amid the coronavirus economic crisis.</p> <p>Everything about this low-grade, callow crew makes them the most unfit government in living memory to cope with this great crisis. Rishi Sunak has done well to spray the meltdown with money, but his real test is still to come. For the rest, they learn nothing from their errors, eroding any trust in the notion that their prime motive might be serving the public\u2019s best interest, not saving their own skins. Boris Johnson looks an ever more inadequate figurehead for their floundering ship.</p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Despite its strong rise of more than 4% on Monday, the FTSE 100 is still down almost 20% on its pre-Covid level.</p> <p>Even bigger gains were posted on bourses in other European countries following news that Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron had agreed to the creation of a \u20ac500bn (\u00a3441bn) European recovery fund under which the European commission would be able to borrow money from the financial markets.

  "<p>Michael Phelps has admitted that the Covid-19 pandemic is taking a toll on his mental health.</p> <p>The 23-time Olympic swimming champion has spoken in the past <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/10/michael-phelps-did-not-want-to-be-alive-anymore-after-dui-arrest\">about his struggles with depression</a> and said that being under lockdown during the pandemic has been a struggle.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic has been a challenge I never expected,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/29186389/michael-phelps-most-overwhelmed-ever-felt\">he told ESPN in an article published on Monday</a>. \u201cAll the uncertainty.

I\u2019m always defensive.\u201d</p> <p>Phelps said that he has argued with his wife during lockdown and has felt \u201cworthless\u201d at times. \u201cThis is the most overwhelmed I\u2019ve ever felt in my life.

But there\u2019s never a finish line. I\u2019ve done so many interviews after [the 2016 Olympics] where the story was the same: Michael Phelps opened up about depression, went into a treatment program, won gold in his last Olympics and now is all better. I wish that were the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The 34-year-old said his wife, Nicole, and three children help him deal with his mental health. \u201cThere are moments, those times where I\u2019m stuck in my own head, I don\u2019t think it can get any worse, and Boomer, my four-year-old, will walk up to me, give me a hug and just tell me he loves me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you absolutely least expect it. It\u2019s literally the greatest thing in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Phelps has spoken about how working with a therapist has helped him. And he said understanding where negative emotions are coming from \u2013 and talking about them \u2013 is vital. </p> <p>\u201cNot long ago, I had a speaking engagement at a major global company about mental health,\u201d said Phelps. \u201cAfter I spoke, there was a Q&amp;A and this younger guy gets up in front of the entire group and starts talking about his struggles. I think about that moment sometimes. The courage he had to get up in front of all his coworkers and admit his challenges. It shows we are finally getting to a point where there is an understanding that mental health struggles are real. It\u2019s serious, life-and-death stuff.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to hide from. Nothing to be afraid of. The fight is only against yourself.

  "<p>A week ago Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee review of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong\">UK\u2019s Covid-19 response</a>, said that some actions represented \u201cthe biggest failure of scientific advice to ministers in our lifetime\u201d.</p> <p>Last Thursday, when pressed by Kirsty Wark on BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000j4bq/newsnight-14052020\">Newsnight</a> about why the community test, trace and isolate strategy in tackling the pandemic was abandoned as a policy on 12 March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jeremy-farrar\">Jeremy Farrar</a>, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/government-names-dozens-of-scientists-who-sit-on-sage-group\">Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies</a> (Sage), was commendably open and honest: \u201cI do not remember the truth of that [what Sage said] on 12 March \u2026 [but] testing has been critical for every country that has controlled the epidemic \u2026 in retrospect it was [a mistake] \u2026 we should have been testing earlier.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/24/case-for-transparency-over-sage-has-never-been-clearer\">Case for transparency over Sage has never been clearer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Saturday, however, when Sir Mark Walport, chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, and another core member of Sage, was asked the same question on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he responded differently. \u201cAdvice from the scientific community was always to test as much as possible,\u201d he said. It was a question of logistics \u2013 the capacity wasn\u2019t there. In other words, Walport saw no failure of scientific advice to government ministers \u2013 simply a failure of people in labs and Public Health England to respond to the scientific advice.</p> <p>This is odd because on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzvOwF48z4s\">15 March</a> he was interviewed on Sky News and made no mention of a testing strategy to reduce transmission: he defended continuation of mass gatherings and the UK\u2019s \u201cworld-class\u201d modelling for the outbreak. Later, when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fOUD_xw_60\">interviewed </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fOUD_xw_60\">again</a> on 29 March, he said social distancing was the best way to reduce transmission and that testing was needed only for health workers, and for when outbreaks flared up. He also wanted a balance between \u201cclamping down\u201d and keeping the economy going. The best advice, he said, was \u201ccoming from the modelling community\u201d.</p> <p>This question about testing policy is far more than a matter of bureaucratic sophistry. The government\u2019s decision on 12 March, when the UK had <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/\">590 confirmed active cases</a> and nine deaths, led to the uncontained explosion of the Covid-19 epidemic. Imperial College London researchers have estimated the baseline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-actually-signify\">R value</a> \u2013 the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at that time to have been just below four. Between 12 and 24 March, when the national lockdown started, cases exploded. By 28 March, Imperial researchers estimate that more than 1.8 million people in Britain were infected. The official death toll in the UK from Covid-19 stands at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-trains-rail-work-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec2aee28f0886ce4f5d5d9b#block-5ec2aee28f0886ce4f5d5d9b\">nearly 35,000 people</a>, though estimates from the Financial Times put the number of lives lost at more than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisGiles_/status/1262407386884706305\">62,000</a>.</p> <p>Grieving families need to know what advice was given and how it was acted on. I have repeatedly called for a rapid and no-blame audit of Sage advice, to take the pressure off its members, so that we can learn the lessons from the scientific debates that might have led to well-intentioned misjudgments.</p> <p>It\u2019s clear that in the early stages of the outbreak, Sage was over-focused on using pandemic influenza as a guideline \u2013 a virus with a much lower death rate, a lower R value (around 1.3) and a short incubation period, which makes testing redundant. Its modelling and behavioural subcommittees were labelled with the prefix SPI \u2013 scientific pandemic influenza groups. And its rigid contain-delay-research-mitigate strategy comes from the influenza handbook. But this was coronavirus not flu. And it simply didn\u2019t listen to advice from the World Health Organization\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who, when declaring a pandemic on 11 March, <a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-mission-briefing-on-covid-19---12-march-2020\">said</a>: \u201cThe idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Understanding these discussions and decisions must come from the accurate, full and public release of the Sage meeting minutes from 28 January up to the present day. And from the evidence of Sage academics who volunteered their time and expertise. This can be done without blame or pointing fingers. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said the minutes would be released when the epidemic is over \u2013 we are coming towards the end of the coronavirus surge, so that time is now.</p> <p>Sage has been bedevilled by a lack of transparency and balance. If independent public health experts had not been excluded from the core committee, which is dominated by modellers, virologists, clinical academics and behavioural scientists, the influenza-driven \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy might not have materialised. If the blame is now subtly being shifted to public health colleagues by core members of Sage, then this heightens the necessity for full transparency. MPs and the scientific community should press for the unredacted release of meeting minutes immediately.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/18/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-trains-rail-work-latest-updates\">UK coronavirus live: everyone aged five and over now eligible for a test, Matt Hancock tells MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those minutes have assumed greater importance given the slow and fragmented response by the UK in mounting a sustainable and locally integrated system for finding, testing, tracing and isolating Covid-19 cases.

This year\u2019s additional funding will take Natural England\u2019s grant-in-aid budget up to around \u00a3100m; \u00a34m of the additional money comes from Defra\u2019s \u00a330m biodiversity fund, announced last year.</p> <p>But critics argue that the extra funding does not go far enough. The conservationist Mark Avery of Wild Justice described the announcement as \u201ca smidgen of good news\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cWell done, Tony, for getting back a small fraction of the money Defra has hacked out of Natural England over the past decade,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Green party peer Natalie Bennett said: \u201cThe government must not be allowed to get away with celebrating a measly announcement of an extra \u00a315m grant as any kind of restoration.

The government missed its 2010 target to restore half of SSSIs to favourable condition by 2020.</p> <p>The rest of the funding has been ring-fenced for other core statutory duties such as advising on the environmental impact of planning applications, licensing work and improving national nature reserves, Juniper said. He would also like to invest in more large-scale landscape recovery projects, such as Dorset\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/17/uks-first-super-national-nature-reserve-created-in-dorset\">Purbeck Heaths</a> super national nature reserve, which started in March.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://prospect.org.uk/natural-england-c2019/\">report by the Prospect union</a> in January last year concluded that staff at Natural England were in \u201cin crisis\u201d. Internal reports show there were 2,661 permanent staff at the organisation in 2007 compared with 1,786 in March last year, resulting in roles being amalgamated and high levels of stress for workers.</p> <p>One anonymous employee, who left last summer, after two years working for the organisation said it was the \u201cmost humiliating professional experience I\u2019ve ever had\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got two first-class degrees from Oxbridge, I\u2019ve got years of experience and I earned \u00a320,000 for four days a week,\u201d she said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t increase my hours. I ended up working five days anyway. I had to leave because I had to work two other jobs to make ends meet.\u201d</p> <p>Juniper said he was working with the union to review pay and conditions at Natural England and hoped to do more to support staff. \u201cIt\u2019s not only issues of pay that have concerned me since I arrived, but issues of workload, with some people having multiple roles. This is a reflection of the dedication of the staff who have been working extremely hard to maintain the service that we provide for the country.\u201d</p> <p>Juniper acknowledged there was \u201cstill quite a long way\u201d to go to secure nature\u2019s recovery. He said: \u201cI came into an organisation that had a number of challenges and I do think that after my first year we are beginning to meet some of them in terms of rebuilding the confidence of the organisation \u2026 I\u2019m delighted to see that the budget increase this year is just putting some more fuel in the tank.\u201d</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said Natural England does vital work protecting the environment, water, invaluable natural spaces, and wildlife. \u201cThat is why we have provided Natural England with over \u00a311m in additional funding to ensure they are able to not only protect our natural environment but also improve it for future generations.\u201d</p> <p>The conservationist and author Peter Marren, who has recently written about the decline of Natural England for <a href=\"https://www.britishwildlife.com/article/volume-31-number-3-page-173-178\">British Wildlife magazine</a>, said Defra\u2019s comment about improving the natural environment \u201cbetrays a depth of ignorance\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt presumably equates improvement with planting trees or leaving corners in public parks for the nettles. The real wild environment \u2013 our remaining old woods, downs, heaths, semi-natural meadows, moors, bogs, rivers, ponds and lakes, are in a terrible state and getting worse,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a great deal anyone can do to offset the loss significantly, but a properly funded Natural England would at least be able to address some of the issues on protected sites.\u201d</p> <p>Kate Jennings, the head of site conservation policy at the RSPB, said there was a huge amount of ground to recover if the government was serious about tackling the nature crisis. \u201cThe RSPB has repeatedly called for Natural England to be given the resources and the independence that it needs to do its job properly, and so the announcement of an increase in funding is really a welcome first step in the right direction,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Craig Bennett, the CEO of the Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cWhile it is welcome to hear about a modest increase in funding for Natural England, they will still be left with an overall budget that is much lower than it was decades previously, at a time when ministers have said we\u2019re facing an ecological emergency.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still a long way to go before funding is back to historical levels, or indeed to what is needed to reverse the declines in the abundance of nature we\u2019re experiencing in this country.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A radical 10-year recovery plan for the UK food system should draw on local and community responses to the Covid-19 crisis to create a more diverse, sustainable and fairer supply chain, say experts.</p> <p>The pandemic exposed fragility in the food supply system: farmers poured away more than a million litres of milk, supermarket shelves were stripped of flour while millers were unable to sell it, and potato farmers were forced to hoard stocks. Meanwhile, food banks faced unprecedented demand as household incomes plummeted.</p> <p>Sue Pritchard, the chief executive of the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission, said: \u201cThe pandemic has exposed the faultlines in our food system.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen big gaps in availability of food, especially for the poor and vulnerable, and significant economic impacts on producers.

  "<p>Last December I visited a charity that is very close to my heart: Acorns children\u2019s hospice.</p> <p>I had the privilege of chatting, telling stories and reading some of my poetry to an inspirational group of children and families. .

I\u2019ve lost two members of my family, and another couple have come close to the edge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I have over the past 10 years met many children and young people using the services of this West Midlands charity. We have shared our love for poetry, talked about the importance of caring for all living beings, and our love of cake, music and Aston Villa football club.</p> <p> I am so inspired by the kids, and I also have an enormous amount of respect for the people who work there. I want to hug and kiss them, I want to tell them how much I love them, but I just shake their hands and act normal. <br><br>Not only do they care for these kids, some of whom are not expected to reach adulthood; they also look after their mums, dads, brothers and sisters, even grandparents. The existence of children\u2019s hospices is something many of us feel uncomfortable with \u2013 most people tend to associate hospices with older people. I was one of them, until I first visited.</p> <p>Those working and volunteering there do everything they can to make special memories for the children and their families.

But since the start of this pandemic Acorns\u2019 600 or so children and young people have been on my mind.

We\u2019re lucky to have such a giving society here in the UK.</p> <p>The staff are also reaching out to families through regular calls, letting them know they are not alone at this scary time.</p> <p>Over the course of this global emergency there have been times when we have seen the virus infect the rich and famous, powerful and influential, and humble world leaders. But as with all emergencies, it\u2019s the most vulnerable members of our community who get hit the hardest.</p> <p>I have just signed <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-uk-boris-johnson-urged-launch-public-inquiry-bame-deaths-2848308\">a letter addressed to Boris Johnson</a> calling for an independent public inquiry into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">disproportionate impact</a> of Covid-19 on black and ethnic minority communities, because for me this is real. I\u2019ve lost two members of my family, and another couple have come close to the edge.</p> <p>I can\u2019t stop thinking about the kids at Acorns. I can\u2019t stop thinking about the elderly and the infirm, the young and vulnerable, the homeless, the families caring for a seriously ill baby or child.</p> <p>Once this terrible chapter comes to an end, what will the next chapter have in store? I would like to think we will retain the strong sense of compassion and community that has been so in evidence during this crisis, and try to turn our backs on division, deprivation and inequality.

  "<p>A Commonwealth-born veteran, who served for more than a decade in the British army including tours of Afghanistan and Iraq, has been told he must pay more than \u00a327,000 for NHS hospital bills after an emergency operation to remove a brain tumour.</p> <p>Hospital staff have classified Taitusi Ratucaucau, 49, as an overseas patient, and therefore ineligible for free NHS care. He joined the British army in 2001 and has been continuously in the UK since being discharged from the military in 2011, living here with his wife and three daughters, and paying tax and national insurance.</p> <p>Ratucaucau, originally from Fiji, is recovering in a London hospital after major brain surgery on 30 April. He is meant to be focusing on his physical rehabilitation but said he was spending most of his time worrying about how he would meet the demand for payment, given that he has no savings, is the main breadwinner for his family and is currently too unwell to work. The bill is increasing by around \u00a31,500 for every day he remains an inpatient.</p> <p>Ratucaucau is one of a group of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/08/commonwealth-veterans-accuse-uk-immigration-limbo-home-office-mod\">Commonwealth-born</a> military veterans who launched legal action against the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence earlier this year, over an alleged systemic failure to advise them of the need to apply for settlement in the UK on discharge and for failing to assist them with complex, expensive immigration rules.</p> <p>This has left them categorised as illegal immigrants, unable to access free NHS treatment, facing unemployment and homelessness and fearing deportation. They are unable to regularise their status owing to the cost and complexity of the immigration system.</p> <p>Since the issue was highlighted in the Guardian in March, more than 70 other veterans have come forward and military charities say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/08/grave-injustice-fiji-british-army-veteran-immigration-limbo-uk\">hundreds</a> more are similarly affected. Coverage of their situation triggered public sympathy and widespread anger that Commonwealth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/10/i-feel-betrayed-the-british-army-veteran-stuck-in-fiji-because-of-immigration-rules\">ex-servicemen</a> should need to pay thousands of pounds in visa fees to remain in the country they risked their lives for.</p> <p>Foreign national soldiers have the right to remain in the UK after leaving the army if they have served for at least four years, but claimants say they were discharged without being given clear guidance about how to regularise their immigration status. Most assumed the immigration process was automatic.</p> <p>On discharge from the army, Ratucaucau, who also served in Belize and the Falkland Islands, was given an \u201cexemplary\u201d conduct record and described as a \u201cvery capable, loyal and trustworthy individual\u201d with an \u201cimpeccable work ethic\u201d. He said he was given unclear advice, and was later unable to afford the cost of visas for himself, his wife and two older daughters, 13 and nine \u2013 who were born while the family were living in British military bases in Germany \u2013 which at that time was around \u00a35,000. Now he would need to pay \u00a32,389 for each applicant, a total of \u00a39,556 for the whole family to secure indefinite leave to remain here. His youngest daughter, eight, was born in the UK and does not need a visa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ca3baeb1251f09185c46f52d8171ca21a874e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ca3baeb1251f09185c46f52d8171ca21a874e92/0_407_1000_1247/802.jpg\" alt=\"Taitusi Ratucaucau in hospital.\" width=\"802\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taitusi Ratucaucau in hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Taitusi Ratucaucau</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was unable to save enough to regularise his status during post-army jobs as a maintenance worker on the railways. More recently he has been working for a security company, which has also not paid enough to cover visas for his whole family.</p> <p>The mounting cost of his unexpected hospitalisation has left him distraught. \u201cWhere can I get money to pay for this treatment when I\u2019m in hospital?\u201d he asked, speaking by telephone from the rehabilitation ward. He said he had felt proud to be accepted into the British army, after officers visited Fiji to sign up new recruits in 2001. \u201cI gave up years of my life to fight for this country. We can\u2019t believe that the Home Office could be like this. I feel sad and angry.\u201d</p> <p>In a witness statement given to his lawyer, Vinita Templeton of Duncan Lewis, before he became ill, he said: \u201cAs I had served for 10 years, I expected that I would be able to remain in the UK after being discharged \u2026 I feel that the position I have had to endure since being discharged from the army is very unfair. The army let me down badly by not giving me enough notice about steps that needed to be taken in order for me and my family to remain in the UK, and also about the cost of the Home Office applications. I feel that the fees that the Home Office charge foreign national veterans for the right to remain is extremely unfair, considering the committed service we have given to this country.\u201d</p> <p>Three years ago, Home Office staff visited his wife at home while he was at work, took away her passport temporarily and told her that the family needed to make applications for leave to remain. The visit alarmed the whole family. \u201cI cannot afford the Home Office fee that needs to be paid to regularise my status in the UK \u2026 I am constantly worried and I fear that my family could face forcible removal from the UK. This would be terrible for my family, especially because my children only know life in the UK,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Templeton said the state of immigration limbo had caused ex-servicemen \u201cunimaginable suffering\u201d. When Ratucaucau became unwell, friends encouraged him to seek medical assistance, but he repeatedly refused. \u201cAll our clients are afraid that seeking medical will result in the Home Office being notified of their situation, and in being faced with medical bills that they cannot afford,\u201d Templeton said.</p> <p>They are waiting for a response from the Ministry of Defence, expected this week. In the interim, lawyers have requested that the veterans should be granted permission to work and to seek recourse to public funds, including the right to access healthcare services.</p> <p>Esita Tuimanu, the co-founder of Commonwealth Neglected Veterans, which has been supporting Ratucaucau during his hospitalisation, said: \u201cIt breaks my heart to see someone who has served for more than 10 years being treated like this. They have sacrificed so much of their life for Queen and country; they risked so much in Afghanistan and Iraq. I don\u2019t think these men and women should ever be left in this position.\u201d</p> <p>She said that medical staff had been very sympathetic but were unable to do anything about the bill. \u201cHe is really worried. He got stressed out when we discussed it on Wednesday,\u201d she said, adding that Ratucaucau would have to pay the bill somehow because unpaid NHS debts triggered an automatic refusal in any visa application.</p> <p>The Home Office stamped the passports of foreign recruits on joining the military with a note stating that they were exempt from immigration restrictions, and that they were \u201cnot subject to any condition or limitation on the period of permitted stay in the UK\u201d. The stamps were not marked with an expiry date but nevertheless became invalid on discharge; veterans say they were not informed. When they discovered, with the tightening of the Home Office\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/theresa-mays-hostile-environment-policy-at-heart-of-windrush-scandal\">hostile environment</a>\u201d regulations after 2012, that they were in breach of immigration rules, they struggled to resolve their difficulties, mainly because of the cost of visas.</p> <p>The armed forces employ about 4,500 Commonwealth citizens; recruitment in Commonwealth countries has recently been stepped up \u201cto build on the long-held links Britain\u2019s military has with Commonwealth countries\u201d, according to the MoD.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said it would not comment on the individual case because of ongoing legal proceedings, but added: \u201cThe service of all members of the armed forces, including Commonwealth nationals, is highly valued.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 May 2020. It was hospital staff who classified Taitusi Ratucaucau as an overseas patient, not medical staff as an earlier version stated.</p>",
  "<p>Chris and Liam Hemsworth, Ryan Reynolds, Meryl Streep and Benedict Cumberbatch are among stars taking part in a group reading of Roald Dahl\u2019s beloved classic James and the Giant Peach from their homes to raise money for the fight against coronavirus.</p> <p>Oscar-winning film-maker Taika Waititi is teaming up with the Roald Dahl Story Company to recreate Dahl\u2019s book in 10 instalments. Waititi will narrate the story while dozens of actors join in, including Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Mindy Kaling and Cate Blanchett. In the first episode, the Hemsworth brothers play Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker, with Streep and Cumberbatch taking on the roles of the evil aunties in the second \u2013 probably the only time Streep and Chris Hemsworth will ever play the same character.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29LDBdpNMRc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/29LDBdpNMRc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The first chapter of James and the Giant Peach, read by Waititi, the Hemsworth brothers and Nick Kroll.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29LDBdpNMRc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">first</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX3Q5y8Dz58&amp;feature=youtu.be\">second</a> episodes are both available to view now, with remaining instalments to be released on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/roalddahl\">the Roald Dahl YouTube channel</a> every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p> <p>The collaboration is intended to raise money for <a href=\"https://www.pih.org/\">global health non-profit Partners in Health</a> (PIH), which is fighting Covid-19 in the world\u2019s most vulnerable areas. The Roald Dahl Story Company has committed matching donations up to $1m (\u00a3823,000), as part of a wider commitment to give more than \u00a31m to charities affected by Covid-19, including the Roald Dahl Marvellous Children\u2019s Charity in the UK, which provides specialist nurses to seriously ill children.</p> <p>Waititi said that James and the Giant Peach, in which James embarks on an adventure with various giant insectoid companions, was a \u201cwacky, wonderful tale\u201d about \u201cresilience in children, triumph over adversity and dealing with a sense of isolation which couldn\u2019t been more relevant today\u201d. First published in 1961, the book has sold more than 28m copies around the world.</p> <p>\u201cBeing an adult child myself and having read James and the Giant Peach to my girls multiple times, I\u2019m excited to be able to partner with my friends, the Dahl team and PIH and retell this story to help those most in need right now,\u201d said Waititi, who is already writing, directing and executive producing two original Roald Dahl animated series for Netflix, one based on the world of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and one centred on the Oompa-Loompas.</p> <p>Dahl\u2019s daughter, Ophelia Dahl, the founder of PIH, said her father had instilled in his children when they were young \u201cthe notion that imagination will spark a chain reaction of possibilities \u2013 we can dream endlessly about ideas and make them real\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis early training meant it was not such a leap to envision PIH with my friends,\u201d she said. \u201cRoald was one of our earliest and most enthusiastic supporters and never let me leave for Haiti without stuffing a massive wad of cash in my hand to put towards the next project. You can see from his stories that he always supported the most vulnerable and those excluded from opportunity. PIH was the perfect match.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWe know from experience that the impact of this virus will be felt most by vulnerable communities around the world,\u201d she added. \u201cBut with more than three decades\u2019 experience in community-based health care, including responses to epidemics and outbreaks such as Ebola, cholera and tuberculosis, we know how to fight this.\u201d</p> <p>The Roald Dahl Story Company previously donated $1.3m to PIH for maternal health in Sierra Leone, and has given $12m to date to other charitable causes.</p>",

It is obviously an unfair and unscientific appeal that China will never accept.</p> \n   <p><strong>Some people in Europe and Australia echoed the US proposal for an independent investigation, against which China is certainly vigilant. Do some people in Canberra and other places follow Washington politically and conceal their political intention toward China?</strong></p> \n   <p><strong>A politicized appeal won\u2019t be supported at the assembly</strong>.

But first of all, it should be led by WHO rather than any country or regional organization. Second, the investigation needs to be scientific and fair. Not only China-related factors, but also those related to the US and other countries need to be included. Earlier confirmed cases than the previously known first infected case have continuously been found in the US. Among those diagnosed as having flu last winter, how many were coronavirus infections? All these clues shouldn\u2019t be missed.</p> \n   <p>Investigating the origin of the virus is only one part of the coronavirus fight. The ultimate goal is to control the pandemic and resume production globally. China is one of the countries that have done well in both. How could China be passive and isolated in WHA? It is the US that should feel it failed the international community.</p> \n   <p><strong>The proposal that will eventually be adopted by the assembly will not be one that only meets US requests. No matter where the virus originated, the challenge is for all people around the world. The international community should be vigilant and reject the US attempt to politicize the investigation and create new disputes.</strong></p> \n   <p>Only a small number of WHO members will cheer for the island of Taiwan, putting on nothing but a farce.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T04:54:09.035Z\">at 5.54am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec2051d8f08a1782fa7c957\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T03:48:54.719Z\">4.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Asked if she believes Australia\u2019s internal borders should re-open (something <strong>Gladys Berejiklian </strong>really wants, particularly with Queensland), <strong>Jane Halton</strong> says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can\u2019t speak for the commission, because obviously that\u2019s not my job.

the Covid-19 wave, and as of today she has confirmation of that headcount.</p> \n   <p>On Monday, Stats NZ released its quarterly estimate resident population figures which showed New Zealand notching the major milestone.</p> \n   <p>As of 31 March, the South Pacific nation has 5,002,100 residents.</p> \n   <p>In all likelihood, New Zealand has reached the figure because of the pandemic.</p> \n   <p>\u201cCovid-19 has caused some unusual and unprecedented travel patterns,\u201d Stats NZ senior demographer<strong> Kim Dunstan </strong>said.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had people that have been in New Zealand prolong their stay which has given some boost to migration.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve also had more New Zealand citizens returning from living overseas in recent months.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve also had fewer citizens departing New Zealand to live overseas.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe combined impact has seen an upswing in migration which has helped New Zealand reach that five million milestone.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T01:17:34.919Z\">at 2.17am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

  "<p>There are easier things than working while looking after your children \u2013 keeping the two activities completely separate, for example. But lockdown living means that\u2019s not possible, so we asked the experts to share their best tips for blending your office and home life like a pro. Rest assured: with broadband powerful enough to keep everyone occupied, the juggle is doable. Just.</p> <p><strong>1. Create a working environment</strong><br>One of the biggest challenges of working from home? Getting used to your relaxation space being a place of achievement. So it\u2019s important to try to create an area in your home that becomes a place you associate with work. Ideally, pick somewhere close to the router for reliable wifi, but at the very least, it\u2019s important to just clear a space that\u2019s your own, according to business psychologist Charlotte Armitage.</p> <p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s simply a part of a table or a corner of a room, you need to create a boundary for work and home life,\u201d says Armitage. \u201cBecause once you blur those lines it becomes very difficult to switch off at home and that leads to burnout. Also, your kids will understand that once you\u2019re in that space you\u2019re in your work mode. That will help them learn not to interrupt you.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2. Get the right kit<br></strong>Congrats, you have a new job! It\u2019s facilities manager of your own home (don\u2019t ask about the pay). It\u2019s important to make sure you have all the tools to improve your performance. Don\u2019t have a big enough desktop screen? Use your TV. Stuttering video calling? Plug in a gigabit ethernet cable to boost your broadband connection and make frozen Zoom calls a thing of the past.</p> <p><strong>3. Routine is key<br></strong>Establishing a daily structure is key for both you and your kids. Every parent\u2019s routine will be different, depending on your job and childcare demands, but it\u2019s vital to ensure your day is separated into chunks of work time and home-schooling time, with your schedule clearly communicated to colleagues who understand when you are and aren\u2019t available. Ensure you also build in time to have fun with your child \u2013 it\u2019s important for the wellbeing of both of you, as well as having sneaky productivity benefits, according to Armitage.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can block out an hour to spend quality time with your child, it makes them feel really fulfilled,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd once they\u2019ve had your full attention, they\u2019re happier about being on their own. So when you need to work, you\u2019ve got time and space to concentrate.\u201d</p> <p><strong>4. Use tech strategically</strong><br>When it comes to distracting your kids for long enough for you to get some work done, tech is your friend. But with most kids using it to home school as well as communicate with friends, the novelty of getting time with digital devices is at risk of wearing off \u2013 unless you\u2019re strategic about how you use it, according to Anita Cleare, author of The Work/Parent Switch.</p> <p>\u201cSave the tech that your child will always sit quietly with. Use it for when you\u2019ve got work to deliver that requires a sustained burst of attention,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we use tech strategically, it can mean we get the benefit of added time to ourselves \u2013 which can be really helpful for your workload.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/may/14/we-get-up-obscenely-early-how-were-balancing-kids-and-work-in-lockdown\">\u2018We get up obscenely early\u2019: how we\u2019re balancing kids and work in lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>5. Stay connected - even if it involves your kids</strong><br>Now that we\u2019re isolated from our colleagues, it\u2019s important to make sure we stay connected digitally. Use video calling for catch-ups rather than phone, where possible. And don\u2019t fall prey to the ultimate WFH parental worry: your child gate-crashing your video meeting. According to Jane Sparrow, a remote-working expert whose workplace consultancy The Culture Builders helped Chinese companies come to terms with their spell in lockdown in February, the more you resist your offspring appearing on-screen, the less productive a worker you\u2019ll be.</p> <p>\u201cThink of interruptions as a great opportunity for your colleagues to get to know you better. Take the 60 seconds to let your child be part of the conversation,\u201d says Sparrow.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s much better than the constant nerves of thinking: \u2018Oh no, I can\u2019t have my children on screen\u2019, as that just makes you anxious. And anxiety has a huge impact on both your productivity and wellbeing \u2013 the two most important things for remote working.\u201d</p> <p><strong>6. Ensure there\u2019s a clear end to your working day</strong><br>There comes a point where, no matter how long your to-do list, you need to end your working day. It helps you avoid burnout, gives your family the time they crave from you and lets you relax. One helpful expert tip for bringing work to a stop is doing a daily performance review, where you judge yourself positively \u2013 considering the things you accomplished rather than those you didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cAsk yourself two questions: What did I achieve with my family today? What did I achieve in business? It\u2019s a good conversation to have with your children as well. Every day when I put my daughter to bed we talk about what was good about the day,\u201d says Sparrow. \u201cThinking about what you have ticked off is really important to put you in a positive space. It really empowers you to try again tomorrow and be productive.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Vodafone #KeepingTheUKConnected<br></strong>Managing the needs of clients as well as children when working from home is a tough ask, but it\u2019s doable with reliable broadband. </em></p> <p><em>That\u2019s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.</em></p> <p><em>So even when we\u2019re apart, nothing can stop us being together.</em></p> <p><em>Stay up to date with the latest information on what we\u2019re doing to keep the UK connected. <a href=\"https://track.adform.net/C/?bn=36685604\" rel=\"nofollow\">Find out more</a></em></p>",
  "<p>The kitchen smells delicious. In a cook-along with the Yard\u2019s resident chef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/23/zoe-adjonyoh-ghana-kitchen-ruby-tandoh\">Zoe Adjonyoh</a>, we\u2019re making the Ghanaian dish red red (stewed black-eyed beans). It\u2019s one of the first events of <a href=\"https://www.yardtheatre.online/home\">Yard Online</a>, the day-long festival from the Hackney Wick theatre. Adjonyoh, founder of <a href=\"https://www.zoesghanakitchen.co.uk/\">Zoe\u2019s Ghana Kitchen</a>, is a friendly head chef. This is not an easy time, she reassures us, sprinkling some salt into the bubbling pan and forgiving us for using olive oil instead of palm. \u201cEveryone\u2019s just pulling through.\u201d</p> <p>Yard Online uses what artists have to hand, not just to recreate what we had on our stages before lockdown, but to consider what we could have afterwards. From a discussion of the future of theatre to a post-apocalyptic dance performance, the festival probes at how we watch theatre online, together. With interactive elements and an after-party on video game Animal Crossing, it also tests ways of engaging digitally, in an effort to fill the bubbly pint-sized hole left from the lack of chat, drink and dance that a night out at the Yard normally guarantees.</p> <p>The team\u2019s problem-solving skills don\u2019t end at how we socialise: when Zoom temporarily goes down across the globe, they deal with it impressively, swiftly switching two of the shows to a new platform, guiding audiences to the right place without fuss.</p> <p>The shows themselves are a mixture of gentle reassurance, wild physical exertion, and playful audience interaction. Midway through <a href=\"https://www.stacymakishi.co.uk/\">Stacy Makishi</a>\u2019s one-on-one phone call, The Promise, I find myself \u2013 at her instruction \u2013 sitting on the toilet thinking about grief. On the phone and around the house, she guides a contemplation of all that we\u2019ve lost \u2013 people, jobs, certainty. It\u2019s a gentle, buoyant little piece, even if it is a little embarrassing to be overheard repeating affirmations into your fridge by family members not involved in the festival.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://christophergreen.net/\">Christopher Green</a>\u2019s No Show, Green takes his time to appear on screen, and when he does, he\u2019s reluctant to perform. We, as his sidekicks, have to help him make the show instead. It\u2019s a somewhat frustrating piece that plays with the idea of what theatre really means, but it excels where many shows fail by managing to use Zoom for genuinely fun and collaborative audience interaction.</p> <p>In a darker turn, <a href=\"https://theyardtheatre.co.uk/theatre/events/now-20/now-20-week-3/\">Marikiscrycrycry</a>\u2019s solo dance piece, I\u2019ll Be Lucina, creates beauty from fear. The layout feels like a video game; half the screen filled with movement, half with a scroll of text. Their ripped black costume looks like a bird whose feathers have been torn apart. They tell us about witnessing a murder. It\u2019s set at the end of the world but it\u2019s hard to disconnect from stories today of black bodies being brutalised, and the urgency to hide vibrates through the screen. With a hospital pulse and rustling piano, the sound design by Joana Pope + nineishuman anchors the sweeping choreography. It\u2019s a short, beautiful piece, the end as lonely as it is abrupt.</p> <p>This festival, like many at the moment, is run on a pay-what-you-can basis. One of the key discussions in the morning\u2019s panel was post-pandemic financial stability, both for freelance artists and institutions. We have to hope that the industry can find a way through this that will support artists, encourage accessibility, and promote risk-taking work while making enough money to keep going. While that\u2019s being figured out, let\u2019s be grateful for the stories pulling us through, and know that red red is very good with a fried egg the morning after.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Inside the white trailer parked up by the farm, the small team headed by Matthias K\u00fcrten are moving fast.</p> <p>Their work has a rhythmical soundtrack: a bandsaw cutting through bones, fat slopped into buckets, murmurs of chatter and knives being sharpened.

Cleaning products have been harder to get hold of, but being a smaller operation means it\u2019s easier to maintain safe distancing.<br><br>Founded in 2002, K\u00fcrten\u2019s butcher is a curious anomaly in an industry characterised by ever greater economies of scale. Around the world slaughterhouses are getting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/meat-plant-workers-us-coronavirus-war\">fewer and bigger</a>. \u201cWe are doing the exact opposite,\u201d K\u00fcrten reflects, a saw wedged in a swaying carcass at his side. \u201cAnd it\u2019s working really well.\u201d</p> <p>Over the course of a year he visits roughly 350 farms, usually slaughtering one to four cows, two or three pigs and as many as 38 sheep on each, and butchering them to the farmers\u2019 specifications \u2013 often, as is the case today, with their help.</p> <p>At the heart of his business lies the conviction that animals should be slaughtered on the farm. \u201cThis means they are calm,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can eat up until the last moment. Mostly they don\u2019t understand what is happening at all.\u201d</p> <p>This is why farmers such as Andrea Schmitz, who has been a client for a decade, chooses K\u00fcrten over the cheaper alternative of an industrial slaughterhouse. \u201cThe animals are born here in the barn with us and run around our fields \u2026 They aren\u2019t driving off in a truck,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/13/eus-live-export-trade-puts-welfare-of-millions-of-animals-at-risk-report\">EU's live export trade puts welfare of millions of animals at risk \u2013 report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Francesca Porta of the advocacy organisation Eurogroup for Animals adds: \u201cIt solves the problem of the stress of loading into a truck, the long journey to a slaughterhouse, and the unloading where the animal doesn\u2019t know where it is and then has to wait [for slaughter].\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year the Guardian reported that as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/something-is-wrong-meps-say-eu-is-failing-to-regulate-live-animal-exports\">the live animal export trade</a> booms across Europe, animals are travelling ever-longer distances, while the European Commission is failing to fully implement its own transport welfare regulations. Longer journeys are linked to a trend across Europe for fewer and larger slaughterhouses, run by an increasingly small number of large commercial players.</p> <p>\u201cIn Germany we have a very strong concentration in the slaughtering industry,\u201d says Katrin Wenz, from Friends of the Earth Germany. A few smaller slaughterhouses can still be found in states such as Lower Saxony, she adds, but in places like Brandenburg companies have to transport animals over long distances. More than half the pigs in Germany, for example, are slaughtered by just <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/animals-and-animal-products/animal-products/pork_en\">three companies</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25905d8e84f370efe544ccc7dd9f6e7fe5631365\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25905d8e84f370efe544ccc7dd9f6e7fe5631365/0_77_3000_1897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"K\u00fcrten's van with two dogs relaxing in front\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smaller slaughter companies struggle to compete against the handful of big players in Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Harwart/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt became increasingly hard for smaller companies to compete,\u201d says Wenz, citing low profit margins and high EU requirements. \u201cMore and more gave up because the big industrial slaughterhouses could slaughter increasingly cheaply and efficiently.\u201d</p> <p>K\u00fcrten is not slaughtering any animals today, but when he does the farmer is usually present. His methods differ depending on the animal: a bolt gun for cattle, electric stunning for pigs and sheep. He remembers the butcher visiting his family farm when he was younger, and the village shops that slaughtered animals themselves rather than have meat delivered. Since starting his training at 16, he has witnessed the industry reconfigure: \u201cI worked [back then] in a small shop \u2013 but these aren\u2019t around any more.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a feeling in our bones and hearts that there is something wrong with the system</p> <footer> <cite>Matthias Wolfschmidt, Foodwatch</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He believes, like many others, that the key turning point was the <a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\">EU </a><a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\"> hygiene </a><a href=\"https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/meat-inspection\"> regulations</a> that came into force in 2006.

The narrative sets off jauntily, recollecting a slightly embarrassing encounter between the speaker and a fellow student. Ambala bursts into the room where the speaker, \u201chalf-naked\u201d, is busy with face mask and leg-waxing. The protocol demands a theatrical display of apology. Ambala seems to bow, \u201cher statuesque body folding in on itself in a greeting\u201d. Like her accompanying song, this is a bit of burlesque, performed with grace and humour. The narrator, too, is suitably magnanimous: she explains her reaction as one of surprise, because she thought she\u2019d locked the door.</p> <p>We\u2019re particularly aware in these opening stanzas of the dazzled admiration the speaker feels towards the vivacious African. Her breathless tone (we know it\u2019s \u201cher\u201d because of the reference to \u201clife in a student female dorm\u201d) could even denote a crush. The metaphor in the relative clause, \u201ccleaving me with her beauty\u2019s pulse\u201d, is difficult to unravel. It works best if the \u201cpulse\u201d of Ambala\u2019s beauty is imagined as a sound \u2013 the heavily amplified drumbeat from a live band, filling the listener\u2019s whole body with thrilling but disconcerting vibrations. It\u2019s only retrospectively that the reader will connect these initial minor intrusions, suggested by the unlocked door, the sensation of \u201ccleaving\u201d, the mask-wearing) with the horror of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/06/study-reveals-fgm-india-female-genital-mutilation\">female </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/06/study-reveals-fgm-india-female-genital-mutilation\">genital </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/06/study-reveals-fgm-india-female-genital-mutilation\">mutilation (FGM)</a>.</p> <p>In stanza seven, the two characters exchange roles, as if in a folktale or fable. The narrator has learned from the first encounter that social taboos may be trivial, and their breaking pleasurable rather than traumatic. Boldly, she enters Ambala\u2019s room after a brief knock at the door \u2013 and her confidence is extinguished.</p> <p>Ambala sits on the floor in front of a mirror, naked, legs splayed, \u201cpeering deep inside herself\u201d. At first, the narrator tries denial through humour \u2013 or perhaps it\u2019s not denial, but a genuine effort at an interpretation: \u201cis this a new tantric // yoga posture I was ignorant of?\u201d When she notices the stain on the rug and Ambala\u2019s agonised expression, she\u2019s led to a new misunderstanding: she thinks Ambala has period pains.</p> <p>\u201cNo, this is different. A most brutal and unkind cut, / nothing like a male circumcision.\u201d The way Ambala talks about it demonstrates how unassimilable the experience has been for her, and is perceived to be for others. Ambala mixes fact with literary language and euphemism. The speaker herself descends into a tangled of harsh echoes: \u201cexcision\u201d, \u201claceration\u201d, \u201chumiliation\u201d. The nouns, like the verb-list in the penultimate stanza, chafe against each other. While the speaker is helplessly \u201caghast\u201d, Ambala, now that her secret is known, abandons her previous sophistication: childlike, she pleads, \u201cHold my hand, be my best friend forever.\u201d</p> <p>The young Indian woman in Shanta Acharya\u2019s novel <a href=\"https://www.shantaacharya.com/assets/html/shantaAcharya_novel_books_aWorldElsewhere.html\">A World Elsewhere</a> searches for self-fulfilment, hindered by cultural restrictions that begin early and fail to prepare women for autonomy. The character in the novel and the speaker in the poem are different, of course, but the poet creates a persona for the poem who has special insight into Ambala\u2019s ordeal \u2013 \u201cthere but for the grace of God,\u201d she thinks. Constraint is suggested in another way, too, by the diction: the two characters struggle to find words adequate to the experience.</p> <p>Both undergo change after the second encounter. The speaker re-orientates herself, away from her idealised Ambala to find the wounded and fragile woman under the extrovert social masks. Ambala, exposed, resists defensiveness and, in an act of profound trust, pleads for a vow of friendship. Despite the melting dreaminess of their concluding embrace, there\u2019s a flicker of revolutionary hope in the phrase \u201ca world unmutilated\u201d.</p> <p>A lesbian-feminist poem would develop this further. But it\u2019s also satisfying to read Ambala as a poem of warm female solidarity. Its impact registers through dialogue (notably, Ambala\u2019s change of voice) and through certain images \u2013 especially the stain, cruelly visible on the patterned rug, and the women\u2019s motherly-daughterly embrace, a bodily integration silently defying both the patriarchal and matriarchal power structures around FGM. It\u2019s only at the end of the collection that a note tells us that the meaning of the name Ambala is \u201cscar\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>By the time I gave birth to my second daughter, her older sister was just 19 months old. At the time, I did research for a small nonprofit and my income barely covered the childcare I\u2019d need to keep doing it. So, like<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/opting-out/500018/\"> a lot of mothers</a>, I left my job because it didn\u2019t make financial sense to continue working.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have a problem with the decision. Thanks to my background in public policy, I\u2019m well aware of the economic value of parenting. By fostering a safe, nurturing, and stable environment for my children in their infancy, I am helping to mold the intelligent, creative, hard-working adults society needs. In economic terms, I\u2019m helping to create human capital, which accounts for<a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29001/9781464810466.pdf\"> two-thirds of global wealth</a> and is a key driver of growth in our increasingly high-tech, globalized economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/08/us-mothers-policies-cultural-shift\">US mothers don't just need new policies \u2013 they need a cultural shift | Amy Westervelt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite all this, when I return to the labor force, I\u2019ll have nothing but a gap in my resume to show for it. It\u2019s a problem many more women will grapple with, owing to coronavirus and the need to take time off and care for their kids. An employer may accept parenting as an understandable explanation of that gap, but few would accept it as evidence of my hireability.</p> <p>This is frustrating, because I\u2019ve sharpened a wide range of skills as a parent: patience, adaptability, multitasking, communication, budgeting, problem solving. I\u2019ve become more efficient. I can finish tasks that once took me an hour during the 15 minutes my toddlers eat their breakfast. I\u2019ve become more decisive, simply because I no longer have much uninterrupted time for hemming and hawing.</p> <p>My ability to focus in the face of distraction has grown exponentially. I can follow a 16-step recipe with a baby on my hip and another twirling under my feet, singing the theme song to Frozen on a constant, off-key loop. I won\u2019t pretend that I\u2019m always graceful under the never-ending pressure of parenting, but there\u2019s no doubt I am mentally, physically and emotionally tougher as a result of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While many of the tasks of parenthood bear little resemblance to an office job, the mental labor involved is not so different</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everyone seems to agree that parenting is as difficult as it is important. Still, the fact that we don\u2019t mention parenting when someone asks about our work experience seems to indicate that we think of childrearing as unlike other forms of work, as if the Venn diagram of the skills they require is just two circles with no overlap. But this dichotomy dissolves under any serious scrutiny. Paid childcare positions, such as a nanny or nursery worker, count as work experience. Unpaid internships and volunteer positions count as work experience. I can see no reason that the unpaid childcare role of a parent shouldn\u2019t count for something, too.</p> <p>This has never been more obvious than right now, as the coronavirus has forced parents to shoulder caregiving duties previously outsourced to daycares and schools in addition to their other jobs.</p> <p>While many of the tasks of parenthood bear little resemblance to an office job, the mental labor involved is not so different. I don\u2019t just steam broccoli for my children, I manage their diets. I don\u2019t just take their temperatures when they\u2019re sick, I monitor their health and development. Surely the research, observation, coordination, and thoughtful decision-making this involves have applications in other forms of work.</p> <p>Yet the skills honed in parenthood go unrecognized by the working world. Every moment that mothers are absent from the labor force, our perceived value to potential employers deteriorates, as if our brains go to mush along with the carrots we\u2019re feeding our kids.</p> <p>It\u2019s no secret that childbearing deals a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/upshot/even-in-family-friendly-scandinavia-mothers-are-paid-less.html\">serious blow</a> to women\u2019s earnings, resulting in a so-called motherhood wage penalty. A recent <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X20300144\">analysis</a> of research on this phenomenon found that working mothers earn an average of 3.6% less per child than comparable childless women, much of which is explained by loss of work experience during career breaks. It\u2019s hard not to wonder why parenting does not \u2013 at least to some degree \u2013 count as work experience.</p> <p>I\u2019m not the first to point out this double standard. In her book, The Price of Motherhood, former New York Times reporter Ann Crittenden laments that \u201ceconomic theory has nothing to say about the acquisition of skills by those who work with children; presumably there are none\u201d. This, she argues, puts mothers at an undeserved disadvantage when they return to the labor force.</p> <p>\u201cChanging the status of mothers, by gaining real recognition for their work,\u201d Crittenden wrote, \u201cis the great unfinished business of the women\u2019s movement\u201d. Nearly two decades later, it remains unfinished.</p> <p>Obviously, I didn\u2019t become a mother for the paycheck or to advance my career. Parenting is, as they say, a labor of love \u2013 but it\u2019s still labor, and in many ways not so different than other forms of work. It only hurts unpaid caregivers like me to pretend otherwise. So while parenting may not qualify me to develop software for Google or sell bonds on Wall Street, it ought to count for something.</p>",
  "<p>Just three months ago, centrist Democrats were panicking.

With Biden the presumptive nominee and Donald Trump facing widespread criticism for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, election experts say the upper chamber is up for grabs.</p> <p>Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage, meaning Democrats will have to flip at least three seats to take the majority, assuming they win the White House. If they can\u2019t win the presidency, they will need four seats to control the Senate. Doug Jones, a Democrat, is considered an underdog for re-election in Alabama. If he loses, Democrats will need another Republican seat.</p> <p>But Jones\u2019s race is one of only a few chances for Republicans to flip a seat themselves. Other Democrats up for re-election, such as Gary Peters in Michigan, have started to pull ahead. The map is unfavorable for Republicans, with incumbents facing difficult re-election races in presidential battleground states like Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cOver the course of the last several months the playing field has gotten a little bit bigger, and I\u2019d say Democratic prospects in some of these individual races have also seemed to get a little bit better,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\">Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball</a> at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.</p> <p>\u201cThe overall race for the Senate is more of a coin flip than maybe you would have described it at the start of the cycle.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats have managed to expand the map, in part thanks to Biden clearing the presidential primary field, which seems to have improved the party\u2019s prospects in states Trump carried in 2016, such as North Carolina and Georgia.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of Democrats were rightly worried that if you had a more progressive nominee, an avowed Democratic socialist on the ticket like Bernie Sanders, flipping a state like North Carolina \u2026 would have been much harder,\u201d said Jessica Taylor, Senate and governors editor for the <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/\">Cook Political Report</a>.</p> <p>Republicans are on defense in states they previously thought safe, most notably Montana.

In 2017 he asked for global support in transforming the kingdom into an open society that would empower its citizens and \u2013 crucially \u2013 attract foreign investment. He has ostensibly introduced some liberal reforms, rescinding the ban on female drivers and restricting the powers of the religious police. He has also spent hundreds of millions building a global public relations machine selling his agenda to the world. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have no doubt that Newcastle United\u2019s fans do not wish their club to be run by the architect of such brutal repression</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But detention, torture and murder have been the backdrop to this. Among the regime\u2019s abuses have been those committed during the war in Yemen \u2013 which have led the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/03/uk-us-and-france-may-be-complicit-in-yemen-war-crimes-un-report\">UN</a> to make credible allegations of war crimes. <br><br>And my fiance, the journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, became a victim of the regime in October 2018. He was butchered by agents of the Saudi government in its consulate in Istanbul while I waited outside. The government tried to cover up the killing and failed. The CIA and UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/jamal-khashoggi-killing-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-evidence-un-report\">concluded</a> that the crown prince ordered Jamal\u2019s murder.</p> <p>The gruesome killing and its aftermath greatly tarnished Bin Salman\u2019s reputation and created a massive embarrassment for the Saudi government. For a few months many world leaders avoided the crown prince and some businesses refused to do business with Saudi Arabia. However, he is now working to salvage his reputation. A network of firms, many based in London, are working round the clock to deflect attention away from human rights abuses committed by the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has hosted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/07/they-want-the-money-the-real-reason-boxing-is-going-to-saudi-arabia\">boxing</a> matches and a golf event, and its long-term deal with wrestling organisation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/02/sportswashing-saudi-arabia-sports-mohammed-bin-salman\">WWE</a> remains intact. These events are simply window dressing, intended to restore faith in Bin Salman\u2019s rule, not expand actual freedoms to Saudis.<br><br>Far from being an enlightened ruler, Bin Salman has shown himself to be a destabilising force in the region. During the coronavirus crisis, while other states have been scrambling to protect their citizens, he has been consolidating power. In March, he arrested <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/saudi-arabia-detains-hundreds-government-officials-200316073516389.html\">298 government employees</a>, including three senior members of the royal family, under the guise of fighting corruption. Last month, the sovereign wealth fund he chairs bought a $500m (\u00a3410m) stake in the US entertainment company Live Nation. And he has worked since the crisis began to take back lost market share through an oil price war. <br><br>The failure of the world\u2019s governments to hold Bin Salman to account in recent years has already emboldened him. Now his investment group is poised to take ownership of one of the English Premier League\u2019s most widely supported clubs. Yet the league will violate its own charter if it allows the move to go ahead: this <a href=\"https://resources.premierleague.com/premierleague/document/2020/05/11/9de08b33-1f94-4ac7-9868-8bb157807062/2019-20-PL-Handbook-070520.pdf\">charter</a> prohibits someone to become a club\u2019s director if \u201che has engaged in conduct outside the United Kingdom that would constitute an offence \u2026 if such conduct had taken place in the United Kingdom, whether or not such conduct resulted in a conviction\u201d. I have no doubt that Newcastle United\u2019s fans do not wish their club to be run by the architect of such brutal repression.

  "<p>\u2018The fire got a bit out of control,\u201d says Blixa Bargeld, recalling a gig his band played in 1986. As Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten, which means Collapsing New Buildings, wrapped up their set of cacophonous industrial noise, Bargeld took a tray of lighter fluid and threw a match on it before squirting on more and watching the flames erupt. \u201cOh, it was gigantic,\u201d he says with a wry smile. Panic and chaos ensued.</p> <p>Today, thankfully, the only thing being toasted is a tablespoon of peppercorns Bargeld has instructed me to put in a pan as pasta bubbles away furiously. We are preparing spaghetti cacio e pepe. \u201cMy pasta is from Mancini,\u201d he announces over Zoom, while opening a bottle of white wine. \u201cHe\u2019s the only pasta-maker who grows his own wheat and has a doctorate.\u201d Mine is from Co-op.</p> <p>Bargeld has been <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_z3w_xIJn_/?igshid=jbyvg5z56d51\">regularly hosting these cooking sessions with fans</a> via Patreon and Instagram. He picks a recipe, curates a playlist, drinks wine, dances, and people cook along. Wearing formal dinner attire rather than a chef\u2019s outfit, Bargeld talks me through this simple yet punchy dish. \u201cPeople think you just put cheese over the pasta but that won\u2019t do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to make a juice out of the peppercorns. Like a tea.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7de69666195b25fac47a2217a466e5dc7e5f41d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7de69666195b25fac47a2217a466e5dc7e5f41d/0_0_1918_1009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018He was the most beautiful man in the world\u2019 ...

Bargeld cooking on Instagram, in an EN-logo apron, during lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: neubautenorg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such activity is an extension of the community he has built among the German band\u2019s fans. As an early adopter of crowdfunding, the group has been self-sufficient and patronage-funded since 2002. \u201cIt\u2019s not an option for a band like us,\u201d Bargeld says of the traditional record label model. \u201cThe money I currently get for making the album cover would be the amount I\u2019d get for the whole record if I were to sign a record contract now.\u201d</p> <p>For 40 years, Bargeld has fronted Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten, an inimitable and pioneering outfit known for their blueprint influence on industrial music and their proclivity for utilising building tools and scrap metal, as well as inventing contraptions to be used as instruments.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/06/henry-rollins-trump-fans-are-going-to-be-very-dangerous-losers\">Henry Rollins</a> loves them so much he has the band\u2019s logo as a tattoo. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/21/trent-reznor-nine-inch-nails-youre-seeing-the-fall-of-america\">Trent Reznor</a> cites them as a huge influence on Nine Inch Nails and later signed them to his label in the US. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nick-cave\">Nick Cave</a> stumbled across them, he fell in love and later wrote of Bargeld: \u201cHe stood in a black leotard, black rubber pants, black rubber boots. Around his neck hung a thoroughly fucked guitar. His skin cleared to his bones, his skull was an utter disaster, scabbed and hacked. Blixa Bargeld. He was the most beautiful man in the world.\u201d Cave soon invited Bargeld to be the guitarist in Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, where he remained for 20 years until 2003.</p> <p>However, just as Bargeld\u2019s aptitude for playing genial host belies his reputation as a man known to scream so intensely it can make dogs miles away howl, there\u2019s also more to Neubauten than ear-terrorising industrial noise mania. This is displayed clearly on their latest album, Alles in Allem, their first studio record in 13 years.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nz9t_4XLcc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Nz9t_4XLcc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nz9t_4XLcc\">Watch the video for new album title track Alles in Allem</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cThe attitude towards the music has relaxed,\u201d says Bargeld. \u201cTwenty years ago, I would have needed to fill spaces, thinking something was too boring or lacking. That\u2019s youth. It\u2019s a different attitude now. I don\u2019t have that urge to fill every space or think there needs to be another scream.\u201d</p> <p>In tone, the result is still quintessentially Neubauten, a band that intuitively understands the equal power of restraint and exertion, albeit with noir pop, ambient soundscapes, sweeping strings and poignant melody overshadowing the cold, brittle rattle of industrial clatter. And why the long wait? \u201cArt doesn\u2019t come from when you can do something,\u201d says Bargeld. \u201cIt comes from when you have to do something.\u201d</p> <p>Having formed in 1980, the band\u2019s early output was a combination of avant-punk, noise, industrial and experimental. They rehearsed in a giant air-conditioning shaft situated underneath \u2013 technically inside \u2013 an autobahn overpass. The intensity of the sound ricocheted around the space whose steel walls doubled as drums, and set the band on a unique path.</p> <p>Having something of an epiphany while listening to traditional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/10/worldmusic\">Ethiopian music</a>, Bargeld asked: \u201cWhat is the authenticity of my life?\u201d The answer lay around him in the debris of post-war Berlin coupled with its fertile and anything-goes outlook. \u201cA lot has been said of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/12/how-berlin-made-me-a-better-artist-chris-petit\">West Berlin in the 1980s</a> and all of it is true. It was like ground zero. The band is connected to this very special environment.\u201d They sold their drum kit to pay rent and soon started to assemble their own instruments and creations, foraging in scrapyards or elsewhere. The message: \u201cBe clever, steal from a construction site\u201d was written across their first self-made drum set.</p> <p>Fuelled by booze and speed, the band found their reputation would precede them. \u201cThe fire thing was moving faster than we were,\u201d Bargeld says. \u201cWe\u2019d turn up to gigs and they\u2019d already be standing there with fire extinguishers. That was something we had to stop, as it became showbusiness. Just showing the audience a petrol canister filled with water became enough to terrify them.\u201d</p> <p>One gig \u2013 Concerto for Voice and Machinery at London\u2019s ICA in 1984 \u2013 became so legendary it was later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/16/popandrock1\">restaged as an artwork in 2007</a>. But its myth has outgrown reality, Bargeld says. The story goes the band planned to drill through the floor into a rumoured secret passage that led to Buckingham Palace. Years later band member Alexander Hacke described the sound they made as \u201ca cross between a building site and war\u201d.</p> <p>His role was to throw milk bottles into a cement mixer. As glass flew out into the crowd, smoke from the petrol chainsaws began to suffocate them, too. The power supply was pulled and a riot followed. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take part in that show,\u201d recalls Bargeld. The gig also featured members of Throbbing Gristle and Fad Gadget. \u201cThe damage was started by the audience, not the band. It was not planned.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9061c6b40a78fd67db5ccd4b9d5e123939ef18da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9061c6b40a78fd67db5ccd4b9d5e123939ef18da/0_558_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"More relaxed \u2026 Blixa Bargeld and Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">More relaxed \u2026 Blixa Bargeld and Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mote Sinabel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You don\u2019t have to look too far for stories where myth and reality intertwine, however. The band did attempt to drill through a wall at the Berlin venue S036, and ex-member FM Einheit did have a penchant for throwing molotov cocktails into the audience, often causing riots. One night in Copenhagen, says Bargeld, \u201cwe were playing in a squat and we climbed up on the PA and began to chisel off parts of the ceiling. They viewed it as an attack on their house, so they slashed the tyres of our tour van, smashed the windows and stole equipment including our Kango drill.\u201d They lasted just one night as tour support for U2 before being thrown off. The outraged and hostile audience threw bottles of urine. The band responded by throwing iron bars back at them.</p> <p>This led many to think of the band as provocateurs but Bargeld disagrees. \u201cI didn\u2019t start out to destroy the stages of the world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was just a sign of being alive more than a provocation.\u201d While still ferociously intense, shows are less wild these days. Sparks still fly, metal still scrapes and power tools still grind, as Bargeld glides between rich baritone croon and vocal cord-shredding scream, but there\u2019s also melancholic beauty and tenderness. \u201cWe\u2019re very serious about representing the material the best we can,\u201d says Bargeld. \u201cIt\u2019s not really about chaos \u2013 although I did fall off stage and break my leg not that long ago.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's not really about chaos \u2013\u00a0although I did fall off stage and break my leg not that long ago</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One constant is the band\u2019s innovative approach to equipment and recording. \u201cThere\u2019s a strategy,\u201d says Bargeld. \u201cI want to undermine routine and sabotage logic. We\u2019ve been doing that for 40 years with unusual instrumentation. It\u2019s important to undermine functionality and knowledge \u2013 to disturb the obvious.\u201d</p> <p>For Bargeld, the sound of Tupperware filled with nails and coins being shaken recalls the sound of the ocean, while a microphone swiped across a shopping trolley mirrors the lush plucks of a harp. Nick Cave once wrote vividly about watching the band mic up a dog to root around in pig guts. \u201cWhat I want when working with unusual materials is for them to open up and give something of their character away,\u201d Bargeld says. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about sound. I think it\u2019s highly overvalued. I care about context and metaphor.\u201d</p> <p>Watching Bargeld slurp up some pepper-coated spaghetti reminds me they have a percussive instrument called the noodle. However, foraging is getting harder these days apparently. \u201cWe went to a scrapyard,\u201d says Bargeld. \u201cBut due to security reasons, they don\u2019t let you in any more. They only let you look through the trash, and there\u2019s not much treasure to be found in there.\u201d Still, the band is still finding beautiful sounds in unexpected places. \u201cPolystyrene,\u201d says Bargeld, taking another mouthful, \u201cgives you incredible sounds.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Alles in Allem is out now on Potomak.</p>",
  "<p>It is now certain. We will emerge from lockdown grieving for those lost and yearning for our previous lives, only to crash <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/snapback-uk-economy-lockdown-recession-coronavirus\">into a recession</a>.

Conventional wisdom has changed almost overnight. The words \u201cthe pandemic has exposed\u201d have become a mantra, as existing fractures (apparent as they were to some of us) are revealed to all. The pandemic exposed our failing healthcare systems; the disparity between the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-crisis-nhs-not-drained-migrants-sustained-died-frontline\">perception of immigrants as a drain</a> and the reality of them as pillars of our communities; the gulf between races and classes; the incompetence of our politicians; the fatal consequences of diminishing public services.</p> <p>Even establishment bastions turned against the current political order. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7eff769a-74dd-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca\">The Financial Times wrote</a> that \u201cradical reforms \u2013 reversing the prevailing policy direction of the last four decades \u2013 will need to be put on the table\u201d. Emily Maitlis looked straight at the BBC Newsnight camera and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-emily-maitlis-newsnight-bbc-inequality-boris-johnson-a9456696.html\">slated the inequalities</a> of the pandemic. Rightwing governments in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/anglo-american-coronavirus-crisis\">Britain and the US</a> scrambled to pay people to stay at home. Surely, all these things point to a revolution.</p> <p>The rupturing effects of the lockdown appear to be laying the foundations for our new world. \u201cNature is healing\u201d is now a meme. The air is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/30/clean-air-in-europe-during-lockdown-leads-to-11000-fewer-deaths\">cleaning itself</a>. As we clap each Thursday, the old hierarchies that defined \u201cskilled\u201d and \u201cunskilled\u201d seem to be dissolving. Some hold out for further changes, anticipating the introduction of low-carbon jobs to replace those lost, or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/universal-basic-income-coronavirus-shocks\">universal basic income</a>, or rethinking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/15/humans-resources-coronavirus-democratise-work-health-lives-market\">value of labour</a> altogether.</p> <p>But observation alone does not bring about transformation. There is a naivety in the hope that once ideas are discussed and made popular, they will permeate policymaking and bring about change. History shows us that, during a period of economic upheaval, this is unlikely. The 2008 financial crisis is the clearest cautionary tale.</p> <p>In reality, the first thing that happens in a recession tends not to be radical reengineering of the economy. The first impulse is to make a quick calculation: who should be saved and who is dispensable. In the US after the 2008 crash, the banks were recapitalised and the economy stabilised, and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/5-groups-still-recovering-from-the-financial-crisis/\">10 million Americans</a> lost their homes. The only factor that mattered was how many people could be lost without disrupting the economy for everyone else.</p> <p>That question is already being asked with regard to the current lockdown. How many deaths can we afford before the economy suffers? Who are we happy to sacrifice, so that the rest of us can thrive? In the UK, the answer to that second question has been those already disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The working classes, the cleaners, the construction workers \u2013 the manual levers of the economy \u2013 have become the canaries, sent back down the coal mine to test the first stage of lockdown easing. If infections surge, it will hit them first.</p> <p>If the loss of life is at a level deemed acceptable by big business and government, the focus will shift to moving on while minimising the need for change. The old order \u2013 that some are already writing eulogies for \u2013 will surge back rather than retreating. We will be told that deep-rooted reform is not necessary because this is an unprecedented crisis, an unforeseen event, a once-in-a-lifetime shock. Any failings are merely opportunities to learn lessons, as the prime minister\u2019s deputy, Dominic Raab, is fond of saying: lessons about how to respond to an exact similar threat rather than reflect on the reason it was allowed to take hold in the first place.</p> <p>The language of a resilient infrastructure doing its best is deliberate \u2013 useful in creating the impression that once the pandemic passes, so does the problem. Failures in the care sector are \u201cchallenges\u201d; the NHS, rather than being underfunded and weakened, has been a success because it has not been overwhelmed, ignoring the infected patients who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/29/care-homes-refusing-to-take-in-patients-discharged-nhs-hospitals-coronavirus-risk\">shipped out from hospitals</a> to care homes to spread the deadly virus to the most frail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/show-care-lockdown-clap-transgressors-rontline-workers-pandemic\">We're all keen to show we care, but we've shaped a society that doesn\u2019t care at all | Sam Byers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fuelled by dissembling and denial, the country lurches forward with a broken economy, a depleted public sector, an underpaid and underprotected class of workers, and a vilified migrant population.</p> <p>In the final stages, policies to help the vulnerable launched at the start of the pandemic will be quietly jettisoned. A pledge to review the NHS surcharge for foreign doctors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/government-reviewing-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-medics\">has come to nothing</a>. A popular programme to house homeless people in England in hotels was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/15/fears-for-homeless-as-leak-suggests-rough-sleeper-funding-to-end\">quietly scrapped</a> last week. The homeless returning to the streets will be joined by others sent there by the economic downturn. They will be scapegoated, along with the rest of the dispensable victims.</p> <p>Who took more than their share in furlough? Who wasn\u2019t alert? A chorus of <a href=\"https://www.spiked-online.com/2020/05/15/fear-kills/\">reactionary voices</a> is already lining up for this task.</p> <p>None of this inevitable, but it is all likely if we are not vigilant. History shows us that whatever horrors a crisis exposes, they can be covered up in the shattered aftermath. Yes, we must imagine the new world that needs to come out of this crisis: but it will not come to pass without a fight.</p> <p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>The first message of peace and goodwill from the young people of Wales was sent out to the world via morse code. Later their words of hope and solidarity were broadcast through the BBC World Service, then television and the internet, and as the decades passed they became more ambitious, featuring poetry, song and dance.</p> <p>This year, a stripped-down, lockdown version of the message has been created, in which more than 30 young Welsh people call for the world to rethink its priorities in the times of Covid-19.</p> <p>The youngsters were asked to record the clarion call from home, and their contributions were spliced together to produce a strong statement of where they think the world is now and where they want it to be.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a very powerful and relevant message,\u201d said one of the contributors, Thomas Pugh, 17, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan. \u201cI hope it will encourage people to reflect and consider our situation and how we can improve things.\u201d</p> <p>The message is sent out every springtime by the youth movement <a href=\"https://www.urdd.cymru/cy/\">Urdd Gobaith Cymru </a>(Welsh League of Youth), which has 55,000 members aged eight to 25. Previous themes range from the atomic bomb to the plight of refugees and poverty. The plan for 2020 had been to focus on women\u2019s rights \u2013 until coronavirus prompted a rethink.</p> <p>Caitlin Kelly, 23, an Urdd peace and goodwill officer, said: \u201cWe had to respond to what was happening. With schools shut there are a lot of young people isolated at the moment, normal connections have been split. I think its a hopeful message \u2013 we look forward.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important young people\u2019s voices are heard in the global conversation. Young people have managed to make some good noise about the climate crisis. We want to ask the world leaders to think about the young people who are going to inherit this mess.\u201d</p> <p>The message begins: \u201cDear people of the world,\u201d and goes on to say nature has \u201cshaken us\u201d. We spend, waste and travel needlessly, and now is the time to act, it adds.</p> <p>It tells world leaders: \u201cCorona has stopped the clock,\u201d and it calls on them to listen to young people and wake up.</p> <p>The text of the message will be available in 57 languages, and a video version of the young people presenting the message in Welsh, with subtitles in six other languages, will be shared on social media.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Urdd\">Urdd</a> chief executive, Si\u00e2n Lewis, has written to Boris Johnson, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to highlight the message.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThe Covid-19 crisis has been a huge and painful challenge to all of us. We\u2019ve witnessed devastating loss of life and livelihood. Yet in many ways, the crisis brought out the best in our commitment to our communities, our common values and humanity and our young people are determined that political leaders do not drop those commitments as the virus recedes.\u201d</p> <p>The first peace message was broadcast in 1922. Over the years it has produced some moving responses. In 1946, young people in Germany replied: \u201cIt is years since we have heard from the Welsh children. How it grew dark! We should like to hear from you again.\u201d</p> <p>Two years later, children in Japan responded: \u201cWe are really happy to know, after so many years of isolation, that you have sent so hearty words of friendship and love.\u201d</p> <h2>The 2020 message</h2> <p>Dear people of the world,</p> <p>Nature has shaken us \u2013 it\u2019s called on us to wake up.</p> <p>We spend needlessly.

The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile Spain<strong> </strong> recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months.

Officials have cited divine protection for Burundi\u2019s ostensibly low infection rate and urged citizens to go about their daily lives without fear.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.iwacu-burundi.org/covid-19-le-burundi-est-une-exception-car-cest-un-pays-qui-a-donne-a-dieu-la-premiere-place/\">Nkurunziza\u2019s spokesperson recently said </a>that though the country may be hit by the pandemic, \u201cBurundi \u2026 has signed a special covenant with God, whether you believe it or not\u201d.<br><br>Evariste Ndayishimiye, the CNDD-FDD\u2019s candidate, said people should not be afraid because \u201cGod loves Burundi\u201d, adding that if there were people who had tested positive, it was \u201cso that God may manifest his power in Burundi\u201d.</p> <p>Six other candidates are running, including the opposition leader Agathon Rwasa, who is deputy chairman of the national assembly. Rwasa has been able to open offices and hold large rallies around the country in what has been an unexpectedly competitive campaign.</p> <p>Nelleke van de Walle of the International Crisis Group, a research organisation, said: \u201cYou do see certain elements of a real election \u2026 but political space is really limited. There is almost no local or international media left. This is definitely not an election where people can express their opinions freely.\u201d</p> <p>Both Ndayishimiye and Rwasa were senior commanders in predominantly Hutu militias during a civil war in which about 300,000 people were killed. Nkurunziza came to power in 2005 as part of a peace deal.</p> <p>Ndayishimiye has promised to \u201cfight poverty and develop the country\u201d, claiming his party had taken 15 years to \u201clay the foundations\u201d for the future, and it was not the time to put \u201camateurs\u201d in power.</p> <p>Voters who spoke to journalists in Burundi last week were too fearful to give their names. A 45-year-old vegetable seller in the capital, Bujumbura, supported the ruling party because it had provided welfare.</p> <p>\u201cThey give us rice and beans and can build houses for the most vulnerable among us like elders or widows,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But a jobless 32-year-old supported the opposition. \u201cAll of us need change, many Burundians need \u2026 one to end this daily violence, these killings, this rampant corruption and economic embezzlement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Medics and others have braved official threats to raise concerns that the true number of Covid-19 cases is much higher than the official count.</p> <p>A health ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said seven patients had gone to one hospital with symptoms such as respiratory distress and that a whole wing had been dedicated to them ata military hospital.</p> <p>A doctor, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, reported six deaths of patients \u201cpresenting all the symptoms of coronavirus\u201d last week.</p> <p>Six staff responsible for taking samples at the National Institute of Public Health, the only place in Burundi that was carrying out tests, have become ill with the virus.</p> <p>\u201cSince then all activity is paralysed, no test can be carried out, it is a catastrophe,\u201d an employee of the institute said.</p> <p>The country\u2019s last election in 2015 led to violence that left at least 1,200 dead, displaced hundreds of thousands and resulted in a sustained crackdown on the opposition and media. Aid was cut off by donors and sanctions imposed.</p> <p>Last year the government shut down the UN human rights office after repeated criticism that members of the CNDD-FDD\u2019s youth wing and the security services were torturing, gang-raping and murdering political opponents. Rights groups say those attacks have increased in the run-up to Wednesday\u2019s presidential, legislative and municipal elections.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Nkurunziza will remain president until August, and a new constitution has given him sweeping powers to declare a state of emergency if the results are disputed.</p> <p>\u201cA perfect storm is brewing in Burundi, but after years of repression, few are left to bear witness and sound the alarm,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/lewis-mudge\">Lewis Mudge</a>, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>Burundi is one the poorest country in the world, <a href=\"https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/the-poorest-countries-in-the-world\">by some measures.</a></p> <p>\u201cThe economic record of Nkurunziza\u2019s 15 years in power is catastrophic.

When Australia first proposed a global inquiry last month, China said it was \u201cseriously concerned about and firmly opposed to this\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSince the outbreak began, China has always acted in an open, transparent and responsible manner and taken a series of resolute, timely and forceful measures,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang then said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/let-taiwan-help-the-who-fight-covid-19\">Let Taiwan help the WHO fight Covid-19 | Letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia led the charge publicly with calls for an inquiry that has now gathered the support of 62 countries, but it has come at the expense of further strain in Australia-China relations.

The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room.</p> <p>Besides the input from Taiwan as a country that has successfully combated Covid-19, the US push for its inclusion is part of a broader struggle between Washington and Beijing for influence within the WHO.</p> <p>Member states will vote on Taiwan\u2019s admittance to the assembly. A unanimous affirmation is required, and it appears increasingly like China will block Taiwan\u2019s admittance.</p> <p>Since the election of the pro-independence president, Tsai Ing-wen, in 2016, China has routinely vetoed Taiwan\u2019s inclusion into UN bodies. Taiwan participated in the WHA as an observer from 2009 to 2016, when the Beijing-friendly president, Ma Ying-jeou, was in office, but has not been invited since.</p> <h2><strong>What are the other issues up for debate?</strong></h2> <p>This will be an intensely political WHA \u2013 a meeting that often passes with little public commentary \u2013 because of the continuing Covid-19 crisis around the world, and the varying capabilities of government responses.</p> <p>The role of the World Health Organisation itself, and its response to the pandemic, will also be under extreme scrutiny, following accusations from the US, Australia and Germany, among others, that it was slow to respond to the initial outbreak and has displayed a bias towards China.</p> <p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has weathered much of the criticism, in particular from the US president, Donald Trump, who said the organisation was \u201cvery China-centric\u201d and had given the US a \u201cfaulty recommendation\u201d about keeping its borders open.</p> <p>The WHO has been criticised for its response to pandemics before.</p> <p>In 2009, it declared the H1N1 flu outbreak as a pandemic, a decision later criticised by some governments that argued it triggered countries to take expensive measures against a disease that was ultimately milder than forecast.</p> <p>The agency and its then director general, Margaret Chan, also faced sharp criticism for not reacting fast enough to the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in December 2013.</p> <p>The 2020 WHA will also address a global vaccine action plan, neglected tropical diseases, and polio eradication.</p> <p><em>with Reuters</em></p>",

The airline had sponsored the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the cricket, but its sponsorship of the basketball team had constituted a handful of domestic return airfare vouchers each year the club would raffle off to raise funds.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought at the time that the airline would be rescued, probably like everybody else now thinks with Virgin. It came as a fairly big shock when we realised it wouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d Hunt says.</p> <p>In 2018, the basketball club was featured on ABC\u2019s show Gruen, about carrying a sponsor\u2019s name that no longer exists. At the sight of an Ansett player pictured mid-slam dunk, host Wil Anderson joked, \u201cthey managed to stay in the air longer than a commercial airline\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABCTV/status/1002036950117728256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Ansett basketball team in Darwin - Best team ever!! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gruen?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gruen</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wil_Anderson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Wil_Anderson</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/EVbGamZz6P\">pic.twitter.com/EVbGamZz6P</a></p>&mdash; abctv (@ABCTV) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABCTV/status/1002036950117728256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The club now boasts more than 220 players and won the NT\u2019s highest state competition in 2016 before a crowd of 750. \u201cAnsett is synonymous with basketball now, we\u2019re one of the strongest clubs in the city,\u201d Hunt says.</p> <p>Ansett is also an important part of the identity of Hamilton in western Victoria, where a <a href=\"http://ansettmuseum.com.au/\">museum</a> is dedicated to the airline, and Sir Reginald Ansett\u2019s road transport businesses, that started in the town.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"db4c46da4f2f5475f8b5665c656db03d47c5acac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db4c46da4f2f5475f8b5665c656db03d47c5acac/0_0_5760_2569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"old tin aircraft hangar turned into a museum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"446\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sir Reginald Ansett Transport museum in Hamilton, Victoria is built inside the hangar that housed Ansett\u2019s first Fokker Universal aircraft in 1936.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sir Reginald Ansett Transport Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ansett\u2019s family attended the museum\u2019s opening in 1991, which was built after locals took the idea to the council.</p> <p>The museum is housed in the original airline hangar that housed the Fokker Universal plane that flew Ansett\u2019s inaugural route between Hamilton and Melbourne in 1936. It is now run by volunteers seven days a week, and hosts about 300 visitors a month, which are mostly former Ansett employees, coach passengers who stop off in Hamilton and local school groups.</p> <p>Displays include a restored Fokker aircraft, models, vehicles, flight attendant and baggage handler uniforms, inflight kitchen dining sets used in service, and other memorabilia.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t even realise there is an Ansett museum, but it\u2019s actually gotten busier for us after the collapse,\u201d says Heather Kruger, secretary of the museum.</p> <p>Kruger sympathises with the uncertainty Virgin employees are facing \u2013 almost two decades after Ansett grounded its flights, she is still hopeful it will return to the skies.</p> <p>\u201cSir Reg put Hamilton on the map.
