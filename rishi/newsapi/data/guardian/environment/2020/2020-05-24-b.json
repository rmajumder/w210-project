Thanks as always for following along. </p> \n  <p>Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wuhan lab had bat coronaviruses \u2013 but not Covid-19.</strong> The Chinese virology institute in Wuhan, the city in China at the heart of the coronavirus pandemic, has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the Covid-19 strain, its director has said. The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims by US president Donald Trump that the virus could have leaked from the facility were \u201cpure fabrication\u201d. In an interview filmed on 13 May but broadcast on Saturday night, Wang Yanyi said the centre had \u201cisolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats. Now we have three strains of live viruses \u2026 But their highest similarity to Sars-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8%.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>US opens up for summer. </strong>There are fears the US will suffer a second wave of coronavirus infections as it opens up for summer, just days away from the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths. Every state has relaxed restrictions to some extent, with many flocking to beaches and outdoor areas. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">filled the entire front page</a> of Sunday\u2019s paper with the death notices of victims from across the country as the country recorded more than 97,000 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Argentina extends lockdown. </strong>Argentina has extended the mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires until 7 June and tightened some movement restrictions, after a steady increase in the city\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days. Officials will tighten traffic controls between the capital and Buenos Aires province, the area with the second highest concentration of cases. The country recorded 704 new infections on Saturday, one of the highest single-day increases since the pandemic began.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases near 350,000. </strong>Brazil registered 965 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,013, the health ministry said. The country now has 347,398 confirmed cases, according to the ministry, up 16,508 from Friday, when it surpassed Russia to become the world\u2019s virus hot spot behind the US. The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as the testing capacity of Latin America\u2019s largest country still lags.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand reports no new cases. </strong>New Zealand\u2019s health ministry has announced there were zero new coronavirus cases confirmed in the last 24 hours. According to NewsHub, there are now only 27 active cases left in New Zealand, with one more patient recovered, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,154, with 21 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australian states ease restrictions. </strong>In Australia, Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, has said Victorians will be allowed to have 20 people in their homes as well as overnight stays in hotels from 1 June. In New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, health minister Brad Hazzard announced that beauty, tanning, nail and waxing salons would all be open from 1 June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pompeo threatens Australia over Belt and Road projects. </strong>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has implied information sharing with Australia may be at risk if the Victoria proceeds with any Belt and Road projects that jeopardise communications networks. Issuing the highly qualified warning during an interview with Sky News Australia, the News Corp-owned channel, Pompeo urged Victoria to scrutinise any proposals \u201cincredibly closely\u201d because Belt and Road projects could \u201cbuild up the capacity of the Chinese Communist party to do harm\u201d. Victoria has attracted domestic political criticism for signing an agreement that would allow for it be part of the Belt and Road Initiative.</li> \n   <li><strong>French churches to hold first masses since lockdown started. </strong>French churches were preparing to hold their first Sunday masses in more than two months after the government bowed to a ruling that they should be reopened. Nearly two weeks into the relaxation of its shutdown, the government finally allowed churches, mosques and synagogues to reopen. Worshippers will have to wear masks, there will have to be disinfectant gel on hand and the seating will need to be organised to ensure people keep a safe distance from each other.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser under pressure as second trip emerges. </strong>In the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, faces renewed pressure to resign after new witnesses reported <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/new-witnesses-cast-doubt-on-dominic-cummingss-lockdown-claims\">seeing him making a fresh trip</a> hundreds of miles to Durham.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/coronavirus-latest-24-may-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T07:11:22.294Z\">at 8.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eca19d58f0886ce4f5d951e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:56:05.370Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In Australia, a Darwin pub has been fined more than AU$5,000 (US$3,270) for repeatedly failing to adhere to strict coronavirus laws.</p> \n  <p>Police and environmental health officers issued a caution to Lola\u2019s Pergola on 15 May for failing to serve separate meals to people consuming liquor, patrons not being seated while drinking and social distancing not being implemented.<br><br>One week later, further observations confirmed reports from concerned patrons that alcohol was being served without meals.</p> \n  <p>Advice about the chief health officer\u2019s directions was provided to the owner at the time.<br><br>But the next day, the venue had to be cautioned again and the following day the infringement notice was issued.<br><br>More than 11,000 compliance checks have been completed and 57 fines issued.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:58:26.951Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eca10b58f08a1782fa807f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/michael-savage\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T06:47:27.642Z\">7.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>UK low-income households denied coronavirus support by benefit cap</h2> \n  <p>Tens of thousands of poor households are being denied extra support designed to ease the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, after being hit by the government\u2019s benefit cap.</p> \n  <p>The number of low-income households affected by the cap in London has doubled since the crisis started, according to analysis seen by the <em>Observer</em>. Households already at the cap when the crisis hit have been missing out on \u00a3320 a month in additional support. For private renters with children, this is \u00a3532 a month. A further 22,000 households are now at the cap and are missing out on an average of \u00a3185 a month.</p> \n  <p>It has led to an outcry that there is now a two-tier system, in which workers on the government\u2019s furlough scheme have access to far more support than some of those reliant on welfare.

  "<p>What do you suppose our pets did before Covid-19, at home all day without us? Perhaps they peered out of the window, had a little play in the garden, dug a hole, chewed on a bone or a piece of string. Or, in our minds, did they yearn for us from the moment we left until we returned?</p> <p>Covid-19 restrictions have changed the way we interact with our dogs and cats. We\u2019ve spent so much time at home with them that it\u2019s easy to imagine they won\u2019t cope without us.</p> <p>Actually, says Black Hawk veterinarian Dr Lee Danks, we\u2019re probably not giving them enough credit. He says when life goes back to relative normality, our dogs and cats are probably going to be just fine, with a little consideration of course.</p> <h2><strong>Dogs and cats have complex feelings</strong></h2> <p>Dogs need social interaction for their wellbeing, Danks says. But their needs are more complicated than that. Healthy relationships between dogs and humans are similar to those between people: dogs need to spend time with us and without us. We\u2019re responsible for giving them space to just be dogs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about realising that dogs and cats are also emotional animals,\u201d Danks says. \u201cFor us, having a pet reduces stress. Their companionship provides us with a sense of purpose or improves our fitness. But let\u2019s remember that it\u2019s a two-way street. While we have them for all those benefits, we need to respect that our dogs and cats have emotional sensitivities as well.\u201d</p> <p>For pet owners that means being open to the spectrum of your pet\u2019s feelings and considering their needs, not only in physical terms or at certain times, but as a whole.</p> <h2><strong>Separation anxiety is only one part of the equation</strong></h2> <p>Dogs and cats can exhibit destructive behaviours because we\u2019re not with them. But our absence is not necessarily the only reason for their behaviour, Danks says.</p> <p>\u201cIn pet behavioural circles, there\u2019s talk about separation-related disorders, because it\u2019s not always anxiety. A dog might go ahead and chew the arm off your couch and the cat may be intensely sharpening their claws on it, but they\u2019re loving it! They\u2019re having the time of their life.\u201d</p> <p>Common signs of separation disorders in pets are weeing and pooing where they shouldn\u2019t, chewing or digging/clawing, and vocalising (more common with dogs, who will bark, howl and whine). If we want to eliminate these behaviours, we need to uncover what motivates them, and what emotions drive them. Our pets might be frustrated and bored, or even be fearful of the situation. We might even have inadvertently trained them into it, reinforcing and rewarded their \u201cbad\u201d behaviour by giving them the attention they crave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b81e3c1360f5104056c7c2db683c6f740f079d80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b81e3c1360f5104056c7c2db683c6f740f079d80/0_809_3800_4750/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ignore your pet sometimes: It is healthy to ignore your pet sometimes, especially when they are demanding too much attention.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Ignore your pet sometimes:</strong> It is healthy to ignore your pet sometimes, especially when they are demanding too much attention.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maskot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Ignore your pet sometimes:</strong> It is healthy to ignore your pet sometimes, especially when they are demanding too much attention.

As soon as something changes, there\u2019s a flow-on effect. \u201cIn a dog\u2019s mind, if I don\u2019t get this resource, for example a meal, where am I going to get my next meal from?\u201d Danks says. \u201cAnd the one after that? Where am I going to get the other needs? It\u2019s a delicate balance.</p> <p>\u201cIf, during these weeks, we\u2019ve given our dogs constant attention, we\u2019ve created the rod for our own backs. We should think about slowly managing that expectation, and teaching them that alone time is OK, creating yet another take on the \u2018new normal\u2019. It\u2019s about that boring word: routine, routine, routine.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0330f90058ab6bf6ec45637c70dafae633ea2b46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0330f90058ab6bf6ec45637c70dafae633ea2b46/0_0_3628_4530/801.jpg\" alt=\"Gradual training: You can get your pet used to being alone again by first leaving the house for just a few minutes, extending it to 15 minutes, then half an hour etc, and slowly increasing this time.

While they have similar physical and emotional needs (with some interesting quirks), they\u2019re much bigger fans of place than people.</p> <p>\u201cCats like to know that the world will provide for them, rather than necessarily feeling indebted to a singular person. This is why they will happily take a meal from your neighbours, as long as it\u2019s in their established territory, and they know they\u2019ll be safe in that place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec4ab35529cf9262b614aa81582fdd85d14b8e93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec4ab35529cf9262b614aa81582fdd85d14b8e93/0_0_3975_2968/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Even cats will benefit from a few practice sessions of returning to a more solitary life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"747\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Even cats will benefit from a few practice sessions of returning to a more solitary life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image by Chris Winsor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Even cats will benefit from a few practice sessions of returning to a more solitary life.

What they need is a sense of security that comes from established patterns and routine.</p> <h2><strong>Promote a healthy relationship with your pet, every day</strong></h2> <p>As they say, prevention is better than cure. The best routine we can give our pet includes the right balance of companionship and social interaction (for dogs) or social availability (for cats),<a href=\"https://blackhawkpetcare.com/au/our-products\" rel=\"nofollow\"> a healthy diet</a>, ongoing health checks, a stress-free environment and the freedom to express normal behaviour. That might mean putting a bit more space between you and your pet, even if it\u2019s not always what you want.</p> <p>So how can you head back to work without turning your pet\u2019s world upside-down? Here are Danks\u2019s top tips:</p> <p>\u00b7 No sudden changes: make a slow transition between any two states, if you can.</p> <p>\u00b7 Be consistent: if you\u2019ve spent isolation taking your dog to the park or having the cat on your lap for an hour every day, keep doing it, if you can.</p> <p>\u00b7 Know and consider all of your pet\u2019s needs.</p> <p>\u00b7 <a href=\"http://dogcheck.com.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stay on top of their health and wellbeing</a>.</p> <p>\u00b7 Negotiate for a pet-friendly office!</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no quick fix,\u201d Danks says. \u201cJust as we\u2019ve helped them realise being with us is the new normal, we need to allow them to realise being alone is also OK. It\u2019s fine either way \u2013 they can be the dog or cat that they are regardless of our presence.\u201d</p> <p>Our pets are part of our family, but, just like children, they need to feel confident to make their own way in the world.</p> <p>Danks has simple words of advice for us all: \u201cAllow your dog to be a dog, or cat to be a cat. Enjoy them. That\u2019s why we have them in our lives.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Black Hawk\u2019s natural, holistic pet food range makes sure your dog gets everything they need, and nothing they don\u2019t.

  "<p>In the first episode of The Clinton Affair, a seven-part docuseries by acclaimed filmmakers Blair Foster and Alex Gibney, Bill and Hillary Clinton sit for a 60 Minutes interview that aired after the Super Bowl in January 1992.</p> <p>It was the eve of the New Hampshire primary, an election that could bring the charismatic Arkansas governor closer to his lifelong dream of becoming president of the United States. But allegations of an affair with country music singer Gennifer Flowers were about to derail months of good work on the campaign trail.</p> <p>When the interviewer refers to their marriage as an \u201carrangement\u201d, Bill clasps Hillary\u2019s hands and says, blue eyes tearing up: \u201cWait a minute, wait a minute - you\u2019re looking at two people who love each other.\u201d</p> <p>Then Hillary gives a response that would shape the public story of their coupledom.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,\u201d she says, pumping her fist emphatically.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sitting here because I love him, and I respect him, and I honour what he\u2019s been through and what we\u2019ve been through together.

It gives us a glimpse of the private story of the Clintons, the union of a pair of equals who met and fell in love in the library at Yale Law School, each emboldened by the other\u2019s ambitions, politics and intellect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"686dc92e139b3f1c29c99d47c7094a7b2d3b599d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/686dc92e139b3f1c29c99d47c7094a7b2d3b599d/0_0_3739_2542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill, Hillary and the shaping of a cultural lightning rod.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill, Hillary and the shaping of a cultural lightning rod.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SBS On Demand</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a narrative that\u2019s reinforced in Hillary, a much-anticipated new docuseries coming to SBS and SBS On Demand later this year, which traces the arc of Hillary\u2019s political trajectory from her feminist awakening in the late 1960s to her 2016 presidential campaign.</p> <p>But The Clinton Affair also shows us how the private story of the Clintons\u2019 marriage would go on to shape a public narrative about a lack of faith in government and institutions, and the inability of American political dynasties - with their links to corporate interests - to understand the plight of everyday people.</p> <p>These ideas swirl around in today\u2019s culture, fragmenting votes around a range of interests and causes and widening the ideological divide.<br><br>Hillary, however, depicts the ways in which Hillary\u2019s legacy has always been shaped by the ways in which she was forced, as a young female lawyer, to withhold her emotions to demonstrate her credibility. The docuseries also show how the scandals that rocked the Clinton administration led Hillary to further strengthen her defences to avoid public scrutiny.</p> <p>The gendered double standard that dictates female politicians must be \u201clikeable\u201d, and able to freely show their emotions, would undercut her political achievements even as she became a global feminist icon. It would contribute to her 2016 election loss to Donald Trump, despite winning the popular vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"547e087ea1645a06f1ce87bcecc39f739d213a7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/547e087ea1645a06f1ce87bcecc39f739d213a7d/0_169_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary\u2019s legacy has always been shaped by the ways in which she was forced, as a young female lawyer, to withhold her emotions to demonstrate her credibility.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary\u2019s legacy has always been shaped by the ways in which she was forced, as a young female lawyer, to withhold her emotions to demonstrate her credibility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SBS On Demand</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Clintons have played such a powerful role in modern history that it\u2019s easy to overlook their influence as a cultural barometer. But, as Amanda Hess puts it in a<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/arts/television/paula-jones-monica-lewinsky-bill-clinton.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> November 2018 New York Times article</a>, The Clinton Affair takes a largely neutral stance, recounting the events of the 1990s in chronological order. In doing so, it shows us, for the first time, how the Clintons themselves were caught up in cultural change.</p> <p>The Clinton Affair introduces Hillary as a new kind of first lady. She isn\u2019t an ornament to be looked at. She\u2019s a formidable lawyer who sits near her husband, her closest collaborator, in the West Wing. When Bill is inaugurated, she\u2019s chosen to chair the Task Force on National Health Care Reform, an attempt at more inclusive healthcare policy that still haunts pandemic-era America.</p> <p>But revelations that Bill was involved in a two-year sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a bright 22-year-old White House intern, and the string of events that would lead to his 1998 impeachment, shattered national perceptions of the Clintons as a couple whose relationship was rooted in shared ideals.</p> <p>At the time, the tabloids framed this as \u201cthe Lewinsky scandal\u201d. Invoking age-old gendered tropes, they cast Bill as the philandering husband, Hillary as the long-suffering wife and Lewinsky as young seductress. But Lewinsky gives in-depth accounts of her version of events and its painful implications for her life and family, and by putting her front and centre, The Clinton Affair exposes the invisible misogyny at work during that cultural moment. The documentary makes clear how the scandal was exacerbated by a newly potent 24-7 news cycle interested in bankable stories and easy targets.</p> <p>Most importantly, The Clinton Affair asks us to reconsider Lewinsky\u2019s testimony, and the part she played in history, from the position of a post-#MeToo era, one in which powerful men like Harvey Weinstein are held accountable for exploiting young women.</p> <p>Just as The Clinton Affair reclaims Lewinsky\u2019s perspective, Hillary wrests back Hillary\u2019s story by illuminating the ways in which her own chances at the presidency were compromised by the failures of the men around her. Hillary reveals how leaked sexts sent by Anthony Weiner, the husband of her top aide, Huma Abedin, sparked James Comey\u2019s new investigation into her use of a private email server, fuelling rumours about her trustworthiness that had lingered since her husband was in office. In doing so, Hillary sheds new light on the age-old feminist struggle that demands women must be perfect to be taken seriously.<br><br>Almost three decades on, the Clintons\u2019 60 Minutes interview is a powerful testament of the their legacy. It raises questions that still loom large in our culture, about the role of good wives and good husbands, about whether feminism can truly elevate all women, about whether lapses in moral judgment compromise the ability to lead. But it also shows us that it\u2019s impossible to reduce people to ciphers and that even events that have become symbolic are a consequence of specific moments in time. Since we were first introduced to the Clintons, the world has changed in ways we could never imagine.</p> <p>When Hillary was asked, on an<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/hillary-clinton-gutsiest-thing-shes-ever-done-was-to-stay-in-her-marriage\"> October 2019 ABC interview</a>, to name the gutsiest thing she\u2019d ever done, she replied, \u201cmake the decision to stay in my marriage\u201d.

The prime minister said he was drawing up plans to reduce the Chinese company\u2019s involvement to zero by 2023.</p> <p>Over the weekend, a series of well-known Conservative MPs added their voices to the debate by either writing or tweeting newspaper articles about the UK distancing itself from China. The MPs included former leader Iain Duncan Smith, former defence secretary Liam Fox and Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee.</p> <p>Writing in the Sun on Sunday, Fox said: \u201cChina is at a crossroads and needs to decide whether it truly wants to become a partner in the global community or take the path to becoming a pariah state.\u201d</p> <p>Tugendhat argued in the Financial Times that \u201ctime is running out\u201d to accelerate new legislation designed to make it harder for state-owned companies from countries such as China to take over struggling UK firms.</p> <p>\u201cBritain needs to bring its laws on foreign ownership in line with partners,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States provides one model that gives the government discretion and dissuades many inappropriate buyers before a veto is required.\u201d</p> <p>The issue of Huawei\u2019s involvement in the UK\u2019s 5G network has long been controversial in the US as well as Britain.</p> <p>Excluding Huawei from the UK\u2019s 5G network would amount to a hasty reversal of a policy announced by ministers in January to limit Huawei to 35% of 5G network supply, and risks irritating China and adding hundreds of millions in costs for BT and other phone companies.</p> <p>The debate in the UK came as Wang told a press conference on the sidelines of National People\u2019s Congress meetings in Beijing: \u201cRegretfully, in addition to the raging coronavirus, a political virus is also spreading in the United States. This political virus is using every opportunity to attack and smear China.\u201d</p> <p>The debate over trade has intensified as the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic becomes clearer.</p> <p>According to a paper published by the World Economic Forum on Sunday, the value of Chinese exports fell by 17.2% year on year in the first two months of 2020, while imports slowed by 4%.</p> <p>The research added: \u201cMajor industries have suffered at the hands of Covid-19, with nuclear reactors, electrical machinery and equipment, plastics and organic chemicals among the worst affected \u2026 Globalisation will work best through the adoption of a strong international cooperation network.\u201d</p> <p>The battles over world trade were further complicated by China\u2019s proposed national security legislation for Hong Kong, which could prompt US sanctions and threaten the city\u2019s status as a financial hub, the White House national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like, with this national security law, they\u2019re going to basically take over Hong Kong, and if they do \u2026 Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo will likely be unable to certify that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy, and if that happens, there will be sanctions that will be imposed on Hong Kong and China,\u201d O\u2019Brien said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.</p>",

has condemned a lack of transparency from both the UK and Scottish governments as the further impact of coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh came to light. <br></p> \n  <p>More than 70 employees from around the world attended the event at the Hilton Carlton Hotel on 26-27 February, PA Media reports.</p> \n  <p>My colleagues <strong>Andrew Sparrow</strong> and <strong>Mattha Busby </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/20/uk-coronavirus-live-school-rebellion-english-primaries-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates\">reported on Wednesday</a> that <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> had denied the Scottish government tried to cover up coronavirus cases linked to a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. <br></p> \n  <p>In angry exchanges at first minister questions, Sturgeon accused the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, <strong>Jackson Carlaw</strong>, of unfairly impugning her integrity and that of health officials by suggesting this early outbreak was hushed up. <br></p> \n  <p>Investigations found that at least 25 people linked to the event contracted Covid-19, including eight in Scotland, but the incident was not made public until it was revealed in a television documentary earlier this month. <br></p> \n  <p>The first coronavirus case in Scotland was announced on 1 March and was a Tayside resident unrelated to the conference. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>But the Sunday Times says it has been reported locally that the north-east of England\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d attended the conference in February and the infection was passed to a second person in Newcastle at a child\u2019s birthday party. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>The Chronicle newspaper also states that a church in Newcastle closed after a member tested positive for coronavirus, with it being \u201cunderstood the patient works for Nike in Sunderland and contracted the virus after attending a conference in Edinburgh\u201d - although this was unconfirmed at the time. <br></p> \n  <p>In a further report on Sunday, the Scottish Sun said one staff member at the Sunderland base contracted the virus after the Edinburgh conference. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>Murray, Labour\u2019s only MP in Scotland, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> The Scottish government has fresh questions to answer about its cover-up of the ground-zero coronavirus outbreak. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n   <p>Not only were people in Edinburgh kept in the dark, the decision to keep the information secret means people in north-east England were also unaware of how the virus could easily spread to their region. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n   <p>There are questions too for the UK government, which should have acted when the Scottish government failed to be transparent. </p> \n   <p>The lack of transparency from both governments is harming public confidence at a vital time for the country as we move towards the easing of lockdown measures. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-24T12:00:29.907Z\">at 1.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

The unevenness of the virus\u2019s impact has underlined the unevenness of the global economy.

The traits it has exploited may, in human terms, be admirable or abhorrent. But they are revealing.</p> <p>Some Australian governments, and many of its people, are acting as if we have this pathogen licked. The belief that the virus is finished with us may yet become an attack surface of its own.</p> <p>There\u2019s still a lot to learn about this variant of the coronavirus but the best science available has laid out some clear markers.

Many Chinese cities are densely inhabited. It may also be that a cover-up at a local or national level inhibited the initial response. Such things have happened before.</p> <p>If the authoritarianism of the Chinese government played a part in concealing the virus\u2019s initial spread, and even the fact of person-to-person transmission, it also has foreclosed on any possibility of a US-style mass protest against confinement.</p> <p>Even though there are indications that in some states, at least, the US is obfuscating figures, it\u2019s not yet able to reproduce a coercive Huubei-style lockdown.</p> <p>Importantly, though, China and neighbours like South Korea and Vietnam have had recent experience with similar viral outbreaks. After Sars and Mers, from masks, to fever clinics, to social isolation, people in this region know the drill. They understand that epidemics can happen, and that they frequently demand personal sacrifices.</p> <p>When it reached the United States, coronavirus revealed the country\u2019s pronounced racial and economic inequalities.

Its cities are separated from the smaller centres and each other by long stretches of empty space.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s epidemic may also have looked different if we did not have to ourselves an island at the bottom of the world, on the way to nowhere except New Zealand, which has been similarly fortunate in having no land borders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A persistent Australian trait is to be absent-minded about its location in the world, or to imagine it is owed something by other nations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government may finally have started listening to advice towards the end of Q1, but it cannot take credit for geography.</p> <p>Perhaps this is not all blind luck.

I can understand why. The scale of the disaster in my country of residence compels attention; the Trump administration has screwed the pooch. The course of events has offered Australia its sweetest guilty pleasure: the assertion that as bad, as unequal, as racist as our society may be, at least we are not America.</p> <p>But in our media, Australia\u2019s closest neighbours, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, have been almost forgotten. They seem on the surface to be managing well, but there are questions about the extent of testing in both. Any threat to their stability is a threat to Australia\u2019s. As our neighbours, they deserve our assistance. All of this has mostly been ignored.</p> <p>In matters foreign and domestic, the biggest danger now is complacency.</p> <p>Many of those urging us to open up all at once appear to believe that they are dealing with a known quantity with which they can conclude a deal.</p> <p>But as the Chinese president Xi Jinping, memorably asserted: \u201cThis epidemic is a demon, and we cannot allow this demon to hide.\u201d Covid-19 is as protean as it is malevolent; each day seems to bring news of it taking on a new shape.</p> <p>In Britain, children have been affected by a strange rash which may be related to the pandemic. In the US, children have come down with a Kawasaki-like syndrome which may also be associated with Covid-19. The virus has been found lingering on cardboard and other hard surfaces for days. It has been detected in the semen of men who have appeared to recover from it. The death toll is likely to be in the millions; there is emerging evidence that many whose lives are spared suffer lasting pulmonary and neurological damage.</p> <p>We simply do not know what it might do, what its final shape may be, or whether there will ever be a vaccine.</p> <p>If you take all of this seriously \u2013 and accept that the disease has precisely benefited from a liberalised regime of global trade that Australia has optimised its policy settings to exploit \u2013 the idea that we can ever go back to business as usual seems fanciful.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t take it seriously, these problems disappear. This is what many conservative commentators have opted for.</p> <p>But this virus does not make deals. It is changing the world. It will change Australia, too.

The poll\u2019s margin of error was about 4 percentage points.</p> <p>The national director of GetUp, Paul Oosting, said the poll showed people \u201coverwhelmingly want real, urgent action on climate change\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in Eden-Monaro won\u2019t let politicians forget how their community was devastated by the bushfire crisis,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Oosting said GetUp had more than 6,000 members who lived in Eden-Monaro and they would be \u201ctalking to their community about how we can recover better from the bushfires and create a safer climate future and sustainable jobs with investment in clean renewable energy\u201d.</p> <p>Robynne Burchell, a GetUp member from the southern NSW town of Delegate which was evacuated three times during the bushfire crisis, said the fires were still front of mind for most people as they saw it everyday when they drove somewhere.</p> <p>The federal government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/angus-taylor-says-it-is-not-australian-government-policy-to-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2050\">resisted calls to commit to net zero emissions by 2050</a>, even though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/24/net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-it-a-controversial-ambition-and-will-the-coalition-adopt-it\">every Australian state has signed up to the goal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/\">scientists say</a> the world must reach it around the middle of the century to achieve the Paris agreement aspiration of limiting global warming to 1.5C.</p> <p>The energy minister, Angus Taylor, told Sky News on Sunday gas and coal would \u201ccontinue to play a really important role in our system for many years\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/19/angus-taylors-tech-not-taxes-approach-is-likely-to-create-more-problems-than-it-solves\">Angus Taylor's 'tech, not taxes' approach is likely to create more problems than it solves | Ketan Joshi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/leaked-covid-19-commission-report-calls-for-australian-taxpayers-to-underwrite-gas-industry-expansion\">revealed last week that a group advising the government on the Covid-19 recovery</a> argued Australian taxpayers should underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry.</p> <p>On Sunday, McBain congratulated Kotvojs and said she hoped all candidates would \u201crun a clean campaign, free of dirty tricks, focused on the issues that actually matter to people in Eden-Monaro\u201d.</p> <p>Declaring her central focus would be on jobs, McBain seized on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/24/labor-calls-on-josh-frydenberg-to-front-covid-19-inquiry-to-explain-jobkeeper-60bn-black-hole\">the revelation the jobkeeper program would cost $60bn less than originally forecast</a> to call on the government to expand its eligibility, including to short-term casuals.</p> <p>It is unclear whether the Nationals will preselect their own candidate for the seat after John Barilaro, the NSW deputy premier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/nationals-trade-blows-over-john-barilaros-aborted-tilt-at-eden-monaro\">pulled out of the race a few weeks ago amid tensions</a> with the federal Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, and the Liberal state minister Andrew Constance, who also abandoned plans to run.</p>",
  "<p>Australia\u2019s new deputy chief medical officer for mental health, Dr Ruth Vine, has sounded a cautionary note over a high-profile study predicting massive increases in suicide following the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n<p>The research by top academics from the University of Sydney <a href=\"https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/05/13/modelling-shows-path-to-suicide-prevention-in-covid-recovery.html\">predicted a 25% increase in suicide</a> and has been seized upon by advocates in the call for greater mental health funding and real-time suicide data.</p> \n<p>Vine, who was appointed to the newly created role earlier this month as the government unveiled a suite of mental health measures, agrees it is important to \u201ckeep a very close eye on suicide data\u201d but warns of \u201cthe difficulty\u201d of modelling suicide, which she says is \u201calways multifactorial\u201d.</p> \n<p>Asked for her view on the research, which predicted suicides could spike by between 750 and 1,500 deaths per year, Vine says: \u201cI\u2019m not aware how they factored in mitigating issues like some of the improved service in reach or consideration of people, particularly high-risk groups, accessing services.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/22/patients-frantic-over-mysterious-global-shortage-of-hrt-medications-and-contraceptive-pills\">Patients frantic over mysterious global shortage of HRT medications and contraceptive pills</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cAnd the whole emphasis on some of the broader community things like schools and allowing family groups to get back together and allowing some greater movement.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of it, I think it\u2019s interesting, but I just think it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d</p> \n<p>High-profile mental health advocates Prof Patrick McGorry and Sydney University\u2019s Prof Ian Hickie, who led the suicide research released by the Brain and Mind Centre, were behind the push to create the new role filled by Vine, who is Victoria\u2019s former chief psychiatrist.</p> \n<p>Hickie, a former national mental health commissioner, told the Guardian he is \u201cvery surprised\u201d by Vine\u2019s comments.</p> \n<p>He notes the health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed he would consider the study as part of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Hickie says the \u201cassumptions built into the model (notably on employment, social disconnection, health services capability) are all in the public domain\u201d and says these services generally have \u201cnegligible additional effects\u201d while some \u201cmay actually make the situation worse\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe models are place-based, detailed and increasingly supported by similar modelling exercises in USA and reviews of past economic impacts on suicide rates.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018$40-odd-million isn\u2019t really going to do a lot\u2019</h2> \n<p>The government last week announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/australian-government-pledges-extra-48m-to-combat-mental-health-impacts-of-coronavirus\">$48m mental funding package that included extra money for services</a> including Kids Helpline and Lifeline, a new \u201cIt\u2019s okay not to be okay\u201d awareness campaign, and other measures.</p> \n<p>It also appointed Vine to the powerful Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and released the <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov.au/mental-health-and-wellbeing-pandemic-response-plan\">National Mental Health and Wellbeing Pandemic Response Plan</a>, which was led by the NSW and Victorian governments.</p> \n<p>Some, like Hickie and the Monash University researcher Alex Collie, were not blown away by the scale of investment.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt seems small compared to the scale of what we\u2019re seeing in the community,\u201d Collie says. \u201cInvestment of $40-odd-million isn\u2019t really going to do a lot.\u201d</p> \n<p>Experts have long warned about gaps in services for people whose mental health had significant impact on their day-to-day lives but who did not need hospital care.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/13/the-genie-is-out-of-the-bottle-telehealth-points-way-for-australia-post-pandemic\">'The genie is out of the bottle': telehealth points way for Australia post pandemic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Vine cites this as a concern, as well as the integration of services between the commonwealth and state systems.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe commonwealth has funded Headspace. Headspace is great,\u201d Vine says.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut Headspace looks after people with a spectrum of need that doesn\u2019t extend into when they are very acute or very high risk and at that point they need to go to the state system. It\u2019s not always a seamless transition.\u201d</p> \n<p>In an interview with the Guardian, Vine, a consultant psychiatrist with more than 25 years\u2019 experience, says the usual punter might face \u201cthree different routes of access to what might be providing similar or overlapping services\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is a risk in some duplication,\u201d she says. \u201cCertainly some people get sick of saying, when I go to a new provider I have to give the same story all over again.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Leanne Beagley, the chief executive of Mental Health Australia, told the Guardian duplication is a real concern but adds \u201cI think the problem of lack of services is more of a problem\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe point of having doctors \u2026 to lead the decision making around healthcare has not been brought up more powerfully than the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy\u2019s work around the pandemic,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s exciting in Ruth\u2019s appointment is having that kind of medical leadership around mental health to match what\u2019s been there for health.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Financial stress a risk factor for mental health</h2> \n<p>Collie is part of a team of academics tracking the impact of job losses during the pandemic.

We\u2019ve got millions of people in Australia who\u2019ve gone from having an income and having money, to having no income or very little almost overnight.</p> \n<p>\u201cHappily, we are finding people who are maintaining social connections, which is quite difficult, are less likely to be impacted by this psychological distress.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Collie notes that others, about 30%, are drinking more alcohol to cope with their new situation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hickie\u2019s research, meanwhile, suggests a link between the increase in the number of suicides and the unemployment rate.</p> \n<p>Collie and Beagley both hope Vine will go beyond the usual bounds of advice around service delivery in health care, and advocate on issues such as an adequate rate of the jobseeker payment.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe do know the things that predict the onset of poor mental health.

By contrast, in some sectors such as pharmaceuticals, notes Tim Belcher, managing associate at law firm EIP, innovation has slowed due to laboratories having closed.</p> <p>But with the option of patenting ruled out the instant an idea has been discussed with anyone, Belcher says, the impetus to protect a good idea, even under lockdown, is clear. \u201cThey need to come to us before they have spoken to possible manufacturers, before they have discussed it with their friend on a Zoom call.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6978f1ea8c89e61c5f89fdf8db217c67f6d29059\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6978f1ea8c89e61c5f89fdf8db217c67f6d29059/0_19_5348_3209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Atif Syed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atif Syed: \u2018Whenever situations like this happen, there will always be new applications [for the product]\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another innovator who has done that is Atif Syed, CEO and founder of a firm called <a href=\"https://www.wootzano.com/\">Wootzano</a>.

  "<p>The lockdown was a nationwide policy: everyone was expected to follow the same rules. It has nevertheless exposed some stark inequalities. Elites have been able to endure the period in comfort, often in remote, spacious holiday homes. Those with office jobs have found themselves stuck in their flats, juggling restless children and Zoom meetings. And at the lower end of the income scale, there are people still showing up for their essential jobs as cleaners, delivery drivers and nurses, with scant childcare support and constant worry about exposure to the virus.</p> <p>These are tense times, with millions of us making sacrifices, some large, some small. Whether\u2019s it\u2019s cobbling together a home-schooling programme while ill yourself, being deprived of the support of extended family or missing a loved one\u2019s funeral, the toll has been significant. It\u2019s no surprise then, that news the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser travelled from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-and-lockdown-a-timeline\">London to Durham</a> with his family while lockdown measures were in place has set off a wave of fury. While the British people have been remarkably forgiving of special privileges for senior members of the government \u2013 such as access to priority testing and tracing for themselves and their families, and early medical support upon diagnosis \u2013 extending this to an exemption from lockdown rules feels like a step too far.</p> <p>From a public health perspective, though, the situation with Cummings presents three problems. First, and most obviously, it undermines the core message to stay at home. This is vitally important because the purpose of lockdown is to buy time to drive down the number of cases to a level that would allow a package of interventions \u2013 including testing and tracing, and isolation \u2013 to take over the job of suppressing the outbreak. If lockdown is interpreted flexibly, or lifted too early, or seen as a symbolic gesture alone, it becomes pointless.</p> <p>Second, Cummings\u2019s actions give an unfortunate impression as far as exposing elderly people to the virus goes. According to Downing Street\u2019s statement on the affair, he remained with his wife and children in a house <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/dominic-cummings-no-10-accused-of-covering-up-lockdown-breach\">near, but separate to, his family</a>, including his mother and father. But to travel across the country to where his parents live inevitably erodes the strong message that precautions to protect older relatives are especially important, given that mortality increases with age.</p> <p>Third, Cummings travelled from London, an area that had a higher number of daily cases, and was ahead on the epidemic trajectory, to the north-east of England, which was less badly affected at the time, but which would soon become one of the hardest hits parts of the country. The lockdown measures were intended to prevent the spread of the virus from hotspots to less-exposed regions.</p> <p>Others advising on the pandemic response have had to resign for far less. This is not a left-right issue. Instead it is about right and wrong, and the government choosing to defend the actions of one of its leading figures over the public health message it has been pushing for the past eight weeks, and which is designed to save lives.</p> <p>Any undermining of that message could not come at a worse time: the UK is facing excess deaths of nearly 60,000, and has one of the highest death rates per capita in the world. There is no functioning test, trace and isolate system in place to take over the job of breaking chains of transmission and support the easing of lockdown. As other countries drive the virus to the margins and celebrate the reopening of shops, hairdressers, schools and businesses, the latest Office for National Statistics survey estimates <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19roundup/2020-03-26\">9,000 daily new cases</a> in the UK. People are suffering from an incoherent public health response, a late and consequently unnecessarily long lockdown, and leaders losing sight of those they\u2019re supposed to serve.</p> <p>While it might be psychologically appealing to believe the worst of the outbreak is behind us, early estimates from antibody tests, which provide a rough guide on what percentage of the population has been exposed, show most countries at under 10%, with cities slightly higher. The <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/21/17-londoners-5-rest-uk-have-coronavirus-antibodies-12739901/\">UK\u2019s estimate is 5%</a>, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/14/france-spain-say-large-scale-testing-coronavirus-shows-no-herd/\">Spain 5</a>% and Sweden 7%. This is nowhere near the level of exposure needed for population-wide natural \u201cherd\u201d immunity. Last week saw the largest number of daily new cases in the world, at 106,000, with outbreaks starting to take off in many low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>The summer months must be used to think ahead, since the winter poses additional challenges. How can a second lockdown be avoided? How can more deaths be prevented? The clear lessons from east Asia are a robust test, trace and isolate system, close monitoring of hotspots such as care homes and hospitals, the protection of health and social care workers, border control and working towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d involving face masks, temperature checks and distancing.</p> <p>Every single person in the world is now affected by this outbreak. How exactly they are affected has more to do with their government\u2019s handling of the virus than anything else. Successful responses have not been correlated with country wealth, but rather with decisive political will and a clear strategy. Just compare the situations in the United States and Brazil with South Korea, Kerala in India, Greece, Vietnam and Senegal. Everything \u2013 whether it is schools reopening, the shielding of the elderly and vulnerable individuals, the viability of businesses, and families being able to see each other \u2013 depends on the ability of a government to contain this virus aggressively and quickly. Those of us who live in the UK need this government to succeed, but that requires it to focus all its efforts on public health planning, clear communication and retaining public trust \u2013 something made harder when a senior adviser appears to flout the rules.</p> <p>\u2022 Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p>",

  "<p>Joe Rogan, the comedian, MMA commentator and podcaster, may seem an unlikely prospect for becoming the world\u2019s highest paid broadcaster. But after signing an exclusive deal with Spotify, that is what he may have become, marking a new era for podcasting in the process.</p> <p>To much of the world, Rogan\u2019s name is most associated with the periodic furores that erupt from the marathon interviews around which his podcast is structured.</p> <p>Elon Musk smoking weed during a 2018 interview brought a lot of heat, for instance, as did Bernie Sanders appearing on the show in the midst of his presidential campaign, less than six months after conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was brought on for his second sit-down in as many years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/mar/30/podcastings-netflix-moment-the-global-battle-for-domination\">Podcasting's Netflix moment: the global battle for domination</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Rogan\u2019s affably bro-ish demeanour, combined with his sponge-like interview style, has garnered him millions of fans over the thousand-plus episodes of his show, The Joe Rogan Experience. And that has made him a linchpin in Spotify\u2019s plans to transform the world of podcasting.</p> <p>Rogan announced the deal on 19 May, revealing his show would debut on Spotify in September, and become exclusive to the platform some point after that. Terms were not disclosed, but <a href=\"https://medium.com/@awilkinson/howard-stern-is-getting-ripped-off-1b721cc2f3f2\">one calculation from 2019</a> pegged Rogan\u2019s revenue from podcast adverts alone between $50m (\u00a341m) and $250m, with more coming from YouTube, where his shows get a million views in their first 24 hours. Add a premium for exclusivity on top and, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/05/19/wilkinson-howard-stern\">says podcaster John Gruber</a>, \u201cit seems likely that Joe Rogan is now the highest paid broadcaster in the world\u201d.</p> <p>The Joe Rogan Experience is the second significant acquisition by Spotify for its growing podcast business, after the company <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-ringer-deal-price-250-million-podcasting-bill-simmons-report-2020-2?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T\">bought US sports broadcaster The Ringer outright for nearly $200m</a> in February.</p> <p>Both deals, as well as smaller forays into exclusive content around topics such as gaming, true crime, and relationship advice, lie at the heart of the Swedish streaming service\u2019s attempts to transform podcasting from an industry built around a mishmash of open standards and traditional advertising into a platform economy \u2013 with Spotify at the centre.</p> <p>By requiring Rogan\u2019s listeners to use the Spotify app to tune in, the company gains far deeper data about who, when and where their audiences are; that, in turn, can be fed through to advertisers, who are more likely to pay higher rates if they can be assured that the target audience is listening. Control of the player also allows Spotify to vary the advertising to the audience, again increasing revenue.</p> <p>The benefits are familiar web economics, and many see the transformation Spotify has in mind as mirroring the changes to the wider web that unfurled over the 2010s. \u201cPodcasting feels like the web prior to the roll-up of power by Google and Facebook, with a lot of new voices, some very successful and most marginal, but quite authentic,\u201d <a href=\"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/on-the-spotify-joe-rogan-deal-and\">said Matt Stoller</a>, author of Goliath, a history of monopolies.</p> <p>\u201cOnce Spotify has gatekeeping power over distribution and a large ad targeting business, it will also be able to control who can monetise podcasts, because advertisers will increasingly just want to hit specific audience members, as opposed to advertise on specific shows.\u201d</p> <p>But Spotify has competition. Apple \u2013 long the corporate leader in podcasting through its control of the Apple Podcast Directory and still the largest global platform for connecting listeners with broadcasters \u2013 has started acquiring original podcasts for itself for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-21/apple-ramps-up-original-podcasts-in-part-to-help-promote-tv\">according to Bloomberg News</a>. The two companies, in direct competition over music streaming, could be going head-to-head in a second field.</p> <p>Until then, Spotify\u2019s bigger problem is convincing podcast listeners to switch from their favourite app to the service\u2019s own \u2013 which may not have access to all the shows available in the open ecosystem. The company is not the first to try, and others, such as Stitcher and Luminary, have struggled to justify themselves to listeners. But Spotify has one big advantage: its app, already used by more than 250 million people a month, could serve to introduce podcasts to a whole new group of listeners.</p>",

The easing of the country\u2019s movement-control order followed nearly two months of being cooped up, forbidden from anything other than infrequent trips to the local supermarket. Even outdoor exercise of any kind was strictly prohibited.</p> <p>Then on 4 May some restrictions were relaxed. That restaurants were one of the sectors given the green light, while schools, swimming pools and visits to family remained off limits, is testament to how central <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/16/penang-malaysia-guide-best-bars-restaurants-hotels-culture\">eating out is to Malaysian culture</a>.

When McKinsey produced a report on coronavirus\u2019s impact on the sports industry it grouped women\u2019s football alongside youth and futsal in the sport\u2019s food chain. Meanwhile, the incessant chatter about sport\u2019s return focuses largely on men\u2019s sport \u2013 with little concern about the lengthier lockdown of women\u2019s sport. With the FA\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League about to be cancelled, the athletics and tennis seasons in limbo, and the prospects for women\u2019s cricket uncertain, it is entirely possible that professional sport could be female-free zone stretching into the autumn \u2013 aside, perhaps, from an occasional sighting of a female jockey.</p> <p>Contrast that with Germany, where the Frauen Bundesliga will start up again next week. \u201cWe can\u2019t just rush to get men\u2019s sport back and not think about women\u2019s sport,\u201d says Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, one of Britain\u2019s greatest athletes. \u201cThere has to be a balance and diversity, otherwise some of the strides women have made could be lost. But, as with a lot of the things I have sat on over the years, the default is always men.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/23/hollow-promises-of-equality-are-to-blame-if-womens-super-league-is-cancelled\">Hollow promises of equality are to blame if Women's Super League is cancelled | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Out of sight, out of mind, out of pocket? The sports marketing agency Two Circles projects that global sports sponsorship rights fees will fall from \u00a337.3bn in 2019 to \u00a323.4bn this year because of the pandemic. Would Barclays, which last year became the first title sponsor of the WSL in a three-year deal worth \u00a315m, make the same investment today given it recently announced a 38% fall in profits? The fear is that women\u2019s sport, which has risen so fast, is also more fragile \u2013 especially with the worst economic recession since 1709 forecast and no gate receipts coming into the accounts.</p> <p>Some sports will be hit much harder than others. Olympic athletes are supported financially by UK Sport \u2013 but many of those in football, rugby and cricket face far more uncertainty. Zarah Al-Kudcy, Formula One\u2019s head of commercial partnerships development, says: \u201cThe irony here is that the sports that have tried to become commercially independent, and more reliant on media rights, are the ones that face more business challenges because they are not getting funding from the government.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just at the elite level where progress has been abruptly reversed. Sport England, which tracks the nation\u2019s weekly activity levels, reports that the gender gap has widened since the lockdown. \u201cIt had been coming down, thanks in part to campaigns such as This Girl Can,\u201d says Sport England\u2019s executive director, Ali Donnelly, \u201cBut we are seeing a retreat in the numbers of women being active in the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>For all the challenges, it is notable how much optimism there is. No one fears a steep retreat to the margins or a return to the bad old days. Indeed, many involved in women\u2019s sport expect it to quickly get a second wind; and to not only to survive but to further thrive. \u201cThe pandemic will definitely impact on the momentum that we were building,\u201d says Donnelly, who is also a prominent figure in women\u2019s rugby. \u201cBut at the same time, there\u2019s expectation from young girls in particular that they will see sportswomen on TV.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1d982f6dc488a086264f9fd0e86f1a96617abee1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d982f6dc488a086264f9fd0e86f1a96617abee1/1353_229_1691_1821/929.jpg\" alt=\"Beth Barrett-Wild, the head of the Women\u2019s Hundred at the ECB.\" width=\"929\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beth Barrett-Wild, the head of the Women\u2019s Hundred at the ECB.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Shaw/ECB</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It undoubtedly helps that a key priority for most governing bodies is to grow their numbers of participants \u2013 and the easiest way to do that is through supporting the women\u2019s game. \u201cStrategically it makes sense for them to keep investing in the growth area of a sport,\u201d says Donnelly. \u201cI also don\u2019t get the sense that a massive sponsorship hit is coming either, because many women\u2019s sports are only on the start of that ladder.\u201d</p> <p>Some sponsors could possibly cut back on their big-ticket items in men\u2019s sport in favour of women\u2019s sport, which is often seen as more authentic. A 2018 Nielsen survey, for instance, found that women\u2019s sport was regarded as more progressive and inspiring than men\u2019s sport \u2013 with 46% of respondents also wanting more shown on free-to-air TV.</p> <p>Another crucial factor is that there is far greater public expectation and pressure on sports to invest in their women\u2019s programmes nowadays. When Tom Harrison, the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/05/cricket-will-lose-380m-if-season-is-wiped-out-coronavirus\" title=\"\">appeared before parliament this month</a> he was criticised when he admitted that women\u2019s cricket could not be completely ringfenced if the lack of play this summer cost the ECB \u00a3380m.

Prior to lockdown, I had a couple of really good meetings with BBC and Sky, where we talked about what we are going to do to make the Hundred a real game\u2011changing moment.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, the next generation of women\u2019s leaders are quietly being developed. The Women\u2019s Sport Trust has used the downtime to set up an \u201cUnlocked\u201d programme for 41 top athletes, providing them with mentors to help them develop what they call \u201ca side hustle\u201d beyond their sport, whether it is in media, marketing or helping the young athletes to come through.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/22/naomi-osaka-serena-williams-forbes-richest-list\">Naomi Osaka tops Serena Williams as world's highest-earning female athlete</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of those involved, the professional boxer Stacey Copeland, stresses that the recent difficulties should be placed into wider context. \u201cWhen I started it wasn\u2019t even legal for women to compete,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd yet I\u2019ve been able to compete for my country and win a title as a professional. We\u2019re used to coming up with creative ways to get around barriers. I don\u2019t see why this pandemic should be any different.\u201d</p> <p>Another participant, Alice Dearing, who is hoping to become the first black woman to compete for Britain at swimming in the Olympics, is just as bullish. \u201cThis enforced break has been like driving hunger for us: it has only made us more determined to succeed. Yes, women\u2019s sport has taken a knock. But it will come back bigger and better than before.\u201d</p> <p>Al-Kudcy, who is a WST trustee and mentor, says one aim of the scheme is to have more diversity across the ecosystem. \u201cIf sports have that across every level of decision-making, they are going to make better decisions. And, what we have seen where there is a lack of diversity, there is often a lack of lateral thinking.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2a9cd07366ed2ddfcbe43e66503887326781a2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2a9cd07366ed2ddfcbe43e66503887326781a2e/0_0_4398_2904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The ECB believe The Hundred will provide a huge boost for women\u2019s cricket.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"660\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ECB believe The Hundred will provide a huge boost for women\u2019s cricket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images for ECB</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That view is reinforced by Grey\u2011Thompson. \u201cThe Davis review of business made it really clear that women on business boards are vital.

The pandemic could be a moment where there is a massive step forward for women\u2019s sport. But that will take greater commitment and not just words.\u201d</p> <p>For the time being those in women\u2019s sport will continue to do what they have always done, even in the darkest and flintiest days when they faced a lack of interest, visibility, sponsorship and money: roll up their sleeves and push on with one eye on a brighter future.</p> <p>\u201cThere are little girls who are relying on us to succeed, to make sure they\u2019ve got the role models and a pathway to be successful,\u201d says Copeland. \u201cWe are committed to that.

  "<p>As the nation locked down in March, the staff of Loud and Quiet magazine knew they were in trouble. No gigs or festivals for the foreseeable future dissolved the live music advertising that props up the free monthly publication. \u201cIt was like a tap being turned off,\u201d says Stuart Stubbs, who founded the indie-minded publication in 2005.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s music magazines have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The closure of bars, venues and shops took with it the primary distribution network for the UK\u2019s raft of free music publications. Many suspended printing and went online onlyincluding In Stereo \u2013 which publishes editorialised listings magazines in London, Bristol and Berlin \u2013 the monthly indie-focused DIY Mag, Loud and Quiet, and Crack. In the paid sector, Kerrang!, Mixmag and DJ Mag halted publication as newsstands closed.</p> <p>Last week, Bauer Media announced it was reviewing the future of key brands, among them the monthly Q Magazine, and considering the possibility of digital-only formats, merger, divestment or closure. (Nobody from Bauer, which also publishes heritage music magazine Mojo, was available for comment during the 30-day review period.) The announcement provoked an outpouring of support for the music title, including from authors Irvine Welsh and Caitlin Moran \u2013 in addition to questions about whether the long-beleaguered medium has met its end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"195110af58c964b7042af6f3b77bee5c806ab1bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/195110af58c964b7042af6f3b77bee5c806ab1bb/0_10_768_960/400.jpg\" alt=\"A recent cover of Loud and Quiet magazine.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A recent cover of Loud and Quiet magazine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two freesheets recently sounded the alarm over their future: <a href=\"https://www.loudandquiet.com/short/a-statement-about-the-future-of-loud-and-quiet-and-how-you-can-save-it/\">Loud and Quiet</a> and <a href=\"https://shop.crackmagazine.net/pages/crack-magazine-supporter\">Crack</a> launched emergency subscription packages, stressing they would close without reader support. Stubbs says he had felt embarrassed to ask readers to pay for a free product, even after they upgraded from newsprint to a glossy magazine in 2018. \u201cWe undervalued ourselves quite a lot, which I regret.\u201d</p> <p>The edgy, Bristol-based Crack moved quickly to produce a \u201cdynamic\u201d digital version of their summer issue for subscribers. They don\u2019t know whether the print magazine will return this year. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a flourishing events industry to support us with advertising,\u201d says publisher Luke Sutton. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a little way to go before we\u2019re out of the woods.\u201d</p> <p>Music magazines have \u201cbeen on the edge of sustainability\u201d for a long time, says Douglas McCabe, of the media research group Enders Analysis. Print advertising has dwindled. There are plentiful free online publications. Key titles have closed: in 2018, NME axed its 66-year print incarnation (the brand survives online). Every year brings headlines about shrinking sales figures.</p> <p>But many British music magazine editors and publishers say they were thriving in straitened times, at least before the pandemic. \u201cThe huge drop-off that most magazines experienced in the early 2010s has, relatively speaking, flattened out for many brands,\u201d says the editor of Metal Hammer, Merlin Alderslade. \u201cMost of our issues in 2019 were actually up year on year.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Geoghegan, the editor of global music magazine Songlines and managing director of Mark Allen Group music publications including Gramophone and Jazzwise, said the brand\u2019s titles were sustainable before March. Stuart Williams, the publisher at Future Publishing \u2013 home to publications including Classic Rock and Metal Hammer \u2013 said its 13 music titles were profitable in April 2020, \u201cwhen half the shops in the UK were closed and the population was barely allowed out\u201d.</p> <p>Different titles reach their sustainability threshold at different volumes, says Enders\u2019 McCabe. Niche publications, especially, can thrive at smaller publishing companies. \u201cIt is easier for a tiny company to run a magazine at a small profit than it is within the framework of a corporate enterprise.\u201d The previously independent Rock Sound was bought by the small publishing company Syon Media earlier this year. The only difference it\u2019s made, says brand director Andy Biddulph, \u201cis that there\u2019s no bailout \u2013 we live and die by what we create and can monetise\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35c47a8bf278a5ba79a7d268fc26d4380c1df6ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35c47a8bf278a5ba79a7d268fc26d4380c1df6ed/0_0_1000_1249/801.jpg\" alt=\"Christine and the Queens on the cover of Q magazine in 2018.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine and the Queens on the cover of Q magazine in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year, the heritage monthly Uncut and the NME brand and website were sold by Time Inc to Singapore\u2019s BandLab. The editor of Uncut, Michael Bonner, describes \u201cthe liberation of working in a smaller, more responsive organisation versus being a relatively small cog in a bigger, non-responsive wheel\u201d. He says the publication had taken a hit during the pandemic, although its strong international subscriber base and online single issue sales had increased and it was otherwise doing well.</p> <p>Part of surviving as a music magazine in 2020 means expanding your offering. Stephen Ackroyd co-founded the free indie-pop magazine Dork in 2016, aiming at younger readers. Prior to lockdown, the publication was having its \u201cbest year to date\u201d, he said, crediting its digital diversification and inventive online presence. Across the May bank holiday, Dork hosted a livestreamed festival comprising 250 original live sets recorded in musicians\u2019 homes to benefit the NHS Covid-19 appeal.</p> <p>Survival has necessitated a more reciprocal relationship with readers. Jon Bickley, publisher of the monthly heritage magazine Classic Pop, says this period has shown the brand \u201cwe need to work with our readers as part of our clan, not as our customers.\u201d, while Future\u2019s Williams emphasises the death of the old top-down, gatekeeper approach to music criticism. \u201cThe magazines that have survived are the ones who understand that readers pick up a magazine because they want to be turned on to great music: either stuff they knew and had forgotten, or they haven\u2019t heard yet.\u201d</p> <p>The stereotypically antagonistic relationship between many musicians and music journalists has also softened into an understanding of their co-dependent relationship. Tony Herrington, publisher of the Wire \u2013 whose remit is highly experimental, left-field music \u2013 said there was no question of pausing printing during the pandemic. He describes the magazine as part of \u201ca global music community, an international subcultural ecosystem and economy. We have a responsibility there, a sense of civic duty even.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4f5e351e66c1968c8dc72aa119622e1f00fb14d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4f5e351e66c1968c8dc72aa119622e1f00fb14d/0_461_6912_4147/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Metal Hammer cover stars Slipknot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Metal Hammer cover stars Slipknot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandria Crahan-Conway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While much of the content within music magazines might find an online analogue, editors, publicists and readers say print still has a unique offering. When Slipknot appeared on the cover of Metal Hammer last year, one member of the band ordered 100 copies for friends and family, says Williams. \u201cShowing them a copy of that is worth 100,000 blog articles or social mentions.\u201d</p> <p>Uncut\u2019s Bonner says the appeal of physical media reaches beyond the magazine\u2019s \u201cvenerable\u201d readership: \u201cThink about the success of vinyl with the younger generation when literally the same product could be streamed.\u201d Adam Harvey, 16, says he fell in love with Charli XCX as a 10-year-old after reading about her in Top of the Pops magazine. Sophie Williams, a 19-year-old Cardiff-based music journalist who has written for the Guardian and NME, says she has built a collection of 62 magazines featuring cover stories with her favourite band, Arctic Monkeys. \u201cI learned more about them as individuals and about their work from these stories, and as a result, felt even more attached to my favourite band.\u201dDespite the always-on nature of online music coverage, readers say they value the slower pace of print.</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think immediacy in journalism is as important as everyone thinks it is,\u201d says Caitlin Hooper, 19. \u201cNot everything has to be reported on the second it happens.\u201d Dork\u2019s Stephen Ackroyd says: \u201cAny good magazine is crafted down to the smallest detail in a way that\u2019s impractical online, where speed, SEO and responsiveness are more important.\u201d</p> <p>Music publications also offer increasingly rare coverage of art as separate from the celebrity culture that dominates online coverage \u2013 and the mainstream publications pay for it.

  "<p>Originally planned as a film installation and now reworked for a single screen, Wilkie Branson\u2019s TOM is an ambitious, technically accomplished and emotionally powerful piece of work.</p> <p>It\u2019s also an evocation of intense loneliness, which might be a bit too close to the bone for some at this time of isolation. Performer-director Branson plays a man lost to numbness, searching for his sense of self, and that mood gradually catches up with you. We see him staring out from a rugged hillside, then in a train carriage, where all the passengers are versions of himself, wearing different clothes but the same impenetrable mask of detachment.

When photographs of a newly opened and crowded Jacksonville Beach in northern Florida flooded social media, critics tweeted #FloridaMorons. In New York City, residents are angry at Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/health/nyc-beaches-open-for-holiday-weekend-no-swimming-allowed/6206187/\">previous</a> decision to keep city beaches closed during Memorial Day weekend.</p> <p>Beaches tend to evoke more reaction and anger than parks and other public spaces. It\u2019s in large part, experts say, because the US shoreline is increasingly private, and controlled by fewer, and richer, people.</p> <p>\u201cWe went from a time, prior to WWII, where much of American shorelines were treated as public land, to a frenzy of privatization where the shoreline was gobbled up,\u201d said Andrew Kahrl, a professor at the University of Virginia who wrote The Land Was Ours: African American Beaches from Jim Crow to the Sunbelt South.</p> <p>Earlier in the 19th century, US beaches were largely public and inhabited by working-class coastal communities, many of them African American watermen, Kahrl said. The coastline wasn\u2019t coveted property, since it was hard to maintain in the face of natural forces like hurricanes and high tide, and it was groups like <a href=\"https://gullahgeecheenation.com/\">the Gullah</a>, who were the keepers.</p> <p>By 1970, however, <a href=\"http://bostonreview.net/class-inequality-race/andrew-w-kahrl-free-beach\">over 95% </a>of US coastlines suitable for recreation were closed to the general public. To add to those restrictions, many municipalities imposed parking fees and tolled roads to limit entry.</p> <p>The result is that our public beaches have become smaller and more crowded, while a small group of affluent elite hold the keys to the rest of the coastline. \u201cThe public\u2019s ability to enjoy the shoreline has decreased in direct proportion to our increasing inequality,\u201d Kahrl said.</p> <p>During the pandemic, this dichotomy has become even more obvious. Public health officials promote exercise and fresh air during citywide lockdowns, and virologists have said it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html\">largely safe</a> to be outside as long as people observe physical distancing. But, as the Guardian reported earlier this week, 100 million Americans, especially people of color and poor communities, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/20/park-inequality-access-coronavirus-wellbeing\">don\u2019t have access</a> to a decent park or public space, which includes beaches.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The public\u2019s ability to enjoy the shoreline has decreased in direct proportion to our increasing inequality</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Kahrl</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Neighborhoods in New York suffer from this lack of access, said Meg Walker, an architect with the Project for Public Spaces, including many of the neighborhoods in the boroughs of Queens and the Bronx that were hit hardest by Covid-19. \u201cThere\u2019s many people in these densely populated neighborhoods who have high asthma rates and poor air quality,\u201d she said, risk factors for the virus.</p> <p>Walker also pointed out that public beaches, even more than parks, tend to bring together people of different backgrounds, especially around holidays. The diversity on a public beach lies in stark contrast to that of a privately owned beach, which tends to skew white and upper class.</p> <p>The increased policing on beaches burdens black communities, who are more likely to have tense interactions with law enforcement. Already this year, in Los Angeles and Miami, the NAACP raised an alarm when <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-05/arrest-of-woman-at-beach-with-dog-prompts-questions-by-councilwoman-naacp\">black beachgoers</a> were reportedly aggressively <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/videos-show-miami-beach-arrests-black-spring-breakers-slammed-racist-n1160921\">accosted</a> by police.</p> <p>During the pandemic beaches have been caught in the political divide between Republican states that have loosened restrictions early and Democrat-run states, who have been far more cautious. In this case, states like Florida and South Carolina, which have long coastlines and Republican governors, opened their beaches as people in the north-east, governed by Democrats, remained at home.</p> <p>Now, as many communities in the north-east start to open up, they have decided to keep their shores closed to outsiders. In Connecticut, home to what Kahrl calls the country\u2019s most \u201c<a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300215144/free-beaches\">exclusionary coastline</a>\u201d, beaches are requiring residential passes to park near the shore.

Throughout the pandemic, however, all of its beaches have remained closed to outsiders. <br><br>Joseph Saladino, the Oyster Bay supervisor, said the hamlet has erected barriers at the local train station, and entry points to the beach to make sure that only residents can enter. \u201cWe understand the beach offers a place for recreation but also an emotional renewal of sorts,\u201d Saladino said. But he said the restrictions were necessary to keep the capacity under 50%, and protect the residents who pay taxes in Oyster Bay.</p> <p>Public space advocates agree there is a real risk of beachgoers posing a threat to public health \u2013 young people in Miami during spring break in March, for example, ended up <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/florida-spring-break-coronavirus.html\">spreading Covid</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/florida-spring-break-coronavirus.html\">-19</a> to other parts of the country because the beaches were completely unregulated and had no distancing restrictions.</p> <p>Unlike parks, many beaches have also been at least partly closed throughout the lockdown, and when they open people might seize the opportunity in droves. \u201cI think there will be a flood of users,\u201d Walker said.</p> <p>But the solution, she said, is not restricting access to beaches. It\u2019s continuing to open more public spaces, like pedestrian roadways, and coming up with community-driven, creative ways to remind people to take precautions. In Detroit, for example, there was a project to open <a href=\"http://downtowndetroitparks.com/parks/Campus-Martius/things_to_do_in/The-Beach\">urban beaches</a> for residents. And Walker pointed out artists making public health signs instead of law enforcement.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Davis in Palm Beach was preparing for a surge of Memorial Day beach visitors because public beaches in nearby Miami and Broward counties remained closed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re wondering what it\u2019s going to look like this weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned we\u2019re still maintaining our primary objective \u2013 making sure people are physical distancing.\u201d</p>",

It is due to expire in February but it can be extended for another five years. The Trump administration has not taken a position on whether it wants an extension, however.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time to look at the full range of options related to that treaty,\u201d Billingslea said. At the same time he made clear he viewed New Start as being inadequate, criticising its verification requirements, its exclusion of non-strategic, shorter-range weapons \u2013 and, most importantly, the fact that it does not include China.</p> <p>The Trump administration\u2019s arms control policy has been stuck for nearly three years on its insistence that China be involved in any new treaty. Beijing has so far refused to be drawn into negotiations which it believes are the responsibility of the US and Russia, who together possess more than 90% of the world\u2019s stockpile of nearly 14,000 warheads. The<a href=\"https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WarheadInventories2020-1.jpg\"> Federation of American Scientists estimates</a> China has 320 warheads, which are stockpiled, not deployed.</p> <p>\u201cThe administration continues to stall,\u201d the Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen told the Guardian. \u201cThe best way to describe their position is that it\u2019s under review.

It\u2019s silly.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison attributed the failure to make progress on the absence of a chief negotiator, \u2013 which he blamed on deliberate bureaucratic inertia.</p> <p>\u201cThe president needs to understand that there are those around him who would be happy to see him run out of time to get a bigger agreement, and put him in a binary position of either to extend or not extend New Start,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/01/us-arms-control-office-understaffed-trump\">US arms control office critically understaffed under Trump, experts say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Disarmament advocates worry that even if Billingslea re-establishes regular contacts with Moscow, the US no longer has the diplomatic muscle to pursue substantive, complex arms negotiations because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/01/us-arms-control-office-understaffed-trump\">the steady loss </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/01/us-arms-control-office-understaffed-trump\">of experienced staff </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/01/us-arms-control-office-understaffed-trump\">responsible for such negotiations</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not obvious they have a kind of a serious team in place to try and make that happen,\u201d a western diplomat said.</p> <p>\u201cThree years after entering office, the Trump administration lacks a coherent set of goals, a strategy to achieve them, or the personnel or effective policy process to address the most complex set of nuclear risks in US history,\u201d a group of arms control experts wrote <a href=\"https://www.globalzero.org/blundering-toward-nuclear-chaos-2020/\">in a report </a>this month by the disarmament group, Global Zero. \u201cPut simply, the current US administration is blundering toward nuclear chaos with potentially disastrous consequences.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A faded decades-old black-and-white photograph was the only lead Johny Isla had when he set out on the trail of a sea monster.</p> <p>The Peruvian archaeologist spotted the image at a 2014 exhibition in Germany about the Nazca Lines, the vast and intricate desert images which attract tens of thousands of tourists every year.</p> <p>The photograph taken in the early 1970s showed a mysterious killer whale deity carved in an arid hillside. The figure bore some resemblance to others he knew but he had never seen this one before.</p> <p>Isla, now Peru\u2019s chief archaeologist for the lines, spent hours poring through archives, before returning to Peru \u2013 armed with a drone and a lifetime of local field experience \u2013 to find it.</p> <p>After several false starts, it took just two weeks to find the 25-by-65-metre image which had been hiding in plain sight in the hills of Palpa, about 30 miles north of Nazca, in a huge expanse of desert in southern Peru.</p> <p>The design carved into the hillside depicts a terrifying mythological beast, part orca but with a human arm holding a trophy head and several more heads inside its body.</p> <p>New research with drones has helped uncover hundreds of such figures carved in the desert near the lines in Nazca but which predate them by as much as 1,500 years. The archaeologists leading the effort now believe that the anthropomorphic orca figure fills in a missing link between hundreds of older geoglyphs and the Nazca culture\u2019s desert etchings.</p> <p>The smaller forms were etched on hillsides in nearby Palpa by the Paracas and Topar\u00e1 cultures between 500BC and AD200.</p> <p>\u201cThis orca was made at a time of abundance and population growth in a moment of change from one society to another,\u201d said Isla.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a2c9ec8389956803b67139f71d23f101749323fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2c9ec8389956803b67139f71d23f101749323fd/125_0_3750_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The figure known as \u2018La Orca de Piedras Gordas\u2019, or The Orca, which was rediscovered by Johny Isla in Palpa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The figure known as \u2018La Orca de Piedras Gordas\u2019, or The Orca, which was rediscovered by Johny Isla in Palpa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorge de la Quintana/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Isla believe that the Topar\u00e1 crafted the orca figure during a period of dynamic transition. \u201cThe Nazca Lines are the culmination of a process of experimentation and improvement in technique which follow on from these older geoglyphs,\u201d said Isla.</p> <p>Dating from AD200-700, the lines were given <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/700/\">Unesco</a> World Heritage status in 1994.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/02/nazca-peru-deforestation-research\">Ancient Peruvian Nazca turned land to desert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than a thousand of them \u2013 vast geometric patterns, and zoomorphic figures such as the monkey, the hummingbird and the whale \u2013 stretch across more than 400 sq km of the Nazca plateau.

They are demarcating territories.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, the larger and more sophisticated geoglyphs further south in Nazca can not be viewed completely from the ground. </p> <p>According to Isla, the latest research indicates the Nazca Lines were \u201cmade with the purpose of asking the Gods for water and fertility in this desert area\u201d.</p> <p>But archaeologists are still trying to understand the transition between the Paracas culture\u2019s depiction of largely human figures intended to be viewed by other people to the Nazca iconography in which humans are all but absent.</p> <p>As the society grew larger the images may have been appropriated by the elite and given a sacred status, Castillo believes. It was a transition from drawings made by households or villages to grand designs made by an organisation closer to a state, he argues.</p> <p>On one hillside, a warrior wearing a headdress and carrying a staff or spear stands close to a female figure. Between them is a mythological creature with a mass of tentacles or snakes. The figures are believed to symbolise fertility.</p> <p>From the ground, the designs are now hard to see. But the drone\u2019s eagle-eye reveals the full design on a monitor viewed by Castillo, who has long promoted aerial mapping techniques to register Peru\u2019s estimated 100,000 archaeological sites, of which only a fraction have been excavated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"acf80208b663a5d208fe59c64b52d1f3bb071c71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acf80208b663a5d208fe59c64b52d1f3bb071c71/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Pan-American highway cuts through the Nazca Lines which are some 450km south of Lima, the capital of Peru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pan-American highway cuts through the Nazca Lines which are some 450km south of Lima, the capital of Peru.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorge de la Quintana/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Drones are being used not just to find geoglyphs but to \u201ccover kilometres and kilometres and take thousands and thousands of pictures, which are then processed in very large computers\u201d, Castillo said. \u201cThe images are so detailed that we can see a stone half an inch across.\u201d</p> <p>The result of the process, known as photogrammetry, is highly detailed three-dimensional mapping of large areas, which in the case of the Nazca and Palpa Lines is a huge boost for their protection.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/10/peru-press-charges-greenpeace-nazca-lines-stunt\">Greenpeace apologises to people of Peru over Nazca lines stunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The funding to discover these new geoglyphs came, ironically, as a result of an international scandal, when Greenpeace activists left damaging footprints next to the famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/10/peru-press-charges-greenpeace-nazca-lines-stunt\">hummingbird</a>, during a publicity stunt aimed at the 2014 UN climate change summit in Lima.</p> <p>Outrage over the incident prompted the US to give Peru a grant which helped fund Isla and his team.</p> <p>Registering and geo-referencing the geoglyphs is the best way to protect them from the spread of agriculture or urban encroachment, Castillo says.

Legislation passed last year by Donald Trump requires the US to sanction officials as undermining Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. It also requires the US to revoke favourable trade status granted to Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt looks like, with this national security law, they\u2019re going to basically take over Hong Kong,\u201d O\u2019Brien told NBC. \u201cAnd if they do\u2026 [secretary of state Mike] Pompeo will likely be unable to certify that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy and if that happens there will be sanctions that will be imposed on Hong Kong and China,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Brien said the city\u2019s attractiveness as a business and finance hub would also suffer. </p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how Hong Kong could remain the Asian financial centre that it\u2019s become if China takes over,\u201d he said, adding that global corporations would have no reason to stay.</p> \n<p>Last week, Hong Kong\u2019s main stock index dropped 5.6% as details of the looming law were released while countries around the world condemned the decision.

In a statement released late Sunday as police continued to detain demonstrators protesting against the measure, the government said: \u201cThe vast majority of law-abiding Hong Kong residents, including overseas investors, have nothing to fear.\u201d</p> \n<p>In response to questions about investor confidence in the Asian financial hub, Chinese foreign minister Wang said: \u201cInstead of becoming more worried, people should have more confidence in the future of Hong Kong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wang said the laws \u201cwill improve Hong Kong\u2019s legal system, bring more stability, stronger rule of a law and a better business environment\u201d.</p> \n<p>Beijing\u2019s decision has further worsened US-China ties, already at record lows as Washington claims China is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>Describing the national security laws as a \u201cdeath knell\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and political freedoms, the US has threatened to revoke the territory\u2019s special economic and trade status.

There are those in the US pushing the two sides to the brink of a new cold war.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is time for the US to give up its wishful thinking of changing China or stopping 1.4 billion people\u2019s historical march toward modernisation.\u201d Wang said China would \u201cemerge stronger, more confident ... in our nation\u2019s unstoppable march to rejuvenation.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Many experts are warning that this pandemic will leave a legacy of mental health issues. But these warnings sometimes seem vague. If you want to know exactly what this might mean, your own family history could be the place to start. </p> <p>Mine is probably typical in showing how the psychological legacy of an epidemic can last for many generations. But my history also suggests that living with quarantine and lockdown has been much more a part of social experience than we perhaps realise.</p> <p>Like many under lockdown, I\u2019ve been doing a bit of idle digging and delving into family ancestry. Mainly, I was looking to clear up one or two little mysteries. As a child, I had been the repository of my grandmother\u2019s memories and had always wanted to see if I could put names and dates to her stories. There was, for example, the question of her youngest brother, Sidney, news of whose death in 1915 in the First World War was as vivid for her in her 90s as when she first heard it as a young woman. But had he really volunteered at 15 and his body never been found?</p> <p>Another question was about my grandmother\u2019s daughter, Constance, my father\u2019s baby sister. My grandmother had told me sadly how she\u2019d died of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/31/lessons-from-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-podcast\">Spanish flu</a>, but I didn\u2019t know at what age. All I knew was what my father told me. He\u2019d been playing with his toys outside her room when the doctor had emerged to tell them she\u2019d died. He said he\u2019d felt terrible guilt that he\u2019d been lost in his game and hadn\u2019t thought of her. I\u2019d always wondered whether this had been a factor in his own melancholy, his persistent guilt about things he hadn\u2019t done and his generalised anxiety. The ancestry research confirmed she died aged three, when my father was eight, a loss that would have been traumatic for a young boy. And it was certainly a loss that shaped the family dynamic. The next year, my grandmother gave birth to another daughter, my aunt, over whom she hovered, fussed and imbued with timidity until her dying day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>My father\u2019s experience of his sister\u2019s death left him chronically anxious, fearful of where the next disaster would strike</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Had this background anxiety of pandemic been a factor when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/polio\">polio</a> epidemic struck in the 1950s? Was it the reason my father injected so much terror into the disease even though the epidemic was largely under control by the time I came along? I can remember as a small child, walking with my parents in areas that, to this day, I still think of involuntarily as \u201cthis is where you catch polio\u201d. Maybe we were passing these places when I was questioning my parents about the children with callipers at my primary school. Maybe he gave me details of what the disease did (infecting the spine and muscle wasting). I remember he said it was in the soil, but that was probably his euphemism for faeces. What he did give me was a pretty deep-rooted fear of contagion and a lifelong commitment to frequent hand-washing.</p> <p>Contagious diseases were pretty much the stuff of my childhood. Most of the big illnesses \u2013 German measles (now considered mild), measles and mumps \u2013 all required quarantine. Children were often away from school for long periods, kept at home for over a fortnight, so there was no risk of spreading to other children. Written at an earlier period, in the 1930s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/arthur-ransome\">Arthur Ransome</a>\u2019s <em>Winter Holiday</em> immortalised the issue of quarantine. The children are quarantined and unable to return to boarding school when their friend Nancy, \u201ccaptain of the Amazons\u201d, develops mumps and is confined to her bedroom. For the most part, anxiety was pretty palpable. I remember my mother considering it lucky that I\u2019d got away with a few spots for chicken pox while my siblings had been covered. \u201cNone of the marks and all of the immunity,\u201d she said triumphantly.</p> <p>Some might be inclined to interpret my experience as indicating how these epidemics are part of the natural cycle that we\u2019ve always lived with. Those people assume most children find ways to deal robustly with the pervasive anxiety. And it\u2019s true that many children, given reassurance, can emerge without psychological damage. Patrick Cockburn\u2019s remarkable <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n09/patrick-cockburn/diary\">account</a> (in the <em>London Review of Books</em>) of catching polio during the epidemic in Cork is a powerful evocation of the fears and uncertainties of that epidemic but also an account of a child overcoming anxiety. But my memories suggest that epidemics that leave vague but powerful anxieties can cast a long shadow. My father\u2019s experience of his sister\u2019s death left him chronically anxious, fearful of where the next disaster would strike, and this was particularly acute around his children. I wish I could say I shrugged it off. But the truth is I picked up a lot of his anxiety, as any child does with an anxious parent. This is why <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52295894\">mental health charities and psychiatrists</a> are saying there is an urgent need to monitor the \u201cprofound\u201d effect on people\u2019s mental health \u2013 now and in the future.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/italy-lockdown-mental-health-psychologists-coronavirus\">Italy's lockdown has taken heavy toll on mental health, say psychologists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s something particularly difficult about losing someone in an epidemic. It\u2019s often sudden and frightening, and it\u2019s depersonalising. Your individual tragedy is just one of many and there\u2019s little comfort in being a statistic. In this current epidemic, with the restrictions around grieving and funerals, it means that you are also deprived of personal agency, unable to sort out rituals for your own comfort or to shape the narrative around saying goodbye.</p> <p>Recently, a friend\u2019s father died of coronavirus. She was unable to be with him and has been suffering from depression since. How many people are there like this, haunted by the lonely deaths of relatives and friends in care homes and hospitals? Or families of care workers and doctors distressed by what they\u2019ve seen? How many children are imagining the disease and what it did to their loved ones? It\u2019s hard to imagine that, without help, they won\u2019t carry this anxiety forward.</p> <p>If I still feel the legacy of the Spanish flu epidemic in how it shaped my family dynamic, it seems likely that unless the mental health issues are given proper prominence now, as we attempt to recover, this epidemic too will be carried far into the future.</p> <p>\u2022 Ros Coward is an author and journalist whose books include <em>Female Desire</em> and <em>Speaking Personally: the Rise of Confessional Journalism</em></p>",

They became a global internet sensation.</p> <p><strong>How did the concerts happen? What was the trigger?<br></strong>It was totally spontaneous. I\u2019d played a concert in Hamburg on 10 March, my birthday. It was clear it would be the last such event for a time. The next night\u2019s, in Cologne, was cancelled. We all thought, and the politicians assured us, this\u2019ll take a couple of weeks then all will be OK. As the days passed I had a gut feeling things were very bad. Back in Berlin, I was a wreck. Walking home with my groceries, I thought: \u201cHey, wait a second\u2026\u201d Sharing what I do with an audience justifies my entire existence as a musician. Without it, literally, I fall sick. There and then, I stopped, put down my grocery bags in the street, and tweeted that I\u2019d be performing a \u201chouse concert\u201d at 7pm that night.</p> <p><strong>What happened next?<br></strong>I panicked. Typical Igor \u2013 act first, think later. There was already an explosion on social media \u2013 people saying they\u2019d tune in. I hadn\u2019t the slightest clue how to go about it. I had no microphone, no proper equipment, no idea whether you could even livestream a long piece of music on Twitter. I messaged friends, saying: \u201cHow do I do this?\u201d I rushed out and grabbed a cheap \u20ac25 camera stand. I got home, then realised I needed a stand for the phone too, so I had to go back again. I made a friend come and literally sit behind the phone while I was playing, to make sure the live stream was working.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a very thin skin right now.

There\u2019s no war, no enemy. Of course it would be insane to have concerts for 2,000 people right now. That\u2019s my despair. On the other hand, I get angry when people think I was just being opportunistic. No. It\u2019s far more serious. It\u2019s life, not livelihood. A few people have asked me how I am.

Concert halls are closed, so that\u2019s a conversation for another time. The most touching, open-hearted comments I got were about one of the least well-known pieces \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIgTAKm33XY\">Palais de Mari by Morton Feldman</a>, which is very important to me. What I saw, night after night, is that if you win people\u2019s trust they will go with you.</p> <p><strong>You had death threats last year. [Levit received a threatening, antisemitic email before a concert in Germany.] Life must feel ever more circumscribed?<br></strong>For a time I had to be careful. I played a couple of concerts with security measures. I was unbelievably furious, but not surprised \u2013 these were basically racist, antisemitic attacks, call them what you like. But seriously, this was last November. We all know extremists, people full of hatred, are out there. I\u2019m able now to see the bigger picture. </p> <p><strong>How has lockdown been in Berlin</strong><strong>?<br></strong>I cook madly. I read. I exercise. I miss certain cafes and restaurants, but things are OK. We haven\u2019t had such a radical stay-at-home warning here, or strict lockdown rules, as in France or Italy. If you didn\u2019t know our world was on the edge of collapse you would think it was quite nice: quiet, fewer cars; you can always go out, go for a run. As you know, Germany is divided into federal states. In Berlin we have a fantastic senator of culture, Klaus Lederer. He can\u2019t open halls \u2013 no one is asking for that yet \u2013 but emotionally he loves music, he loves art.

The virus first appeared in Wuhan, population 11 million, and some of its worst outbreaks have been in New York, London, Milan and S\u00e3o Paulo. Crowds and public transport, goes the theory, are bad for your health. Remote working, boosted by lockdowns, will be here to stay. Balaji Srinivasan, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist summed this view up in a pithy tweet: \u201cSell city, buy country.\u201d</p> <p>So cities appear both more and less attractive. It\u2019s a contradiction. To which the best response might not be a rush away from everything urban, but a less violent redistribution from one kind of city to another. For several decades wealth and population have been tending to concentrate in a few privileged urban centres, to the disadvantage both of other towns and cities \u2013 and of themselves. This has been particularly true in Britain, with its gross imbalance between London and its satellites and much of the rest of the country. What if there were a shift in intensity away from the biggest cities towards the others, such that the enjoyment of life was increased all round?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b26a7dd81f9daf60a3299bfe48329a5d26af626d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b26a7dd81f9daf60a3299bfe48329a5d26af626d/0_0_4134_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four cyclists wearing protective masks ride along a new cycle path in Milan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A new cycle path has been built in Milan to encourage people to use alternative transport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Finizio/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much or most of the lockdown\u2019s changes are temporary. But what if this crisis were not allowed to go to waste? What if the glimpses of alternative realities became guides to the future? There have already been some rapid responses both in Britain and elsewhere, such as the closing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/15/large-areas-of-london-to-be-made-car-free-as-lockdown-eased\">several central London streets</a> to traffic by mayor Sadiq Khan, the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2020/05/15/parking-cull-and-pocket-parks-for-englands-finest-street-as-newcastle-plans-post-pandemic-future/\">pedestrianisation of Grey Street</a> in Newcastle and the permanent closure of <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/seattle-will-permanently-close-20-miles-of-residential-streets-to-most-vehicle-traffic/\">Seattle streets</a> that had been temporarily blocked.</p> <p>These initiatives are welcome attempts to make selected urban areas more sociable and pleasurable. There is also the chance to steer the decentralising effects of the pandemic towards towns and cities that already have most of what it takes to support successful communities, but could do with a bit more economic and social energy. This is surely preferable to a flight towards car-dependent detached houses, scattered around rural areas that would hardly welcome them.</p> <p>Some situations that were under strain before the virus have been revealed as all-but unsupportable. In the capital, there was scarce and expensive housing, air pollution, long commuting times on crowded public transport. Lockdown has made confined living conditions less tolerable while also removing the compensations of a metropolitan social life.</p> <p>Elsewhere there was a lack of investment and opportunity, alongside decaying buildings and public spaces. A three-bedroom Victorian terraced house in Fulham, to take property prices as a measure, goes for at least \u00a31m. An essentially identical house in Gateshead might sell for \u00a3100,000, in Portsmouth maybe \u00a3250,000. London is overcrowded, Doncaster is depopulated. Empty space is at a premium in the capital and in its south-eastern penumbra. In high streets across the country there is all too much of it.</p> <p>Meanwhile attempts to mitigate the London-centred housing crisis have foundered on familiar rocks. Residents of green belts don\u2019t want new homes near them. Almost any land inside London that is easy to develop has been built on by now. Property companies can\u2019t and won\u2019t build homes of the quantity and affordability that are needed. There are ways to confront these problems \u2013 good planning, state housebuilding, some determination \u2013 which shouldn\u2019t be abandoned, but contemporary Britain has so far proved sluggish to adopt them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be792a8829ae9d407fc98ce5c921ed4e16fe5a30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be792a8829ae9d407fc98ce5c921ed4e16fe5a30/0_999_5100_3062/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patients lie in beds in a tuberculosis ward in Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tuberculosis ward in Istanbul in the 1880s. The highly infectious disease made cities a killer and led to the creation of more green spaces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another approach is to make best use of the already-there. Ease the pressure on London and on some other mostly southern hotspots and reflate the many towns and cities that often have good housing stock, handsome if neglected high streets, a legacy of past investment in public amenities like parks and libraries, and access to beautiful countryside. Places roughly answering this description include Preston, Walsall, Sheffield, Plymouth, Colchester, Derby, Dundee, Hull, Wakefield and Wrexham, to name but a few. Such a shift would have the added environmental benefit of reducing the large costs in energy and carbon of a mass housebuilding programme.</p> <p>It\u2019s been widely pointed out, especially since the pandemic started, that modern attitudes to cities have been closely linked to health. A century or so ago, for planning theorists from Ebenezer Howard to Le Corbusier, diseases such as tuberculosis made density a killer, and so cities had to be depopulated, their teeming streets replaced with green open spaces. Patrick Abercrombie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/mar/22/london-county-plan-abercrombie-forshaw\">Greater London Plan of 1944</a> put these ideas into practice, directing that a large number of Londoners should be moved to healthy new towns.</p> <p>Once antibiotics had pushed back TB, the virtues of city life were reasserted. Jane Jacobs celebrated these virtues in <em><a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/17/reviews/jacobs.html?mcubz=0\">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a></em><em> </em>of 1961, after which it became the creed of right-thinking urbanists that the density and vibrancy of cities were to be encouraged. Theory was eventually put into practice with spectacular success, at least in economically powerful and good-looking cities including London and New York.</p> <p>Populations started growing after decades of decline, money poured in, shops and restaurants boomed, property prices soared, derelict buildings were done up. The 1980s phrase \u201cinner-city deprivation\u201d gave way to the estate agents\u2019 buzz-term \u201curban lifestyle\u201d. The term \u201cworld cities\u201d came into use in the 1990s, to describe urban economies that were competing with rivals of a global scale for business and attractiveness. Cities were good. Big was good. Big cities were best.</p> <p>In the process something was lost. Supercharged property prices turned cities\u2019 best features into commodities. If Jacobs talked of the \u201cballet of the street\u201d \u2013 the choreography of people of different backgrounds and trades going about their lives in shared spaces \u2013 it became hard to find in the sealed glass towers of the world cities\u2019 newest real estate. It is more likely to be found in, well, streets, of which there are countless numbers across the country, not just in the most privileged metropolitan centres.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"123be58246438a6f402a6fa706ed40463ce71d73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/123be58246438a6f402a6fa706ed40463ce71d73/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crowds in Camden Market during a busy weekend before the coronavirus outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crowds in London\u2019s Camden Market during a busy weekend before the coronavirus outbreak.

Rather it is to encourage an adjustment of priorities towards towns and cities in general. It is not about mass internal migration but about incremental change. Most people will stay where they are. Most people\u2019s lives will not be transformed by remote working. But for at least some people, some of the time, the advantages of online interactions will outweigh the disadvantages. It might mean that you only need to visit a big-city office once a week, for example, rather than every day.</p> <p>It should be possible to imagine that Person A decides that the possibility of having a house and a garden outweighs the attractions of the big city. The development of remote working makes this a little more possible. Perhaps there are enough people like her to form a social network in her area, perhaps she persuades some friends to join her. Their choices might be influenced by the rediscovery, during the lockdown, of activities that don\u2019t require a sophisticated urban pleasure dome within easy reach: cooking, talking to family or friends, going to shops that are not supermarkets, tending a garden, online socialising and entertainment. They might be less driven than before by the prestige and desirability of a metropolis.</p> <p>Perhaps they work for companies who see the benefits of helping their employees live like this, or who spread their operations around regional bases more than they would have done previously. Perhaps they make an empty shop into a shared workspace and meeting place. A cafe, you could call it. Perhaps this helps to bring some life back to a high street. They would not be moving into a void, but into an existing set of businesses and activities, with which they could be mutually supportive.</p> <p>Such a shift won\u2019t happen all by itself. Successful high streets, as the <a href=\"https://www.centreforcities.org/high-streets\">Centre for Cities </a><a href=\"https://www.centreforcities.org/high-streets\">thinktank</a> has shown, are symptoms of more general strengths in local economies. Brighton, York and Cambridge were doing just fine before the pandemic, and are the most likely places to bounce back; Newport, Bradford and Wigan less so. It will, as well as the resourcefulness of individuals and companies, require some positive contributions from government.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"570ef97a7d49fa942094291de66953bf3d506f78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/570ef97a7d49fa942094291de66953bf3d506f78/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children play in the water garden at Tainan Spring in Taiwan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The water garden at Tainan Spring in Taiwan was created from an old shopping mall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daria Scagliola</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Partly this would be a matter of supporting those things that support quality of life \u2013 parks, nurseries, street maintenance. Reversing austerity, you could call it. Partly it would be a case of investing in local transport systems and broadband. It would require creative use of the planning system \u2013 not just allowing individuals to convert shops into homes, which can create poor homes and inactive streets, but encouraging initiatives that work out new futures for whole streets at a time. Vacant shopping centres should be taken into public ownership so that, as happened with empty docklands in the 1980s, they can be made available to whoever might make the most of them. Versions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/09/the-worlds-top-10-new-architecture-projects-lockdown\">Tainan Spring in Taiwan</a>, where an old shopping mall was made into a water garden, could be realised in Britain.</p> <p>The vast financial and environmental costs of projects like HS2 and Heathrow\u2019s third runway, together with the long time they will take to deliver any kind of return, now look \u2013 in a future that will definitely be poorer than expected \u2013 preposterous. Their main effect would be to bring more people from less-favoured parts of the country to the more favoured. It would be far better to spend the tens of billions they require on local and regional projects. Rather than bring people to where the work is, the plan should be to bring work to people, wherever they are.</p> <p>This is hardly a new idea. Its most recent manifestation has been the Conservative party\u2019s policy of \u201clevelling up\u201d the British regions. Last year the government launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/14/english-towns-and-cities-get-share-of-95m-regeneration-fund\">future high streets fund </a>as a gesture in this direction, although its \u00a31bn budget is very much smaller than the sums previously extracted through austerity. The overheating of London has already been causing people to live further out \u2013 commuters using improved trains from Rugby, creatives relocating to Margate. These changes might be seen as the enlargement of London\u2019s orbit, but they at least tend towards greater decentralisation.</p> <p>Other future developments might help this transfer of energy from world cities to urban settlements in general. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/07/20/city-planners-eye-self-driving-vehicles-correct-mistakes-th-century-auto/\">Cars that are both driverless and electric</a> could, for example, by using road space in a more efficient and less polluting way, allow urban density without centralised public transport systems. A virus can\u2019t change city planning all by itself, but it can be used as a chance to push changes whose time has come.</p>",

  "<p>Over the last two months, Islamic State has carried out a series of large-scale and coordinated attacks in parts of Syria and Iraq. The spike in attacks has renewed fears about the group\u2019s resurgence, a year after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/23/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-isis-caliphate\">collapse </a>of its physical caliphate in eastern Syria and only six months after the killing of its former leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-obituary\">Abu </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-obituary\">Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>. The heightened activity is especially worrying because the conditions that have made it possible appear set to worsen in the coming months.</p> <p>Isis has never ceased attacks in the two countries since the loss of its territories, but the recent operations are particularly bad news. Aside from the attacks, for example, reports from the ground consistently suggest that the group has had greater visibility and mobility this year in villages and suburbs across Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>The way in which some of the attacks were conducted also indicates that the group has access to information about troop movements and individuals it seeks to target. Such trends are usually early signs that the group has established roots, carved out space for itself and built the infrastructure necessary to launch attacks.</p> <p>This recovery is recent, and follows at least a year of weakness in both countries, due to the loss of Isis centres in Mosul and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/raqqa-recaptured-from-islamic-state-us-backed-forces-announce\">Raqqa </a>and the intense military campaigns against it. This weakness reached its lowest point with the killing of Baghdadi in October. The group seemed unable to carry out revenge attacks for the killing of its self-proclaimed caliph, or to exploit significant openings such as the US announcement that it was withdrawing its troops from Syria, which was followed by Turkey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/us-withdrawal-from-syria-leaves-fate-of-isis-fighters-and-families-in-detention-uncertain\">invasion </a>of parts of the north.</p> <p>Warnings that such events would open the door for the group to re-emerge did not transpire. Several months later, though, the group rebuilt its capabilities and became more active \u2013 the most active since the collapse of its caliphate. This time lag between decreased pressure and the ability to rebound matters because it reveals precisely how Isis could be put back in its box.</p> <p>It took Isis some time to regenerate because the sustained military pressure against it had prevented it from quickly seizing clear openings such as the chaos that followed the American withdrawal \u2013 which was later reversed \u2013 and the Turkish invasion. The pressure had been building steadily against Isis since the recapture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/18/iraqi-kurdish-forces-recapture-mosul-dam-isis\">Mosul </a>in 2017 and Raqqa in 2018, and the US-led forces largely focused on clearing operations in abandoned villages, mountains and deserts to ensure a more enduring defeat of the organisation. It would have been hard to contain the organisation had it been \u201cready\u201d to attack when such opportunities presented themselves in October.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b1d51fe83cd9be0913c3a6e95a409916d0b53df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b1d51fe83cd9be0913c3a6e95a409916d0b53df/0_248_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Afghan security forces with arrested alleged Isis fighters on 10 April 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Afghan security forces with arrested alleged Isis fighters on 10 April 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noorullah Shirzada/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The steady pressure was disrupted by a chain of events in both countries, paving the way for Isis to return. The initial US withdrawal from Syria caused its allies on the ground, the Kurdish-dominated forces, to seek the help of Russia and the regime in Damascus to prevent Turkey from taking over. Even after the US reversed its decision to withdraw, part of the third of Syria previously controlled by the international coalition became shared with the Russians. The damage was already done, as the international mandate against Isis shrank in both territory and influence.</p> <p>In Iraq, too, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/iraq-protests-aim-topple-regime\">mass protests</a> in Iraq in October triggered several events and raised the political temperature in the country. The protests in central and southern Iraq forced the government to resign and led to political stagnation that lasted until two weeks ago, when political parties agreed on a new prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/iran-iraq-khadimi-control-middle-east-suleimani\">Mustafa al-Kadhimi</a>.</p> <p>The protests, which sometimes included an anti-Iran tone, also added to the tensions between the US and Shia forces in the country. Attacks and counter-attacks, by the US and Iranian proxies, ultimately led to the killing of the Iranian general <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/making-of-a-martyr-how-qassem-suleimani-was-hunted-down\">Qassem </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/05/making-of-a-martyr-how-qassem-suleimani-was-hunted-down\">Suleimani </a>and the prominent Shia militia leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/abu-mahdi-al-muhandis-iraq-iran-militias-suleimani\">Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis</a>.</p> <p>Despite what seemed like a perfect storm, Isis could not expand its influence until recently. The earliest notable attack happened on 9 April, between the group and Syrian regime forces near Palmyra in the Syrian desert. The attack appeared sophisticated, as the group ambushed regime forces and clashed with them for several hours. Later that month, Isis conducted several attacks in Kirkuk, Diyala and Salah ad-Din. Such attacks included the attempted storming of the counter-terrorism and intelligence directorate in Kirkuk, and several coordinated attacks in Salah ad-Din. The attacks were among the most sophisticated in years.</p> <p>Isis clearly benefited from the security vacuum and decreased pressure in both countries. As Isis establishes a foothold, it soon becomes hard to weaken it without deeper international engagement. Renewed tactical operations might force it underground but it will not dismantle its networks, because that process requires a patient counter-terrorism strategy that seemed to exist a year ago.</p> <p>The recovery of Isis is still new and fragile, and so could be easily reversed if the pressure is restored. However, the problem is that the current trends seem more favourable to Isis than to local forces. Tensions between the US and Iraqi forces also make it harder for the two partners to work in harmony as they did during the fight against Isis in places like Mosul. The US has already withdrawn from several tactical bases in western and central Iraq, in the very areas in which it recently carried out attacks.</p> <p>In other words, the chances for further Isis recovery are increasing as the odds decrease for a tougher crackdown led by the US. This pattern is what makes the current phase particularly dangerous. If the pattern continues in the coming months, Isis is likely to become a far greater threat that will be much harder to contain than it is now.</p> <p>\u2022 Hassan Hassan is the director of the non-state actors and geopolitics programme at the Center for Global Policy thinktank, and co-author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror</em></p>",

Jordan\u2019s own trajectory from baby-faced amateur to larger-than-life symbol to latter-day myth is exhaustively retold through a stylish blend of archival footage, present-day interviews and spare-no-expense soundtrack.</p> <p>Lengthy segments are, however, devoted to the other principals in Jordan\u2019s orbit: Scottie Pippen, the famed wingman and lone constant aside from Jordan on all six of Chicago\u2019s title teams; Dennis Rodman, the free-spirited, hard-partying rebounding machine; Phil Jackson, the hippie-mystic head coach whose triangle offense helped unlock the team\u2019s potential.</p> <p>But the star of the piece is Jordan, who after all these years remains both overexposed and mysterious: at once the most prominent cultural reference point the United States has ever produced and something of a recluse who has spoken only sparingly about the Bulls\u2019 imperious reign and still-mystifying break-up at the height of their powers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s maddening because I felt like we could have won seven, I really believe that,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cWe may not have, but man, just not to be able to try, that\u2019s something that I just can\u2019t accept.\u201d</p> <p>Before what proved to be the team\u2019s last season together \u2013 a sixth and final championship run \u2013 Jordan allowed the NBA\u2019s in-house entertainment division to film what became more than 500 hours of behind-the-scenes footage of them with the condition that it could only be used with his explicit consent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdf06ef77a38c203b444006a88c8802606b9d0fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdf06ef77a38c203b444006a88c8802606b9d0fd/0_0_5353_3569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Michael Jordan at the White House in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Barack Obama presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Michael Jordan at the White House in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It does bear mentioning that Jordan\u2019s own production company is among the co-producers behind the project and he retained final cut and editorial control.

We are left with the unshakeable sensation that we are seeing Jordan as he wants to be seen.</p> <p>But if history is written by the winners, then Jordan\u2019s participation in his own hagiography is fair play, especially if the alternative meant the unseen footage that comprises the narrative spine of <em>The Last Dance</em> would have remained locked away in the league\u2019s New Jersey vault.

He earned a relatively modest $90m (\u00a374m) in salary over the course of his 15-year NBA career \u2013 with about $63m coming in his final two seasons with the Bulls \u2013 yet became the world\u2019s first billionaire athlete by selectively aligning himself with brands like Nike, Gatorade, Hanes, McDonald\u2019s and Upper Deck. He was ever conscious of the idea that his image became diluted the more it was used. In a time when the titans of sports and entertainment routinely bypass traditional channels to control the narrative through their own production companies or friendly platforms, Jordan was years ahead of the game.</p> <p>The film does make gestures toward placing Jordan\u2019s legacy in a broader context, relying on no less than a former president and fellow Chicago icon for authority. \u201cThere are great players who don\u2019t have an impact beyond their sport,\u201d Obama says. \u201cAnd then there are certain sports figures who become a larger cultural force. Michael Jordan helped to create a different way in which people thought about the African-American athlete. A different way in which people saw athletics as part of the entertainment business. He became an extraordinary ambassador, not just for basketball, but for the United States overseas as part of the American culture sweeping the globe. Michael Jordan and the Bulls changed the culture.\u201d</p> <p>But <em>The Last Dance</em> deftly resists the temptation to overreach and remains centred on Jordan\u2019s first and only concern: the pursuit of perfection and wholesale domination of his rivals. At a time when the games that bring us together have been put on indefinite hold, it\u2019s no surprise people flocked to the next best thing \u2013 even if they know how the story ends.</p>",
  "<p>Responding to Donald Trump\u2019s pandemic antics last week, Hu Xijin, editor of China\u2019s state-controlled <em>Global Times</em>, accused the US president of trying to distract attention from his failure to prevent the deaths of nearly 100,000 Americans. \u201cIf it were in China, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/nancy-pelosi-fears-for-morbidly-obese-trump-after-hydroxychloroquine-admission\">White House would have been burned down</a> by angry people,\u201d he tweeted.<br></p> <p>Given Beijing\u2019s dislike for protests of any kind, that seems unlikely. Yet Hu raised a question relevant to all countries ravaged by Covid-19. Where is the fury, the public outrage? Faced by the inability of incompetent governments to protect them, why have the people not risen up, erected figurative scaffolds and guillotines, and set a torch to the established political order?</p> <p>In other words, when does the revolution begin? Furloughed workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your supply chains.</p> <p>Given the history of the past century or so, today\u2019s politicians, democratic or authoritarian, left or right, may count themselves fortunate not to be experiencing a fiercer backlash. This may be brewing, once people regain their nerve. Many countries have seen <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/20/21263919/anti-lockdown-protests-coronavirus-germany-brazil-uk-chile\">small-scale Covid-related protests</a>. Yet by and large, insurrection has not gone viral \u2013 yet.<br><br>That\u2019s despite a consensus among business leaders, scientists and pundits that the world will never be the same again. A watershed has been reached, they say. Mostly older people are suffering now, but millions among the younger generations may have their lives forcibly upended for years to come. Like it or not, a second <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Europe/The-age-of-revolution\">Age of Revolution</a> is dawning.<br><br>So the real question is not whether but what manner of revolution is coming. Will it be of the uncontrollable, ideological 20th-century variety associated with the likes of Marx, Mao, Guevara and Castro? Or will it take the form of a non-violent but nonetheless rapid and profound shift in the way a more consciously interdependent world works? An awful lot rests on how the pandemic\u2019s shockwaves and after-effects are directed and shaped.</p> <p>The main elements of political revolutions have not changed much since Aristotle identified them more than 2,300 years ago. Whatever the objective, <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D5\">he wrote in Book V of </a><em><a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D5\">The Politics</a></em>, inequality is the chief cause of revolution. Justice and equality are \u201cthe fundamental basis of any state\u201d, and inequality, being a kind of injustice, is potent grounds for challenging that state. \u201cThe lesser rebel in order to be equal, the equal in order to be greater. These then are conditions predisposing to revolution,\u201d Aristotle declared.</p> <p>Amid epidemic uncertainty, two things are clear. First, the virus is universal and ubiquitous \u2013 a threat to all humankind. Second, its impacts are deeply unequal, decisively determined by social class, race, ethnicity, income, nutrition, education, living conditions and geographical location as well as by gender and age.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you don\u2019t have a situation where people have opportunity \u2026 you\u2019re threatening the existence of the system</p> <footer> <cite>Ray Dalio, hedge fund billionaire</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It follows that the large, unjust societal inequalities found both within and between wealthy and developing countries and ruthlessly exposed by the virus are just as powerfully insurrectionary in nature today as when Aristotle first pondered them or when Marie-Antoinette <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/story/did-marie-antoinette-really-say-let-them-eat-cake\">told starving peasants</a> to eat cake.</p> <p>The danger that entrenched inequality poses to hopes of weathering the Covid storm without chaotic upheavals was recently debated by the tsars of modern American capitalism. \u201cThis is our chance to do the right thing,\u201d by reducing income disparities, said <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jamie-dimon-mark-cuban-ray-dalio-billionaires-inequality-coronavirus-2020-5?r=US&amp;IR=T#facebook-chief-operating-officer-and-billionaire-sheryl-sandberg-says-the-coronavirus-pandemic-underscores-the-need-for-paid-sick-leave-and-paid-bereavement-leave-4\">top investor Mark Cuban</a>.

JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, called the pandemic \u201ca wake-up call \u2026 for business and government to think, act and invest for the common good\u201d. This sounds almost socialistic.<br><br>A revolutionary agenda for the post-pandemic world also includes meaningful steps to address poverty and the north-south wealth gap, more urgent approaches to linked climate, energy, water and mass extinction crises and, for example, the adoption of so-called <a href=\"https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/\">doughnut </a><a href=\"https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/\">economics</a> that measures prosperity by counting shared social, health and environmental benefits, not GDP growth.<br><br>It may seem like pie in the sky.

In Europe, too, the EU <em>ancien regime</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/coronavirus-could-be-final-straw-for-eu-european-experts-warn\">must remake itself</a> or else risk overthrow by populist-nationalist <em>sans-culottes</em>.<br><br>Nor may authoritarian oligarchies such as China and Russia, weaned on violent rebellion, continue on their self-aggrandising, quasi-imperialist path if repeat conflagrations are to be avoided. To forge the necessary consensus for this born-again world, it\u2019s time to reboot the United Nations, revive the idealism of the 1945 San Francisco founding conference, and rekindle that transformative vision of humankind working in concert to defeat common evils.</p> <p>As Aristotle might have said, the revolution starts here.</p>",

  "<p>Lockdown has made me nostalgic \u2013 not about travelling so much as about places. It\u2019s no surprise the focus of some of my fondest remembering has been the world capital of looking back: Buenos Aires. The reasons behind this are many and complex. Porte\u00f1os \u2013 BA residents \u2013 are famously given to looking far away, to the Spain or Italy of their ancestors, and to romanticising the brief belle \u00e9poque of the early 20th century, when Argentina was rich and promising.

This has inevitably made my nostalgia layered, but more than anything I miss walking, roaming the Argentinian capital. Now, incarcerated in my English semi-rural home, I yearn for people and movement and being lost in the crowd.</p> <p>I have tried to walk every street of Buenos Aires. It\u2019s a foolish quest. There are 2,154 of them, according to one local author, and combined they must measure thousands of miles. But the kindest way for a foreigner to own a city is arguably to walk it. Conquest as reconnaissance. When I first bought a Lumi guidebook \u2013 a street map of the capital \u2013 I was struck by the regularity of the grid of streets, as well as its immensity. So, unlike England, with its medieval town plans, curves and cul-de-sacs, BA beckoned like a maze.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"267822043cb177615929f471547193e13d68b8fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/267822043cb177615929f471547193e13d68b8fa/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Palace of National Congress on Avenida Rivadavia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Palace of National Congress on Avenida Rivadavia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as I wandered ever further from the centre \u2013 along Avenida Rivadavia, at 23 miles the longest street in the city, turned north into working-class Saavedra and down to El Sur, BA\u2019s southside, associated with tango legends but also a bit sketchy and shabby \u2013 I couldn\u2019t help but wonder at the cliched claim that this is \u201cthe most European\u201d city in South America. I saw a very Latin American reality: squat, functional terraces, shanties and high-rises predominated. Yet something in the juxtaposition of old and new, burnished and broken, beautiful and bland, beguiled.</p> <p>Guidebooks were too literal. What I needed was a native to help me decode the metropolis. I found one in an author known outside Argentina as a master of conundrum and enigma.</p> <p>I\u2019d first come across Jorge Luis Borges in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/23/caspar-henderson-rereading-jorge-luis-borges\">The Book of Imaginary Beings</a> as a teenager. In BA, his name was dropped all the time, and not only in literary circles. The handsome, sober-jacketed hardbacks of publisher Emec\u00e9\u2019s complete works stood firmly at the centre of the \u201cArgentinian Literature\u201d sections in city bookshops. Photographs of him often appeared in the newspapers. An arts centre bearing his name sits incongruously in the corner of a downtown shopping mall.</p> <p>Borges is best known for his Ficciones short-story collection, but it was his poems that provided me with epiphanies on my walks. At the simplest level they helped me decode the built environment. The opening lines of \u201cThe Streets\u201d, which opens his first collection, 1923\u2019s Fervour of Buenos Aires, are \u201cMy soul is in the streets/of Buenos Aires\u201d. The poem tells how he identifies not with the city centre but with the \u201cneighbourhood streets where nothing is happening\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04643c32a1dfdd1eec3c513581590bb5cc6b043e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04643c32a1dfdd1eec3c513581590bb5cc6b043e/150_315_3233_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jorge Luis Borges on the terrace of his house.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jorge Luis Borges on the terrace of his house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MP/Leemage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Borges was a serious fl\u00e2neur, making epic wanderings like a modern psychogeographer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He uses words derived from Arabic that evoke Andaluc\u00eda. I was seeing, through Borges, an old world in the new world. In a poem titled El Patio, a simple courtyard becomes \u201cheaven\u2019s watercourse\u2026 the slope/Down which the sky flows into the house\u201d. Borges was a serious fl\u00e2neur, making epic wanderings like a modern psychogeographer. He notes \u201cthe drab houses, the crude banisters, the doorknockers\u201d \u2013 of tourist-free suburbs such as Caballito, Pompeya and Villa Ort\u00fazar \u2013 but in the silver light of evening finds them \u201cvivid as a verse\u201d. The plainest streets are as profound and generous as poetry.</p> <p>The title of Borges\u2019s second poetry collection, Moon Across the Way (1925), captures how Buenos Aires was expanding westward, away from the River Plate estuary. If you walked to the edge of the built-up area you would, eventually, come to a street that looked over the pampas. In his next collection, San Mart\u00edn Copybook (1929), his beautiful and oft-quoted poem The Mythical Foundation of Buenos Aires ends:</p> <p><em>A cigar store perfumed the desert like a rose.<br>The afternoon had established its yesterdays,<br>and men took on together an illusory past.<br>Only one thing was missing \u2013 the street had no other side. <br>Hard to believe Buenos Aires had any beginning;<br>it feels as eternal as air and water.</em></p> <p>Like many city dwellers, Borges laments the passing of what once was: \u201cOur image of the city is always slightly out of date. Cafes have degenerated into bar-rooms; old arched entranceways with their grilled inner gates, once giving us a glimpse of patios and of overhanging grapevines, are now dingy corridors... that lead abruptly to an elevator.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b483f618b2ed124c327c2c277412fbafb3533aac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b483f618b2ed124c327c2c277412fbafb3533aac/0_145_4367_2622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tango in La Boca neighborhood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tango in La Boca neighbourhood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean Schweitzer/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On my ramblings, I was always looking out for the old, the low-slung, the elegantly faded. Such craving for the picturesque came partly from being a foreigner but it also, over time, turned me into a bit of a <em>porte\u00f1o \u2013 </em>prone to idealising the past, imagined or real.</p> <p>As with the stories, Borges loads his verse with classical allusions and speculative meditations. By treating Buenos Aires as palimpsest and puzzle, he turns a walk into an investigation, and makes the 500-year-old city as mysterious and captivating as any ancient archaeological site.</p> <p>Walking a great city can be a balm to the soul: it makes us engage at different levels, rediscover the familiar, and ourselves. In one of the short essays on 19th-century poet Evaristo Carriego (1930), Borges writes: \u201cBuenos Aires is deep, and never have I, disillusioned or suffering, given myself over to its streets without receiving some unexpected consolation, whether from feeling unreality, from guitars at the back of a patio, or from contact with other lives.\u201d</p> <p>Buenos Aires made sense of the poems, which in turn made sense of the city. Now, several years and an ocean away, in the strange new nostalgia imposed by coronavirus, I can reread poems and evoke the city, and its layers of time and memory. Travel as reading, walking as words.</p>",
  "<p>When the Bank of England governor says he is not ruling out a cut in the cost of borrowing to below zero, you know there is trouble ahead.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/what-would-negative-interest-rates-mean-for-mortgages-and-savings\" title=\"\">Negative interest rates</a> are the last resort of the central banker and not to be used unless absolutely necessary. At least that is the thinking inside the forbidding walls of the Bank\u2019s offices on Threadneedle Street. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Only a couple of weeks ago,</a> governor Andrew Bailey said, in effect, that the Bank had never lowered interest rates to below zero and wasn\u2019t going to start now.</p> <p>With the Bank rate standing at 0.1%, it seemed odd to make a distinction between a moderately positive rate of interest and a moderately negative one. But in the world of central banking, such posturing appears alive and well. Only those economies considered weak and feeble go negative. Not the UK.</p> <p>Of course, there was more substance to Bailey\u2019s argument than that. Like his predecessors, he argued that negative rates would put a huge strain on high street banks, which would see their profit margins on lending squeezed. Tighter margins would lead them to accept households and businesses with only the safest credit histories, meaning fewer loans would be granted. Rather than being expansionary, negative rates would lead to a contraction in borrowing \u2013 the opposite of what the central bank wanted to achieve.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem lies with savers who are offered negative interest on their savings. What if they refuse to accept this new reality?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/uk-sells-government-bond-with-negative-yield-for-first-time-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Last week he changed his tune</a> and argued it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d to rule out such a move. For many economists, Bailey was recognising the magnitude of the current downturn. And, theoretically, there are ways to keep high street lenders safe from harm.</p> <p>Negative rates allow the borrower to pay back less at the end of the term than originally borrowed. Borrowing becomes very attractive, and nervous households that might not have taken a loan to buy a car or new kitchen might go ahead with credit this cheap. If a high street lender can borrow at an even lower negative rate from the central bank, there should be scope to maintain profit margins and stay profitable.</p> <p>The problem lies with savers who are offered negative interest on their savings. What happens if they refuse to accept this new reality? They will take their deposits out of the banks and find another home for them.</p> <p>Gold is the usual safe haven from negative interest rates, but middle-income families are unlikely to start buying bars of the stuff or even derivatives of gold that allow punters to buy and sell more easily. Cryptocurrencies on the other hand \u2013 long seen as an esoteric and volatile form of money \u2013 could take off even more than they have already with mainstream savers.</p> <p>And, deprived of deposits, the high street lenders will then lack the reserves they need to lend, defeating the object of the exercise.</p> <p>In Japan, the central bank has told high street banks not to worry about deposits and other usual safeguards; it has said it will act as the backstop for the entire financial system. The European Central Bank has tried to mimic this stance and been held back from such a wholehearted approach only by the reluctance of Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, which fear underwriting the shaky financial systems of their southern European neighbours.</p> <p>Bailey\u2019s gloomier outlook for the UK \u2013 one that expects a shallower recession but several years of business bankruptcies, higher unemployment and lower investment \u2013 could see the UK follow the Danes, who have sanctioned the high street lender Jyske Bank\u2019s plan to offer negative-rate mortgages.</p> <p>A poll of City economists found that the majority believe the unintended consequences of negative rates in an economy the size of Britain\u2019s will deter the central bank from pulling that particular lever.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope the final assessment sets aside any notion of national pride and focuses on the real-world consequences. Britain is going to need all the support it can get from its central bank in the next few years.</p> <h2>Air travel\u2019s return will be closely watched</h2> <p>Mandatory face masks at all times, assessments in interview booths if you show Covid-19 symptoms and no goodbyes inside the terminal. Welcome to the unglamorous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/the-future-of-flying-eu-air-safety-body-issues-coronavirus-guidelines\" title=\"\">future of air travel</a>. These were the guidelines issued by the EU\u2019s air safety body last week for travel through airports.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/easaecdc-issue-joint-guidelines-assure-health-safety-air-travel\" title=\"\">28-page document</a> is full of instructions that would have sounded outrageous in January: stand 1.5 metres from fellow passengers at check-in, boarding and passport control; no food and drink service on board; immediate midair isolation of passengers who develop a fever or cough on a flight. But several months into the worst pandemic in a century, the majority of the document seems proportionate.</p> <p>The guidelines from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency are a warning to other industries and to consumers who interact with them: this is the new normal. Not only will businesses have to adapt to the requirements of beating a highly infectious disease, but so will people who work in them and buy goods from them, whether it is going to the gym (limited class attendance, restricted access to machines), attending the pub (under the watchful eye of social distancing marshalls, if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/22/jd-wetherspoon-pubs-reopen-lockdown-staff-goggles\" title=\"\">it\u2019s a Wetherspoons</a>) or buying a dress in a shop (without trying it on).</p> <p>The danger for the global economy is that consumers balk at the changes and bin the gym membership, drink at home and shop online. If prospective holidaymakers, weekend tourists and business travellers decline to travel by air, the aviation industry\u2019s financial crisis will worsen and a shift in transport patterns and the holiday industry could become permanent.</p> <p>So aviation will be a test of consumer appetite for disruption and discomfort that will send a signal to other sectors shut down by the virus. When Ryanair and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/easyjet-to-resume-domestic-flights-across-england-and-france\" title=\"\">easyJet resume flights</a> next month, businesses should watch closely.</p> <h2>Whitbread borrows to seize an opportunity</h2> <p>In another big week for corporate fundraisings, Whitbread\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/whitbread-raising-1bn-from-shareholders-to-boost-finances-coronavirus-premier-inn\" title=\"\">\u00a31bn pitch to shareholders</a> stood out. First, it was a traditional rights issue, with all investors able to subscribe equally. Very admirable too: most offers during the crisis have left small retail shareholders in the wings in the scramble to raise cash quickly.</p> <p>The second difference is related to the first. Whitbread, owner of the Premier Inn hotel chain and the Beefeater restaurant business, could afford a leisurely timetable because it doesn\u2019t need \u00a31bn urgently.</p> <p>The company, like most in the hospitality industry, is leaking cash during lockdown, so any reinforcement of the balance sheet helps. But Whitbread could have chosen to raise less from shareholders and increase borrowings. Instead, it went for \u00a31bn with an eye on \u201coffensive\u201d expansion.</p> <p>Chief executive Alison Brittain\u2019s bullish argument that many rivals will be \u201cweakened by the pandemic\u201d, creating opportunities for Whitbread, sounds correct.</p> <p>The decline of independent hotel operators was a long-term trend anyway. Meanwhile, its main UK rival, Travelodge, is owned by private equity, and thus weighed down by the usual debt-heavy financial structure. In the fight for new development sites, Whitbread could enjoy a double benefit in the new world \u2013 lower commercial property prices and fewer bidders.</p> <p>Many of the same factors will apply in Germany, which was already Whitbread\u2019s big hope for the next decade. The goal of becoming the biggest budget operator in that country may have come closer.</p> <p>The Whitbread example points to a trend we may see in other sectors: strong companies taking chunks of market share from underequipped rivals. In retail, Boohoo has armed itself with \u00a3200m to add ailing retail brands to a collection that already includes Coast and Karen Millen.</p> <p>We may be looking at a two-speed world: an abundance of cash for strong operators and starvation rations for the weak.</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Wuhan lab had bat coronaviruses \u2013 but not Covid-19</h2> <p>The Chinese virology institute in Wuhan, the city in China at the heart of the coronavirus pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/global-report-wuhan-lab-says-its-bat-strains-were-not-covid-19-as-us-nears-10000-deaths\">has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the Covid-19 strain</a>, its director has said. The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims by US president Donald Trump that the virus could have leaked from the facility were \u201cpure fabrication\u201d. In an interview filmed on 13 May but broadcast Saturday night, Wang Yanyi said the centre had \u201cisolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats. Now we have three strains of live viruses ... But their highest similarity to SARS-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8%.\u201d</p> <h2>US opens up for summer</h2> <p>There are fears the US will suffer a second wave of coronavirus infections as it opens up for summer, just days away from the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths. Every state has relaxed restrictions to some extent, with many flocking to beaches and outdoor areas. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">filled the entire front page</a> of Sunday\u2019s paper with the death notices of victims from across the country as the country recorded more than 97,000 deaths.</p> <h2>Argentina extends lockdown</h2> <p>Argentina has extended the mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires until 7 June and tightened some movement restrictions, after a steady increase in the city\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases in recent days. Officials will tighten traffic controls between the capital and Buenos Aires province, the area with the second highest concentration of cases. The country recorded 704 new infections on Saturday, one of the highest single-day increases since the pandemic began.</p> <h2>Brazil cases near 350,000</h2> <p>Brazil registered 965 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,013, the Health Ministry said. The country now has 347,398 confirmed cases, according to the ministry, up 16,508 from Friday, when it surpassed Russia to become the world\u2019s virus hot spot behind the US. The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as the testing capacity of Latin America\u2019s largest country still lags.</p> <h2>New Zealand reports no new cases</h2> <p>New Zealand\u2019s health ministry has announced there were zero new coronavirus cases confirmed in the last 24 hours. According to NewsHub, there are now only 27 active cases left in New Zealand, with one more patient recovered, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,154, with 21 deaths.</p> <h2>Australian states ease restrictions</h2> <p>In Australia, Victorian state premier, Daniel Andrews, has said Victorians will be allowed to have 20 people in their homes as well as overnight stays in hotels from 1 June. In New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, health minister Brad Hazzard announced that beauty, tanning, nail and waxing salons would all be open from 1 June.</p> <h2>Pompeo threatens Australia over Belt and Road projects</h2> <p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has implied information sharing with Australia may be at risk if the Victoria proceeds with any Belt and Road projects that jeopardise communications networks. Issuing the highly qualified warning during an interview with Sky News Australia, the News Corp-owned channel, Pompeo urged Victoria to scrutinise any proposals \u201cincredibly closely\u201d because Belt and Road projects could \u201cbuild up the capacity of the Chinese Communist Party to do harm\u201d. Victoria has attracted domestic political criticism for signing an agreement that would allow for it be part of the Belt and Road Initiative.</p> <h2>French churches to hold first masses since lockdown started</h2> <p>French churches were preparing to hold their first Sunday masses in more than two months after the government bowed to a ruling that they should be reopened. Nearly two weeks into the relaxation of its shutdown, the government finally allowed churches, mosques and synagogues to reopen. Worshippers will have to wear masks, there will have to be disinfectant gel on hand and the seating will need to be organised to ensure people keep a safe distance from each other.</p> <h2>Boris Johnson chief adviser under pressure as second trip emerges</h2> <p>In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, faces renewed pressure to resign after new witnesses reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/23/new-witnesses-cast-doubt-on-dominic-cummingss-lockdown-claims\">seeing him making a fresh trip</a> hundreds of miles to Durham.</p>",

that it would immediately allow barley imports from the US \u2013 which came at a time when Australian barley exporters were trying to prevent the steep new tariffs being imposed.</p> <p>In the

Australia should take a longer-term perspective on relations with China, while also acting to protect its national interest and hold to its values regardless of the potential reaction.</p> <p>But she was concerned there was so much focus on the bilateral relationship with China that it was diverting attention from a range of other important foreign policy issuing, including how should Australia navigate the post-Covid-19 world.</p> <p>Wong noted the pandemic was fracturing the global economy, unravelling the rules-based order, and hardening strategic competition between the US and China.</p>

  "<p>Two months have passed since Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, called on warring parties around the world to lay down their weapons and help fight another battle \u2013 against Covid-19. \u201cThe fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cThat is why I am calling for an immediate <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059972\">global ceasefire </a>\u2026 It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown.\u201d <br><br>This was and remains an entirely sensible idea. The UN leader\u2019s appeal received strong support from civil society groups, charities, churches and human rights organisations. In Colombia, the Philippines and South Sudan, armed groups initially heeded his call. But to their great shame, the US, China and Russia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/un-ceasefire-resolution-us-blocks-who\">blocked the plan </a>in the UN security council. They continue to do so.<br></p> <p>Those who suggest a global ceasefire would be a merely symbolic gesture should listen to the Norwegian Refugee Council. Since 23 March, when Guterres spoke, more than <a href=\"https://www.nrc.no/news/2020/may/armed-conflict-displaces-660000-since-un-call-for-global-ceasefire/\">660,000 people around</a> the world have been forced to flee their homes because of armed conflict, it reported last week. Failed ceasefires in Yemen, Libya and Afghanistan continue to take a dreadful daily toll of civilian lives.<br><br>\u201cThis not only hurts those who are forced to flee. It seriously undermines joint efforts to combat the virus,\u201d said the NRC\u2019s chief, Jan Egeland. \u201cWhile people are being displaced and killed, powerful members of the UN security council <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/world/un-security-council-fails-support-global-ceasefire-shows-no-response-covid-19\">squabble </a>like children in a sandbox. World leaders must unite in protecting all communities from Covid-19.\u201d<br><br>Donald Trump\u2019s objections to a ceasefire resolution, repeatedly proposed and delayed in recent weeks, have nothing to do with war or virus-related suffering, to which he appears indifferent. Trump dislikes the fact that the latest draft refers, indirectly, to the World Health Organization \u2013 with which he is irrationally feuding as part of his China virus vendetta.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This pathetic inability on the part of the world\u2019s great powers to show leadership, compassion and common sense is dangerous and disheartening</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><br><br>The US had previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/us-and-russia-blocking-un-plans-for-a-global-ceasefire-amid-crisis\">objected </a>on the grounds that a global ceasefire might inhibit its ability to interdict terrorists, a concern echoed by Russia vis-\u00e0-vis its military operations in Syria.

The result: stalemate.<br></p> <p>This pathetic inability on the part of the world\u2019s great powers to show leadership, compassion and common sense at a time of global emergency is dangerous and disheartening. The impasse reflects the decline in the authority of the UN security council. More so, it is an indictment of the irresponsibility of men such as Trump, China\u2019s Xi Jinping, and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.<br><br>How on earth do these leaders hope to wield influence and command respect and support when, ignoring basic human decency, they allow personal disputes, selfish political calculations and a myopic interpretation of what constitutes national interest to determine their decisions? This way lies the complete breakdown of international co-operation.<br><br>As ever, it will not be they who pay the price. The momentum generated by Guterres\u2019s inspirational call has begun to dissipate. The situation in several conflict zones has even begun to get worse. Northern Yemen is a case in point.

By the same measure, \u201cpolitics can change a culture and save it from itself\u201d.</p> <p>Frum criticizes the effective disenfranchisement wrought by the electoral college but does not call for its abolition. That would be futile. Although the Republicans lost the popular vote in six of seven presidential contests since 1992, they captured the White House three times. Few surrender power for the asking.</p> <p>After the debacle of 2000, Frum\u2019s boss extended an olive branch to blue America. Bush sought to broaden his mandate.

He also homes in on the contradiction at the heart of Trumpian populism.</p> <p>On the one hand, it is rooted in the belief that the silent majority should come first, not the elites. On the other, its operative dictum is \u201cwe should not choose our leaders just by counting who got the most votes\u201d. Shades of Animal Farm: some folks are more equal than others.</p> <p>Said differently, the people\u2019s preferences should not be equated with \u201cwill of <em>the </em>people\u201d. In the end, Frum says, Trumpism is about defending a \u201cdistinct way of life\u201d, one challenged by modernity.</p> <p>Frum makes clear that this outlook is shared by the cosseted segments of Trump\u2019s base. Trumpocalypse quotes <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fema-tells-states-to-hand-public-health-data-over-to-palantir\">Peter Thiel, a pillar of Silicon Valley</a> and an early Trump supporter, who sees democracy at odds with his libertarian ideals.

He also contends that the welfare state has \u201crendered the notion of \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron\u201d. Recent reports, however, describe even Thiel <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/billionaire-maga-fan-peter-thiel-has-had-it-with-trumps-covid-19-response\">as displeased with Trump</a> over his handling of the pandemic.</p> <p>Trumpocalypse voices irreconcilable grievance. Still, Frum\u2019s dismay is not directed at the president\u2019s supporters, at least he tries not to. Frum understands that even if the incumbent loses re-election, the great American divide is not disappearing anytime soon.</p> <p>On that note, Trumpocalypse rejects progressivism\u2019s embrace of the \u201cGreat Awokening\u201d, the volatile brew of identity politics and intersectionality. The left\u2019s orthodoxies find few takers in swing districts. Frum opposes liberal immigration policies as devaluing the rights and status of actual citizens.

Unsurprisingly, many of these revolved around allegations that the PM\u2019s advisor Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown rules back in March. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The government has announced it will put \u00a3283m into moving public transport back to a full timetable</strong>. However, those who can should still work from home, and those who can should still avoid all forms of public transport. Even a fully restored service will only be capable of carrying, at best, one fifth of normal capacity, to allow for social distancing. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>There have been a further 282 recorded deaths, bringing the UK\u2019s total death toll to 36,675</strong>. Important to note - the government publishes the death toll based on those who definitely had Covid-19; broader figures based on suspected coronavirus deaths is larger. On average, the number of deaths is starting to come down, Harries said. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The \u201csteady, slow\u201d <strong>downward trend in hospital admissions in England is continuing</strong>. Across all four nations, the percentage of mechanical ventilator beds occupied by patients with Covid-19 is also falling.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Testing for under 5s will be \u201cprogressed\u201d going forward</strong>, said Harries, after a question on whether they\u2019ll be able to get tested once early years facilities are reopened. Harries said it is known that children rarely become ill with Covid-19 and there are signals that the transmission from children is reduced.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2><strong>Shapps was grilled on Cummings</strong></h2> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Shapps dodged a question on whether or not the PM knew of Dominic Cummings\u2019 400km journey, simply saying: \u201cthe important thing is that everyone remains in the same place whilst they are in lockdown\u201d. He also said the welfare of Cummings\u2019 4 year old child was \u201cthe important thing\u201d - this is a reference to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iainjwatson/status/1264124644191277057\">explanation</a> given by Downing Street for Cummings\u2019 journey.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The PM gives Cummings his full support.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Asked if, like Cummings, those who become ill with the virus can go closer to relatives, Shapps says if you\u2019re symptomatic, you have to get yourself locked down in the most practical way, and that this will be different depending on different family circumstances.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>If you want more detail, you can read some of the exchanges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/23/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-under-pressure-to-sack-dominic-cummings-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec942418f0886ce4f5d91c7#block-5ec942418f0886ce4f5d91c7\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/23/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-under-pressure-to-sack-dominic-cummings-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ec940278f0864e579f167ae#block-5ec940278f0864e579f167ae\">here</a>.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T19:51:23.657Z\">at 8.51pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec9498f8f0886ce4f5d91fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T16:06:59.567Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The death toll in <strong>Italy </strong>has risen by 119 to 32,735, the third highest in the world after the US and the UK.</p> \n  <p>There have been another 669 confirmed cases, taking the total to 229,372, the sixth highest global tally behind those of the US, Russia, Spain, Britain and Brazil.

Early analysis by WHO suggests that Africa\u2019s lower mortality rate may be the result of demography and other possible factors. Africa is the youngest continent demographically, with more than 60% of the population under the age of 25. Older adults have a significantly increased risk of developing a severe illness. In Europe nearly 95% of deaths occurred in those older than 60 years.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>WHO also noted that African governments swiftly imposed restrictive measures on their populations in an attempt to contain the spread of the disease.

To recap the latest developments around the world:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>About 1.8bn Muslims worldwide will celebrate one of their biggest holidays, the three-day Eid al-Fitr, largely confined to their home. The celebration marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, and usually involves travelling, visiting family and gathering for lavish meals, all of which will be largely prohibited as authorities try to prevent virus outbreaks. </li> \n   <li>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/22/hydroxychloroquine-trumps-covid-19-cure-increases-deaths-global-study-finds\">another study has shown that the anti-malarial drug the US president,<strong> Donald Trump,</strong> is taking</a> to prevent Covid-19 has increased deaths in patients treated with it in hospitals around the world. It follows a<a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2\"> study published in April that showed hospital patients given hydroxychloroquine</a> in the US found no benefit from the drug, either alone or given in combination with an antibiotic. In fact the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone had a higher mortality rate.</li> \n   <li>Still in the US, in yet another attack on media Trump called the editor of the New York Times \u201cone of the dumbest men\u201d in journalism, and as CNN\u2019s fact-checker has noted, this is the third time in the last month he has called a prominent black journalist \u201cdumb\u201d. He also spent his Friday evening attacking his former attorney general, <strong>Jeff Sessions, </strong>on Twitter. Trump declared churches, mosques and synagogues \u201cessential services\u201d and threatened to override governors who refuse to reopen them this weekend \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">a power he does not possess</a>.</li> \n   <li>In Russia, the Chechen leader,<strong> Ramzan Kadyrov</strong>,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/ramzan-kadyrov-vanishes-amid-reports-he-has-coronavirus\"> is being treated for Covid-19 in Moscow</a>.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/22/jobkeeper-to-cost-60bn-less-than-originally-forecast-due-to-reporting-error\">error between the number of employees businesses estimated would be covered by the scheme and the actual number receiving the payment means the scheme will cover 3.5m workers, down from 6.5m</a>. It will also cost about $70bn, not $130bn. The government is so far resisting calls from Labor to extend the payment to casuals and those workers who were not eligible for the payment.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-23T00:32:22.499Z\">at 1.32am BST</time></p> \n</div>"
