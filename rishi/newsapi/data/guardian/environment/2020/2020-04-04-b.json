  "<p>Whatever plans Simon Bridges had to convince New Zealanders that he should be their next prime minister are \u2013 nominally at least \u2013 on hold. Bridges, the leader of the parliamentary opposition and of the centre-right National party, suspended campaigning for September\u2019s poll last month as lawmakers across the political spectrum united to endorse a four-week shutdown over the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>But despite the cross-party display of support for measures to combat the virus\u2019 spread, politics for Bridges is never far away. A post on his Facebook page is soliciting support for his call to quarantine everyone entering New Zealand \u2013 currently, the government is allowing some to self-isolate at home \u2013 and urges the public to message him directly with their problems or complaints during the lockdown.</p> <p>And Bridges, 43, has jumped at the opportunity, in his new position as leader of a parliamentary committee scrutinising the government\u2019s decisions on Covid-19, to grill those in power.</p> <p>\u201cI think actually the scrutiny and the sunlight\u2019s working,\u201d he told a radio interviewer on Friday, referring to the committee\u2019s daily sittings, held on a publicly livestreamed video call. \u201cWe\u2019re dragging out more openness and transparency behind the press conferences.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/27/new-zealand-national-party-elects-maori-leader-jacindamania\">New Zealand: National party elects Maori leader and deputy to take on Jacindamania</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jacinda Ardern, the country\u2019s prime minister \u2013 an adroit and empathetic communicator \u2013 is in her element in a crisis, and one of the world\u2019s most popular leaders. But if an election is held in September as scheduled, Bridges told the Guardian in a February interview that he was not worried about his rival\u2019s global profile.</p> <p>\u201cI see when I go overseas, our prime minister \u2013 and therefore the government \u2013 has this strong reputation and that\u2019s amazing,\u201d he says,upbeat but underscored by his trademark bluntness, on a couch in his office at New Zealand\u2019s parliament. \u201cBut of course for New Zealanders at home, that international work is only so good as your domestic record and that is, I clearly think, lacking.\u201d</p> <h2>Pitching economic clout</h2> <p>Like Ardern, Bridges has a young family at home. His three children \u2013 aged seven, five and two \u2013 and wife Natalie live in the port city of Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty in the North Island. He has brought to Wellington the relaxed, casual demeanour of the beachfront city, though he admits he has no life beyond politics, his family, and a little Netflix, and has never learned to surf.</p> <p>But where Ardern has built a reputation for exhorting a politics of kindness, Bridges is painted by his detractors as too negative, not likeable enough, maladroit in sensitive situations. The former prosecutor \u2013 who almost burned out in the job because, he tells the Guardian, he obsessed over each case he presented before a court \u2013 says that depiction of him is wrong.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has a monopoly on compassion,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always what people say that defines that. I think it is one\u2019s acts in government that show that.\u201d</p> <p>While polling data has not been published since Ardern shut down the country last Wednesday \u2013 a move that was widely supported to combat Covid-19, but is expected to deepen a recession forecast for the country \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12308451\">1News Colmar Brunton poll in February</a> suggested it would be Bridges\u2019 National that would form the government after a vote in September, with a razor-thin, two-seat majority over the left-wing coalition led by Labour.</p> <p>But that was when the threat of Covid-19 still felt far from New Zealand\u2019s shores; now, the vote is likely to come down to whether people believe Ardern\u2019s party or Bridges\u2019 can better steer New Zealand\u2019s ship through an economic shock expected to be worse than the 2008 global financial crisis.</p> <p>Bridges is making the pitch that it\u2019s him. An economic speech touted as the centrepiece of his election-year pitch in February promised lower taxes, more jobs, boosts to GDP and debt reduction. As the impact of the pandemic became apparent in the past month, Bridges told the Guardian those pledges remained \u2013 and that Covid-19 \u201ccalls for more boldness in our actions\u201d on the economy.</p> <p>While New Zealanders are often uncomfortable with displays of naked ambition, he says Ardern\u2019s wish for the country \u2013 that everyone might have the basics for life covered \u2013 is \u201cnot remotely ambitious and aspirational enough\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI want my three children to be world beaters,\u201d he says. \u201cI know with an English wife that they have options and I don\u2019t want them to spend their adult years in the UK. I want this to be a world beating economy and country where they can \u2026 not just exist happily but thrive.\u201d</p> <p>Bridges and his party are not centre-right in the way some comparable countries understand the term; the lawmaker is a full-throated supporter of New Zealand\u2019s free healthcare and schooling systems, and says he would consider climate change in his economic proposals were he prime minister. But in other ways he is an inveterate conservative: he believes New Zealanders will vote for lower taxes, would not use the term \u201cclimate emergency\u201d and disagrees with what he calls \u201cpreaching\u201d on the topic in schools.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/13/new-zealand-schools-to-teach-students-about-climate-crisis-activism-and-eco-anxiety\">New Zealand schools to teach students about climate crisis, activism and 'eco anxiety'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He recalls a former parliamentary colleague telling visiting Americans that \u201cin New Zealand, the Labour party\u2019s like the Democrats and the National party\u2019s like the Democrats\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t overly caricature it, but New Zealanders, I think, are a caring, compassionate society \u2013 dare I say it, and maybe I\u2019ll regret saying this, but I think a bit more so than [Australia].\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I also have a moral obligation to ask hard questions\u2019</h2> <p>When the Guardian met Bridges in February, he expected the election to be close, but was buoyant about his chances. He is relaxed and familiar in conversation, with a tendency to warn that he is about to be candid, or to say something he \u201cmight later regret,\u201d before voicing an entirely uncontroversial opinion in line with his political views. It is \u201ccandid\u201d, for example, for him to suggest that people might vote for Labour come September because Ardern, in her first term as leader, is \u201ca nice person\u201d with good intentions and deserves another chance, even if they don\u2019t feel the government has delivered on its promises, particularly on the country\u2019s housing crisis.</p> <p>September\u2019s poll will be Bridges\u2019 first as National and opposition leader; he won the role after Bill English stepped down in 2018.</p> <p>Seen as a bright, young talent during National\u2019s time in power, Bridges entered parliament as a 32-year-old lawmaker who was Oxford-educated \u2013 but the son of a clergyman and a school teacher \u2013 telegenic and with a politically enviable background prosecuting criminals. He was awarded frequent promotions and hefty portfolios, becoming minister for transport and economic development.</p> <p>New Zealand\u2019s politicians, when interviewed \u2013 perhaps cautious of the public\u2019s preference for humility in leaders \u2013 often protest that they dislike parliament; it\u2019s a necessary evil, not something they would ever choose. Bridges enjoys it.</p> <p>\u201cI think once you understand that it\u2019s a place of theatre, it\u2019s symbolically very important that arguments in parliament are good,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He is less sanguine about brickbats from \u201cthe left and the Twitterati\u201d that he says frequently misconstrue his positions. In contrast to Ardern \u2013 who frequently receives glowing media attention for her party\u2019s social media posts, and has called all New Zealand\u2019s leaders to commit to factual and transparent campaigning, which Bridges says he supports \u2013 his party, he says, is nitpicked unfairly.</p> <p>\u201cThey seek to hold National to a higher standard of these things and are on the lookout for it every second of the day,\u201d he says. He is sometimes accused by his critics of inappropriately politicising situations; where Ardern plays politics, but subtly, his speeches are often battering rams.</p> <p>\u201cI think they are unfair,\u201d he says of reproaches that he should not have criticised the government over its initial Covid-19 response. \u201cI have often been constructive but I also have a moral obligation to ask hard questions and push the government along for the good of New Zealand.\u201d</p> <p>Bridges laughs off questions of whether he is likeable enough to lead National to victory; he has previously said it is <a href=\"https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/likeability-doesnt-make-good-pm-bridges-says-while-shrugging-off-negative-approval-rating\">not an essential trait in a prime minister</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee0253c4f8c48933d4835e90a7122d96cca24be2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee0253c4f8c48933d4835e90a7122d96cca24be2/0_18_3960_2376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Bridges, Winston Peters and Jacinda Ardern attend Waitangi Day celebrations\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Bridges (far left), Winston Peters and Jacinda Ardern attend Waitangi Day celebrations on 4 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried sometimes that I\u2019m not overly hardened to valid criticism and that I have some sensitivity there,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t get worked up about what Mrs Jones says to me in an email or what I read on Twitter but I do want to be sensitive enough that where they\u2019re saying you\u2019ve got that wrong, and you can improve in this way, I seek to do that.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s an example?</p> <p>\u201cI wear better-fitting suits these days,\u201d he says.</p> <p>When Bridges meets aspiring political candidates, he tries to dissuade them from running for office if they are already doing well in their careers. But he does not regret his move to leave the courtroom behind.</p> <p>\u201cYou think you really enjoy something and certainly I found it satisfying, but the day I resigned to be the Tauranga candidate for the National party, a weight lifted off my shoulders,\u201d Bridges says.</p> <p>\u201cI used to find sleeping quite hard when I was in cases, I\u2019d always have my cross examination and my closing arguments rolling over my head, because I wanted to get it perfect for the jury and the victim.</p> <p>\u201cAs my wife would attest, now in politics I sleep like a baby.\u201d</p>",

The New Orleans area continues to be the epicenter of the outbreak in Louisiana, with 3,966 known cases and 154 deaths reported out of Orleans Parish.</p> <p>Neighboring Jefferson Parish has another 3,008 known cases, 95 of them fatal.</p> <p>To what extent Saturday\u2019s hike resulted from an increased testing rate is unclear.

Let me put this in a proper, yet very sobering context. We have now lost nearly 100 more of our fellow New Jerseyans to Covid-19 that we did on the September 11th attacks. Please let that sink in for a moment. This pandemic is writing one of the greatest tragedies in our state\u2019s history and just as we have committed to never forget the lives lost on 9/11, we must commit to never forgetting those we are losing to this pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cLet\u2019s just all remember again: this is war. We are in a war. How do you win wars? You don\u2019t panic and you don\u2019t go business-as-usual. You win it by being smart, aggressive, proactive, shooting straight with each other, being honest about the toll that is both before us and will continue to grow. Let\u2019s not kid each other. You win wars by not turning on each other, but to the contrary, coming together. This extraordinary diverse state coming together as one family. </p> <p>\u201cYou win a war because your work harder than the next folks.

Every single one of us is a hero right now. Every single one of us must do our part if we are to flatten the curve of this virus, allow our healthcare system to be able to deal with it properly and then emerge on the other side.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Dubai goes into lockdown</h2> <p>Dubai has entered a two-week lockdown to limit the spread of coronavirus. The new measures, introduced at 8pm on Saturday (1600 GMT), will see mobility restricted, with just one person per residence able to leave home for \u201cessential needs\u201d such as food and medicine. Supermarkets and pharmacies, alongside food and drug delivery services, will continue to work as normal and those working in \u201cvital sectors\u201d will be allowed to go out.</p> <h2>US cases pass 300,000 as Trump warns next two weeks will be hardest</h2> <p>Donald Trump has warned American citizens that the next two weeks will be the toughest, as the number of cases in the US pass 300,000. He also announced that thousands of military personnel would be deployed to states to help them tackle the coronavirus pandemic, with 1,000 directed to New York City.</p> <h2>Deaths in New York pass 3,000</h2> <p>The death toll in the state of New York increased by 630 in the last day, governor Andrew Cuomo announced, bringing its number of coronavirus-related deaths to 3,565. This was the largest daily increase in deaths in the state, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the US and has accounted for almost a quarter of the US\u2019s 8,291 deaths.</p> <h2>Tehran could see virus resurgence</h2> <p>A senior health official in Iran has warned that the area in and around the capital city of Tehran could see a resurgence of coronavirus cases after residents flouted restrictions. The warning came after many people ignored advice to stay at home, with crowding and traffic jams on the city\u2019s streets as the country\u2019s New Year holidays ended on Saturday.</p> <h2>Tunisia government gets new powers</h2> <p>The Tunisian parliament has given the government new powers to combat the spread of coronavirus and the expected economic fallout. These will allow the government to issue decrees, make purchasing agreements and seek finance without consulting parliament. The decision was backed by all political parties.</p> <h2>Malawi government takes 10% pay cut to fund virus fight</h2> <p>The president and ministers of Malawi will take a 10% cut to their salary and redirect the money to the country\u2019s efforts to fight coronavirus, president Peter Mutharika has said. The announcement came in a national address on state television which also unveiled a number of measures to protect businesses, including tax breaks, reduction in fuel allowances and an increase in the risk allowances for health workers.</p>",

Textor, a company that previously created materials <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/army-deployed-as-manufacturers-ramp-up-production-20200324-p54daw\">for nappies</a>, sanitary pads and baby wipes, has repurposed its business toward personal protective equipment (PPE) with the help of the CSIRO.</p> <p>The manufacturing industry\u2019s guide during this pandemic-induced transformation is the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre, a not-for-profit working with the federal government.</p> <p>It is trying to help the sector pivot into Covid-19-related work, setting up a central portal where businesses can register their skills, supplies, and capabilities.</p> <p>\u201cOnce we set up the portal, heaven broke loose,\u201d the AMGC managing director, Dr Jens Goennemann, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cUp to today, we had 1,000 registrations from companies who not only said \u2018I want to help\u2019, but they said how they could do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo that means we can make a heat map of different skills and capabilities, which we can then throw at the most targeted need.\u201d</p> <p>The speed of the pivot has been remarkable.

Production, he says, is just one part of the manufacturing process, along with research, development, design, logistics, distribution, sales and services.</p> <p>In fact, Goennemann said Australia may be uniquely placed to respond. He points to 3D printing, of which Australia has an \u201cincredible onshore capability\u201d, as an example.</p> <p>\u201cThe 3D printing capability onshore is a massive distinguisher for Australia to step up to the crisis,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2841f822deea85f7b2753f6f3d88becbd0ff400\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2841f822deea85f7b2753f6f3d88becbd0ff400/0_0_4032_3024/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Mat Bowtell in a face shield\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mat Bowtell (right) in one of the face shields printed on 3D printers in his Cowes factory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Free 3D Hands</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When asked how else 3D printing might be deployed in practice, Goennemann points to the supply of ventilators, which are needed to assist breathing in the most seriously ill Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>A lack of ventilators has been a critical issue in countries like Italy, where doctors in swamped intensive care units have been forced to make heart-wrenching decisions about who gets access to the life-saving machines.</p> <p>Australia has about 2,300 ventilators in intensive care units across the country. The government wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/31/experts-confident-australia-will-have-enough-ventilators-to-meet-coronavirus-demand\">increase the number of ICU beds</a> dramatically to prepare for the peak of the pandemic, and is attempting to source more ventilators through a combination of domestic production, procurement from abroad, and the conversion of existing equipment, including from veterinarians.</p> <p>Goennemann says Resmed, the main ventilator manufacturer, could struggle to get parts due to the disruption of global supply chains.</p> <p>That\u2019s where 3D printing can help.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to speak on behalf of Resmed, but that\u2019s an area where we have critical supply, and parts can be 3D printed onshore rather than being procured offshore,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The industry minister, Karen Andrews, is heading up the government\u2019s efforts to ramp up domestic production of PPE and ventilators.

Over many years we\u2019ve shown that the variation in bleaching tolerance is hereditable \u2013 it gets passed from parents to offspring.\u201d</p> <p>She says these differences can exist even among the same species, meaning those corals can be selectively grown in a lab setting to promote more heat tolerance.</p> <p>AIMS scientist Dr Neal Cantin has just finished a three-year experiment with one fast-growing coral species called <em>Pocillopora acuta</em>, which behaves like a weed by filling in the gaps when less hardy corals die off.</p> <p>Starting with 90 parent specimens taken from three different parts of the Great Barrier Reef, Cantin and colleagues grew 7,500 offspring and then subjected them to rising levels of CO2 and temperatures of up to 2C warming.</p> <p>Even at high temperatures, some of these corals survived, and they were able to tolerate higher levels of heat as the experiment went on.</p> <p>Having a street-fighting weedy coral like this is important, says Cantin. Dead areas of coral reefs tend to get covered in algae, but Cantin says a weedy coral that can compete with the algae can then make room for slower-growing corals to also grow.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole goal of a lot of these interventions is to work with species that can be successful on their own. We won\u2019t be able to work with 600 species of corals, but we could probably work with 20 that fill the functional roles of a healthy reef community.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t deny bleaching events are becoming more frequent and more severe and they\u2019re impacting across a bigger area than before. We can just document that demise, or we can learn from it and have some corals for future generations.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b680323c4e6db98409ca5057987e549c7c216d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b680323c4e6db98409ca5057987e549c7c216d5/0_0_4000_3000/1000..jpg\" alt=\"An unbleached specimen of Acropora clathrata on the Great Barrier Reef\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An unbleached specimen of <em>Acropora clathrata</em> on the Great Barrier Reef.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zoe Richards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That demise is clear and it happens at scale, and also in detail. Zoe Richards has already seen evidence of likely local extinctions of some corals at Lizard Island. One is a spiralised plate coral \u2013 <em>Acropora clathrata</em> \u2013 that she hasn\u2019t been able to find for years.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s these silent extinctions that go on,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe entire reef is operating like one big meta population with sub-populations that are connected to each other. If you successively take out nodes in that population, sooner or later you will end up with parts that don\u2019t connect. It will be fragmented into subsets that will continue to erode in terms of diversity. It\u2019s degradation of the [coral] community at a very large scale.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018At 3C, you basically have nothing\u2019</h2> <p>Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, of the University of Queensland, has done pioneering work on the study of coral bleaching going back to the mid-1980s.</p> <p>He remembers Lizard Island as a \u201cpicture perfect\u201d place to do research on corals in the late 80s, when his research there found rising temperatures caused corals to lose their \u201csymbionts\u201d \u2013 the algae that lives in the coral and gives them much of their nutrients and colour.</p> <p>The Great Barrier Reef\u2019s first major mass bleaching event happened in 1998. There was another in 2002, and again in 2016, 2017 and 2020.</p> <p>Hoegh-Guldberg says: \u201cWe knew there was a temperature effect, and we knew that temperatures were going up. At the end of the 90s, I could put those two things together.\u201d</p> <p>The year after the reef\u2019s first mass bleaching, <a href=\"article\">Hoegh-Guldberg</a> took climate models to forecast that if greenhouse gas emissions kept growing then, by 2020, \u201cthe average bleaching event is likely to be similar or greater than the 1998 event\u201d.</p> <p>As 2020 approached, the models showed reefs across the northern, central and southern regions would see between eight and 10 bleaching events per decade.</p> <p>\u201cI wished I\u2019d been wrong\u201d he says. \u201cI think I said at the time that I\u2019d have egg on my face if I was wrong.

Corals will come back and there will be winners and losers, but you\u2019ll have a functional reef that supports fisheries and tourism.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is that right now, government pledges under the Paris agreement are enough to raise temperatures by 3C \u2013 not 1.5C.</p> <p>\u201cAt 2C all the reef-building corals have plummeted and instead you are looking at the dominance of other organisms like algae. At 3C you basically have nothing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fearful that in the next 10 years we will see the loss of coral across the planet at phenomenal rates,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me up at night.\u201d</p>",

They have cramped rooms with windows that don\u2019t open, no balcony and are not allowed to leave even for some fresh air and exercise. Some hotels aren\u2019t cleaning the rooms for the two weeks and aren\u2019t offering people products to clean their own bathrooms.\u201d</p> <p>Finlay said one person had been told they could have a food package delivered by a family member. The family member included a bottle of wine, which the hotel confiscated. He described those in the hotels as \u201cdetainees\u201d and said many did not have access to a laundry. One hotel, the Hilton, was charging some $20 to do the washing, he said. This is not covered by the government.</p> <p>One of the vulnerable passengers Finlay flagged for medical exemption from staying in a hotel was a man who had survived being in a fifth floor hotel room in Kathmandu during the deadly Nepal earthquakes in 2015. He\u2019d been trapped for some time with dead bodies nearby.</p> <p>\u201cUnderstandably he didn\u2019t want to end up in a hotel with windows that didn\u2019t open, no balcony and no scope for getting out of the room to exercise and feel normal,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cHe held grave fears for his mental health and I agreed. I escalated his case a few times to the ministry of health with no communication back to me and no action taken.\u201d</p> <p>Another vulnerable woman found out she was approximately 15 weeks pregnant. Due to being on a remote island prior to returning to Australia, she has so far had no antenatal screening and this is her first pregnancy. She had arranged to be seen by an obstetrician in her home city of Hobart but was unable to travel to Tasmania due to strict travel restrictions which meant that, even after completing two weeks isolation in NSW, she and her husband would be required to do the same again in Tasmania.</p> <p>\u201cShe works in an emergency service,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cShe was very anxious about not having any antenatal screening until the end of another four weeks. She reported to me that she spoke to the onsite doctor and that she is not allowed out of her room so she could get antenatal screening.\u201d</p> <p>Finlay also shared concerns for other quarantined arrivals, including a woman with a newborn baby who he said is a high risk for developing post natal depression, and an older couple where the husband has dementia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-covid-19-australian-doctors-dentists-stuck-cruise-ship-coast-chile\">Coronavirus ban: more than 100 Australian doctors and dentists stuck on cruise ship off Chile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey were to be isolated in a hotel despite having a home in Sydney,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cThe unfamiliar environment and confinement is likely to result in behavioural disturbances for her husband.\u201d</p> <p>He said a paraplegic woman with a catheter and needing an air mattress so that she doesn\u2019t get pressure sores, and who has a carer who helps her with tasks such as bathing, was not allowed to be driven to Wollongong to her house that her friends had ensured was stocked with supplies for her return.</p> <p>\u201cTo my knowledge she is still languishing in a hotel in Sydney,\u201d Finlay said. \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience sit and wait for the authorities to rectify any of this because there\u2019s evidence that they know and still won\u2019t do anything.

Communications have been changing regularly particularly between police and the hotel, with lack of clarity given to those in isolation, she said, adding there was uncertainty on the date and time people will be allowed to return home. Neilson said people would cope better if they were given clear information.<br><br>\u201cSome people really are struggling and lonely, particularly older people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disorientating for them.\u201d<br><br>She added that \u201cpolice are running\u201d the hotel operations. \u201cThe communications between border force, police, the hotel and the army appear to be a mess,\u201d Neilson said.</p> <p>NSW police and the Hilton have been contacted for comment.

  "<p>The British are dying in \u201ccare\u201d homes across the country without saying goodbye to their families. The government said <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-residential-care-supported-living-and-home-care-guidance/covid-19-guidance-on-residential-care-provision\">goodbye to goodbyes</a> on 13 March when it ordered care home providers to \u201cstop all visits to residents from friends and family\u201d.</p> <p>Helen Wildbore, whose <a href=\"https://www.relres.org/\">charity</a>, The Relatives &amp; Residents Association, represents the families of elderly people, talks of their acute distress as children and partners disappear from their lives. Some with dementia will only eat and wash when a husband, wife or child is with them. And now they\u2019ve gone.</p> <p>Few outsiders care about the care services. Residential and nursing homes, and the army of harassed women who go <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2018-12/Home-care-in-England-report.pdf\">from door to door</a> looking after 350,000 people, are as neglected as the prisons, another Cinderella service that could be ravaged by the virus. Britain is a gambling nation. It gambled that it could neglect social care, just as it gambled that it could manage with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/effd0dae-655f-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5\">fewer doctors and hospital beds</a> than most of the developed world, gambled that it could postpone a lockdown and the mass production of testing kits and protective gear and gambled it could get away with putting an after-dinner funster from the comedy corner of the <em>Telegraph</em>\u2019s comment pages in Downing Street.</p> <p>Millions gather at their windows to <a href=\"https://clapforourcarers.co.uk/\">applaud the frontline staff</a> fighting the virus. The organisers say they are clapping \u201chealthcare workers, emergency services, armed services, delivery drivers, shop workers, teachers\u201d and so on, through to vets. Nowhere are home and residential care staff mentioned.</p> <p>So what, some might say. Banning visits is a necessary measure to contain the danger. It might be if the rest of the care system were not a lethal trap. Stories of the army finding the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/spain-distributes-650000-testing-kits-as-coronavirus-deaths-rise-steeply\">dead abandoned in their beds</a> that make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end have come out of Spanish old people\u2019s homes. We\u2019re not there, but no one should be surprised if the system buckled. It could barely cope before.</p> <p>Compare it with the NHS and you see why social care is an unexploded bomb. We need care workers but we have treated them with contempt. There is no job security for large numbers of workers on zero-hours contracts. Staff turnover is rapid, vacancy rates are high and <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2019/08/average-pay-for-care-workers\">average hourly pay rates</a> are below those of supermarket workers. We\u2019ve dumped the elderly on a workforce, which has an alarming proportion of staff with no relevant social care qualification. \u201cThe point has arguably been reached,\u201d the Centre for Health and the Public Interest thinktank <a href=\"https://chpi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CHPI-SocialCare-Oct16-Proof01a.pdf\">concluded</a>, \u201cwhere it is no longer a feasible ambition for a care worker to acquire skills and pursue a stable career.\u201d Indeed not. The pay differential between care workers with less than one year\u2019s experience and those with more than 20 is 15p an hour.</p> <p>When cowed workers meet a global crisis, the result is dire. Care workers are cannon fodder. Despite government promises, they are <a href=\"https://www.unison.org.uk/news/2020/03/care-workers-put-risk-lack-face-masks-basic-safety-kit-says-unison/\">telling their union</a>, Unison, that they have not received the kit they need to safeguard elderly clients in the highest of high-risk groups, and indeed themselves and their families. Workers on zero-hours contracts who don\u2019t turn up don\u2019t get paid. Unison\u2019s Gavin Edwards tells me that the pressure on staff cannot be imagined by people with secure employment in the NHS and other workplaces governed by proper procedures and union agreements. Union members tell of <a href=\"https://www.unison.org.uk/news/2020/03/care-workers-put-risk-lack-face-masks-basic-safety-kit-says-unison/\">pushy employers</a> who don\u2019t give a damn about the dangers. Managers were suggesting \u201cwe take our children in if we can\u2019t find childcare,\u201d said one.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When cowed workers meet a global crisis, the result is predictably dire. Care workers are cannon fodder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/02/uk-care-home-bosses-threaten-quit-over-return-coronavirus-patients\">employers are demonstrating</a> that we do not have a national care service to match the NHS. They are refusing to take patients who might have the virus. You see their point. It is impossible to maintain social distancing with confused older people. But this refusal illustrates a wider danger. There are <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5941057be5274a5e4e00023b/care-homes-market-study-update-paper.pdf\">5,500</a> small companies running homes or providing domestic care workers to councils. Ministers cannot compel them to make best use of their beds or concentrate staff where they are most needed. If Britain had set out to design a care system less able to cope with a national emergency, it couldn\u2019t have done a worse job.</p> <p>Here we come to the final gamble. The chaotic state of social care for the elderly exists in a Britain dominated by older people. It\u2019s almost a cliche for journalists and academics to say that, as life expectancy has risen, western countries have become gerontocracies. The voting power of the old dominates politics. It delivered Donald Trump, Brexit and Tory governments. When the Conservatives were acting with the utmost cruelty towards benefit claimants of working age, they didn\u2019t dare touch pensioners\u2019 benefits. They increased them, as they knew that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/21/age-not-class-is-what-divides-british-voters-most\">age is now a stronger determinant</a> of how voters vote than class. The 2017 general election reminded politicians they could never go against grey power. Theresa May refused to commit to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39960309\">the triple lock</a> on pensions and said that pensioners who could afford it must <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/22/theresa-may-u-turn-on-dementia-tax-cap-social-care-conservative-manifesto\">pay for social care</a>, just as graduates who can afford it must pay for a university education. The uproar forced May into an abject retreat and nearly lost her the election.</p> <p>The gamble that older voters have taken is that they may not need social care and so shouldn\u2019t be asked to pay extra. Or that if they hold out, Britain will fund it out of general taxation on the young and middle aged, who have already been loaded with vast debts that are growing every day that this crisis continues.</p> <p>The result is a care \u201csystem\u201d that isn\u2019t a system and could be a virus super-spreader. As with so many other gambles Britain has taken, it looks as if the casino is ready to rake in the chips.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Lockdown in Spain to be extended</h2> <p>The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, is set to ask parliament to extend lockdown restrictions by more than two weeks. Most Spanish people have been in lockdown for three weeks so far, with the measures expected to be extended until 26 April. Spain has the second highest death toll in the world, at 11,744, after Italy, which has 14,681.</p> <h2>Italian death toll reaches 15,000</h2> <p>The number of deaths from the coronavirus in Italy has passed 15,000. On Saturday, the country registered 681 deaths from Covid-19, 86 less than Friday, bringing the total to 15,362 \u2013 the highest death toll in the world.</p> <h2>China to send 1,000 ventilators to New York</h2> <p>A thousand ventilators will arrive in New York\u2019s JFK airport from China on Saturday, New York governor Andrew Cuomo has said. He thanked the country in a press conference, saying it would make a significant difference. In the UK, the government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing revealed that 300 ventilators had arrived in Britain from China on Saturday.</p> <h2>German daily cases fall slightly</h2> <p>The number of confirmed cases in Germany has increased by 6,082 in the last 24 hours, a slight decrease on the day before. The reduction, down from 6,174, has prompted \u201ccautious hope\u201d that the infection is beginning to level off.</p> <h2>France overtakes China in number of cases</h2> <p>Confirmed cases of coronavirus in France have exceeded those in China, reaching 83,031. China, where the outbreak originated, has recorded 82,543 cases, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</p> <h2>UAE to postpone Expo 2020</h2> <p>The United Arab Emirates has requested to postpone the start of the Expo 2020 Dubai until October 2021, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The six-month event was due to begin on 20 October this year.</p> <h2>Portugal and South Korea pass 10,000 cases each</h2> <p>In Portugal, the number of confirmed cases has reached 10,524, closely followed by South Korea at 10,156. Portugal has so far seen 266 deaths, and South Korea 177, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.emilymandel.com/\">Emily St John Mandel</a> is a Canadian novelist now residing in New York. Her fourth novel, the<em> </em> dystopian fiction of <em>Station Eleven</em>, propelled her to fame in 2014. It was a bestseller in both the UK and the US, winning the Arthur C Clarke award for science fiction, and nominations for the National Book Award and the Pen/Faulkner award. Her new novel is <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-glass-hotel-9781509882809.html\">The Glass Hotel</a></em>.</p> <p><em><strong>The </strong></em><em><strong>Glass Hotel</strong></em><strong> centres on </strong><strong> </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>2008</strong><strong> financial crash. Why was that a period you wanted to explore?<br></strong>It\u2019s a period in recent history that I remember so vividly. It was such an unsettling, chaotic time. In particular, I was fascinated by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bernard-madoff\">Bernie Madoff</a> story. <em>The Glass Hotel</em> is not about Bernie Madoff or his staff, his family or his investors. But it is the same crime in the novel. Madoff almost seemed like the embodiment of that era. There was such popular rage directed against him because we thought our economies were solid and it turned out to be something of a house of cards. And here was this fabulously wealthy conman who\u2019d been gambling with retirement savings.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s not Madoff\u2019s story but your protagonist, </strong><strong>Jonathan Alkaitis</strong><strong>, is a very similar character. What is it about that personality type that interested you?<br></strong>The compartmentalisation. We all compartmentalise to some extent: you\u2019re a different person at work than you are at home, a different person with your family than with acquaintances. But to be able to split your life in that way: to devote your professional energies to running a massive fraud and at the same time be a husband and a friend and a father. There\u2019s something fascinating in that to me.</p> <p><strong>The life of Jonathan\u2019s fake trophy wife inside \u201cthe kingdom of money\u201d is vacuous and unfulfilling. Was that your starting point?</strong><br>It was partly a desire to write about money as its own country. I think if you live with an enormous amount of money, that puts you in a very different world, with its own customs and mores. You see it most vividly at the airport: there are first-class lounges, and a first-class section on the plane. But at different levels of money, they\u2019re no longer on the same plane. They\u2019re in their private jets.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'd always wanted to write a ghost story. It's a genre that I love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Ghostliness and hauntings permeate the novel</strong><strong>. Would you describe </strong><strong>it as a ghost story?</strong><br>Absolutely. It\u2019s funny \u2013 I set out to write a book that was quite narrowly focused on the collapse and aftermath of a massive Ponzi scheme but by the end I\u2019d written a ghost story wherein a Ponzi scheme was just one element. The truth is that I\u2019d always wanted to write a ghost story. It\u2019s a form that I love.</p> <p><strong>Reinvention and transformation are strong themes. It seems that for some characters it\u2019s a strength, but for others a way to avoid reality and their own demons</strong><strong>.<br></strong>Yes, I think that generally speaking a capacity for reinvention is wonderful. Often that can take the form of resilience when someone\u2019s life is not going particularly well. To have the courage to do something completely different: I think that\u2019s usually admirable. But sometimes that can just be an escape hatch.</p> <p><strong>Your previous novel, </strong><em><strong>Station Eleven</strong></em><strong>, featured a global pandemic \u2013 </strong><strong>Georgia Flu</strong><strong>. In light of the coronavirus, does the novel now seem worryingly prescient?<br></strong>It doesn\u2019t, but only because I read so much about pandemics when I was writing it. This is not to make light of pandemics at all \u2013 it\u2019s a terrible situation \u2013 but this is just something that happens from time to time in human history. There have been pandemics before and there will be again.

It\u2019s an old novel \u2013 it came out in 1960 \u2013 and it\u2019s about the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. It\u2019s a very sharp, beautifully written work. It\u2019s somewhat haunting and I read it when I was 15 years old and it\u2019s stayed with me in a very vivid way.</p> <p><strong>What about your favourite ghost story?<br></strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/31/sarah-waters-the-little-stranger\">The Little Stranger</a></em> by Sarah Waters.

Also Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky \u2013 her most famous novel is <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/26/fiction.features\">Suite Francaise</a></em>, which was not finished when she was arrested by the Nazis and died at Auschwitz. But even as an incomplete novel it\u2019s a masterpiece of lucidity and clarity, and I\u2019m always writing towards that prose style. And also an American novelist named Dan Chaon: he does really interesting things with structure and genre that I admire.</p> <p><strong>Which novelists working today do you admire </strong><strong>most?<br></strong>Those who are doing really interesting things with the form \u2013 pushing it forward in some way. So Ali Smith is one of my very favourites. And on this side of the Atlantic I would also say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/24/jennifer-egan-quantum-leap-manhattan-beach-visit-from-the-goon-squad\">Jennifer Egan</a>: her novel <em>A Visit from the Goon Squad</em> was hugely influential for me in the boldness of its structure.</p> <p><strong>What kind of reader were you as a child?<br></strong>I was a voracious reader. My family never had much money but we did have an incredible number of books so I just read my way through my parents\u2019 book collection. I\u2019m sure it was often quite inappropriate but I read everything.</p> <p><strong>Which books and authors have stayed with you since childhood?<br></strong>Susan Cooper\u2019s series <em>The Dark </em><em>Is Rising</em>. Nobody in the US has ever heard of her but I thought she was wonderful. Also <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> and the Tolkien books \u2013 the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> cycle.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the last really great book you read?<br></strong><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-bluest-eye-9780099759911.html\">The Bluest Eye</a></em> by Toni Morrison \u2013 it\u2019s a masterpiece.</p> <p><strong>What</strong><strong>\u2019s on your bedside table to read next?<br></strong>Ronan Farrow\u2019s book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/20/catch-and-kill-ronan-farrow-review\">Catch and Kill</a></em> \u2013 I\u2019m looking forward to that very much.</p> <p><strong>Which literary figures \u2013 dead or alive \u2013 would you most like to meet?</strong><br>I would love to meet Alice Munro. She was friends with my grandmother years and years ago. My grandmother\u2019s been dead for 25 years but she used to talk about Alice. I\u2019d love to meet Munro to talk about her work, which I love, but also to ask if she remembered my grandmother.</p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/emily-st-john-mandel/the-glass-hotel/9781509882809\">The Glass Hotel</a></em> by Emily St John Mandel is published by Pan Macmillan in ebook and audio formats on 30 April and in hardback on 6 August (\u00a314.99)</p>",
  "<p>With all the serious issues surrounding coronavirus, it feels surreal and distasteful to be encouraged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/03/matt-hancock-deflecting-blame-on-to-footballers-andros-townsend-crystal-palace-premier-league-pay-cuts\">focus our ire</a> on the stereotype of, so it goes, greedy, selfish, over-paid footballers.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said: \u201cGiven the sacrifices that many people are making, including some of my colleagues in the NHS who have made the ultimate sacrifice... I think the first thing that Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52142267\">take a pay cut</a> and play their part.\u201d Shame on you, Mr Hancock: coronavirus should not be used as an excuse for a crass, inappropriate stand-off between footballers and tragically dead NHS workers.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that top-flight football has been above criticism during the pandemic. Clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United have been rightly censured for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/02/pay-cuts-furlough-or-deferrals-what-are-the-premier-league-clubs-doing\">taking advantage</a> of the government\u2019s furloughing scheme, allowing taxpayers to pick up the bill for cleaners, security, shop workers and catering staff, leading to accusations of a \u201cmoral vacuum\u201d.</p> <p>The Premier League has now asked players, via the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, to take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/03/premier-league-clubs-will-ask-players-to-take-30-per-cent-wage-drop-cuts-deferrals\">a 30% drop in pay</a>, in terms of cuts and wage referrals, while the 20 top clubs will <a href=\"https://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/pl-in-pound125m-advance-for-efl-clubs/178891?aff=1197317997&amp;dcmp=SL_TWITTER_PREMIERLEAGUE\">donate \u00a3125m</a> to the English Football League and National League and \u00a320m to support the NHS, communities and vulnerable groups.</p> <p>I sincerely hope that even more good is done and more selflessness displayed. However, it was still unfair to frame this as footballers needing to be morally shamed into action because players don\u2019t control how wages are paid. Such framing pitted \u201cordinary\u201d people against not just football \u2013 in terms of big business \u2013 but individual players.</p> <p>And, you think: why are footballers \u2013 young, self-made sportsmen - in particular getting stick and not, say, far <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8183763/Sell-one-yachts-Outrage-billionaire-Sir-Philip-Green-asks-taxpayer-help.html\">wealthier global businessman</a>, several of whom have held their hands out for government assistance?</p> <p>To me, this reeks of deep-rooted class prejudice. Overwhelmingly, footballers tend to come from poorer backgrounds, often extremely poor in the case of overseas players. This means that, as much as the players are idolised, they also find themselves routinely attacked for being greedy, arrogant and \u201cjumped up\u201d.</p> <p>Of course Premier League players are overpaid, but people forget that, in days gone by, clubs took much of the money and footballers were lucky to end up with a pub and a drink problem when their careers were over. But an archaic resentment towards players persists and while, generally, it\u2019s lighthearted (\u201cHe\u2019s paid <em>how much</em> and he misses a penalty?\u201d), at other times, like now, it has a real danger of turning rancid.</p> <p>This is what Hancock seemed to be doing with his comment \u2013 taking an easy shot at \u201crich\u201d, \u201cspoilt\u201d footballers, perhaps to deflect attention from the government\u2019s own failings. What an insult to those brave NHS workers who made the ultimate sacrifice.</p> <h2>Modern romance was ruined long before coronavirus</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e38ecaf6816818d0a9b6c77cb66d790cbdf370c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e38ecaf6816818d0a9b6c77cb66d790cbdf370c9/0_153_4578_2747/1000..jpg\" alt=\"the tinder app logo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018For too many women, this has turned out to be the romance model that never <em>starts</em> giving.

More seriously, as tricky and awful as the situation is, don\u2019t many people find online dating difficult and unfulfilling at the best of times \u2013 if somebody wants a relationship and not just a hook-up?</p> <p>Sexual emancipation is a wonderful thing, but both parties must agree. Since the online dating boom, too often it has seemed that women in particular have been dealing with dating on uber-sexualised male terms \u2013 where sex is the main objective, and relationships have become rare and disposable.</p> <p>For too many women, this has turned out to be the romance model that never <em>starts</em> giving.

Put bluntly, it\u2019s about facilitating commitment phobia. For some, this works well and good luck to them. For others, it leads to misery and the tedium of dealing with weaponised time-wasters.</p> <p>Has online dating played fair with people who ultimately want relationships? Obviously, there are safety issues in meeting strangers. Away from that, while casual sex has its place, I sympathise with anyone who dislikes the modern romantic-sexual landscape, but gets labelled prudish if they complain. So, sure, modern romance is tricky in the time of coronavirus, but some might argue that online love is also a nightmare.</p> <h2>So Harry can\u2019t pop over to granny\u2019s.

  "<p>If the familiar list of the most influential fashion figures is beginning to sound predictable \u2013 sorry Anna, sorry Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 meet someone who wields no less influence but is not (yet) a household name: Elizabeth von der Goltz.</p> <p>As the global buying director for <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/\" title=\"\">Net-a-Porter</a>, the world\u2019s largest multibrand luxury retailer, von der Goltz is to fashion what a conductor is to the orchestra: everyone looks to her to see what\u2019s coming next. Her role is to scout, source and nurture brands and designers (from established to emerging, in everything from lingerie to sportswear); cut deals in order sell their designs; and to do everything she can to support the brand and its sales. That\u2019s the basic outline. In reality, her job is a task of titanic proportions.</p> <p>Von der Goltz\u2019s much-coveted position demands a nose for new talent and a finely honed instinct for trends \u2013 clothes as well as concepts \u2013 years before they materialise. And she must do that with the conviction of someone unfazed by the multi-million-pound budgets she is responsible for, and the confidence of someone who understands the cultural differences between the 170 countries that Net-a-Porter serves. </p> <p>She is fashion\u2019s formidable silent force, yet on every occasion I\u2019ve encountered her \u2013 whether navigating an army of street-style photographers fighting to get her picture in the rain, or being delayed for two hours on board a London-Milan flight and missing countless appointments \u2013 she is never anything but calm, cool and approachable, with a mega-watt smile.</p> <p>Little wonder she is a part of a wave of retail directors attracting attention. Whereas in the past these roles remained relatively under the radar outside of the fashion industry, they are now basking in widespread recognition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfff9484821802a27b2bd1c355b45b6dd7058907\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfff9484821802a27b2bd1c355b45b6dd7058907/0_154_3296_1976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth von der Goltz with Alexa Chung\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Brands \u2013 even big designers \u2013 come to me for advice\u201d: Elizabeth von der Goltz, pictured with Alexa Chung.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt really has changed. I don\u2019t know if any of us anticipated it. I didn\u2019t,\u201d laughs von der Goltz, 46, who has nearly 25 years\u2019 experience. \u201cI think people didn\u2019t understand before. Even when I was in school, I didn\u2019t think about how fashion gets into the store. Now people are thinking: \u2018Who\u2019s behind it? Who are these people?\u2019 And it\u2019s not just fashion. People are so much more interested in what happens behind the scenes.\u201d</p> <p>Von der Goltz\u2019s recent appearance on the Netflix hit <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/29/next-in-fashion-review-alexa-chung-and-tan-frances-outrageously-ott-reality-tv\" title=\"\">Next in Fashion</a></em>, which saw 10 fledgling designers battle it out to win a $250,000 prize and sell their collections on Net-a-Porter, is one of the many ways the veil is being lifted. As a guest judge on the series finale, von der Goltz was arguably the most important person on the panel. The cash prize might sound impressive, but becoming a success on her product pages affords a designer the widespread recognition necessary to make them several times the prize money and validates everything they\u2019ve worked for. On the flipside, if a designer isn\u2019t ready, it could spell catastrophe.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge consideration,\u201d says von der Goltz, her chirpy American accent placing the emphasis on huge. \u201cAt Net-a-Porter we have three warehouses we ship to around the world \u2013 London, New York and Hong Kong \u2013 so even when we\u2019re buying a small buy, it\u2019s actually huge! We can make or break a brand and so we have a responsibility to help them develop and evolve, because we almost change the structure of their company just by asking them to complete our order.\u201d She compares it to a marriage: \u201cYou have to believe that they\u2019re ready to build a business, because then we\u2019re in it for a long time.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It takes instinct, taste and creativity to set the trends</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Von der Goltz has form for placing her bets wisely. By her own humble admission she has been \u201cextremely influential\u201d for years. Before taking the top job at the London-based juggernaut in 2017, von der Goltz was the designer buyer for 16 years at Fifth Avenue landmark store Bergdorf Goodman, where, she says, \u201cbrands \u2013 even big designers \u2013 would come to me for advice\u201d.</p> <p>Far from just selling fashion, she is responsible for the existence of fashion houses. The founders of <a href=\"https://monse.com/index.php/\" title=\"\">Monse</a>, who are also creative directors at Oscar de la Renta, first came to von der Goltz with sketches \u2013 now it\u2019s one of New York fashion week\u2019s highlights. She persuaded Valentino to start producing the pre-fall and cruise collections. \u201cI told them, work with me, we need this delivery. If it works, I\u2019m totally happy for you to sell it to the rest of the world,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it\u2019s huge business!\u201d</p> <p>What von der Goltz gives out in support, she gets back tenfold. Vincent Ho, co-founder of the avant-garde New York collective <a href=\"https://peterdo.net/\" title=\"\">Peter Do</a>, which started on Instagram, calls her a fairy godmother. \u201cShe works for Net-a-Porter, but she\u2019s really helpful to our brand \u2013 telling us what to look out for,\u201d Ho says. \u201cShe\u2019s always accessible \u2013 whether it\u2019s through an Instagram DM, an email, or a text, she\u2019s willing to help us at any given moment. And she\u2019s so personable,\u201d Ho says with a hint of mischief. \u201cShe responds to stories; she talks about food \u2013 she\u2019s one of us.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Von der Goltz has</strong></em> had a front row seat not just to every fashion show but at every major fashion evolution for the best part of the last two decades \u2013 and right now is no different. Her arrival at Net-a-Porter also coincided with one of the most polarising eras in fashion, with the spotlight on sustainability highlighting the unmanageable volume of clothing in the world.</p> <p>Federico Marchetti, CEO of Net-a-Porter, told <em><a href=\"https://wwd.com/\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s Wear Daily </a></em>in December that its 10 distribution centres worldwide total \u201calmost 100 soccer fields in eight countries\u201d. While a buyer plays a key role in an industry that has been heavily criticised for creating and selling too much stuff, von der Goltz is characteristically articulate and informed. \u201cThe customer doesn\u2019t need to choose between style or sustainability any longer \u2013 they can now have both,\u201d she tells me over email after our call. \u201cThe product we buy \u2013 and therefore what our customers buy \u2013 is particularly important as the production of fashion and textiles has a significant impact on the welfare of people and ecosystems.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96a3f429d5ce2878033b6bda1b9b32d3f9dde79a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96a3f429d5ce2878033b6bda1b9b32d3f9dde79a/267_444_2846_4400/647.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth von der Goltz crossing a road in New York wearing multi-coloured plaid trousers and a white T-shirt\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street style: in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Vierig/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On her watch, Net-a-Porter has launched two things she is passionate about: the Vanguard programme, which gives new designers access to the entire company, including legal, marketing and business development teams; and Net Sustain, which platforms community, craft and locally sourced products. Putting sustainability at the top of the agenda is integral to any buyer\u2019s reputation right now: \u201cOur aim is to give a voice to the brands on site, big or small, that are truly making positive changes by providing them with a platform to highlight their best practice.\u201d She points to \u201cthe advancement of data, AI and VR capabilities\u201d increasingly aiding the buyer\u2019s role in the future.</p> <p>Von der Goltz is good at adapting. Born in New York, her family were globetrotters \u2013 her father was in private equity, her mother an art gallerist. Tokyo, London and then Hong Kong called, where she grew up with her older brother and went to the German-Swiss school. An art history degree in Washington DC followed, including an internship at Christie\u2019s in London. A career in art was not for her, she discovered, but the formative years and inherited talents for business and creativity proved invaluable.</p> <p>\u201cYou really have to have two sides of the brain to be a buyer, because so much of the work is financial and analytical. We have to grow our business double digits year on year. But the other side takes a lot of instinct, taste and creativity, because you\u2019re the one setting the trends of what people are buying.\u201d Note that this is always at least six months in advance, so there\u2019s no temperature- taking from the style on the street.</p> <p>After Hong Kong, on the advice of a friend who worked at the legendary fashion boutique <a href=\"https://www.joyce.com/\" title=\"\">Joyce</a>, von der Goltz relocated to New York to pursue her love of fashion. After landing a temping position at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/22/barneys-new-york-closing-luxury-industry\" title=\"\">Barneys</a> (\u201cIt was my Mecca!\u201d) she put her head down and eventually became an assistant buyer in the \u201cprivate label\u201d area of the store, which at the time was designed by Dutch designer Ronald Van Der Kemp. It was 1997 \u2013 and the break she needed.</p> <p>\u201cIn that role, you didn\u2019t just buy, you started from complete scratch; everything from ordering the sample fabric to the finish of a garment. It was a great place to start, because I learned so much about fabrication, how much fabric it takes to make a jacket, production in Italy, all of that. I feel fabrics now and designers say, \u2018This is expensive because it comes from this mill\u2019, and I\u2019m like: \u2018I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d931e0ac4c4d74217d9200da1b1ca34edfb36382\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d931e0ac4c4d74217d9200da1b1ca34edfb36382/631_274_2573_4726/544.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth von der Goltz wearing a light blue long dress, white boots, neon green bag and blue vinyl coat, in Paris\" width=\"544\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big mac: at Paris fashion week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Lavenia/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After working her way up through Barneys, a brief spell at the now closed New York institution Henri Bendel, and her nearly two decades at Bergdorf\u2019s, von der Goltz was already an industry authority \u2013 especially when it came to what makes a good buyer.</p> <p>Being an excellent negotiator is mandatory: \u201cWe negotiate down to the core with each of our brands \u2013 it\u2019s all about margin and probability, so you have to have that leadership voice in the industry.\u201d</p> <p>You also need to have a great world view. \u201cI love people with a liberal arts background who read fiction, watch movies, travel, love art and architecture, because so much of what we\u2019re doing is influenced by the culture around us. The customer is global, so you have to understand who she is, what\u2019s she doing every day; when she\u2019s travelling; what she\u2019s seeing, what her hobbies are.\u201d</p> <p>When in London, where she is based full-time now with her husband Andreas, she practises what she preaches. In between managing a team of 50, relentless schedules of back-to-back meetings and round-the-world attendances at London, Milan, Paris, Shanghai, Copenhagen, Seoul, Sydney and Tbilisi fashion weeks, she keeps her finger on the pulse.</p> <p><em><strong>As for what</strong></em> the woman who presents women with what to wear wears, von der Goltz looks forward to getting dressed every day and brushes off any suggestion of pressure \u2013 even if she is becoming one of fashion\u2019s most photographed people. \u201cI innately love fashion!\u201d she enthuses. \u201cI love clothes \u2013 even when I\u2019m doing Pilates or I\u2019m in the mountains, I have an idea of how I want to look in my head.\u201d Favourites include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/12/gabriela-hearst-war-on-waste-upends-the-fashion-process\" title=\"\">Gabrie</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/12/gabriela-hearst-war-on-waste-upends-the-fashion-process\" title=\"\">la Hearst</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2011/nov/15/joseph-altuzarra\" title=\"\">Altuzarra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.net-a-porter.com/gb/en/Shop/Designers/Citizens_of_Humanity?cm_mmc=GoogleUK--c-_-NAP_EN_UK_London-_-NAP+-+INTL+-+London+-+Designer_Citizens+of+Humanity+-+BT--Citizens+of+Humanity+-+Alone+-+Exact-_-citizens%20of%20humanity_e_kwd-147101016_INTL&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw3-bzBRBhEiwAgnnLCr31kmHdvqvC1foBPvLtjSiaSZpdYuHsFVSVuwudvKyUrv3R46YfehoCLTAQAvD_BwE&amp;pn=1&amp;npp=60&amp;image_view=product&amp;dScroll=0\" title=\"\">Citizens of Humanity</a> and, of course, Peter Do, which give her what she calls a mix of high and low.

First up: money doesn\u2019t necessarily buy you style. \u201cThere is not a defined way of saying someone has style or not \u2013 if you have the money, you have access, but there are so many people out there with the most amazing style wearing clothes from the high street.\u201d Second, there are no rules. \u201cThe world has changed so much that\u2019s it\u2019s not about trends dictating any more, so you can express yourself,\u201d she says. But maybe look for her cue, too.</p>",
  "<p>I fully encourage people to dance on the furniture in my home and have a good time,\u201d says graphic artist and photographer Zoe Zimmer of her Victorian terrace ground-floor garden flat in Notting Hill, London.</p> <p>\u201cI really love cooking for friends and having parties,\u201d she says, \u201cand, although I want the place to be beautiful and well presented, it\u2019s important to enjoy it, too, and not be precious about it.\u201d</p> <p>A chrome Tom Dixon mirror ball pendant glimmers on the ceiling of the dark, inky entrance hall, painted in Farrow &amp; Ball\u2019s Railings.

In the main bedroom a showstopper mirrored wall acts as a backdrop for an Allen Jones screenprint from the 1973 film <em>La Ma\u00eetresse</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s mounted there with cement-like adhesive in case it falls down,\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>Zimmer is an interiors illusionist. Her clever configuration of furniture and the placement and mix of objects in the open-plan kitchen, living and dining area both defines and connects the space, while mirror trickery gives the impression of infinite space. Behind two reupholstered luxe-velvet cream swivel chairs in the living area, opulent floor-to-ceiling mirrored shelving houses her collection of art prints, books and white 1960s sci-fi Foglio wall lights by Tobias Scarpa from vintage marketplace <a href=\"https://www.pamono.co.uk/italian-foglio-wall-lights-by-tobia-scarpa-for-flos-1966-set-of-2\" title=\"\">Pamono</a>. In the narrow galley kitchen, to which Zimmer added panelled cabinetry painted in Farrow &amp; Ball\u2019s Minster Green, another mirrored wall adds depth. A dividing white marble counter regularly doubles as a bar (the cupboard underneath is fully stocked with spirits).</p> <p>The flat was an unfinished renovation project when Zimmer bought it in 2015. All the structural work had been completed, but there were few fixtures or fittings in place. Original features, such as the ornate cornices, remained, as did the fireplace, which she transformed into an expression of decadence by simply adding a black marble base. She also installed black lacquered floorboards throughout, to set the mood at night. \u201cThe upkeep on them during the day is a little more than I bargained for,\u201d she says. \u201cSo much dust!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cb068fb4c47a77c4d21f57ae74f48a92bb95aff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb068fb4c47a77c4d21f57ae74f48a92bb95aff/0_0_4480_5407/829.jpg\" alt=\"Mirrored wall in a bedroom with a film poster for La Ma\u00eetresse mounted on it.\" width=\"829\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Backdrop: the mirrored wall in her bedroom with a film poster for La Ma\u00eetresse mounted on it.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Batchelor/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI loved the place immediately, as it felt like a mini version of where I grew up \u2013 I\u2019ve always lived in Notting Hill. I just had to decorate it from scratch, which was my dream.\u201d</p> <p>Having access to her own private garden via French doors from the small studio-cum-spare room at the back of the property also helped seal the deal, says Zoe, who is the daughter of the composer Hans Zimmer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Zimmer\u2019s home is a homage to mirrored walls \u2013 think more Studio 54, less Stringfellows</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>High ceilings also help to make the flat feel deceptively spacious and allow for statement lighting, including a bubble pendant by George Nelson. \u201cI love looking at old interior magazines, like <em>Architectural Digest</em> from the 1980s, and I saw a photo of a light just like this in the <a href=\"https://eamesfoundation.org/house/eames-house/\" title=\"\">Eames House</a>,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was suspended from a very long cable and I loved it, so I wanted to try and replicate the look in my own living space.\u201d</p> <p>An orange velvet <a href=\"https://www.habitat.co.uk/hendricks-orange-velvet-2-seater-sofa-289803\" title=\"\">Hendricks sofa from Habitat</a>, and an emerald green <a href=\"https://www.therugcompany.com/uk/designers/diane-von-furstenberg/climbing-leopard.html\" title=\"\">Climbing Leopard</a><a href=\"https://www.therugcompany.com/uk/designers/diane-von-furstenberg/climbing-leopard.html\" title=\"\"> rug</a> by Diane von Furstenberg, bought in the US, are both rare nods to bright colour in the otherwise softened monochrome scheme.

  "<p>Every sector of the British economy is suffering and asking the government to do more. Such is the scale of the economic hit that the country is facing from the coronavirus pandemic that even the widening of the government\u2019s bailout last week has failed to assuage business leaders\u2019 concerns.</p> <p>The travel industry is seeking a relaxation of consumer protection rules, charities say they face a \u00a34bn shortfall amid rocketing demand for their services, and Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic says it needs a multi-million pound rescue package. Even in normal times such requests would pose a quandary for governments. But now they are flooding in at once.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, the chancellor was forced to update the government\u2019s rescue plan last week. Sunak said he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/130k-inquiries-1k-loans-why-uk-government-had-to-tweak-help-for-small-firms\">prevent banks from requesting personal guarantees for emergency loans</a> to small businesses and would extend the reach of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-promises-to-guarantee-330bn-loans-to-business\">\u00a3330bn coronavirus business interruption loan scheme </a>\u2013 under which the government offers interest-free 12-month loans.</p> <p>Larger firms not currently eligible for loans \u2013 the so-called \u201csqueezed middle\u201d of this crisis who were too big for the small-firms schemes but not large enough for the major bailout loans \u2013 would benefit from a new scheme under which the government would provide a guarantee of 80% so that banks could make loans of up to \u00a325m to firms with an annual turnover of between \u00a345m and \u00a3500m.</p> <p>Business lobby groups backed the upgrades to the rescue plan, albeit with a warning that the small print should not prove a barrier to firms accessing vital funds. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cThe announcement of a new loan scheme for mid-sized companies closes a significant gap in existing support.\u201d</p> <p>However, for some sectors it is not just a question of accessible finance. Travel firms said the difference between staying afloat and going bust could be changes to regulations as much as access to credit.</p> <p>Marc Vincent, the finance director of Newmarket Holidays, said the UK needs to follow the example of other EU governments, which have overturned consumer protection rules requiring travel firms to pay customer refunds within 14 days.</p> <p>Vincent said a switch to credit notes, which can be used to buy a holiday at a later date or redeemed for cash after two years, would protect hundreds of travel firms that have usually paid in advance for airline tickets and hotels that are also in lockdown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d892a22507e20f93f5e0e8e7683e9187c37313a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d892a22507e20f93f5e0e8e7683e9187c37313a/0_190_3000_1800/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Virgin Atlantic is campaigning for a multimillion-pound bailout.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virgin Atlantic is campaigning for a multimillion-pound bailout.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian  Schofield/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Travel firms are among many industries that have temporarily ceased their main operations, but have incurred higher costs in other areas after keeping staff working to answer customer calls or provide other services. It means they can only use the government\u2019s furlough scheme \u2013 which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">pays 80% of staff salaries</a> up to a cap of about \u00a325,000 to workers sent home \u2013 to subsidise the cost of some staff while others remain active on the company payroll.</p> <p>\u201cWhile a pub will close down and furlough everyone, we need extra people to handle cases, which in many cases are complicated and take longer to deal with,\u201d said Vincent.</p> <p>Kristy Elsmere, joint managing director of the coach company Woods Travel Group, said a legal change allowing the use of credit notes would be an important reform, even though most of the company\u2019s regular customers were accepting vouchers or re-booking trips later in the year.</p> <p>Referring to one industry-specific bailout announced last week, she said: \u201cSome coach companies also run buses and have benefited from the new \u00a3400m bus rescue scheme, so they will have some cash coming in from that. But we don\u2019t, so we need the government to look at the package travel arrangements and allow credit notes to be given to customers.\u201d</p> <p>Sunak agreed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/02/bus-firms-get-400m-bailout-to-maintain-services\">cover the losses of bus companies in England</a> over the next three months to ensure that services can still run.</p> <p>Bus industry executives lobbied the government after ministers advised people against all non-essential travel, and passenger numbers \u201cfell off a cliff\u201d. A \u00a3167m fund will ensure that bus companies can cover their costs on essential services so that key employees, such as NHS staff, can get to work. The funding, which adds to an existing \u00a3200m bus subsidy scheme, follows similar agreements in Scotland and Wales.</p> <p>Stagecoach, a key player in the industry, said on Friday that its local regional bus companies were currently seeing sales at about 15% of normal levels. The company, which will suspend it Megabus coaches between major towns and cities this weekend, said the new funding would mean \u201ckey workers can still get to and from work, and that communities can still access other services\u201d, such as shopping for food or picking up medicines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d60aa53a76e87a498204434f24d548a8565f902c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d60aa53a76e87a498204434f24d548a8565f902c/0_274_4287_2572/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Stagecoach has seen its coach ticket sales fall dramatically.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stagecoach has seen its coach ticket sales fall dramatically.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsmere, who chairs the coach industry insurance scheme, said private coaches also provided vital services that would be missed if firms were allowed to go bust. Stately homes, hotels, schools and charitable events depend on groups travelling by coach. \u201cPeople think it is just for pleasure, but it underpins so many businesses.\u201d</p> <p>Sunak and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, have argued the bus bailout was needed because firms such as Stagecoach provide vital infrastructure. A similar scheme to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/02/bus-firms-get-400m-bailout-to-maintain-services\">subsidise rail companies</a> \u2013 effectively ending the franchise system as we know it \u2013 was justified on that basis.</p> <p>This argument is not limited to bus, coach and rail companies. P&amp;O Ferries has argued that it can be described as vital infrastructure. Last week it asked the government for a \u00a3150m bailout after passenger numbers dried up. The company, which is owned by the Dubai firm DP World, operates more than 30,000 voyages a year in Europe and accounts for about 15% of Britain\u2019s trade. It said income from its 8.4 million passengers a year normally subsidises its income from freight lorries, but the lockdown has plunged it into a \u00a3250,000 daily loss.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/01/virgin-atlantic-bailout-backed-by-rolls-royce-airbus-and-heathrow\">seeking a bailout</a>, backed by lobbying from the aviation manufacturers Rolls-Royce and Airbus, who argue that Virgin is a major aircraft buyer and vital for the success of a key industry. Heathrow Airport, leader of another suffering sector, is also backing a Virgin bailout because the Branson-controlled airline is one of its main customers.</p> <p>Retail and steel, two sectors that were hurting even before the pandemic struck, are also desperate for help. The industry lobby group UK Steel told the Treasury the nation\u2019s steel companies were \u201cfast approaching a cashflow crisis\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d0844808d543793aa8eb24df6f6dd1c3e56b5b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d0844808d543793aa8eb24df6f6dd1c3e56b5b3/0_144_3196_1917/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak\u2019s loan scheme was heavily criticised, and has now been modified.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak\u2019s loan scheme was heavily criticised, and has now been modified.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Arcadia group is putting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/philip-green-asks-for-taxpayer-support-to-prop-up-arcadia\">14,500 staff on the government furlough scheme</a> in a bid to prop up his crumbling retail empire. Meanwhile, the Horticultural Trades Association warned the government that the sector, which includes hundreds of garden centres, was facing losses of \u00a3687m by the end of June.</p> <p>Energy companies, under pressure from cash-strapped households cancelling their monthly direct debt payments, have already asked the government to support a loan scheme worth up to \u00a3100m a month. Without the funds, the industry has warned it will struggle to offer payment holidays to businesses and households struggling to pay their energy bills.</p> <p>A spokesman for Energy UK, the industry lobby group, said; \u201cPeople are cancelling direct debits in increasing numbers. That\u2019s a problem for suppliers working on thin margins. It means there isn\u2019t the cushion needed to withstand an indefinite break by businesses and households in paying their bills.\u201d</p> <p>The chancellor is expected to hold the line this week and resist what he sees as special pleading from multiple sectors \u2013 even if some exceptional cases such as rail and buses are getting through. He will say his revamped loan scheme will allow all employers to access the funds they need to cope over the next few months.</p> <p>Success will probably rest on how well the banks and other commercial lenders understand his new proposals and allow firms to access the new loans. Time is short for many companies and they will need funds fast.</p> <p>Last week Sunak admitted that of 130,000 inquiries to access loans, only 1,000 had been agreed. Businesses will cheer if the reformed bailouts expand the rate of loan agreements. If the new efforts don\u2019t work, those calls for sector-specific bailouts will get much louder.</p>",
  "<p>The controversial practice of setting heather-covered moorland on fire \u2013 often carried out by gamekeepers to create more attractive habitats for grouse \u2013 is now banned on more than 30 major tracts of land in northern England. Three large landowners have confirmed that their tenants are no longer allowed to burn heather routinely.</p> <p>The ban is a blow to grouse shoots, which burn older heather to make way for younger, more nutritious plants for grouse to feed on, but environmental groups say the practice harms the environment. <a href=\"https://water.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2017/06/EMBER_full-report.pdf\">Research by the University of Leeds</a> has found that burning grouse moors degrades peatland habitat, releases climate-altering gases, reduces biodiversity and increases flood risk.</p> <p>Last year, the <em>Observer </em>reported that Yorkshire Water was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/22/grouse-shooting-yorkshire-water\"> reviewing each of its grouse-shooting leases</a> amid concerns about the practice of routine burning. The company says has written into its lease a presumption against burning as a land management technique.</p> <p>United Utilities is also altering its leases to shorter terms, with a similar review to Yorkshire Water\u2019s expected.

Braithwaite Hall said tenants required written consent to do so, and that it had taken legal action against one. Dark Peak said it retained complete control of burning practices on its land. Marsden said tenants could not carry out any burning.</p> <p>A National Trust spokeswoman said: \u201cWe don\u2019t allow burning on deep peat and over recent years have moved away from using controlled grouse-moor burning as a matter of course. There are a diminishing number of historic agreements where burning may occasionally be used but we are working with these tenants to introduce more sustainable land-management practice.\u201d</p> <p>Routine burning is now no longer allowed on 34 sections of moorland spanning Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire, according to BBYM. \u201cYorkshire Water, United Utilities and the National Trust are to be commended for ending routine burning of moorland,\u201d said Luke Steele of BBYM.</p> <p>Steele said there had been 550 incidents of grouse-moor burning recorded across Yorkshire since the burning season began in October. </p> <p>The environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, has promised to stop the practice. And the committee on climate change has recommended that a grouse-moor burning ban be introduced within the year. But owners of large grouse moors have threatened legal action if such a ban is introduced.</p> <p>The issue has been thrown into sharp relief by the coronavirus outbreak. Yorkshire Water and United Utilities have said that all burning on their land must now cease until further notice. The National Trust said: \u201cWe are keen to alleviate pressure on the emergency services, and are working with estate managers and tenants to ensure any burning is stopped immediately.\u201d</p> <p>The move follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/26/uk-landowners-told-to-stop-burning-moorland-after-yorkshire-blaze\">requests from </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/26/uk-landowners-told-to-stop-burning-moorland-after-yorkshire-blaze\">emergency services</a> and local councils, which fear that burning increases the risk of wildfires, and that fumes might affect people suffering from Covid-19.</p>",
  "<p>Scholarships have been threatened. LinkedIn and Facebook profiles have been removed. Death threats have been sent in their hundreds, if not thousands. And governments spurred into action. Since mid-March \u2013 when the government first recommended self-isolation measures as a way to tackle the spread of the world-altering respiratory disease Covid-19 \u2013 a public shaming frenzy has spread across social media. Thousands of people are blaming, naming, and shaming others for their improper pandemic practices; those targeted include <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/19/coronavirus-spring-break-party/\">drunk spring breakers</a>, coughing commuters, flower markets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/17/pop-stars-criticise-fans-over-coronavirus-inaction-billie-eilish-taylor-swift-ariana-grande-camila-cabello\">Stereophonics fans</a>, and romcom screenwriter Richard Curtis\u2019s daughter.</p> \n<p>When it comes to the crime of not taking a global pandemic seriously, perhaps online shaming is the perfect punishment. After all, if you go to a packed public place or hoard paracetamol, you\u2019re endangering other people\u2019s lives. Yet is pointing the finger actually a productive way to change others\u2019 behaviour? Are we simply spreading discord at an already distressing time? At worst, are we blaming individuals for the inconsistent and confused measures implemented by the government?</p> \n<p>The term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Covidiot\">covidiot</a>\u201d was first uploaded to the online slang decoder Urban Dictionary on 16 March and was defined as: \u201cSomeone who ignores the warnings regarding public health or safety.\u201d On Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/covidiot\">#covidiot</a> skyrocketed on the evening of 22 March; overnight, <a href=\"https://keyhole.co/hashtag-tracking/dashboard/3LmEQ9/covidiot?realtimePreview=true\">nearly 3,000 tweets</a> used it to call out poor practices. That same day, Hilda \u2013 a 49-year-old who runs the Facebook and Twitter accounts for Columbia Road flower market in east London \u2013 received an influx of notifications.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The worst was someone saying, \u2018I hope you and your family stay healthy and alive but sadly I doubt all of them will\u2019</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still feeling slightly traumatised by it,\u201d says Hilda, whose name has been changed on her request, after a BBC journalist tweeted a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dinosofos/status/1241697657690734593\">picture of the market</a>, which appeared heavily crowded despite social distancing rules. The picture was \u201cliked\u201d nearly 4,000 times, with commenters bemoaning the \u201cstupidity\u201d of those in attendance. Hilda began to receive angry comments, tweets, emails, and phone calls complaining that the market should be shut down. To make matters worse, the social media accounts she runs are for market shopkeepers, and she had no control over whether the market as a whole opened (that decision lay with the local council).</p> \n<p>\u201cThe worst thing I had to open and read was someone saying, \u2018I hope you and your family stay healthy and alive but sadly I doubt all of them will,\u2019\u201d Hilda says. \u201cThey were very vitriolic \u2026 The world feels really dark and horrible.\u201d A day later, after newspapers splashed pictures from Columbia Road and other markets, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, branded those who visited crowded places \u201cvery selfish\u201d \u2013 that evening, new lockdown measures were put in place by the government. Yet Hilda argues that, at the time, people hadn\u2019t broken any rules. \u201cThe government advice was if you\u2019re healthy, go outside and exercise\u2026 that\u2019s what people were doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hilda is far from the only person to be \u201cpandemic-shamed\u201d. On 16 March, activist Scarlett Curtis uploaded an Instagram video of herself washing her hands for nearly 30 seconds, and commenters complained she used an improper technique. \u201cPlease can we not shame anyone during this hard time,\u201d she countered. \u201cNow is the time for community not judgment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most egregious shaming came on 18 March, when CBS News tweeted a video of American spring breakers partying in Miami. In the video, drunk students flagrantly disregard social distancing recommendations, one declaring: \u201cIf I get corona, I get corona.\u201d The video was subtitled with the full names of every student interviewed.</p> \n<p>The clip was \u201cliked\u201d more than 96,000 times and was flooded with comments berating the students\u2019 appearances and intelligence. People began tweeting the students\u2019 names and linking to their social media profiles, writing: \u201cI have a feeling the following people will have a hard time finding a job upon graduation\u201d (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kate_m_mcg/status/1240465770569662465\">288 likes</a>) and \u201cHospitals take note of these names. Do not give these selfish dumbfucks beds and/or respirators\u201d (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/aldentanaka/status/1240410951045623808\">84 likes</a>). Some went further and contacted the students\u2019 schools, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macndemocracy/status/1240477462779195392\">one tweeter</a> asking for a student\u2019s scholarship to be rescinded (the same student later deleted their Facebook page).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65a9450f-4bec-4555-bdb0-c829a2782b42\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What do the restrictions involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible</li>\n     <li>One form of exercise a day \u2013 for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2013 alone or with members of your household</li>\n     <li>Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person</li>\n     <li>Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

And just three days earlier, internet shaming arguably had a productive outcome. After a Tennessee man received a barrage of angry comments for stockpiling 17,700 bottles of hand sanitiser to sell for inflated prices, he expressed remorse and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/technology/matt-colvin-hand-sanitizer-donation.html\">donated his stock to a local church.</a></p> \n<p>Shaming has also been used effectively to improve employees\u2019 lives during the pandemic: after Waterstones\u2019 chief executive, James Daunt, announced its stores would be staying open, an online backlash prompted him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/waterstones-staff-say-their-health-is-at-risk-as-stores-stay-open\">reverse the decision</a> within a day. The same happened to Sports Direct, while Wetherspoon\u2019s was shamed online and off (with branches graffitied) after its chairman, Tim Martin, claimed that he couldn\u2019t afford to pay staff. A tweet calling Martin a \u201ctwat\u201d gained more than 30,000 likes, and the pay decision was reversed after he met with hospitality experts.</p> \n<p>Yet pandemic shaming can also have dire consequences. On 18 March, the Polish press reported that a professor infected with coronavirus, Wojciech Rokita, died after being flooded with hateful <a href=\"https://kielce.wyborcza.pl/kielce/7,47262,25805201,kolejny-raz-zszedl-ze-sceny-niepokonany.html?disableRedirects=true\">online comments</a>. Rumours had spread \u2013 both online and in local media \u2013 that 54-year-old Rokita had not complied with his quarantine and had <a href=\"https://www.polsatnews.pl/wiadomosc/2020-03-18/nie-zyje-lekarz-zakazony-koronawirusem-mial-mierzyc-sie-z-nieprawdopodobnym-hejtem/\">visited a car showroom</a> after being diagnosed with coronavirus. On 19 March, a lawyer representing Rokita\u2019s family claimed the professor had not violated his quarantine, and had taken his own life as a result of the \u201cwave of hate\u201d he faced online.</p> \n<p>The story of the remorseful Tennessee hoarder is also less uplifting on second glance. The <em>New York Times</em> reported that the man received hate mail and death threats, with one stranger banging on his door late at night. \u201cYour behaviour is probably going to end up with someone killing you and your wife and your children,\u201d read one email. The man has also lost his livelihood \u2013 he is now banned from selling on eBay and Amazon, previously his sole form of income.</p> \n<p>It is hardly surprising that online shaming can have tragic consequences, but when it comes to coronavirus, you could argue that shamers endanger one person in order to save many more. Yet do the shamed actually change their minds as a result of hateful comments? Is shaming actually productive?</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat they were saying was absolutely outrageous,\u201d says Laura, a 17-year-old who received online hate after attending a Stereophonics gig in Manchester on 13 March (her name has been changed on her request). Laura emphasises that when she attended the concert, mass gatherings hadn\u2019t been banned by the government (although some artists had cancelled their gigs). \u201cI had people telling me I was going to kill people, someone private messaged me saying, \u2018I hope you feel great about yourself when you\u2019re the one who\u2019s killed your whole family,\u2019\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t change my mind, they didn\u2019t make me regret that I went,\u201d Laura goes on. She received the comments on a tweet she posted after the gig, and therefore notes: \u201cWhat they were saying was irrelevant because what had happened had already been and gone, so they couldn\u2019t have stopped me from going.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6397723a-89fe-4de7-80bc-982c5aa7f79f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JbvWniXcNhA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Three days earlier, 24-year-old Jardin May from Texas received a flood of comments after tweeting, \u201cCoronavirus is everywhere. BOOK THAT FLIGHT. Take that trip. You probably won\u2019t die from it, but even if you do \u2026 You wanna die with the Eiffel Tower in the background \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>May says some commenters educated her about coronavirus \u2013 those who were calm and polite taught her that she shouldn\u2019t be concerned about herself, but rather the elderly and vulnerable people she might infect. \u201cA lot of the stuff I know about coronavirus I didn\u2019t learn till the calmer people in the comments were like, \u2018Hey, just be careful\u2019,\u201d May says. \u201cBut Twitter took it and ran with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>A fortnight later, May is still receiving notifications from the tweet, and she is continually being branded \u201cfucking stupid and selfish\u201d, a \u201cbitch\u201d, \u201cmurderer\u201d, and a \u201cmoron\u201d. \u201cThey were extremely aggressive, they were like, \u2018Oh I hope your family dies\u2019; \u2018I hope you get sick and you die from it,\u2019\u201d May says of the initial messages she received. \u201cI did feel like a lot of people were wasting their breath, because if you\u2019re doing angry tweeting and cursing and threats, I\u2019m not gonna read it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The venom generated hasn\u2019t prevented the state from adopting online shaming during the coronavirus crisis. While individuals use it to police behaviour, now the actual police are using it to denounce members of the public. On 27 March, Derbyshire police released drone footage which labelled anonymous dog walkers and exercisers on the Peaks as indulging in outlawed \u201cnot essential\u201d travel. The former justice secretary, David Gauke, described the shaming as \u201cbadly misjudged\u201d.</p> \n<p>And last Sunday (29 March) after tweeting a photo of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/29/stephen-kinnock-targeted-by-police-for-visiting-father-neil\">physically distanced birthday visit</a> to his father Neil, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock was criticised by the South Wales police Twitter account \u2013 \u201cA lovely thing to do, however this is not essential travel.\u201d When Kinnock replied pointing out he had been delivering \u201cnecessary supplies\u201d, the force thanked him for the \u201cclarification\u201d. The Twittersphere was divided over whether this was a good use of police time.</p> \n<p>Dr June Tangney, a psychology professor at George Mason University, and author of <em><a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-00509-000\">Shame and Guilt</a></em>, doubts shaming will prevent poor pandemic behaviour. \u201cBy shaming people, we\u2019re actually encouraging the opposite,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen people feel shamed, they tend to get very defensive, they tend to blame other people, they\u2019re disinclined to take responsibility, and they\u2019re not any more likely to change their behaviour.\u201d</p> \n<p>So why are we really shaming others during a pandemic? Dr Lydia Woodyatt is a social sciences professor at Flinders University whose research has shown that schadenfreude motivates online shaming. \u201cThe same things that drive hostility and collective action offline can drive shaming behaviour online: anger, identification with others in the cause, schadenfreude, belief that our actions together will make a difference,\u201d she explains. She points to recent research by PhD students at her university which found that when an online leader emphasises the nobility of the \u201cgoal\u201d of their shaming, people are more likely to shame.</p> \n<p>You\u2019d struggle to find a more noble goal than saving lives, so it makes sense that there\u2019s been an increase in shaming in recent weeks. Yet Woodyatt also points to a simpler explanation \u2013 with social isolation increasingly common, more and more people are online for longer stretches of time, and this is an issue that encompasses the entire world. \u201cThe sense of loss of control can mean that people try and take control of what they feel they can control,\u201d she adds.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Shame is one of our most primitive feelings ... if it happens on a grand scale it can be psychologically traumatic</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dr Aaron Balick</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Schadenfreude and a bit of boredom might explain the reaction to a tweet posted by nightclub owner Fraser Carruthers on 16 March. Responding to Boris Johnson\u2019s recommendation that the public stop visiting pubs, Carruthers tweeted: \u201cI am a nightclub owner in Kensington and Chelsea. You can\u2019t tell the nation to avoid \u2018pubs and clubs\u2019 and not officially \u2018close us\u2019 so that we can claim our insurance.\u201d When online sleuths discovered that he had previously tweeted \u201cAnyone but Corbyn\u201d, they mocked the 37-year-old as deserving of his fate.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was a mind-blowing response,\u201d says Carruthers, who says he had \u201chundreds and hundreds\u201d of messages for \u201cthree days non-stop\u201d. He was particularly alarmed by commenters who wished he and his family would end up on the street. \u201cIt really makes you think there are some horrible people in this world.\u201d Carruthers believes the response was so strong because of the \u201cstigma\u201d of Kensington and Chelsea, but notes he didn\u2019t actually vote Conservative in the 2019 election \u2013 he voted for the Animal Welfare party.</p> \n<p>Of course, in the middle of a global pandemic, nightclub owners aren\u2019t the people we should feel sorriest for. Yet the vitriol Carruthers received demonstrates that online shaming isn\u2019t always altruistic. <a href=\"https://www.freud.org.uk/2013/10/23/psychodynamics-social-networking/\">Dr Aaron Balick</a>, a psychotherapist from London and author of <em>The Psychodynamics of Social Networking</em>, argues that online shamers are \u201chardly doing it for the safety of society. They\u2019re doing it because they get to be right and someone else gets to be wrong.\u201d</p> \n<p>Balick says pandemic shaming may be caused by fear, as \u201cpeople tend to regress when they\u2019re frightened\u201d. Yet like Tangney, he believes shaming is counterproductive and potentially dangerous. \u201cShame is one of our most primitive feelings. It does hurt, very, very deeply, and if it happens on a grand scale, like on Twitter, it can be psychologically traumatic,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Arguably, the repercussions of online shaming aren\u2019t as severe as they were five years ago, when journalist Jon Ronson wrote his book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/15/publicly-shamed-jon-ronson-is-shame-necessary-jennifer-jacquet-review-think-before-you-tweet\">So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed</a>,</em> chronicling the trauma, job losses, and damaged lives of the internet-shamed. Nowadays, trending topics move so quickly that it is difficult for one individual to capture the entire internet\u2019s attention for long. Even actor Vanessa Hudgens, who employed her best vocal fry to say, \u201cLike yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible \u2026 but inevitable?\u201d on Instagram on 16 March, got away relatively unscathed. Though Hudgens was flooded with hate and forced to issue an apology, model <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1240123787993133058\">Chrissy Teigen came to her defence</a> and gained 75,000 likes for tweeting that when people make misjudged comments, \u201cu don\u2019t have [to] ruin their lives\u201d.</p> \n<p>And indeed, if we now know the consequences of online shaming, we should also know the consequences of what we post online. May, the tweeter who encouraged people to book cheap flights, says she doesn\u2019t think the backlash was unfair because she was aware that \u201cthis is the internet\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s open for everyone to leave their opinion\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is also possible that while shaming doesn\u2019t change the behaviour of the shamed, it can adjust cultural norms. An anonymous 27-year-old says that seeing others hectored online changed his own habits. \u201cIn general it just made me take it way more seriously,\u201d he says, explaining that he had initially still planned to go on holiday and had a \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude to the dangers. \u201cOnline hectoring [of others] did force me to see that behaviour as selfish and individualistic \u2026 perhaps more than straight up relaying that information in a calm and dispassionate way would have done.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet overall, the experts do not believe in the power of public shame. \u201cBy increasing hostility in an otherwise volatile environment we are just promoting the norm of hostility and aggression as a means of coping,\u201d Woodyatt says. \u201cI think we should all agree that is not a good idea. Humans can communicate social norms in calm and non-aggressive ways. We are all in this together.\u201d </p> \n<p>Jon Ronson, too, is not a fan of pandemic shaming (though he notes that we can and should criticise public figures who are putting people in danger). \u201cAs we\u2019re forced to isolate,\u201d he says, \u201cwe need to be able to connect with other people. It can make the difference between being happy and stoical and being depressed. The very best thing Twitter could be right now is a nice place for people to visit and find connection.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is 0808 2000 247.

He pledged to increase lab testing dramatically, introduce new antibody tests for people who may have had the virus, and conduct \u201csurveillance testing\u201d \u2013 checking samples of the population to model the extent of the virus\u2019s spread.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve lost nearly two months in getting on top of this epidemic,\u201d Pollock said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what the scandal is really.\u201d She said there would be a second wave of infections, and planning needed to start now.</p> <p>\u201cClearly we don\u2019t have the capacity to do contact tracing, but we can just call for volunteers, train them up to do it and combine that with mobile phone apps as in Singapore and South Korea and China.\u201d</p> <p>Contact tracing was used in Wuhan, where 1,800 teams of five people went house to house, and Ireland last week said it would recruit 1,400 contact tracers. <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-audio-emergencies-coronavirus-press-conference-full-27mar2020.pdf?sfvrsn=4b72eab2_2\">On 27 March</a> the World Health Organisation director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated the need for \u201cearly detection and isolation of confirmed cases [and the] identification, follow-up and quarantine of contacts\u201d.</p> <p>Some UK public health professionals, however, believe it is too late for contact tracing because the virus has spread too far. And the example set by Singapore appears increasingly questionable: the country is to close most workplaces and all schools this week following the prime minister\u2019s admission that \u201cdespite our good contact tracing\u201d the authorities have been unable to ascertain the origin of nearly half its new cases.</p> <p>One senior director of public health, responsible for local health teams including contact tracing, dismissed the experts group as \u201carmchair commentators\u201d. \u201cContact tracing would be a waste of time right now,\u201d said the director, who asked not to be named. \u201cWe should have done better on testing, but that\u2019s being resolved. Contact tracing would tell you nothing because it\u2019s so widespread. We have to focus on increasing testing, and most virologists I\u2019ve spoken to would agree.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"43d297ec6552704588c8440ac296f63065b2cdbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43d297ec6552704588c8440ac296f63065b2cdbd/0_0_4992_3328/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Professor Allyson Pollock\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Professor Allyson Pollock: \u2018We\u2019ve lost nearly two months in getting on top of this epidemic and that\u2019s what the scandal is really.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI suspect there will come a time for contract tracing again, but not now. It\u2019s when you start getting outbreaks in care homes and prisons and hospitals, or possibly when we\u2019re through the first or second peak and the numbers are bumping along the bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Yet the calls for contact tracing to resume appear to be gathering steam. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has repeatedly called for testing and contact tracing.At the beginnng of last week, Pollock and three others <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1284\">published a paper </a>in the British Medical Journal questioning why the government was not following WHO advice. Then last Wednesday, 24 public health experts, led by David McCoy, professor of global public health at Barts Medical School, signed an open letter urging the government \u201cto expand community testing and individual case detection, contact tracing and appropriate isolation as a core disease control measure\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTesting and quarantine are not enough on their own,\u201d McCoy said, \u201cespecially if we want to avoid some of the serious harms that would be caused by prolonged lockdown. It is not clear why the government is resisting the evidence from elsewhere, as well as the views of the majority of public health opinion.\u201d</p> <p>The group has since expanded to include more than 50 public health experts, Pollock said.</p> <p>AnneliesWilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cTo anyone who tells me that contact tracing is too expensive or not do-able, I just say, rubbish. We are now basically quarantining 68 million people. That is so much more expensive. But at the moment, we cannot do contract tracing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76d32753395dca930f395b55bc2fcafc254001e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76d32753395dca930f395b55bc2fcafc254001e6/0_0_3610_2407/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A woman in singapore looks at a smartphone with the contact-tracing app on it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Singapore government introduced a smartphone app to trace people who had come into contact with a Covid-19 sufferer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Lai/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She said with the epidemic \u201cout of hand\u201d, the lockdown needs time to interrupt the virus\u2019s transmission.</p> <p>\u201cThen we can go back to the basics of dealing with this outbreak. You test, test, test, test. You find a case, you isolate the case; you find their contacts and you isolate their contacts.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Health and Social Care did not respond to requests for comment, but some academics believe smartphone apps might provide automatic contact tracing.</p> <p>NHSX, a division of the NHS responsible for digital innovation, is working on an app that would monitor other phones\u2019 Bluetooth signals, keeping a record of those most at risk \u2013 possibly anyone who stayed within two metres for 15 minutes, the <em>FT </em>reported. If a user tested positive, they could upload a notification, which would warn people they needed to self-isolate.</p> <p>Yet the tracking technology would raise privacy concerns, and the system would not work efficiently unless tens of millions of people downloaded the app.</p> <p>\u201cMobile technology may be a useful adjunct, but contact tracing and the behaviour change we subsequently want to engender needs an active human element,\u201d McCoy said.</p>",

It is where she grew up, it\u2019s the place that she knows best, and so it isn\u2019t a surprise that they\u2019re here. I think what has surprised people is just the fact that they came here so quickly.\u201d </p> <p> As soon as the city kicks back into business again, the couple are expected to shoot to the top of everybody\u2019s invite lists. \u201cUltimately, this is a city where royalty trumps celebrity,\u201d says LA-based Bromley. \u201cThey are potentially the most famous residents of Los Angeles \u2013 or at least they\u2019re on the same level as Oprah [Winfrey], as that kind of celebrity, AAA list.\u201d</p> <p>The couple are currently living in a \u201csecluded compound\u201d, according to <em><a href=\"https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-have-left-canada-and-are-now-settled-in-the-l-a-area/\">People</a></em>.

But it won\u2019t earn her money because she donated her fee to conservation charity <a href=\"http://elephantswithoutborders.org/donate/\">Elephants Without Borders</a>.</p> <p>However, the documentary will be an interesting test of her \u201cbankability\u201d as a star, says<em> LA Times </em>entertainment industry reporter Anousha Sakoui. \u201cDisney will get the first insight into the sellability of their name when it comes to content.

And then on top of that, Meghan is able to pursue her Hollywood career, and she will be sought after just for her name and status,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he thinks that a lot of businesses \u2013 such as Snapchat, based in Santa Monica \u2013 and charities will be interested in working with Harry. <strong>\u201c</strong>There are companies based here that would welcome him to be on their boards, just as status.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b319f4f3c25adbed95dab07a43e131fa5d00407d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b319f4f3c25adbed95dab07a43e131fa5d00407d/0_0_4762_3340/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Harry and Meghan join a mental health community group on Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach in 2018.

  "<p>It\u2019s natural to seek scapegoats to hide your mistakes.

China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, was personally culpable, he suggested.</p> <p>China\u2019s leaders do have many questions to answer about cover-ups and delays. And there is justified anger among western governments about what appears to have been a lack of timely, accurate data from Hubei.</p> <p>Since China flatly denies this, what is needed, once calm returns, is an independent investigation under impartial UN auspices. But getting agreement for an international inquiry of this type is difficult.</p> <p>What is more probable is an acrimonious, post-pandemic widening of the US-China divide. Existing disputes over trade, human rights, geopolitical influence and thorny issues such as Taiwan and the South China Sea are grist to the mill of an expanding global superpower stand-off.</p> <p>The seeds of this defining 21st-century collision between a rising China and a declining America were sown decades ago. The pandemic is bringing them more rapidly into noxious bud.</p> <p>Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, says the virus has produced a \u201cglobal battle of narratives\u201d. China portrays itself as a reliable, disease-conquering partner for Europe and the wider world, in contrast to an untrustworthy US. Trump administration hawks and allies cast China, meanwhile, in the Soviet Union\u2019s old role of contagious \u201cevil empire\u201d. Both narratives are parodies of the truth. But many on each side will believe them.</p> <p>Europe, meanwhile, is caught in no-man\u2019s land. EU leaders are struggling to collaborate amid competing national imperatives. A recent video summit saw Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/solidarity-members-eurozone-coronavirus-dutch-coronabond\">reject a French-led plan</a> for \u201ccoronabonds\u201d to bail out the eurozone. Italy, Hungary and Greece are among member states that have welcomed pandemic assistance from China, consistent with their pro-Beijing stance and entrenched Euroscepticism.</p> <p>In the Netherlands, where a decision on allowing Huawei to help build 5G networks is due in June, the Chinese telecoms giant has donated 700,000 face masks. While this may win over the Dutch, Britain looks poised to review its Huawei links, along with other investments from China.</p> <p>\u201cChina has been extremely adept at exploiting the virus for its global propaganda war against the US. Beijing is taking every opportunity during this crisis to drive wedges between members of the EU,\u201d wrote analyst Peter Rough.</p> <p>If this is at all true, the US should surely be wary of fuelling a global confrontation. However angry they feel now, European states that joined America after 1945 in forging the transatlantic alliance and demonising the Soviet Union are unlikely to act similarly towards China today. This holds true for most other parts of a world that is more connected and interdependent, and less in awe of the US.</p> <p>The parallel crisis in present-day American leadership and competence is also key. Trump is no Harry Truman and secretary of state Mike Pompeo is certainly no Dean Acheson. Who would follow them? We can perhaps hope that a Joe Biden presidency <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/23/death-american-competence-reputation-coronavirus/\">would behave more sensibly</a>.</p> <p>Those pushing for a \u201cget tough\u201d approach should instead get real. The world does not need more superpower muscle-flexing.<br>China\u2019s leaders have made some big mistakes. So, too, have other governments.

Here it is.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is the honour and the privilege of my life to be elected as leader of the Labour arty. It comes at a moment like none other in our lifetime.</p> \n   <p>Coronavirus has brought normal life to a halt. Our cities, our towns and our villages are silent, our roads deserted. Public life has all but come to a standstill and we\u2019re missing each other.<br></p> \n   <p>People are frightened by the strangeness, anxious about what will happen next. And we have to remember that every number is a family shaken to its foundation.<br></p> \n   <p>Unable even to carry out the most poignant of ceremonies, a funeral, in the way that they would like. It reminds us of how precious life is, but also how fragile.</p> \n   <p>It reminds us of what really matters, our family, our friends, our relationships. The love we have for one another. Our health.</p> \n   <p>Our connections with those that we don\u2019t know. A greeting from a stranger, a kind word from a neighbour. These make up society. They remind us that we share our lives together. We have to trust one another and look after one another.</p> \n   <p>And I can see this happening, people coming together to help the isolated and the vulnerable, checking on their neighbours.</p> \n   <p>So many volunteering for the NHS, millions of people doing their bit to stop this virus and to save lives.</p> \n   <p>Our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long. When millions of us stepped out onto our doorsteps to applaud the carers visibly moved there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That\u2019s why in the national interest the Labour Party will play its full part.</p> \n   <p>Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition\u2019s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that\u2019s the right thing to do.</p> \n   <p>But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we\u2019ll challenge that and call that out.</p> \n   <p>Our purpose when we do that is the same as the government\u2019s, to save lives and to protect our country, a shared purpose.</p> \n   <p>But that is not the only task for the Labour party. The weeks ahead are going to be really difficult. I fear there are going to be some awful moments for many of us.</p> \n   <p>But we will get through this. The curve will flatten, the wards will empty, the immediate threat will subside. And we have scientists working on vaccines.</p> \n   <p>But when we do get through this we cannot go back to business as usual. This virus has exposed the fragility of our society. It\u2019s lifted a curtain.</p> \n   <p>Too many will have given too much. Some of us will have lost too much. We know in our hearts, things are going to have to change.</p> \n   <p>We can see so clearly now who the key workers really are.<br></p> \n   <p>When we get through this it\u2019ll be because of our NHS staff, our care workers, our ambulance drivers, our emergency services, our cleaners, our porters.</p> \n   <p>It will be because of the hard work and bravery of every key worker a they took on this virus and kept our country going.</p> \n   <p>For too long they\u2019ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first.</p> \n   <p>In their courage and their sacrifice and their bravery, we can see a better future. This crisis has brought out the resilience and human spirit in all of us.</p> \n   <p>We must go forward with a vision of a better society built on that resilience and built on that human spirit. That will require bravery and change in our party as well.</p> \n   <p>I want to thank Rebecca and Lisa for running such passionate and powerful campaigns and for their friendship and support along the way.</p> \n   <p>I want to thank our Labour party staff who worked really hard and my own amazing campaign team, full of positivity, with that unifying spirit.</p> \n   <p>I want to pay tribute to Jeremy Corbyn, who led our party through some really difficult times, who energised our movement and who\u2019s a friend as well as a colleague.</p> \n   <p>And to all of our members, supporters and affiliates I say this: whether you voted for me or not I will represent you, I will listen to you and I will bring our party together.</p> \n   <p>But we have to face the future with honesty.</p> \n   <p>Antisemitism has been a stain on our party. I have seen the grief that it\u2019s brought to so many Jewish communities.</p> \n   <p>On behalf of the Labour party, I am sorry.</p> \n   <p>And I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us.</p> \n   <p>The Labour party is an incredible and powerful force for good.</p> \n   <p>Together with those that went before us we\u2019ve changed the lives of millions of people for the better.</p> \n   <p>We created the NHS. We created the welfare state. We passed equalities legislation, the Race Relations Act, we set up the Open University. We built hospitals and schools, established Sure Start and played our part in bringing about peace in Northern Ireland.</p> \n   <p>But we\u2019ve just lost four elections in a row. We\u2019re failing in our historic purpose.</p> \n   <p>Be in no doubt I understand the scale of the task, the gravity of the position that we\u2019re in.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019ve got a mountain to climb.</p> \n   <p>But we will climb it, and I will do my utmost to reconnect us across the country, to re-engage with our communities and voters, to establish a coalition across our towns and our cities and our regions with all creeds and communities to speak for the whole of the country.</p> \n   <p>Where that requires change, we will change. Where that requires us to rethink, we will rethink.</p> \n   <p>Our mission has to be to restore trust in our party as a force for good and a force for change.</p> \n   <p>This is my pledge to the British people. I will do my utmost to guide us through these difficult times, to serve all of our communities and to strive for the good of our country.</p> \n   <p>I will lead this great party into a new era, with confidence and with hope.</p> \n   <p>So that when the time comes, we can serve our country again in government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8859a18f080bdb9f534169\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:56:30.131Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Angela Rayner elected Labour deputy leader</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And Angela Rayner is the new deputy leader, the Press Association has confirmed.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8859638f08c35a1d119e1c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:54:57.466Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labour has confirmed the result.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/UKLabour/status/1246375178684239874\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Congratulations to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keir_Starmer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Keir_Starmer</a>, the new Leader of the Labour Party!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LabourLeadership?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LabourLeadership</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/i2PjxXaWMf\">pic.twitter.com/i2PjxXaWMf</a></p>\u2014 The Labour Party (@UKLabour) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UKLabour/status/1246375178684239874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8858ff8f080bdb9f534165\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:53:28.188Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Keir Starmer elected Labour leader</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong> has won, the Press Association is reporting.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8858888f080bdb9f53415d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:51:23.097Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.labour.org.uk/leadership2020\">The page on the Labour website</a>, where the leadership result is due to get posted, has crashed.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T10:38:15.628Z\">at 11.38am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e88582c8f08c35a1d119e0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:50:00.027Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from Labour First, a Labour group supporting Sir Keir Starmer.

A majority of us are now floating voters, the book\u2019s seven authors argue.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When Butler and Stokes looked at panel data of vote choice in the 1960s, they observed that only around 13% of those who voted in both elections switched their vote choices between elections (Butler and Stokes 1969). They concluded that differential turnout and cohort replacement were the major drivers of electoral change. Slightly over a decade later, S\u00e4rlvik and Crewe (1983) saw sufficient change (21% of voters switched) that they considered there to have been a \u2018decade of dealignment\u2019. However, even the switching seen there seems modest when compared to the levels seen in 2015 (43%) and 2017 (33%). Across the four elections from 2005 to 2017, around 60 per cent of voters switched parties at least once.1 Far from being the minority of the electorate, swing voters \u2014 defined as people who switch their support to different parties between elections \u2014 now comprise the majority of the modern British electorate.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here are two of the charts from the book that illustrate this point.</p> \n  <p>This chart shows the percentage of voters at general elections from 1966 onwards, voting for a different party from the one they backed at the previous election.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a517fb668cf8acdfe85f75fffe51bf38703158a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a517fb668cf8acdfe85f75fffe51bf38703158a/0_0_497_336/497..jpg\" alt=\"Individual-level voter volatility at general elections between 1966 and 2017.\" width=\"497\" height=\"336\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Individual-level voter volatility at general elections between 1966 and 2017.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Electoral Shocks</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And this chart shows how the proportion of voters identifying with a particular party, and strongly identifying with a particular party, has declined over the same period.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7eb48d29d56cddeb920ce62e5a5355d5e4c74b8\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7eb48d29d56cddeb920ce62e5a5355d5e4c74b8/0_0_479_324/479..jpg\" alt=\"Electoral Shocks\" width=\"479\" height=\"324\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Electoral Shocks</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Declining levels of party identification since 1964/Electoral Shocks</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:46:27.483Z\">at 10.46am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e884f048f080bdb9f53412b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T09:19:26.968Z\">10.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson says all parties 'have duty to work together at this moment of national emergency'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some Conservatives have suggested that <strong>Boris Johnson </strong>should invite the next Labour leader to join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/covid-coalition-government-considered-by-senior-conservatives\">some form of government of national unity to deal with the coronavirus crisis</a>.

  "<p>With the party on its knees, an implausible leftwing Labour leader with pacifist inclinations is replaced by a strait-laced lawyer from the soft left. A few short years later, Britain is plunged into deadly turmoil, one that exposes hitherto ignored injustices, while an ideologically shapeshifting Tory prime minister with surging popularity expands the state\u2019s role in the economy to an unprecedented degree. But Labour\u2019s radicalism remains undimmed; the party recognises that revolutionary times require revolutionary answers.</p> <p>The implausible Labour leader was George Lansbury in 1935; his successor was Clement Attlee; and the Tory prime minister who seemed to be the master of all before him was Winston Churchill. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/keir-starmer-wins-labour-leadership-election\">Keir Starmer wins a decisive victory</a> to become the 22nd leader of the Labour party in its 115-year history, a new 1945 seems, for now, a distant prospect. He assumes the leadership in unenviable circumstances. Labour was battered in December\u2019s election; the party has been traumatised by half a decade of internal strife; the Brexit culture war has polarised the nation and wreaked havoc among the party\u2019s electoral coalition; and the UK is being convulsed by its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/03/john-mcdonnell-calls-for-wealth-tax-to-pay-for-coronavirus-measures\">greatest crisis</a> since the guns fell silent three-quarters of a century ago.</p> <p>But Starmer can succeed, and anyone with progressive sympathies should actively will his leadership to do so. His democratic mandate is rooted in <a href=\"https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/\">a policy prospectus</a> which, before 2015, would have been deemed unthinkably radical by mainstream Labour: hiking taxes on the rich and big business to fund public investment; democratic public ownership of utilities and services; expanding the welfare state; the abolition of tuition fees; a green industrial revolution; defending migrants\u2019 rights; an end to illegal wars. Starmer declared that Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto \u2013 which punctured a suffocating generation of \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d\u2013 was the party\u2019s foundational document.</p> <p>In one of his campaign videos, Starmer rightly declared that Labour must hold Boris Johnson to account for the promises made in his election campaign. The same applies to Starmer; here are red lines that cannot be crossed, the reasons thousands of members who voted for Jeremy Corbyn in two leadership elections have placed their trust in him. What hurt Corbyn, in the end, was not being seen as dangerously extreme. It was instead that Brexit unfairly made him seem like a flip-flopper who would say anything to win power. But there is cause for optimism: Starmer\u2019s allies are emphatic that his commitments are an authentic expression of his own beliefs.</p> <p>When Corbyn became leader, many of his opponents within the Labour party embraced a scorched earth policy. They desperately wanted him to fail, craving vindication more than displacing a Tory government. They cheered every misstep and failure throwing relentless tasty morsels to insatiable vultures in the rightwing media. They actively destabilised his leadership. Some on the aggrieved left may ask why they should behave any differently. It would achieve nothing except to prolong the Tory nightmare and alienate the wider membership. Now is the time for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/21/defeat-left-labour-activism-party\">critical friendship</a>; dissent should be in the context of willing the triumph of a radical Labour government.</p> <p>There will be those who now want the left to go and find the nearest ditch to die in. So, let\u2019s be clear from the outset: we aren\u2019t going anywhere. Already, those who caricatured Corbynism as an era of authoritarian Stalinism are demanding bloodthirsty purges, to permanently smash the left once and for all. In the coming days and weeks, those elements will do all they can to provoke and demoralise the left. Don\u2019t listen to them: this is your party. Every socialist who rips up their membership card, who retreats from political activity, who finds sanctuary in a dead-end leftwing sect, will be cause for celebration for those hankering for a Blairite revival.</p> <p>The mistake many \u201ccentrist\u201d voices have made is to dismiss political phenomena they do not like \u2013 from Corbynism to Brexit to Trump \u2013 as simply being mass irrationality, stupidity and hysteria. But Corbyn secured a landslide victory in 2015 because all of the other flanks of the Labour party were politically and intellectually exhausted. Labour\u2019s social democrats had abandoned social democracy; the last consistent social democrats left standing were Labour\u2019s left flank. All of its sister parties were in crisis, including those \u2013 like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/03/the-guardian-view-on-germanys-social-democrats-turning-left-is-a-risky-but-necessary-gamble\">German Social Democrats</a> \u2013 who had stuck to the \u201cthird way\u201d playbook. Just two years after what was then one of the party\u2019s worst defeats, and in the aftermath of a vicious civil war, Labour <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/corbyn-election-results-votes-away-prime-minister-theresa-may-hung-parliament-a7782581.html\">came within 2,227 votes and seven constituencies</a> of forming a government in 2017.</p> <p>Today\u2019s two major success stories for the European left are the Spanish and Portuguese governments, where social democratic parties have swung leftwards after making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/12/spain-ruling-socialists-strike-coalition-deal-with-podemos-sanchez\">pacts with the radical left</a>. It is no coincidence that younger voters in the US, Spain, Portugal and the UK embraced the new left movements at the same time, from Bernie Sanders to Podemos: free-market ideology robbed them of security and prosperity, leading them to demand radical answers.</p> <p>That isn\u2019t going to change: and that\u2019s why the left is going precisely nowhere. Why, at the very moment our ideas have been consecrated as the party\u2019s mainstream, would we perform hari-kari? That remains the success of Corbyn and his supporters and cannot be airbrushed from history despite the undoubted attempts to do so. As it was under Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell and Harold Wilson, the left is a legitimate power within the party again, one which cannot be ignored.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-britain-economy-government-blame-labour\">Blaming Labour won't work this time \u2013 the Tories will have to own this crisis  | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starmer has committed to the policies long advocated by the left; and so the left\u2019s role now is to act as the protectors and defenders of those ideas, to ensure that those red lines are not violated, and to develop a vision of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-crisis-new-society\">what post-coronavirus Britain will look like</a>. The left may have succeeded in giving otherwise cautious Labour politicians the courage of their convictions again, but pressure must be maintained to ensure this remains so. While the left has understandably expended much energy on electoral politics in the past five years, in post-pandemic Britain there must be a revival in extra-parliamentary struggles \u2013 from the climate emergency to workers\u2019 rights \u2013 to build popular support for a decisive rupture from a broken status quo.</p> <p>Unlike most Labour leaders, Starmer\u2019s politics is rooted in extra-parliamentary politics: those instincts should be appealed to. Those who hoped that a Starmer triumph would end the remorseless attacks from the rightwing media will soon be disappointed: it will fall to the left to push back against them. And while many Labour MPs, for a time, will be relieved that their Corbynite nightmare is over, the party\u2019s right went for Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband as well as Corbyn. They will come for Starmer, too: the Labour leader may find his only genuine defenders are the left.</p> <p>Starmer has many challenges, not least winning back older voters who have abandoned Labour. But the left should wish him well; the quid pro quo is Starmer stands by his promises. Now is the time for critical friendship, to wish a genuinely decent and progressive politician well: because his success is our only chance to rid the UK of the cruel injustices that both scar and define our society.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

About 25 strains of coral are being crossbred with the same or different species. The research is being carried out in the<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.aims.gov.au/seasim\">National Sea Simulator</a><em>,</em> the world\u2019s most advanced research aquarium, and intends to show that young coral offspring \u2013 produced from mixing corals from various parts of the reef \u2013 can survive in warmer sea temperatures.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like crossbreeding corn. We do the same thing with the corals, so they can withstand higher temperatures,\u201d says Kate Quigley, a researcher on reef restoration at Aims.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aeb411ad24f22674086b9c0ccdeb8c3c6a127eec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeb411ad24f22674086b9c0ccdeb8c3c6a127eec/0_0_6458_4305/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aims scientist Kate Quigley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aims scientist Kate Quigley is looking at how some corals can withstand higher water temperatures. The idea is to prevent the degradation of the Great Barrier Reef</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonas Gratzer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The method is called \u201cassisted gene flow\u201d, and although at an early stage, shows encouraging results in the sea simulator, as well as on the reef \u2013 where cross-fertilised corals have been transplanted. The hybrids have one parent from the northern parts and one parent from the central reefs, and the results show that corals with at least one parent from the more heat-resistant northern reefs survive when placed in cooler environments. The research has also confirmed that the offspring inherit heat tolerance from their northern parents, and these genes may ultimately be passed on to make reefs more heat resistant.</p> <p>Aims also conducts research on how to decrease the numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish (cots), which prey upon corals. There are currently more than five million cots on the reefs between Cairns and Cooktown, and the invasion spreads south as the heavily spined species (which normally range from 25\u201335cm across, and can have up to 23 arms) devours corals and leaves nothing but traces of fine calcium carbonate. </p> <p>Female cots can produce up to 50 million eggs a year and each one annually ingests 10 square metres of coral. Rising sea temperatures and increased availability of nutrients due to run-off from farming practices are said to be behind the rise in cot numbers. So far divers have culled about half a million by injecting the starfish with white vinegar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"ba62142be7b18e44dadae5797b0aa0a2294bdf41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba62142be7b18e44dadae5797b0aa0a2294bdf41/0_0_6623_4415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aims researcher Samantha Jaworski  among tanks of water\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aims researcher Samantha Jaworski among tanks of water of various temperatures where corals are monitored</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonas Gratzer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"473a0349700e99842c8b9ce2a8332229ede3202c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/473a0349700e99842c8b9ce2a8332229ede3202c/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aims scientist are trying to breed corals that can withstand higher water temperatures.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aims scientist are trying to breed corals that can withstand higher water temperatures</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonas Gratzer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"b7abdfedf3c10fa63014139cf5669007a5d1464e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7abdfedf3c10fa63014139cf5669007a5d1464e/0_0_6250_4167/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corals in tanks at Aims research facility in Townsville, Queensland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corals in tanks at Aims research facility in Townsville, Queensland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonas Gratzer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"1a968d32df4a699ea266f4004f850ed71f8b3f41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a968d32df4a699ea266f4004f850ed71f8b3f41/0_0_5942_3961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aims scientist Samantha Jaworski\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aims scientist Samantha Jaworski with coral samples</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonas Gratzer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scientists at Aims are attempting to wield another \u2013 more natural weapon \u2013 to combat the mass outbreak.

It means making sure businesses aren\u2019t just profit-making machines but instead have a social purpose.</p> <p>We can\u2019t repeat what happened after the 2008 crash, when big banks and corporations bounced back but working families paid the price. Real wages only returned to their pre-2008 levels in early 2020 \u2013 immediately before coronavirus hit.</p> <p>While right now many of us simply want things to return to normal, the reality is that some things have changed for good. We know the years ahead won\u2019t be easy.</p> <p>But together we can build a new normal, where we all get our fair share and can provide a decent life for ourselves and our families. Collectivism is for life \u2013 not just in a crisis.</p> <h2><strong>Terry Smith, manager of </strong><strong>the \u00a317bn Fundsmith Equity</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018No one seems able to sell everything and buy back at the bottom\u2019</em></p> <p>What should investors do in the current market panic? Four strategies spring to mind:</p> <p>1. Sell everything and buy back at the bottom</p> <p>2. Try to buy those companies which will benefit from the crisis</p> <p>3. Buy so-called \u201cvalue\u201d stocks which have been hit hard in the market fall</p> <p>4. Just own high-quality companies and try to ignore events</p> <p>The first strategy suffers from one major drawback \u2013 no one seems to be able to do it. It takes more foresight, mental flexibility and emotional stability than most investors possess to be able to foresee a disaster, sell and then buy back in when things look at their bleakest.</p> <p>Trying to pick companies that might profit from the crisis is maybe easier. Think disinfectant manufacturers like Reckitt Benckiser and mask manufacturers like 3M. But the crisis will be temporary and they have other businesses, some of which were already challenged before the economy turned down.</p> <p>Buying so-called \u201cvalue\u201d stocks has fared very badly and has not shown any improvement so far in this market downturn. The Fundsmith Equity Fund year to date has outperformed the Benchmark MSCI World Index by nearly 8% but it outperformed the MSCI World Value Index by over 14%.</p> <p>I have never been a believer in the philosophy that so-called \u201cvalue\u201d investments would perform well in an economic and market downturn. Shares that are lowly-rated are so mostly for good reasons. Their businesses are mostly heavily cyclical, highly leveraged, they have poor returns on capital and/or they face other structural or management issues. It\u2019s not a combination likely to protect your investment in difficult times.</p> <p>Which brings me to the final strategy. I haven\u2019t a clue what will emerge from the current apocalyptic state. Rather like some of the companies I most admire, I try to spend very little time considering matters that I can neither predict nor control and focus instead on those that I can affect. I just try to own good businesses.</p> <h2><strong>Phil Spencer, TV property expert</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018The market is likely to take a fair while to recover\u2019</em></p> <p>It seems that for all intents and purposes the UK housing market is shut. It is temporarily closed for business. Nothing more, nothing less. It has not crashed, slumped or even slowed down. It has just stopped.</p> <p>Aside from physical viewings not being allowed to take place at the moment, the real crunch point is that surveys and bank valuations cannot take place. Which basically means you can\u2019t raise a mortgage \u2026 or certainly not under even half sensible terms. It doesn\u2019t matter what market you\u2019re dealing in \u2013 whether its wellington boots or bags of popcorn \u2013 for a marketplace to function, people have to be able to trade within it. There has to be liquidity. While the banks are unable to safely lend money, the housing market is unable to function. It\u2019s as simple as that.</p> <p>The primary question in my mind is how long will this situation remain?</p> <p>Working on that assumption \u2013 it begs the question, how comfortable are the banks going to be lending money to individuals whose future income may be uncertain? And then added into that perfect little storm, will be the fact that even when things do get going again, how long will it be before borrowers, valuers or lenders will be able to trust any price or reliable market data? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9512504c14c77a2d00cb48af9a7c82a8087eea98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9512504c14c77a2d00cb48af9a7c82a8087eea98/335_326_2964_1779/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The UK housing market is shut.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UK housing market is shut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This does not necessarily mean a price crash or a fall in underlying property values. But it does mean transaction volumes will dry up for a period of time. To give this some context, in China, property transactions were around zero for the three weeks following movement restrictions and have since (two months later) recovered to 50% of their four-year average.</p> <p>So my expectation is that while the actual pandemic and social lockdown etc may even turn out to be short-lived, the property market itself is likely to take a fair while longer to return to full health. I\u2019m absolutely sure it will get there \u2013 a combination of low interest rates and rising inflation will certainly help \u2013 but it might be a wee while yet. Hold on tight folks! In the meantime, there\u2019s a wealth of free information on my advice site <a href=\"https://www.moveiq.co.uk/\" title=\"\">moveiq.co.uk</a></p> <h2><strong>Peter Hargreaves, </strong><strong>founder of Hargreaves Lansdown</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018Coronavirus is going to change things dramatically\u2019</em></p> <p>Right now I\u2019m in total isolation because I have a heart condition, as well as my age. I think coronavirus is going to change things dramatically. At the very least it will make luddites embrace the internet. Even I\u2019ve shifted to doing internet banking for the first time. There\u2019s still an awful lot of people not on the internet.</p> <p>It was sheer luck that I sold a lot of my shares just before the crash. [Hargreaves sold \u00a3550m in Hargreaves Lansdown shares in early February, when the price was around \u00a317.50 a share compared with around \u00a313 now]. It was the biggest sale by a single private investor in the UK of all time. I\u2019ve had a lot of stick about it. But I started work on it in December \u2013 it was not the sort of thing of thing you can do overnight.</p> <p>When the world comes out of this, more and more people will be converted to the new economy, how everything can be bought online, and how we won\u2019t need the high street. If you are in retail today, you are done for.</p> <p>I\u2019ve put \u00a320m into the Blue Whale Growth fund [Hargreaves co-founded Blue Whale in 2017]. The team there are keener on some of their tech stocks than they have ever been.</p> <p>Some people are saying buy the cyclical stocks that will recover after a recession. But I\u2019m not sure a lot of the cyclical stocks are going to come back in the way they used to.</p> <h2><strong>Jo Whitfield, chief executive, Co-op Food</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018Budgets will be tighter and the biggest change will be the shift to online\u2019</em></p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see the longer-term picture as one of doom and gloom, and there will be challenges, but there will also be much change for good and a great party to kick things off. Once freed from lockdown, we can expect shoppers to celebrate in some style with family and friends who they haven\u2019t seen for some time. Restaurants and cafes should experience a boom as we go mad for a while on eating out, but home cooking is also becoming a way of life as we face into staying at home, and this shift will continue.</p> <p>Consumers are having to prepare more meals at home and are falling in love with baking and home cooking. Dusting off old family recipes and involving the family more in creating meal occasions. We see this growing as people shop differently to make more meals themselves from scratch. </p> <p>Neighbourliness will also be a big theme post-coronavirus. There is a thriving community spirit as people look after their own and their neighbours. The street party spirit of older generations could well return as we enjoy being free from the confines of our homes but also strengthen new-found friendships. </p> <p>Budgets will be tighter, given the economic fallout from coronavirus, and we will look for value for money. And we are moving to an \u201conly when necessary shopping\u201d mentality. In the future, this little and often approach could help accelerate the move to less frequent big shops and an increase in top-up shopping. Local producers are seeing uplifts in sales and local farm shops and other community stores will benefit beyond coronavirus from a new customer base which will stay loyal.</p> <p>The biggest change will be the shift to online. Demand is outstripping delivery slots but this will see many move into home-delivered or click-and-collect services in the future. </p> <h2><strong>Caroline Lucas, Green party MP</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018Even Conservative MPs are calling for a universal basic income\u2019</em></p> <p>Coronavirus is changing us as a society, but it\u2019s also revealing who we can truly be. We are seeing people\u2019s roles and jobs afresh . People who yesterday were \u201cunskilled\u201d are now essential workers \u2013 and rightly so. I hope that will lead to a reassessment of jobs and wages, so that in future no one working in an essential role is undervalued or left in poverty.</p> <p>We\u2019re very lucky in Brighton to have a huge range of independent food shops. I don\u2019t necessarily think the panic-buying and early response to coronavirus will see them replace supermarkets. But I think people are appreciating how fragile our food supply system is and how dependent it is on invisible armies of poorly paid people. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bbf1fffef9221d2f3717ee54b255d4de9db980b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bbf1fffef9221d2f3717ee54b255d4de9db980b/408_778_4163_2497/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Deck chairs on Brighton beach\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Lucas says there are some responses to the pandemic that \u2018if they become hardwired and permanent, will do huge damage to the environment and to people\u2019s lives\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Fraser/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But I know there are no guarantees. We\u2019ve seen too many false dawns, ignored too many warnings in the past. And there are some responses to this pandemic which, if they become hardwired and permanent, will do huge damage to the environment and to people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>There are things being said now, though, which cannot be unsaid. Michael Gove asserting on the Marr programme that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to put the lives of the vulnerable ahead of everything else\u201d; Conservative MPs calling for a universal basic income. The coronavirus may turn out to be the locomotive of history which accelerates the transition to a better, fairer society. But we will have to fight to ensure it happens.</p> <h2><strong>Edwin Booth, head of family-owned supermarket chain Booths</strong></h2> <p><em>\u2018A sharing of value will save mankind, greater wealth in fewer hands will not\u2019</em></p> <p>Customers are and will continue to be anxious, seeking reassurance that the food that they buy is safe, healthy and from a trusted source. In the aftermath of Brexit, there is an opportunity for the government to collaborate with food industries and farming to create a framework for increased food production throughout the United Kingdom.</p> <p>Consumers are going to be more aware and conscious than ever before. Food retailers will need to understand how they make customers feel, while front-line workers will have more responsibility for running \u201ctheir business\u201d.</p> <p>In my personal purpose there is a line that reads, \u201cThere is no such thing as a dull person\u201d. At Booths I describe empowerment as \u201clegitimising common sense\u201d. After three weeks of facing into Covid-19, this simple sentiment has accelerated our responses. Remote working and the use of modern video technologies has enabled our business to run at a high pace despite there only being a team of some 12 people physically attending our central office.</p> <p>It has not been a smooth ride for those having to maintain a physical presence either in distribution centres, manufacturing areas and the stores. Distancing and safety routines have made many tasks more difficult, and the attitude with which colleagues have carried out their daily tasks has been heart-warming.</p> <p>The future of food retailing will be fast-paced. Overarching everything will be the need for customers to feel loved. Family and friends are going to mean more to all of us, and communities will be rebuilt with a keener awareness of local values. Globalism will not die but should become a way of understanding diversity as opposed to a means by which to direct wealth to the few. A sharing of value will save mankind, greater wealth in fewer hands will not.</p>",

A total of 43 disembarked in Italy, in the Sicilian island of Lampedusa, while about 155 have landed in Malta.

A case of an asylum seeker suspected of Covid-19 turned out to be negative. Many people displaced by the conflict are particularly fragile, as well as refugees and migrants who live in sub-standard shelter conditions.

Libyan armed factions have defied the UN\u2019s call for a <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2020-03-23/secretary-generals-appeal-for-global-ceasefire\">\u201cglobal ceasefire\u201d</a> and last week fighting escalated across the country, with forces loyal to eastern warlord Gen Khalifa Haftar claiming to have gained control of a string of towns in the north-west.</p> <p>As always in conflicts, it is the most vulnerable who pay the biggest price. Thousands of migrants remain stuck in Libyan detention centres, where they are subjected to torture and abuse. According to the UNHCR, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on departures by sea from Libya is not yet clear. Certainly, given the absence of NGO rescue boats, attempting to reach Europe from North Africa has become increasingly risky in recent months.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the coronavirus emergency, many charities committed to saving migrants in the central Mediterranean have temporarily abandoned their activities at sea and transferred their resources, including doctors and other health workers, to European hospitals. Long attacked by the Italian government and affected by unjustified judicial investigations, teams from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and the Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms are providing support to the Italian health authorities.</p> <p>MSF staff are based in four hospitals in areas of the northern Italian province of Lodi, part of Lombardy, the country\u2019s worst-hit region. Even Open Arms doctors are now on the frontlines in Italian hospitals, including Bergamo. Mediterranea Saving Humans, an Italian NGO normally engaged in the rescue of migrants at sea, has launched a \u201ctelephone emergency room\u201d for psychological support in areas worst affected by Covid-19.</p> <p>With the German NGO Sea-Watch waiting to return to sea \u2013 their boat is moored in Sicily \u2013 the only ship currently operating in the central Mediterranean is the Alan Kurdi.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/18/ngos-raise-alarm-as-coronavirus-strips-support-from-eu-refugees\">NGOs raise alarm as coronavirus strips support from EU refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have set up booths for the isolation of any patients with symptoms of Covid-19 or tuberculosis,\u2019\u2019 says Ribbeck. \u201cWe cannot do the tests onboard because the swabs must be shipped to specialised centres.

Previously working in advertising, he had been trying to help his dairy farmer Dad to find a market for his goat meat when he discovered the masses of goatskins being discarded.</p> <p>Unable to find a facility that could process smaller, less sought-after goatskins, Millington enlisted experts at the University of Northampton to develop a bespoke tanning recipe using natural bark extracts, then set about creating his own purpose-built micro-tannery.<br><br>The tanning process, which takes up to two weeks, starts when the raw hides arrive from the abattoir. They are covered in salt to preserve the skins and draw out moisture, then the traditional \u201cbeamhouse operation\u201d begins. Initially, lime powder is added to a small batch of 70 or so skins in the first drum which spins intermittently to remove the hair and plump the skin up into a thick jelly-like material. <br><br>Powdered enzyme is then added to break down proteins in the skin and once in the second drum, hides are pickled with rock salt and acid solution. Finally, non-toxic mimosa bark tannins are added to colour the leather overnight. <br><br>Once tanned, skins are dyed and finished at a local family-run leather finishing company and handcrafted into luxury bags, wallets, made-to-order shoes and bespoke commissions such as the <a href=\"https://billytannery.co.uk/blogs/news/billy-x-silo\">aprons for staff at SILO</a>, London\u2019s zero waste restaurant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10665e71be81e37a762ac85dd3af260525d79022\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10665e71be81e37a762ac85dd3af260525d79022/0_0_2500_1654/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leather\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The tannery takes hides from billy goats and produces bags, wallets and shoes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Billy Tannery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While most leather companies won\u2019t mention that their fabric comes from livestock, Millington is totally open about the connection between leather and the food industry. All of the billies ultimately used by the tannery come from farms supplying Cheshire-based Delamere Dairy, which processes a third of the UK\u2019s goat milk. <br><br>\u201cThe leather industry is so misunderstood. People don\u2019t think about where leather comes from, but it\u2019s a natural by-product. The connection between the meat and dairy system and the leather industry has been forgotten, but they are inextricably linked,\u201d says Millington, who launched Billy Tannery three years ago and now sources all his hides from Cabrito.<br><br>\u201cWe\u2019re repurposing a bi-product that comes from an inherently wasteful food system to make a material that\u2019s biodegradable, natural and beautiful,\u201d he adds.<br><br>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t do anyone any favours to talk about the males in the dairy system, it\u2019s not in the farmers\u2019 interests, retailers\u2019, or consumers\u2019 interest to dig that much,\u201d explains Cabrito\u2019s founder James Whetlor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87862a1e715d9faf8553e034db74eee342e3fe23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87862a1e715d9faf8553e034db74eee342e3fe23/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goats\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The goat meat distributor Cabrito buys goat meat from farms that keep and rear their billies until around seven months old before slaughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Evans/Cabrito Goat Meat</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re a vegetarian who eats goat\u2019s cheese, you\u2019re directly contributing to a system that euthanises animals at birth, so if you care about the circular economy, the sustainability of industries and reducing the impact of your food on the planet, you should be eating goat meat,\u201d he says.<br><br>Sending the hides to Millington\u2019s tannery is the \u201clast piece of the puzzle\u201d, says Whetlor, and ends another unnecessary waste in the goat dairy system. <br><br>\u201c200 years ago no one would have dreamt of knocking a perfectly healthy animal on the head at birth, and 100 years ago no one would have dreamt of throwing these hides away.

Rather, those who have aggressively advocated pursuit of narrowly defined \u201cnational interests\u201d at any cost are doubling down.

The US embargo not only prohibits American companies and individuals from conducting lawful trade with Iranian counterparts, but given that the sanctions are extra-territorial, all other countries and companies are also bullied into refraining from doing legitimate business with Iranians, even the selling of medicines.</p> <p>As a result, the ability of my colleagues and I to provide the health, logistical and other essential infrastructure necessary to combat the disease has been drastically reduced.

Under the federal protocol in place from 6 March, it was entirely discretionary as to whether those processes had to be followed. Hazzard says he\u2019s:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>... not blaming the federal government here because it was evolving so fast at the time. As you would recall, this all was moving slowly, between mid-January and the end of January, we only had four people. But Health was still preparing and doing all they needed to do, doing all the work behind the scenes and they took it upon themselves to step up the protocol that they had previously applied for many years to other infectious diseases. So when the 6 March protocol came from the federal government, basically making it discretionary, they [NSW Health] didn\u2019t adopt that. The Health team, the senior practitioner, decided they were going to do an assessment on every ship and that is what they did. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Given the risk assessment they did \u2013 regardless of federal advice they did not have to do an assessment \u2013 the NSW Health staff decided the ship was low risk as only flu was found, and at non-outbreak levels.

One reporter in particular keeps jumping in giving her a grilling and calling on her to resign. It needs to be said that Australia Border Force also had a role to play in this saga \u2013 it\u2019s not all on <strong>NSW Health who were following protocol and assessment processes in place at the time</strong>. Chant says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> If I could just take you back to some of the facts. There was influenza circulating on the cruise ship. And we know that because the point of care test, is pretty accurate and showed it is influenza. So we know that influenza was circulating in that cruise ship, and the majority of patients, over half of the samples that were collected at the time, that the cause of illness was flu. Notwithstanding, it didn\u2019t breach the outbreak level of flu because that would have itself triggered a different response. </p> \n   <p>Can I just assure the public, because I think this is really critical, New South Wales Health has learned lessons and had extensive planning under way to actually disembark people and passengers should we suspect Covid-19 on a cruise ship, or should that have been confirmed. We had always planned to ensure self-isolation for people in the Sydney region, safe transport home through use of health share and other modes of transport and also using hotels for the accommodation of people. If we had known that Covid was on this ship, or it had of been suspected, we would have chosen that way of disembarkation.</p> \n   <p>Having said that, the people who acquired the infection, to the best of our knowledge, got it on the cruise ship. A couple of people may have acquired it earlier on with earlier onset dates and may have acquired it from other means. But certainly, the later ones acquired it on the cruise ship and the reason we suspect that amplified so quickly on the cruise ship was because we know some crew members were actually in the galley area, the food preparation area, when unwell and that would have led to a significant risk of transmission there. </p> \n   <p>So the incubation period of the disease, just to refresh everybody\u2019s memory, is 14 days. We have been following up new cases and linking it to the Ruby Princess for that period because that reflects the fact that they were infected on that time. </p> \n   <p>Be clear, the actions of New South Wales health on the day and the advice of the public health panel was based on the assessment of that information presented to them. They concluded it was a low risk, took the action and tested the results. But we would have got them off in a different way [if the risk assessment had of been high]. As I said, this goes to the fact that the clinicians knew there was activity in influenza. It was low-level influenza.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:44:40.202Z\">at 1.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87d3d28f08c35a1d119c35\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T00:26:59.006Z\">1.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A reporter asks NSW chief health officer <strong>Dr Kerry Chant \u2013</strong> who has worked tirelessly since the epidemic began \u2013 why her resignation isn\u2019t on the premier\u2019s desk over NSW Health\u2019s handling of the Ruby Princess.

Seven of the ship\u2019s passengers have now died after getting the virus and more than 600 passenger are infected. Hazzard is angry at the criticisms, and has defended the handling of the situation by senior NSW Health staff.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> I have seen senior health staff, allI will say is that I have seen them extremely emotional because of the long hours they have worked and because of the challenges they are facing. And I find it disappointing in the strongest way possible that there can be any suggestion that those people are not doing their best. </p> \n   <p>In general terms, can I just say, this city of ours is the gateway to Australia. In normal times we pride ourselves on that. We believe that we actually do lead the way in this country, through Sydney and through New South Wales. But part of that is we have more people coming through our airports and more people coming through our ports than any other state or territory. We have more cruise ships that come through the port of Sydney than any other port in Australia. In a normal course of events, there are about 300 of these cruise ships that come in through the port of Sydney every year.<br></p> \n   <p>The very senior health staff that make the assessments on those cruise ships are actually among the world\u2019s best. There were four, generally, involved in each decision made [about the ships]. Four very senior health staff. They are specialist physicians, doctors with extraordinary training and experience in public health. We have people in that group who make these decisions who are consulting to the World Health Organization, in communicable diseases. When they make decisions, they make decisions the rest of us, if we were one-on-one with that doctor, would be very, very happy to have that advice. </p> \n   <p>I would say to all of you in the public, and actually, it is not so much, I think, the public, there are others who are making comments, but I would say to people who are being critical, know that these frontline staff are sometimes working, as<strong> Dr Kerry Chant</strong> did, she won\u2019t want me to say this, but last Saturday she worked for 31 straight hours before she stood before the media. She hadn\u2019t slept. People don\u2019t do that unless they have extraordinary commitment to all of us. </p> \n   <p><strong>What I would say to the community and to those who are leaping to criticise is, take a step back, and realise that we need everyone of these people, who have worked their hearts out, worked every aspect, every possible thing they could do to keep us safe, and we should be very temperate and careful in any criticism of those people.

Following the release from the health minister outlined below, <strong>the department of agriculture has said temporary changes to visa arrangements are being made to help farmers get the workforce they need to secure Australia\u2019s food and produce supply during the pandemic</strong>. </p> \n  <p>The changes allow those within the Pacific Labour Scheme, Seasonal Worker Program and working holiday makers to continue to work in agriculture and food processing until the coronavirus crisis has passed.</p> \n  <p>Deputy prime minister <strong>Michael McCormack</strong> said the measure meant supporting businesses, providing job opportunities and securing food supply. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We can\u2019t afford to see fruit rotting on trees and vines and vegetables left unpicked. It is vital our farmers maximise their hard work and economic returns. We are acting to enable seasonal workers to extend their stay and remain lawfully in Australia until they are able to return to their home countries.</p> \n   <p>The agriculture sector relies on an ongoing workforce and we are committed to providing the means for that to continue while ensuring strict health and safety measures are adhered to, including visa holders following self-isolation requirements when they move between regions.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Before moving to other parts of the country, working holiday makers will need to self-isolate for 14 days and register at the <a href=\"http://australia.gov.au/\">Australia.gov.au</a> website. Those who do not comply will face having their visas cancelled. The National Farmers Federation has developed best practice guidance for farmers regarding requirements for the living and working arrangements for farm workers during the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> \n  <p>The key points:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Seasonal Worker Programme and Pacific Labour Scheme workers can extend their stay for up to 12 months to work for approved employers.</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Approved employers will need to continue to ensure recruitment of Australians first.</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Working Holiday Makers who work in agriculture or food processing will be exempt from the six month work limitation with the one employer and eligible for a further visa to keep working in these critical sectors if their current visa is due to expire in the next six months.</strong><br></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T21:55:22.152Z\">at 10.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87abf08f08c9eaf0dae33c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T21:40:24.110Z\">10.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Health minister announces $1.5m to support clinical management of Covid-19 cases</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Greg Hunt </strong>has just issued a statement saying the<strong> </strong>government is investing <strong>$1.5m into support for clinicians to ensure they are given the best advice on managing Covid-19 patients.</strong></p> \n  <p>The National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce will receive the funding from the Medical Research Future Fund to deliver guidelines on the clinical management of patients with suspected or confirmed cases.</p> \n  <p><strong>The Taskforce, which includes a large coalition of peak health professional bodies, will analyse emerging national and international research and data on Covid-19 to provide frontline health care workers with the most up-to-date information and advice</strong>.

Australia\u2019s chief health officer, <strong>Brendan Murphy</strong>, said he was \u201cquietly pleased\u201d with the numbers of new cases of Covid-19 slowing, with the rate of the number of new confirmed cases in single digits. However, community transmissions have been growing. There are now 300 community transmission cases in Sydney, 60 in Melbourne and 30 in Brisbane. Australia is now in the \u201csuppression\u201d phase of containing the virus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/australias-major-measures-to-tackle-coronavirus-are-now-in-place-scott-morrison-says\">the prime minister said on Friday</a>.</p> \n  <p>In other updates:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Last night, New South Wales Health confirmed that to date, there have been <strong>342 confirmed cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in NSW related to Ruby Princess cruise ship passengers</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-update-live-news-australia-queensland-victoria-nsw-qld-tas-act-sa-wa-nt-covid19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e86ea0d8f087564da1e4fda#block-5e86ea0d8f087564da1e4fda\">Defending their handling of the debacle</a>, NSW Health said \u201cTransmission of Covid-19 amongst these passengers could not have been prevented by NSW Health staff.

  "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lil-nas-x\" title=\"\">Lil Nas X</a> was growing up in the small, conservative community of Lithia Springs outside Atlanta, Georgia, he was sure of two things. One: he wanted to be an entertainer. Two: he would never come out of the closet. Only one of those predictions proved to be true.</p> <p>As a teenager who blasted SoundCloud rappers in his headphones and spent all his free time scrolling through Twitter, Lil Nas X quickly learned that it was easier to blend in than risk being different. He knew people who had come out at high school, and saw the pain, bullying and homophobia they experienced. He told himself he wasn\u2019t cut out for it. So he dressed in his cousin\u2019s hand-me-downs and, when he could afford them, purchased safe, muted clothes from Zara and H&amp;M. He watched fashion shows on his smartphone, but never thought he would be brave or rich enough to wear such explicitly queer outfits.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything seemed like a dream or a movie. It was like the world was playing a prank on me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe honest truth is, I planned to die with the secret,\u201d Nas says now of his sexuality. We meet two weeks before the California lockdown, and he digs into the plate of spicy fusilli in front of him, a quick lunch at a West Hollywood restaurant after the Guardian photoshoot and before his afternoon power nap. Hesitant and shy at first, he becomes increasingly playful as our lunch goes on. Today he\u2019s dressed in a matching, traffic cone-orange <a href=\"https://www.heronpreston.com/en/GB\" title=\"\">Heron Preston</a> denim combo \u2013 a contrast to the soft, Edwardian-esque outfits he modelled hours earlier, strutting shirtless in a flower crown while belting out <a href=\"https://youtu.be/pok8H_KF1FA\" title=\"\">Doja Cat\u2019s viral hit Say So</a>.</p> <p>Was that really his plan, I ask, never to be himself? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that changed when I became Lil Nas X.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2eacb57d0450e2b3f0a017f8b7653b081b0eb13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2eacb57d0450e2b3f0a017f8b7653b081b0eb13/504_536_4894_6258/782.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X wearing a Givenchy suit and jewellery by Chrishabana\" width=\"782\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suit: Givenchy.

In 12 months, he has gone from \u201cthe black cowboy with the song on TikTok\u201d to a global superstar. He is simultaneously a Gen-Z success story, red carpet fixture, <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8524235/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-longest-number-one-hot-100\" title=\"\">Billboard record holder</a> and, perhaps most surprising to Lil Nas X himself, a queer figurehead.</p> <p>The key to this success has been his track <a href=\"https://youtu.be/r7qovpFAGrQ\" title=\"\">Old Town Road</a>, an infectious blend of hip hop and country, right down to lyrics such as \u201cRidin\u2019 on a tractor/Lean all in my bladder\u201d and \u201cCowboy hat from Gucci/Wrangler on my booty\u201d. The crossover hit was embraced by everyone from Rolling Stone magazine to teens on TikTok, prompting Lil Nas X to quickly release <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/05/lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-old-town-road-remix-country-enough\" title=\"\">a version featuring country titan Billy Ray Cyrus</a>, known to one generation for his 1992 hit <a href=\"https://youtu.be/byQIPdHMpjc\" title=\"\">Achy Breaky Heart</a>, and another for being Miley\u2019s dad. \u201cEverything seemed like a dream or a movie,\u201d Nas says of his whirlwind 2019, culminating in six Grammy nominations, including best record for Old Town Road and best album for 2019\u2019s 7. \u201cIt was like the world was playing a prank on me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57347a28419aa89661ce98cb4b330a312ec86312\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57347a28419aa89661ce98cb4b330a312ec86312/0_6_5894_7361/801.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X wearing a gold corset and a necklace\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corset: <a href=\"http://zanabayne.com/\">Zana Bayne</a>.

He slept on the floor of his sister\u2019s apartment and was about to drop out of college, giving up on the computer science major he half-heartedly pursued at the University of West Georgia. One day, while procrastinating over his course work, he wrote his first song. The track, Shame, saw Nas lean into the rough-edged, macho qualities of the rap styles he grew up listening to: Drake, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/09/lil-uzi-vert-review\" title=\"\">Lil Uzi Vert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/07/rae-sreummurd-sr3mm-album-review\" title=\"\">Rae Sremmurd</a>. \u201cIt was just me acting really hard,\u201d he admits. \u201cWhich I did a lot of in the beginning. Because it felt like that\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d</p> <p>He took on a straight persona for those early songs, lewdly rapping that he \u201cmight go and fuck ya motha\u201d on the unpolished and unmixed track Nasarati, formerly available on the rapper\u2019s SoundCloud page. Merely mentioning the song makes him cover his face in embarrassment, hiding his high-beam smile, and shaking his head. \u201cYou heard it?\u201d he says when I point out that nothing on the internet ever truly disappears. \u201c<em>Oh</em> <em>goddddd</em>.\u201d</p> <p>He is currently recording his first proper album (he considers 7 to be an EP), and after a year of talking about Old Town Road says he\u2019s tired of answering the same questions. \u201cYou know, \u2018What was it like working with Billy Ray Cyrus?\u2019\u201d he drones, rolling his large, hooded eyes. \u201cIt was great, by the way,\u201d he quickly adds.</p> <p>For better or worse, these questions will not stop any time soon. The song was made in a $20-an-hour studio, on a laptop with a beat found on YouTube (which illegally sampled Nine Inch Nails\u2019 track <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XF_ceFugJjQ\" title=\"\">34 Ghosts IV</a>). Nas had already amassed a 20K following on Twitter, with an account mainly known for memes and jokes. When he posted the song there, his life would change dramatically. \u201cCountry music is evolving,\u201d he wrote, finding a video of a cowboy riding a bull to accompany the song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e728bcfbb52cb0d9df9d10204b55a11e61e321f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e728bcfbb52cb0d9df9d10204b55a11e61e321f1/89_347_3659_2194/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X with Noah Cyrus, Diplo, Billy Ray Cyrus and YoungKio at the Stagecoach festival in California in April 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Noah Cyrus, Diplo, Billy Ray Cyrus and YoungKio at the Stagecoach festival in California in April 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Old Town Road took off on the video-centric TikTok, soundtracking clips of teens shedding their suburban attire for cowboy hats and boots, and switching seamlessly between square dancing and hip hop moves. The genre was dubbed \u201ccountry trap\u201d and quickly charted high on the Billboard Hot Country Songs list. Then Billboard stepped in and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/02/lil-nas-song-removed-from-billboard-not-country-enough\" title=\"\">yanked it off the</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/02/lil-nas-song-removed-from-billboard-not-country-enough\" title=\"\">chart</a>, claiming the track lacked the necessary \u201celements\u201d of the genre, without <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-810844/\" title=\"\">specifying what those elements were</a>. Many accused Billboard\u2019s decision of being rooted in racial bias. White artists have long borrowed sounds from black rappers, infusing their music with an \u201curban\u201d edge, with little to no pushback from genre-based music charts. It felt like the epitome of hypocrisy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m trying to \u2013 no, I will build myself up as a superstar, and fashion will be a big part of that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the outrage that followed Billboard\u2019s decision only helped boost Old Town Road\u2019s popularity. The Billy Ray Cyrus collaboration hit No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early April 2019, holding that position for 18 more weeks and beating the previous record (held jointly by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UXxRyNvTPr8\" title=\"\">One Sweet Day</a>; and Puerto Rican artist Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/72UO0v5ESUo\" title=\"\">Despacito</a>).</p> <p>A year later, Nas says he still struggles to understand why Old Town Road prompted the kneejerk reaction from Billboard\u2019s country purists. \u201cI think maybe it leaned too much on the other side for them,\u201d he says, adding that because his earlier music features more traditional rap sounds, they assumed \u201cOh, this is <em>him</em>? Then this is all he\u2019s allowed to do.\u201d</p> <p>The predictable outcome of all this would have been for Lil Nas X to remain a one-hit wonder, enjoying the flash-in-the-pan success of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kfVsfOSbJY0\" title=\"\">Rebecca Black\u2019s Friday</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0\" title=\"\">P</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0\" title=\"\">sy\u2019s Gangnam Style</a> as the internet moved on.

Grateful that the announcement hadn\u2019t killed his career, he began pushing the limits with increasingly outlandish red-carpet looks. He wore a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2019/nov/25/glitter-glamour-and-theatrics-at-american-music-awards-in-pictures\" title=\"\">neon-green suit</a>, created by the hip black designer Christopher John Rogers, paired with feminine leopard print gloves to the American Music Awards in November last year.

As the red carpet looks grew campier, the reactions became more extreme. Pastor Troy, a hardcore rapper, also from Georgia, went on a homophobic rant in response to Nas\u2019s Grammys look, writing on Instagram and Twitter: \u201cWelp I guess I won\u2019t be winning a Grammy\u2026 If this is what I gotta wear. They love to push this shit on our kids!!\u201d Lil Nas X shared the rant with his 4.3 million Twitter followers and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1222571894483931136\" title=\"\">wrote in response</a>, \u201cDamn i look good in that pic\u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb02c57b12b33b1c441cccd4967c1a8904d63aba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb02c57b12b33b1c441cccd4967c1a8904d63aba/30_0_3561_4451/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X wearing a leather, Barbie-pink Versace suit, with a harness, see-through mesh T-shirt and cowboy hat, holding two awards at the Grammys in January 2020\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In his Versace suit at the Grammys in January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Granitz/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nas credits his stylist, Hodo Musa (who worked on the Guardian Weekend shoot), for his increasingly eye-catching looks. Yes, he possessed a mild interest in fashion as a teen, he says, but he didn\u2019t have an encyclopaedic knowledge of it. \u201cI\u2019m trying to \u2013 no, I <em>will</em> build myself up as a superstar, and fashion will be a big part of that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It\u2019s perhaps strange that, unlike musicians from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/apr/06/troye-sivan-youtuber-singer-actor-fashion-queer-pride-laura-snapes\" title=\"\">Troye Sivan</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-ocean\" title=\"\">Frank Ocean</a> (whose <a href=\"https://youtu.be/fYGPcfUqzL0\" title=\"\">track Biking</a> holds a top spot in Nas\u2019s playlist right now), he does not explore his sexuality in his music. \u201cI 100% want to represent the LGBT community,\u201d he says, adding that he also worries about the safety and wellbeing of fans who may grapple with the decision to come out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to encourage them to do something they don\u2019t 100% want to do. Especially in, like, middle school or high school. Because it\u2019s just super hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier for me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not depending on anybody. There\u2019s no one who\u2019s going to kick me out of the house \u2013 nobody to start treating me shitty.\u201d This may not be the case for \u201canother 20-year-old who doesn\u2019t quite have it figured out and still lives with his parents\u201d. What about his own parents? \u201cMy family knows now. But it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever brought up or we speak about. We\u2019re quiet on it. Nobody\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you got a boyfriend?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Does he want that question? He tilts his head and thinks long and hard. \u201cIt would have to be something I grew used to hearing. I don\u2019t want it to be something we never talk about. Because what about the kids in my family? I would like it to be a healthy medium between, \u2018Who are you <em>fucking</em>?\u2019 and just not saying anything.\u201d</p> <p>For the record, Nas\u2019s love life remains a mystery, despite him saying, last year, that he was \u201csomewhat\u201d in a relationship. His family \u2013 which includes seven brothers and sisters \u2013 also remains behind the scenes. \u201cI should talk to them more,\u201d is all he will say. He is not in contact with his mother, and hasn\u2019t been for a long time. When pressed on this, he becomes tight-lipped, saying only that, \u201cPeople have to be willing to help themselves first before you can help them.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>My family know I\u2019m gay now. But it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever brought up or we speak about. We\u2019re quiet on it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Piping hot mozzarella sticks are brought to our table, and he eagerly bites into one as the song Lucid Dreams plays in the background, Nas singing along softly. It\u2019s a track by Juice WRLD, a rapper who also created a massive internet fanbase for himself, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/08/rapper-juice-wrld-dies-age-21-chicago\" title=\"\">dying of a drug overdose</a> late last year. When the news broke, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1203913545127088128\" title=\"\">Nas performed a cover of Lucid Dreams</a> on stage.</p> <p>In many ways, the two young artists are sharply divergent examples of what sudden, internet-born fame can look like. Since the success of Old Town Road, Nas has had to rethink what he shares. For one, he no longer runs the meme accounts on which he mastered the art of posting viral tweets and jokes. He refuses to own up to running @NasMaraj, a Nicki Minaj fan account, despite sleuthing fans and journalists all but confirming he did through analysis of IP addresses and time stamps. When asked about being a Nicki Minaj \u201cbarb\u201d, or superfan, he gives a devilish grin and speaks into the recorder lying on the table, as if delivering a message directly to the internet. \u201cQuiet on that,\u201d he teases. \u201cUm, that\u2019s never happened.\u201d I can\u2019t quite tell what he would be embarrassed about, other than the idea of fanboying for another rapper.</p> <p>But Nas has to be careful of his digital footprint. He learned this lesson the hard way in February when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1226883959180734470\" title=\"\">he tweeted</a> a glamorous red-carpet photo of R&amp;B singer SZA with a line that suggested they were dating. He wrote, \u201cclean for her. cook for her and everything i do is for her. and if she cheats? that is on me!\u201d As with a lot of memes, the joke didn\u2019t stand up to a lot of scrutiny; it was just Nas\u2019s way of heaping praise on SZA. But many took him literally. \u201cOne morning show on YouTube was like, \u2018Lil Nas X says he\u2019s not gay any more!\u2019 And it has a hundred thousand views.\u201d He worries more that when he is being serious, people will think he\u2019s kidding. Case in point: he felt compelled to write \u201cno joking\u201d before asking his Twitter followers how best to provide <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1235590156364550144\" title=\"\">help during the coronavirus</a> pandemic.</p> <p>He is even more cautious when it comes to politics. Last year, the first openly gay Democratic presidential nominee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\" title=\"\">Pete Buttigieg</a>, asked him to appear in a campaign video. Nas turned down the offer. \u201cI\u2019m not too into politics,\u201d he says now. \u201cI don\u2019t know his political history or motives. The only thing I know\u2026 Wasn\u2019t he from the Democratic party?\u201d <em>Yes.</em> \u201cSee. All I know is he\u2019s from the Democratic party and he\u2019s gay. So it\u2019s like\u2026 I don\u2019t want to base my support off, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re gay, I\u2019m going to support you.\u2019\u201d His words are coming faster now. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re gay. But I don\u2019t know everything you\u2019re planning when you\u2019re running the entire country.\u201d He returns to eating his food, retreating back into his calm, subdued demeanour as quickly as he came out of it. \u201cBut, yeah. That was the reason I said no.\u201d</p> <p>Later, Nas tells me that politics depresses him. As a teenager, he closely followed the protests over police brutality and mass shootings. It frustrated and saddened him to see that nothing really changed. \u201cIt got hard to leave the house,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess ever since that, I\u2019ve tried to stay away. Politics gets me very upset.\u201d</p> <p>The more Nas talks, the more it becomes obvious that what he is deeply suspicious of is less politics than the individual Americans delivering it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I support this one person because they\u2019re doing this one thing. Because I don\u2019t know what else they\u2019re doing, or what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d He says he hasn\u2019t yet registered to vote in this year\u2019s presidential election, but \u201cof course I\u2019m going to vote. I encourage my fans to vote.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07a9541d131730355c5dd2171fd3d01fe141956d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07a9541d131730355c5dd2171fd3d01fe141956d/0_0_5778_6964/830.jpg\" alt=\"Lil Nas X topless with a tulip behind his ear\" width=\"830\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trousers: <a href=\"https://www.heronpreston.com/en/GB\">Heron Preston</a>.

He reads books about Buddhism to \u201cget a better understanding of life and how to handle things\u201d, and says he\u2019s inspired by HBO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/03/is-euphoria-the-most-shocking-teen-show-ever\" title=\"\">teen drama Euphoria</a>. \u201cI would love to do a version of that somehow,\u201d he says of the boundary-pushing show that features a trans lead, queer relationships and lots of drug use. The songs on his new album will explicitly explore his queer identity, he says; his form of social advocacy will be \u201cthrough my art\u201d.</p> <p> We pay the check. Nas is ready for a power nap. After that, he\u2019s attending a concert by Noah Cyrus, the youngest daughter of Billy Ray.</p> <p>I sense that Lil Nas X is still not done coming out to the world.

  "<p>\u201cEscapism\u201d is an operative word when you\u2019re hunkered down under quarantine and surveying your home viewing options, but how you interpret that is up to you. Many will opt for fiction and fantasy, for the furthest possible reaches from the glum news of the moment. Yet documentary films have their place in this comfort system too: they may not take you to another universe entirely, but at a time when a single global crisis unavoidably consumes all media attention and almost all personal conversation, the window they provide into other realities, past and present, can be a vital way to clear your head of current noise.<br><br>Netflix is a reliable source of good ones, and they\u2019ve landed one of the year\u2019s best so far in <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/81001496\">Crip Camp</a></strong><strong>, </strong>an audience award winner at Sundance in January that manages to be a crowdpleaser without softening tricky subjects or taking sentimental shortcuts. It\u2019s the second feature documentary to emerge from the Netflix-allied, Barack and Michelle Obama-founded production company Higher Ground: the first, last year\u2019s outstanding <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/17/netflix-american-factory-sundance-barack-and-michelle-obama-higher-ground-the-third-wife\">American Factory</a></em>, went on to win the Oscar.<br><br>It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see <em>Crip Camp</em> earn similar plaudits for directors Nicole Newnham and James LeBrecht, the latter coming to this project with some personal investment. Born with spina bifida, and a disability rights activist since the early 70s, LeBrecht was once an attendee of Camp Jened, the groundbreaking New York state summer camp for young disabled people on which this moving film is centred. From 1951 to 1977, it was a place where teens with a variety of disabilities had their first experience of living as a community free from overprotective minders or oppressive bullies; many had their first, formative stirrings of both sexual and political consciousness along the way.</p> <p>The directors blend heartening archive footage from the camp and contemporary interviews with its past beneficiaries, expanding from a nostalgia piece into a stirring overview of how the American disability rights movement hatched and grew from the spirit of empowered unity that the camp stood for. Judy Heumann, a former camp leader who became a leading activist and legislator for the independent living movement, emerges as the most prominent and galvanising hero in a film of many. From its blunt title\u2019s defiant reclaiming of an ugly slur, <em>Crip Camp</em> is frank and forthright, warmly soulful but free of condescension: there aren\u2019t many better new films out there right now.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrIs22plz0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XRrIs22plz0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrIs22plz0\">Watch a trailer for Crip Camp</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>If you\u2019re still on a documentary bent, Netflix continues to provide: their wholly riveting (if less uplifting) new docuseries <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80233339\">How to Fix a Drug Scandal</a></strong> started streaming earlier this week, and unpicks the more-than-meets-the-eye story of Sonja Farak, a disgraced lab chemist convicted of stealing the drugs she was supposed to be testing.

Unlike other tech firms, like Uber which can do deliveries instead of driving people, it can\u2019t diversify. There\u2019s nothing Airbnb can do to make money.</p> <p>\u201cEverything indicates that Airbnb income around the world has just stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt [coronavirus and lockdown] has exposed the Airbnb business model, and it\u2019s going to pull thousands and thousands of people down with it. People [hosts] have gone into it as an absolute business and they\u2019re in a very, very difficult situation.\u201d</p> <p>To try and make some income from their empty properties landlords have flooded the rental market with their Airbnb flats. On Edinburgh\u2019s Princes Street, for example, there are 209 Airbnb listings on a road of just 494 homes. Property portal Rightmove said the number of new rentals coming on to the market in the week the UK lockdown started increased by 45% in London, up 55% in Brighton, 62% in Edinburgh and 78% in Bath. It\u2019s a similar story the world over with a 61% increase in Dublin and 41% in Prague.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Holway said many hosts are reliant on Airbnb income to pay mortgages on not one but several properties, while others \u201crent flats off commercial landlords and then seek to make a profit renting it out on short lets on Airbnb \u2013 that\u2019s not going to happen now\u201d.</p> <p>Sheffield based entrepreneur Alex Milburn claims to have made \u201c\u00a31,000,000 in Airbnb sales in 12 months\u201d and now markets his \u201crent to rent\u201d strategy in <a href=\"https://events.tomheaney.com/R2R-Training?r_done=1\">one-day seminars costing \u00a3997 (plus VAT)</a>.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include: </p> <h2>China mourns \u2018martyrs\u2019 and victims</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/china-mourns-covid-19-whistleblowers-as-trump-dismisses-us-face-mask-advice\">People across China</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/china-mourns-covid-19-whistleblowers-as-trump-dismisses-us-face-mask-advice\"> paused for three minutes</a> on Saturday morning to remember the more than 3,000 patients and medical workers who have died during the coronavirus outbreak. Citizens stood with heads bowed, while cars, trains and ships sounded their horns, and air-raid sirens rang out. Among the 14 health workers and police declared to be remembered was Li Wenliang, the doctor who was reprimanded for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d before being exonerated. The country reported 19 new cases on Friday, most of which were linked to foreign travel, and more than 1,030 patients who are asymptomatic are under medical observation.</p> <h2>Fresh warnings on global economy</h2> <p>World Bank Group president David Malpass said the rapidly spreading pandemic was expected to cause a \u201cmajor global recession\u201d that would likely hit the poorest and most vulnerable countries the hardest. He echoed comments by the IMF\u2019s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, who called on advanced economies to step up their efforts to help emerging markets and developing countries survive the economic and health impacts. \u201cThis is a crisis like no other,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have witnessed the world economy coming to a standstill. We are now in recession. It is way worse than the global financial crisis\u201d of 2008.</p> <h2>Trump ignores latest US health advice</h2> <p>Health officials in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/im-not-going-to-do-it-trump-refutes-his-own-administrations-advice-on-masks\">US advised Americans to cover their faces when outside</a>. But President Donald Trump has undermined the guidance, saying he can\u2019t see himself wearing one when he greets \u201cpresidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens\u201d. Melania Trump later urged everyone to take the official advice seriously.</p> <h2>UK endures deadliest day so far</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/03/uk-coronavirus-live-emergency-nightingale-hospital-opens-today-matt-hancock-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e8734358f087564da1e539d#block-5e8734358f087564da1e539d\">It was confirmed that 684 more people have died in UK hospitals</a>, bringing the total to 3,605 and making the 24 hours to 5pm on Thursday (BST) the deadliest since the outbreak began. The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care says 173,784 people have been tested; of whom 38,168 were positive.</p> <h2>US prisoners freed</h2> <p>US attorney general William Barr has issued an emergency order for the release of more federal inmates into home confinement, warning that the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is facing emergency conditions. Barr has given priority to vulnerable inmates housed in federal prisons that have been hardest hit by Covid-19, including facilities such as Oakdale in Louisiana, Elkton in Ohio and Danbury in Connecticut, where inmates have died. The BOP said on Friday 91 inmates and 50 staff in its 122 institutions had fallen ill, though reports suggest the number of those affected is much higher.</p> <h2>Falklands confirm first case</h2> <p>The Falkland Islands government confirmed the territory\u2019s first case. The patient has been hospitalised since 31 March and developed a range of Covid-19 symptoms, tested positive for the virus, and was now in a stable condition in isolation.</p> <h2>Crackdown in Central America</h2> <p>Police have detained thousands across Central America for violating rules put in place by their governments to curb coronavirus transmission. Honduran authorities said about 2,250 people had been arrested for violating the curfew imposed since mid-March while Guatemalan authorities said 5,705 people had been detained for leaving their homes without justification.</p> <p>In Panama, more than 5,000 people have been detained in recent weeks for violating curfew rules; another 424 people have been held for not complying with recent rules that limit men and women leaving the house on alternate days.<br><br>Meanwhile, in El Salvador, 712 people have been detained for failing to comply with the mandatory home quarantine decreed by President Nayib Bukele, and have been taken to containment centres.</p>",
  "<p>Lockdown day 10 in south-east London. A loud rhythmic tweeting is emanating from the cherry plum tree in my back garden. A great tit? Blue tit? I catch a glimpse; too small for a great tit, not as colourful.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know my birdsongs beyond the basics, but I remember a friend imitating calls to coax birds nearer so he could identify them. I have an idea and grab my phone and Google \u201ccoal tit song\u201d. I press play and the rival tweeting produces instant results. Hopping from branch to branch towards me a delightful but agitated coal tit emerges and alights on a branch barely two metres away (I think it knows). Is it angry or amorous? My exhilaration at our proximity turns to doubt and guilt \u2013 I\u2019ve used gadgetry to disrupt the natural world. What was I thinking? The coal tit flies off, its song tinged with irritation.</p> <p>Clearly, playing birdsong on phones can produce results but could this be unethical? I decide to ask Chris Packham through the Facebook page he\u2019s set up, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/sibirdclub/?fref=mentions&amp;__tn__=K-R\">Self-Isolating Bird Club </a>, which is crewed by thousands of nature enthusiasts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0275c62096b4d9ad6827bcb2d69c30a0a46dccff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0275c62096b4d9ad6827bcb2d69c30a0a46dccff/0_0_817_327/500..jpg\" alt=\"Self-isolating bird club\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Packham set up a Facebook page for lockdown birders</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There can be few better online platforms than this in showing how modern, accessible tech has revolutionised local wildlife reporting. People have put mini cameras in nest boxes, on feeders; installed trail cameras on patios; and remote-triggered DSLRs have been placed in tree canopies. This stuff is no longer the preserve of well resourced global-roaming wildlife film production teams.</p> <p>Packham says of the daily morning live feed, the focal point of the group, which has attracted more than 500,000 viewers daily: \u201cWe\u2019re doing it all on mobile phones and Skype with earpods, and I\u2019ve got a digital microscope. Fabian Harrison, a former RSPB guy, is mixing it in his bedroom in Norwich. It\u2019s Dad\u2019s Army makes TV. It\u2019s very real and in the moment but with no campaigning \u2013 no banging on about shooting or anything. It\u2019s all just joy and enjoying wildlife and getting people to engage. As long as it [lockdown] lasts, we\u2019ll just keep going.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25a70b1900c165ae739c2082286e5a0be0a76ea4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25a70b1900c165ae739c2082286e5a0be0a76ea4/0_0_5760_3840/1000..jpg\" alt=\"BBC Springwatch presenter Chris Packham at RSPB Minsmere, Suffolk.

Each day, the public posts gems such as barn owls evicting jackdaws that had attempted to squat their nest box; sea eagles being mobbed by red kites; hedgehogs scurrying under garden furniture; and adders emerging into the spring sunshine.</p> <p>Michaela Strachan, Packham\u2019s colleague on the BBC\u2019s Springwatch programme, who has also featured on the Self Isolating show from her home in South Africa, tells me that even she has now changed the way she enjoys wildlife: \u201cA whole new wave of birdwatching is happening. Amazingly, I\u2019ve never taken the time to sit down and watch birds on my feeders.\u201d</p> <p>Strachan says the appeal of placing cameras in the garden comes from a different place to the motivations of expert birdwatchers: \u201cThe birds become like family. Right now our lives have never been so uncertain. You know the birds are coming to feed every day\u2026 we look for those kind of certainties. The mental health benefits are proven. When I took those two hours in my garden, I instantly felt better.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a16fd349ec26ce13bf58a9a310cbe931656d855\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a16fd349ec26ce13bf58a9a310cbe931656d855/0_0_5760_3840/1000..jpg\" alt=\"BBC Springwatch presenter Michaela Strachan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michaela Strachan: \u2018I\u2019ve never taken the time to sit down and watch birds on my feeders\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others go further, suggesting that watching animals is instinctive behaviour.

OK?\u201d</p> <p>Trump went on. Karl, he said, was \u201ca wise guy\u201d too.</p> <p>What viewers may not have known is that the two men go way back.</p> <p>They first met in 1994 when Karl was a cub reporter at the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/\">New York Post </a>and Trump, a millionaire property developer, gave him a tour of Trump Tower, where newly married couple Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley were staying. The result was a front-page scoop: \u201cInside Michael\u2019s Honeymoon Hideaway\u201d.</p> <p>Now president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, Karl recounts the episode both at the start of his new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Front-Row-at-Trump-Show/dp/1524745626\">Front Row at the Trump Show,</a> and in a phone interview with the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing that blew me away about that moment, my first real introduction to Donald Trump, was the way he understood exactly what my job was and how to make a compelling story, and the way he operated so quickly,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t going through handlers and PR advisers and spokespeople. It was Donald Trump: \u2018Come on over, let me show you what I got.\u2019 There was no filter. It was him and he was incredibly, in a way, charming and we had a great story and he was willing to break rules to tell it.</p> <p>\u201cThere was intense security all around, keeping the press at bay, and here\u2019s Donald Trump bringing me right up to Michael\u2019s apartment, showing me their secret vehicle to get in and out of the place. He didn\u2019t play it the way it\u2019s normally played.\u201d</p> <p>Karl, 52, adds: \u201cI knew that I could call him from that point on whenever I wanted to and he would be accessible and willing to play along and loved to be in the mix. The idea that I would go on to become a White House reporter, president of the White House Correspondents Association, and he would be the president is kind of mind-blowing.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s gut instinct for publicity and reptilian genius for making media weather would be evident in his 2016 election campaign and throughout his presidency. The White House press secretary\u2019s daily briefing was killed off and replaced by \u201cchopper talk\u201d, before Trump boarded Marine One on the South Lawn. He has turned the daily coronavirus updates into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">a new form of campaign rally.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b8f7b89de3504d9a78b540e44dbfc24e7a431d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b8f7b89de3504d9a78b540e44dbfc24e7a431d6/0_289_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karl with Sarah Sanders, then White House press secretary, at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl with Sarah Sanders, then White House press secretary, at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Karl reflects: \u201cWe\u2019ve had three White House press secretaries, we\u2019ve had \u2013 I guess depends on how you count \u2013 three or four communications directors in the Trump White House, but in reality we\u2019ve really only had one. Donald Trump has always been the press secretary, the spokesperson, the communications director for Donald Trump. That was true in 1994 when I first encountered him and it\u2019s absolutely true in 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Karl finds himself promoting a book in the middle of a pandemic. He has been doing TV interviews from remote locations. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XwIwwG0u_E\">Stephen Colbert teased him</a> for speaking from a home office where his Emmy awards were prominently displayed.</p> <p>One of Karl\u2019s most memorable anecdotes is about 10 November 2016. It has become a commonplace to quote the musical Hamilton\u2019s song The Room Where It Happens but Karl was genuinely in there, witnessing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/barack-obama-donald-trump-white-house-meeting-transition\">the Oval Office meeting</a> between President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump (and snapping a few photos from 5ft away). And this collision of matter and anti-matter produced a surprise.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the first time that I saw what seemed to be a humbled Donald Trump,\u201d Karl recalls. \u201cHe seemed to be taken with the moment. I was almost imagining he\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, my God, what did I get myself into?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cNobody thought he was going to win. I don\u2019t think he really thought he was going to win and here he was in the Oval Office, a place where he was gonna be returning in just a short period of time as the president and all the weight of all that meant and the problems he was gonna be dealing with and the responsibility he was going to have.</p> <p>\u201cHe seemed humbled. He seemed a little bit freaked out. Now, that didn\u2019t last: we never saw that look again, really. That was a fleeting moment but it really struck me.\u201d</p> <p>When Trump was asked if he intended to ask Obama or any of his other predecessors for advice on dealing with the coronavirus crisis, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-8/\">he replied:</a> \u201cI don\u2019t want to disturb them, bother them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to learn much. And, you know, I guess you could say that there\u2019s probably a natural inclination not to call.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Enemy of the people\u2019</h2> <p>For more than three years, Karl has been on Trump\u2019s trail, even receiving a hug from Kanye West in the Oval Office. He has also witnessed Trump\u2019s war on the media with barbs such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/07/donald-trump-war-on-the-media-oppo-research\">\u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d</a> \u2013 a phrase which, Karl notes, the Nazis used in 1934.

So you see Erdo\u011fan and Putin. You see it\u2019s been documented in Kazakhstan and in Egypt. You see authoritarian leaders echoing the precise words of Donald Trump, talking about \u2018fake news\u2019 as reporters are thrown in jail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/11/the-enemy-of-the-people-review-cnn-jim-acosta-trump\">The Enemy of the People review: CNN's Jim Acosta takes Trump's bait again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe other thing that I think is really troubling is when the president calls real news \u2018fake news\u2019, when he suggests that the act of being an aggressive reporter is \u2018treasonous\u2019, it has undermined the faith in an independent free press among a significant segment of the population. That\u2019s a big problem. I do worry about that a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s use of the bully pulpit for his daily coronavirus briefings has led to renewed calls for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/us-coronavirus-outbreak-donald-trump-media-latest\">press corps to be more combative.</a> In his book, however, Karl cautions against reporters behaving like a political opposition or the anti-Trump \u201cresistance\u201d.</p> <p>He explains: \u201cThere is a breathlessly negative tone to a lot of the news coverage of Trump and Trump\u2019s provided ample material to fuel that, but what happens is a segment of the population sees it and tunes it all out. It all becomes noise and everything is the outrage of the day and then it\u2019s hard to differentiate between a real outrage and an outrage that is maybe not as important.</p> <p>\u201cI mention the case of one CNN reporter literally getting up on live television and saying reporters should be protesting the president in <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/dc30.htm\">Lafayette Square.</a> We are not protesters. We are not the resistance. We need to report on a president fairly and objectively and a lot of that\u2019s going to end up being negative.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cYour north star is to provide objective and balanced news and let\u2019s remember that this president has branded the news media as the opposition party, so when those working for mainstream news organisations act like the opposition party, you\u2019re actually playing right into his media strategy.\u201d</p> <p>Karl\u2019s book draws on fresh research and interviews, including with John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff. In 2017, Karl writes, Kelly had to talk the national security adviser, HR McMaster, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/jonathan-karl-front-row-at-the-trump-show-kelly-venezuela-e9025e17-8486-47d2-abdf-16d771877812.html\">out of passing on the president\u2019s order</a> for a Venezuela war plan to the Pentagon.</p> <p>Now, however, as Trump faces the biggest test of his life, most voices of restraint are gone.</p> <p>Karl says: \u201cUp until this moment he\u2019s had a series of people in the White House who have tried to steer him or put some guardrails up. John Kelly made the most aggressive effort to try to protect Donald Trump from his most destructive tendencies.</p> <p>\u201cIt is all Donald Trump right now and I think that\u2019s potentially dangerous. Any president, no matter how competent, needs to have strong advisers. He\u2019s got the medical people that are advising him on this, sure, but those are not on his West Wing staff there.</p> <p>\u201cThis is truly Donald Trump calling all the shots and doing it by his gut instinct. So I think that is potentially worrisome, as is the way the truth has been undermined, the credibility of the White House and also the credibility of the press corps that he\u2019s tried so hard to undermine. Both of those things make this crisis harder to deal with day to day.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018An exhausting story\u2019</h2> <p>As the title of his book implies, Karl already had a front-row seat to history, reporting on the most peculiar president of this or any other age. Now there is a once-in-a-century global pandemic added to the mix. What a time to be alive. Is a part of him secretly enjoying the daily adrenaline rush?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ede5cd049718520af46e4ad5146ae02f93122e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ede5cd049718520af46e4ad5146ae02f93122e1/0_0_6000_4000/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Trump speaks during the daily briefing on the novel coronavirus in the Brady Briefing Room at the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump speaks during the daily briefing on the novel coronavirus in the Brady Briefing Room at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an exhausting story,\u201d he says, suddenly sounding weary. \u201cYes, there is something rewarding about people wanting to know the story and the interest and the fascination in it, but it\u2019s exhausting and some of it\u2019s truly been troubling.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/22/a-citizens-guide-to-beating-donald-trump-review-dispatches-from-a-time-before-the-virus\">A Citizen's Guide to Beating Donald Trump review: dispatches from a time before the virus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He elaborates: \u201cI think, especially in light of what we\u2019re seeing with this pandemic, there is something very dangerous that is unfolding here.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re at a point where nearly half the country doesn\u2019t believe what this president and White House says and we have nearly half the rest of the country that\u2019s been told not to believe what they see in a newspaper or see in television news or any other form of mainstream news.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a deeply troubling, deeply dangerous place to be where there isn\u2019t a shared agreement and sense of some basic facts, especially now where reliable information, and believing you have reliable information, can literally be a matter of life and death.\u201d</p>",

As they grow, the roots contract, hauling themselves down more than 10cm into the woodland floor.</p> <p>Once a year, each plant sends up a few long pointed leaves to pierce the surface. In Dorset, these begin to appear in January, poking out of the mulch like bunches of green plastic straws. The smooth, slightly shiny leaves are triangular in section, with one side developing a folded groove. Despite their robust appearance, the plants are highly sensitive to crushing. Trample them and you damage their ability to photosynthesise, and they can take a long time to recover.</p> <p>By mid-March, in sheltered places and sunny weather, they begin to lift flower stems, each tipped with a head of greeny-purple buds. Bluebells are part of the <em>Asparagaceae</em> family and it\u2019s at this stage, when their poisonous ends look a little like asparagus spears, that the botanical relationship is clearest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d2cd97602135d3ad4c302038b0bc4d4928a60b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d2cd97602135d3ad4c302038b0bc4d4928a60b2/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A first bluebell in the wood\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A first bluebell in the wood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sara Hudston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another few days and the stems lengthen, the ends droop and the bells begin to hang in elongated drops, each on its own thin stalk.

Bumblebees sometimes bite through the bottom of the flower in their hunger to reach the nectary.</p> <p>This April, many of us will be starved of outdoor sweetness and will have to imagine the perfume and colour seeping through the woods.</p>",

But Joseph Maguire, who was acting director of National Intelligence at the time, decided it was not urgent and tried to withhold the complaint from Congress.</p> <p>Under huge political pressure, the White House eventually released the complaint, triggering an investigation by the Democratic-controlled House, which charged Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress and voted to impeach a president for only the third time in history.</p> <p>Trump was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate in February in what critics described as a show trial with no documents or witnesses allowed. Nevertheless, the president claimed he had been vindicated following a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and purged two officials who testified.</p> <p>Trump chose Atkinson, who had served in the justice department for 15 years, for inspector general in late 2017 and he was confirmed in May 2018.

The coronavirus taskforce was to be led by the vice-president, Mike Pence, who has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/07/mike-pence-indiana-hiv-outbreak-coronavirus\">widely criticized</a> for his handling of a 2015 HIV outbreak when governor of Indiana.</p> \n<p>Trump is also increasingly relying on his son-in-law <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/01/jared-kushner-coronavirus-response-160553\">Jared Kushner</a>, who made his <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/kushner-makes-first-appearance-at-coronavirus-briefing/ar-BB1262ef\">first appearance</a> at the taskforce briefing on Thursday.

What began as an inability to get diagnostic testing going on a mass scale has developed into a sluggish mobilization of the federal government, a stuttering deployment of the Defense Production Act to enlist the firepower of corporations, and a stand-back, almost detached approach that has allowed state governors to take the lead in what Konyndyk called the birth of \u201c50-state anarchy\u201d.</p> \n<p>One of the few proactive measures taken by Trump was to impose a partial travel ban on China and Europe. Scientists told him the move would only delay the advance of Covid-19 in the US, it could never stop it. Again, he didn\u2019t listen.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump thought in terms of a wall. Put a wall around China and the virus won\u2019t come to the US. He was out of step with all the experts around him,\u201d Topol said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0700fc5ba356fb7970e17f724b75952b4c78a68a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0700fc5ba356fb7970e17f724b75952b4c78a68a/0_0_4000_2667/1000..jpg\" alt=\"EMS personnel outside Emergency Department, St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx on March 28, 2020 in New York City.

His <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca\">first exploration</a> of the subject, a data-driven plea to take the disease seriously posted on Medium in early March, received 40m views.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday he published his <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-out-of-many-one-36b886af37e9\">updated research</a>. It shows America\u2019s curve of confirmed cases rising more steeply than that of any other country in the world.</p> \n<p>Three weeks ago, Pueyo reminds us, the US had <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html\">fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases</a> at a time when Trump was <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-president-bolsonaro-brazil-working-dinner-west-palm-beach-fl/\">telling the world</a>: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not concerned at all. No, I\u2019m not. No, we\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d</p> \n<p>Now it stands at almost a quarter of a million. \u201cThis is what exponential growth looks like,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa27f770298203f683e5dec1edabb73ec19de468\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa27f770298203f683e5dec1edabb73ec19de468/0_0_2973_1982/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump arrives behind Dr Anthony Fauci for a coronavirus taskforce briefing at the White House on 31 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump arrives behind Dr Anthony Fauci for a coronavirus taskforce briefing at the White House on 31 March.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Having hit the Democratic-controlled high-density urban centers first \u2013 San Francisco and Seattle, then New York and New Jersey, now Detroit \u2013 the virus is marching inexorably in the direction of the more rural southern and heartland states that happen to form the crucible of Trump\u2019s base.</p> \n<p>Many of those states followed the lead set by Trump and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/13/fox-news-accused-of-downplaying-coronavirus-as-it-moves-to-protect-staff\">Fox News</a>, remaining relaxed about the threat and moving astonishingly slowly to put physical distancing controls in place. Florida, under its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has echoed Trump\u2019s approach and only imposed a statewide <a href=\"https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/stay-at-home-order-to-begin-in-florida-heres-what-you-can-do-what-will-be-open-and-more\">stay-at-home order</a> on Friday despite having the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">sixth-largest tally</a> of confirmed cases in the country.</p> \n<p>Georgia and Mississippi <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html\">followed suit</a>. Some Republican states including Oklahoma and <a href=\"https://www.wistv.com/2020/04/01/state-representatives-call-gov-mcmaster-issue-stay-at-home-order/\">South Carolina</a> still have no statewide mandatory stay-at-home orders.</p> \n<p>Pueyo points out that Republican voters are additionally vulnerable as they have a higher age profile than Democratic voters. Coronavirus makes no distinctions as to party, but it does prey on the elderly.</p> \n<p>So it is one of the great paradoxes of Trump\u2019s pandemic that he may have put many of his own loyal supporters in mortal peril. As Konyndyk put it: \u201cTrump has endangered his own supporters by sending out a message in contradiction to the science, and they believed him.\u201d</p>",

the spread of the coronavirus after cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cNew cases have been reported in some of the most vulnerable countries with fragile health systems,\u201d said Ahmed Al-Mandhari, the WHO\u2019s director for the Eastern Mediterranean region, which includes Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia and Djibouti, as well as Middle Eastern states.</p> <p><strong>\u201cEven in countries with stronger heath systems, we have seen a worrying spike in the numbers of cases and deaths reported,\u201d</strong> he said in a statement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e74dd0d4a22df93b97dc8d6bad85d831f29a263e\"> <img

just over 50,000 cases, confirmed coronavirus numbers have been relatively low in the Middle East compared to Europe, the United States and Asia.</p> <p>But health officials fear that cases of the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus are under-reported and that many countries with weak governments and health systems eroded by conflict will struggle to cope.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot stress enough the urgency of the situation,\u201d said Mandhari. \u201cThe increasing numbers of cases show that transmission is rapidly occurring at local and community levels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe still have a window of opportunity, but this window is slowly closing day by day,\u201d he added.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e867a2c8f08532a0e667004\" class=\"block

I\u2019m Alison Rourke and will be steering our coverage for the next few hours. </p> <p>As the number of infections rose past one million, and deaths passed 50,000, countries, including the United Sates, are taking increasing measures to combat the virus. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has warned his state will run out of ventilators in six days.</p> <p>Donald Trump has issued orders to use the defence production act to make ventilators. The president has also confirmed in his daily press briefing that he has tested negative for Covid-19. The US now has just under 240,000 infections and 5, 798 deaths according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. </p> <p>Here\u2019s a summary of the other top points:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Global cases of the virus have passed one million</strong>, according to figures collected by researchers from Johns Hopkins University. Deaths worldwide have passed 50,000. <br></li> <li>In terms of deaths,<strong> Italy remains the country worst affected by the outbreak</strong>, with 13,915 fatalities, followed by Spain, with 10,003 deaths. The US is now the third worst affected country, with 5,316 total deaths.</li> <li><strong>Governments in the Middle East</strong> need to act fast to limit the spread of the coronavirus after cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. </li> <li><strong>The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock,</strong> said the government was hoping to build an \u201cat-scale\u201d diagnostics industry to reach 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, as he unveiled his five-pillar strategy. Just 5,000 NHS staff have been tested so far.</li> <li>More than 6.65 million people <strong>have filed for unemployment benefits in the US last week</strong>, according to the latest official figures, highlighting the devastating economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the American economy.</li> <li><strong>The pro-independence leader of Catalonia,</strong> the region of Spain hardest hit by the coronavirus after Madrid, has abandoned his government\u2019s initial reluctance to seek help from the Spanish army, saying any assistance would be gratefully received. </li> </ul> <p>You can get in touch with me via email alison.rourke@guardian.co.uk.
