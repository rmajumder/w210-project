  "<p>Few athletes, coaches and administrators across Australia\u2019s Olympic sports will ever forget this past week. As national sporting organisations were busily complying with a directive to shut down training centres and other facilities, their chief executives on Monday received notification of an extraordinary Australian Olympic Committee board meeting. They were invited to join a late-morning teleconference, where the news was delivered: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/australian-athletes-told-to-prepare-for-olympic-games-in-2021\">Australia would cease preparations for a 2020 Olympics in Tokyo</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/olympic-postponement-inevitable-but-finding-right-way-to-do-it-caused-delay\">How Tokyo's 2020 hopes turned to ashes \u2013 but can rise again in 2021 | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was unexpected,\u201d said Jacco Verhaeren, Swimming Australia\u2019s head coach, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-olympics-to-be-postponed-to-2021-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic\">the Games were officially postponed</a>. \u201cThis is the right thing to do right now, but it is still a tough message \u2013 particularly for our athletes and coaches who have been working for years to get to this point.\u201d</p> <p>Cycling Australia\u2019s performance director Simon Jones was at the velodrome in Adelaide with his sprint riders, as they completed a final, social-distancing compliant training session before the arena shuts indefinitely. The AOC had written directly to all athletes on the Olympic selection long-list, but these riders had not yet seen their emails; Jones had to break the news. \u201cIt was a bit of a shock,\u201d said Jones. \u201cYou have to let people absorb the information.\u201d The team had already been hit hard by the news last week that a staff member was in hospital with coronavirus.</p> <p>Annette Edmondson, an endurance rider in Jones\u2019 squad, had woken on Monday to the latest international developments before setting out for a morning ride. \u201cThe scenario has been changing so quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cWe went for a bike ride in the morning, and by the end of it more international news was trickling through. By the time the official announcement came, we were already 90% sure it was coming.\u201d Just six days ago, Edmondson and 14 colleagues had been selected for Tokyo. \u201cMonday was an interesting day \u2013 it is going to take time to process,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The AOC\u2019s withdrawal pre-empted the official postponement of Tokyo 2020 by the International Olympic Committee, announced late on Tuesday. With the coronavirus\u2019s disruption growing by the day, the AOC had not been prepared to wait. \u201cIt is a big call, but it puts the safety of athletes and staff as the number one priority,\u201d said Jones.</p> <p>With a July Olympics off the table, training camps scrapped, facilities closed and athletes homebound, Australia\u2019s Olympic sports have three priorities. The first is athlete wellbeing. \u201cIt will become emotional \u2013 in the next few hours, days, weeks and months,\u201d said Verhaeren. \u201cPeople have seen their goals disappear. We are focusing on providing immediate care for those who need it.\u201d</p> <p>Cycling Australia has a full-time performance psychologist on staff and a dedicated athlete wellbeing officer. \u201cAthletes are in a range of positions,\u201d said Edmondson. \u201cWe have young riders coming into the team for the first time \u2013 a one-year delay will affect them, but not significantly. Whereas older athletes, myself included, we are coming to the end of our span. I was already contemplating that this could be my last major event. The idea that to get to the Games could take 12 months more than expected really threw me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/international-olympic-committee-hype-thomas-bach-tokyo-games\">International Olympic Committee has rare chance to live up to its hype | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Beyond initial concern for athletes, Australia\u2019s major Olympic sports are also looking to their balance sheets \u2013 and wondering how a 12-month delay will impact funding, which is determined on an annual basis. \u201cIt is very difficult to answer that,\u201d said Jones, who is in close contact with the Australian Institute of Sport. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any answers at the moment, but we know people are working quickly on those sorts of questions.\u201d</p> <p>While these sports are dependent on government funding, which may be at risk in a straitened economic climate, their business models are also protected from the sudden suspension of spectator sport. \u201cOur budget is not reliant on ticket sales,\u201d said Swimming Australia chief executive Leigh Russell. \u201cSome of the pain that other sports are experiencing right now is because they are heavily reliant on people transacting with a club or the sport. We are in a different situation, but a very unknown one. There are lots of moving pieces right now.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, with the postponed Olympics likely to take place in July-August 2021, athletes and coaches must reset their countdown and plan for 16 months\u2019 time. \u201cOnce we are through this, we\u2019re going to need to ramp up pretty quickly, both from a performance perspective and behind the scenes,\u201d said Russell. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to lose the momentum we have, even if it needs to be put on pause right now.\u201d</p> <p>Given the ongoing uncertainty, those plans may take some time to shape up. Amid global panic over the coronavirus pandemic, Olympic athletes are trying to take it in their stride. \u201cAt the end of the day we\u2019re just a sport,\u201d said Edmondson, a three-time world champion and London 2012 bronze medallist. \u201cWhat we do is important to us. But when you hear the figures of people affected, the people dying, that puts it in perspective. A postponed Olympics is not the end of the world for us. But this situation will be pretty serious for many, many others.\u201d</p>",

But it is a solution that many think will make matters worse, leading to the loss of even more lives and a deeper economic crisis.</p> <p>Trump stood by his suggestion on Tuesday, saying he wanted the US open for business by Easter, just 19 days away. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible. Why isn\u2019t it? We\u2019ve never controlled the country before and we\u2019ve had some flus and some viruses. I think it\u2019s absolutely possible,\u201d Trump told Fox News. \u201cWe have to get our country back to work.

The shutdown of the economy is damaging. It is a balancing of risks. I think we will be in worse shape in the public health sector and the financial sector if we just unthinkingly send people back to business as usual.\u201d</p> <p>Even one of Trump\u2019s closest supporters, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, has distanced himself from the president\u2019s position <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1242120623448621061\">in a tweet</a>, writing: \u201cTry running an economy with major hospitals overflowing, doctors and nurses forced to stop treating some because they can\u2019t help all, and every moment of gut-wrenching medical chaos being played out in our living rooms, on TV, on social media, and shown all around the world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we had been better prepared for coronavirus, the economy wouldn\u2019t be where it is right now</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Greenberger</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is no functioning economy unless we control the virus.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump has pinned his re-election hopes on soaring stock markets and record lows in unemployment. Now with stock markets in freefall and jobs set to follow, he seems determined to press ahead and try to relax restrictions on business in an attempt to cure the economic crisis.</p> <p>Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said such a move would probably fail, economically and politically. \u201cThe first question is: what will people do?\u201d she said.</p> <p>Gould said some people were likely not to return to work even if ordered to do so. Secondly, she said, it was clear that state governors \u2013 who have shut down so many cities \u2013 would resist any move from Trump that could worsen the escalating health crisis.</p> <p>Even in normal times, such a conflict would create a constitutional crisis. In the current situation it could be much worse.</p> <p>Greenberger said: \u201cIn your worst imaginations, and our worst imaginations have come alive in this episode, you could see serious tension between the active military deployed to enforce the opening of businesses and the state police who are enforcing the closures.\u201d</p> <p>Trump predicted Americans would see \u201cpacked churches\u201d this Easter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1242537995103846400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump on why he picked Easter as the day he wants to end strict social distancing and reopen American businesses: &quot;Easter is a very special day for me ...

  "<p>When Rosalind Chou was on a flight at the end of February, she saw a woman in front of her raise her phone up high, as if taking a selfie.

  "<p>Global stock markets staged a strong rally on Tuesday as investors were buoyed by the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to boost the US economy and the prospect of Congress backing a fiscal stimulus package.</p> <p>The Dow Jones recorded its best day since 1933 as it gained 11.4%, or 2,113 points, while the FTSE 100 posted its highest ever gain, of 452 points, as it rose 9% to 5,446.</p> <p>The rally on US and European markets followed gains in Asia overnight in the wake of the US central bank\u2019s move on Monday to launch an unlimited money-printing programme.</p> <p>Japan\u2019s Nikkei jumped 7.1%, the South Korean Kospi rose 8.6%, and the New Zealand market gained 7.18%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng closed 4.46% higher, the Australian market rose 4.17% and the Shanghai stock exchange finished 2.34% higher.</p> <p>The world\u2019s seven key western economies also sought to calm mounting fears of a global depression on Tuesday by pledging to do whatever it takes to get through the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Despite the market rallies, Tuesday saw early warning signs for developed economies as data showed the steepest plunge in business activity on record in Britain, Japan and the eurozone.</p> <p>As more countries effectively shut down large parts of their economies to contain the spread of the virus, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7\">G7</a> said it would take further steps to <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm955\">coordinate the fightback</a> against the economic meltdown.</p> <p>Issuing a joint statement following criticism of some world leaders over the lack of a united response to the unfolding crisis, the group of wealthy nations said: \u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to restore confidence and economic growth and to protect jobs, businesses, and the resilience of the financial system.\u201d</p> <p>Finance ministries across the group \u2013 comprised of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US \u2013 will coordinate weekly, and promised to take further measures when needed to cushion the economic blow, according to the statement, while policies to support jobs and growth will be used for as long as necessary.</p> <p>\u201cWe also pledge to promote global trade and investment to underpin prosperity. Our nations are working together to fight the Covid-19 outbreak and mitigate its impact, treat those affected and prevent further transmission,\u201d the G7 said.</p> <p>The G7 intervention came as closely watched surveys of business activity revealed the early economic damage from the rapidly escalating crisis. The purchasing managers indices (PMI) \u2013 which provide snapshots of business activity \u2013 for the UK, Japan and the eurozone plunged to the lowest levels since PMI records for those economies began. The UK PMIs date back to 1996, with those for eurozone countries launching in 1998 and Japan\u2019s starting in 2007.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/0f164ac0128b429ea1c329104afd62c3?s=1\">flash PMI</a> for the UK\u2019s dominant service sector \u2013 which includes restaurants, hotels and banks, and accounts for about 80% of the UK economy \u2013 crashed to 35.7 on an index where anything below 50 represents contraction.</p> <p>The collapse on the index, which is closely monitored by the Treasury and the Bank of England, outstripped the slump recorded during the depths of the 2008-09 financial crisis, as emergency public health measures disrupt supply chains and demand for goods and services evaporates.</p> <p>Surveys in the US showed private sector activity contracting at the fastest rate since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, while activity across the eurozone crashed by the greatest extent ever recorded by the data firm IHS Markit, which compiles the surveys. In a potential prelude to a deep recession around the world, Germany and France also plunged to record lows.</p> <p>Activity in Japan\u2019s service sector also dropped by the most since its PMI records began. Economists warned that the reading was especially worrying given that, apart from school closures, there had been no major European-style lockdowns put in place, indicating that the collapse in activity in Europe could worsen over the coming weeks.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the virus-fighting lockdowns meant the US economy, the world\u2019s biggest, was probably already in a recession. \u201cJobs are already being slashed at a pace not witnessed since the global financial crisis,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Despite the worsening economic outlook stock markets rallied on Tuesday to halt a plunge in recent weeks, as hopes mount for greater coordination between the world\u2019s biggest economic superpowers and Congress in Washington inched towards agreeing a bipartisan deal on a stimulus plan. There are also hopes of a boost for economic activity in China, where there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/china-to-lift-travel-restrictions-in-hubei-after-months-of-coronavirus-lockdown\">plans to lift travel restrictions</a> in the central Hubei province where the Covid-19 outbreak originated late last year.</p>",
  "<p>How does it feel to be locked down in the largest urban centre in western Europe? Well, it certainly looks different from the skies.

Not much has been locked. Nobody seems that down. The plague laws may be back on the streets, dusted off after 500 years on the shelf.

Thirteen days ago, 55,000 people, 3,000 of them from Madrid, were watching football in Liverpool. Three days ago, people were still thronging the restaurants and pubs.</p> \n<p>Even now, on lockdown Day Zero, East Street market is rammed with shoppers drawn to the fish and fruit stalls.

It\u2019s an odd look, after all, that a man who\u2019s supposed to be in the business of handing out gongs should be so keen on receiving them, but Bach grew up in West Germany and was a prominent spokesman against the political boycott of the Moscow 1980 Games, so really believes some of this stuff. And he has done most of his campaigning in public.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"19c1502c-287f-4589-8d1b-ef360eccdb91\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-DNXY0T6QvY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Just last year Bach persuaded the United Nations to pass a resolution promising to honour an \u201cOlympic truce\u201d during the Tokyo Games. \u201cWith the adoption of the Olympic truce resolution today, you are supporting the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 as this true symbol of peace in our world,\u201d Bach told them. \u201cToday is therefore a welcome opportunity to reaffirm the commitment of the IOC to our shared values of peace, solidarity, and respect.\u201d The resolution passed unanimously. Who, after all, was going to stand up and protest against world peace? Even the Russians were all for it, and they launched a five-day war with Georgia the day before the Beijing Summer Olympics started, then annexed the Crimea a week after the Sochi Winter Games had finished.</p> \n<p>So the UN didn\u2019t even need to vote on it. Which may have been a relief, given the IOC\u2019s record in the recent referendums in Boston, Calgary, Budapest, Davos, Hamburg, Innsbruck, Krakow, Munich, and all the other potential host cities who have pulled out of bidding for the Games because the residents simply couldn\u2019t see that they were worth the enormous cost of hosting them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca91037fb60e7c4615ea57c90600a59e81009e8e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca91037fb60e7c4615ea57c90600a59e81009e8e/158_347_4343_2605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin with his fellow president Thomas Bach of the IOC during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin (left) with his fellow president Thomas Bach of the IOC during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, when the hosts benefited from a state-sponsored doping scheme.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Goldman/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Which gets at the problem with Bach\u2019s Hallmark card philosophy of peace through sport. It would be harmless enough if it didn\u2019t seem so much like a thick coat of whitewash on everything that\u2019s gone wrong with the Olympic movement in recent years. Little things, like the state-sponsored doping programme at Sochi 2014, and the endemic corruption and waste at Rio 2016. The IOC botched its handling of both.</p> \n<p>Now, in 2020, the IOC finally has an opportunity to take on the sort of global leadership role that Bach has so often claimed for it. Because if the delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic is a crisis for the IOC, it\u2019s also an opportunity for it to prove the Games really do have a greater significance to us all. And its leaders being criticised for delaying the decision to postpone the Games so much longer than many of the competitors felt was necessary (as recently as three weeks ago Bach was still insisting that they would go ahead as scheduled) that will matter less, in the end, than what comes now, and whether the IOC gets its next steps right.</p> \n<p>Rearranging the Games will be a hellishly complicated job, with myriad challenges, an unfathomable number of unforeseen snags and hitches. Get it right, and these Tokyo Games won\u2019t just go down as a triumph of sporting logistics, but of the human spirit. Because after the 12 months we\u2019re all in for, the world is sure going to feel ready for a party sometime next summer. And gloriously trivial as running and jumping and swimming and all the rest of it are, the Olympics will be something for millions of sports fans to look forward to at a time when there\u2019s so little else for them to get excited about that half a million people are tuning in to watch <a href=\"https://www.si.com/more-sports/2020/03/22/marble-racing-jelle-coronavirus-sports-greg-woods-commentator\" title=\"\">marble races live on YouTube</a>.</p> \n<p>And they\u2019ll be a sign, too, that normality\u2019s back, that we\u2019ve all come through it. In recent years it\u2019s often felt as if the Olympics are the greatest show on earth despite the IOC, rather than because of it. If it pulls this off, it will prove otherwise. And it will deserve every credit, as well as, who knows, maybe a prize or two, too.</p>",

  "<p>Once upon a time, wise elders foretold that east and west would meet, a reviving and ruling power coming together in new leadership. The idea of a <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-united-states-and-china-a-g-2-in-the-making/\" title=\"\">Sino-American G2</a>, reaching bilateral consensus on key issues to prudently steer the international community, always sounded like a fairytale. But from this moment in time, it seems more like a bad joke. As a pandemic threatens millions of lives, and further suffering through a global recession, the shortcomings of China and the US are increasingly glaring.</p> <p>Chinese authorities covered up the Wuhan outbreak and harassed those who tried to blow the whistle, allowing the coronavirus to spread within and then beyond its borders \u2013 though subsequent draconian measures appear to have contained the internal spread, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/life-after-lockdown-has-china-really-beaten-coronavirus\" title=\"\">for now at least</a>, and should have bought time for other countries to prepare.

He ceded responsibility to states and now wants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/trumps-push-to-shorten-the-coronavirus-shutdown-proves-the-captain-is-flying-blind\" title=\"\">return to business as usual</a>, as if that were possible \u2013 even as the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/us-may-become-centre-of-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says\" title=\"\">warns</a> that America could become the new centre of the pandemic.

Pundits have blamed predatory pricing by Chinese firms for ending penicillin and aspirin production in the US, but the US has also showed complacency in failing to protect key national resources and relying on foreign production.</p> <p>Washington\u2019s failures are allowing Beijing, despite its own culpability, to restore its image and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/efdec278-6d01-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f\" title=\"\">build foreign influence</a>. \u201cThe only country that can help us is China \u2026 European solidarity does not exist,\u201d declared the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, last week; masks and health experts arrived days later. China\u2019s dispatches of medical supplies to other countries are welcome; so presumably were the shipments it received from the EU when the outbreak emerged, and the equipment that European neighbours have shared with each other. The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3076728/eu-fires-warning-shot-china-coronavirus-battle-narratives\" title=\"\">warned</a> on Tuesday of a \u201cstruggle for influence\u201d, including through the \u201cpolitics of generosity\u201d.

  "<p>Senior Conservatives are questioning whether Boris Johnson will need a national unity government or emergency cross-party council to share responsibility for the coronavirus crisis if the situation worsens.</p> <p>George Freeman, a former minister in Johnson\u2019s government, was the first to break cover to say a \u201cCovid coalition\u201d government may be \u201cunavoidable\u201d and some other Tory MPs privately believe the prime minister will need cross-party governing consensus if emergency measures are to continue for months.</p> <p>Freeman told the Guardian: \u201cThe scale of this national emergency \u2013 the suspension of usual freedoms and democracy, the economic consequences and the likely loss of tens of thousands of lives \u2013 demands a suspension of politics as usual.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Labour have a sensible new leader, Keir Starmer [if elected] should be invited to Covid cabinet, Cobra and joint No 10 briefings.\u201d</p> <p>One argument circulating among some Tories is that Johnson may need to to share responsibility for decision-making with Labour and other opposition parties in order to survive the crisis, but he would need to convince the opposition that they would have meaningful input in return. One Tory MP said there was a political argument that Johnson may be keen to \u201cdrag Labour in\u201d so the public do not associate the crisis solely with the Conservatives, if the situation worsens.</p> <p>They fear that Johnson could end up losing public support \u2013 despite surveys currently showing he is strongly backed \u2013 if it looks like he alone is responsible for a crisis that ends up involving tens of thousands of deaths.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s hero Winston Churchill ran a national unity government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/14/attlee-and-churchill-review\">with Labour\u2019s Clement Attlee </a>as his deputy and Arthur Greenwood as a senior minister.</p> <p>But one Tory MP said they already fear that even if Johnson comes to be regarded favourably like a Churchill, then the public could still be ready for a postwar Attlee-type figure \u2013 such as Starmer \u2013 if they want to see public services properly funded and rebuilt after the crisis is over.</p> <p>Another Conservative MP said they thought No 10 would be considering a cross-party coronavirus council as an option if emergency measures have to go on for some time \u201cas democratic consensus will be needed for a continued suspension of everyday life, especially if parliament cannot sit\u201d.</p> <p>Opposition politicians gave a mixed reaction to the idea of a national unity government. Starmer, the Labour leadership favourite, is focusing on trying to push No 10 to do the right thing on guaranteeing income and strict physical distancing, also called social distancing, rather than countenancing a national unity government.</p> <p>However, Rebecca Long-Bailey, a rival leadership candidate is understood not to be ruling out the idea of more cross-party cooperation or even a government of national unity because of the crisis situation that the government finds itself in.</p> <p>The third Labour leadership candidate, Lisa Nandy, said it would be better to draft opposition figures, unions, business groups and others on to a \u201cnational Cobra\u201d than form an official unity government.</p> <p>\u201cDecisions are being made in real time,\u201d she said. \u201cRather than having a reshuffle and trying to bed in a new government what you really need is a decision-making body that essentially takes this over until it\u2019s dealt with.\u201d</p> <p>Labour would need to be among those represented, Nandy said. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason I can see why someone like Gordon Brown wouldn\u2019t be in the meeting room, helping to steer us through this. He\u2019s dealt with not just the global financial crash, but foot and mouth as well. We really do need to start drawing on a wider pool of expertise.\u201d</p> <p>A national Cobra would be better placed to spot issues with plans, Nandy said, and so avoid \u201cwhat we\u2019ve seen in the past few weeks, which is the government coming up with a plan, announcing it, the plan then unravels, and people are brought in to try and sort it out\u201d.</p> <p>A more cohesive approach was vital, she said: \u201cMy sense is people are losing confidence in what they are being told, and if people start ignoring advice we\u2019re going to be in a new level of trouble\u201d.</p> <p>Layla Moran, a leading candidate for the Liberal Democrat leadership, agreed that rather than the disruption of rejigging ministerial posts in a formal unity government, a better approach would be \u201ca more formal arrangement of cross-party working, through joint Cobra and subject-specific committee meetings\u201d.</p> <p>The government has engaged in some cross-party working so far, allowing Scotland\u2019s first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, the Labour Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, and the DUP first minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, into emergency meetings.</p> <p>It reluctantly allowed Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, into Cobra meetings in recent weeks. He revealed on Tuesday that there had been disagreement over whether construction sites should be shut, with the prime minister resisting such a move.</p>",

On Monday, for the first time, more than 100 people in the US died in a single day. The sharp acceleration in cases \u2013 just two weeks ago the official number was less than 2,000 \u2013 has led to the WHO warning that the US is overtaking countries such as Italy as the global hotspot for the virus.</p> <p>The true scale of infection in the US is almost certainly far worse, with a severe lack of testing having stymied efforts to contain Covid-19 once it emerged near Seattle. Trump initially referred to media coverage of the outbreak as a \u201choax\u201d before banning travel from China, where the virus originated, and claiming it had been nearly vanquished on US soil.</p> <p>But the US response has been hobbled by the administration\u2019s rejection of standard WHO testing kits, instead opting to develop its own, which turned out to be faulty. The Trump administration previously dismantled a federal team working on pandemics and cut back a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) group based in China tasked with tracking new threats such as Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cThe administration has repeatedly and systematically corroded critical parts of the CDC,\u201d said Christopher Sellers, an expert in the environment and health at Stony Brook University. \u201cThis was just begging for an epidemic to hit us. It was a perfect storm of lack of preparation.\u201d</p> <p>Muddled messaging from the White House, where Trump has often contradicted the sombre warnings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-fauci-meme-coronavirus-response\">his top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, has done little to Americans stop congregating on beaches or in shopping malls.</p> <p>State governors have taken up the mantle, shutting down public gatherings and non-essential businesses. But a paucity of medical supplies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavrirus-medical-staff-beg-for-masks-social-media\">has led doctors and nurses to beg for items online</a>. Dressmakers have been asked to make masks for hospital workers. As one hospital\u2019s equipment supply diminished, one anesthesiologist wore a plastic bag over his head during a procedure.</p> <p>These shortages have only worsened pre-existing problems. Nearly one in 10 Americans have no health insurance, while a widespread lack of sick pay across the country has forced many ill people into work despite the risk of spreading the virus.</p> <p>New York City, now at a standstill, faces a tsunami of sick and dying people. More than 2,600 people have been hospitalized in New York state with more than 150 deaths so far.</p> <p>The \u201cattack rate\u201d of the virus \u2013 the percentage of the population infected \u2013 is five times higher than in other parts of the country, leading Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, to warn: \u201cTo all of my friends and colleagues in New York, this is the group that needs to absolutely social distance and self-isolate at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Authorities in New York are scouring the world for the ventilators, masks and gowns needed for an unfolding public health emergency that is expected to peak in the next three weeks.</p> <p>The Javits Center, a hulking glass conference space in Manhattan, has been transformed into a field hospital, with 2,000 beds installed.</p> <p>\u201cThe apex of this pandemic is higher and sooner than we thought,\u201d said Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor who has garnered praise for his handling of the crisis. \u201cI will turn this state upside down to get the hospital beds we need.\u201d</p> <p>Cuomo also condemned Fema and the Trump administration again, saying: \u201cYou want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators? What are we going to do with 400 ventilators when we need 30,000 ventilators? You\u2019re missing the magnitude of the problem, and the problem is defined by the magnitude.\u201d</p> <p>The number of cases was higher in New York, he said, \u201cbecause it started here first because we have global travelers coming here first. Because we have more density than other places. You will see this in suburban communities across the country. We are just a test case. We are just a test case. And that\u2019s how the nation should look at it. Where we are today, you will be in three weeks or five weeks or six weeks.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/older-people-would-rather-die-than-let-covid-19-lockdown-harm-us-economy-texas-official-dan-patrick\">Older people would rather die than let Covid-19 harm US economy \u2013 Texas official</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But even as leaders such as Cuomo scramble to cope with an steep increase of sick patients while urging people to stay at home and avoid social contact, Trump has signaled that he is prepared to wind down restrictions at the end of a 15-day window in an attempt to bolster the economy and a sagging stock market.</p> <p>\u201cOur country wasn\u2019t built to be shut down,\u201d Trump said on Monday. \u201cThis is not a country that was built for this.

Rather, it was the daily government coronavirus press conference, being chaired for the first time by Hanock. Boris Johnson has fronted most of them since they started eight days ago.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said that the government had brought 3.5m antibody testing kits, to show whether people had had coronavirus, and that a new testing facility in Milton Keynes had opened today. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I understand why NHS staff, in particular, and others across public service are so keen to get the testing ramped up, that we need to see and that we are undertaking.</p> \n   <p>Of course it really matters for getting people getting back to work, so we have now bought 3.5m antibody tests.</p> \n   <p>That will allow people to see whether they have had the virus and are immune to it and then can get back to work.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said 7.5m pieces of protective equipment including facemasks had been shipped out in the last 24 hours.<br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock implicitly blamed Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, for overcrowding on some London tube trains today.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/24/uk-coronavirus-live-news-lockdown-boris-johnson-sports-direct-abandons-talk-of-opening-stores-as-gove-clarifies-scope-of-lockdown-rules?page=with:block-5e79e6228f08cc9a819474b0#block-5e79e6228f08cc9a819474b0\">10.52am </a>for some video footage.) Asked about the problem, Hancock said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When it comes to the tube, the first and the best answer is that Transport for London [which is run by Khan] should have the tube running in full so that people travelling on the tube are spaced out and can be further apart - obeying the two-metre rule wherever possible.</p> \n   <p>And there is no good reason in the information that I\u2019ve seen that the current levels of tube provision should be as low as they are. We should have more tube trains running.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Generally the political figures from the UK government, the opposition, the devolved administrations and the major mayoralties who have been engaged in the coronavirus crisis have so far kept recriminations to a minimum. Perhaps Hancock\u2019s comment is a sign that this is changing, because it was a clear dig at Khan. Earlier Khan himself openly criticised the government, saying that he had wanted to close construction sites but that he had been overruled by Boris Johnson. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/24/uk-coronavirus-live-news-lockdown-boris-johnson-sports-direct-abandons-talk-of-opening-stores-as-gove-clarifies-scope-of-lockdown-rules?page=with:block-5e7a25558f08d17da4d88b2b#block-5e7a25558f08d17da4d88b2b\"> 3.21pm.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Jenny Harries, the chief medical officer for England, said that couples who live apart should ideally stay apart - or else use coronavirus to \u201ctest the strength of their relationship\u201d and move in together.</strong> She was responding to an invitation to clarify whether the government advice meant that couples who did not live in the same house should stop seeing each other. After Hancock ducked the question and passed it over to her, Harries replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you are two individuals, two halves of the couple, living in separate households then ideally they should stay in those households.</p> \n   <p>The alternative might be that, for quite a significant period going forward, they should just test the strength of their relationship and decide whether they should be permanently be resident in another household.</p> \n   <p>What we do not want is people switching in and out of households. It defeats the purpose of reductions in social interactions and will allow the transmission of disease.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said he was launching a scheme inviting up to 250,000 people to volunteer to contribute to the fight against coronavirus.</strong> He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Today we launch NHS volunteers. We are seeking a quarter of a million volunteers, people in good health to help the NHS, for shopping, for the delivery of medicines and to support those who are shielding to protect their own health.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that 11,788 recently retired NHS staff had responded to the call to return to the service.</strong> They included 2,660 doctors, more than 2,500 pharmacists and other staff and 6,147 nurses, he said.

She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This material should soon provide considerable relief in Italy, Spain and in 23 more member states. Now it is up to the member states to sign the necessary contracts swiftly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The commission said it expected the equipment to be available two weeks after the member states leading the procurement sign the contracts. </p> \n  <p>Two other procurement schemes, to supply ventilators and laboratory equipment needed for coronavirus testing, are at an earlier stage, with calls for tenders launched last week. Nearly all EU countries, 25 out of 27, are participating in the procurement scheme on ventilators, while 19 are joining forces to buy laboratory equipment. </p> \n  <p>The Brexit transition agreement means the government has the right to take part in EU joint procurement. Under David Cameron, the government signed the EU\u2019s joint procurement agreement in 2014, which was drawn up after some member states experienced shortages of medical kit during the H1N1 pandemic.</p> \n  <p>The logic behind joint procurement is to reduce administration, get better prices through bulk purchasing power and take advantage of medical purchasing skills that may not be equally shared (something especially useful for smaller countries).</p> \n  <p>British officials have not ruled out joining an EU procurement scheme and stress the NHS will get everything it needs to tackle the pandemic. Meanwhile Boris Johnson recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/vauxhall-owner-psa-car-shuts-european-plants-amid-coronavirus-fears\">called on manufacturers to make 20,000 ventilators \u201cat speed\u201d</a>, as the government prepares for a surge in people needing intensive care. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T16:20:44.612Z\">at 4.20pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7a2efa8f08c78e185cff38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-24T16:03:04.872Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Grant Shapps</strong>, the transport secretary, says he is asking retired rail staff to return to work to cover for any shortages generated by coronavirus.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/grantshapps/status/1242478808357154823\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">To ensure those who absolutely-need-to-travel are able to safely I\u2019m requesting the rail industry ask retired staff including signallers to assist in this great national effort to beat <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirusuk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirusuk</a>.

Describing the experience of those abroad, she said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>An inability to get through to consular services on the phone, a standard acknowledgement email telling them to contact their tour operator, airline or insurer, an increasing inability to find accommodation. Hotels are shutting, flights are cancelled, borders are closed and there are no routes home. Many are hours away from large airports in countries operating curfews.</p> \n   <p>To them, it looks like [Raab\u2019s] words of last week were empty and I ask him today as I asked him last week to explain how he is working with airlines with unused planes, parked at airports around the globe to bring our people home. He must get the process fully under way. The vision of British citizens sleeping rough on the streets of Caracas is not a good one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Raab replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>She said that embassies had been closed. Actually it\u2019s a very small number of posts that have to be closed \u2026</p> \n   <p>A large chunk of the consular staff work from home.

chancellor, told MPs a few minutes ago about why constructing a scheme to protect the self-employed who are losing work because of the coronavirus crisis was so complicated. He said it may require a brand new system. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019re looking at pace at what support can be provided.</p> \n   <p>The fact is that [the 5m group] that we\u2019re dealing with contains such a wide variety of different people where we don\u2019t have the ability to target support - that\u2019s the challenge that we have in designing something that gets to the people that we want it to help whilst at the same time being affordable, not having to benefit absolutely everybody.</p> \n   <p>That is proving to be problematic, but we are hard at work on it.</p> \n   <p>In terms of delivery, it is almost certainly going to be the case that we would have to build another brand new system to deliver any support.</p> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s right, and I\u2019m sure honourable members on both sides of this house would agree, that in terms of prioritising system design, the scheme we have set up for 90% of the workforce that is employed should be delivered first and quickly, and that is what we have committed to do, ideally by the end of April.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Labour\u2019s <strong>Wes Streeting </strong>pushed him for clarification on this. He said people wanted an announcement very soon.</p> \n  <p>Sunak said that he \u201choped to have something to say very shortly\u201d. But he said that did not mean he would be able to implement a scheme immediately.

Here are the key points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gove only partially rejected claims that the government had acted too late, saying that this would be for others to judge in the future.</strong> <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-03-23/debates/F4D06B4F-56CD-4B60-8306-BAB6D78AC7CF/CoronavirusBill#contribution-42294916-A34B-4479-844E-85E9BFA637B4\">In the Commons yesterday</a> <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, the former foreign secretary, former health secretary and former Tory leadership candidate, said that \u201cit may be too late\u201d to avoid the UK following Italy. Hunt said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One London hospital has seven doctors with the virus in just that one hospital. Yet still people are going to shops, parks, beaches and holiday homes as if nothing has changed. It may be too late to avoid following Italy, but to have any chance at all of doing so we must move now to lockdown rules that ban non-essential travel. It is time not just to ask people to do social distancing, but to enforce those social distancing rules\u2014not next week, not this week, but right away.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On Sky News <strong>Kay Burley</strong> asked Gove about Hunt\u2019s comment and how he thought history would look back at the way the UK has handled this, Gove replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the most important thing now is not to look back, but to do everything that we can in order to ensure that the instructions that are being put in place are being followed. People will form their own judgment at some point in the future. What I\u2019m concerned about now is making sure that we do everything possible to protect the NHS, and that means that wherever possible people should stay at home.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked again if the government had acted too late, Gove said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve followed advice at every stage on what is the appropriate measure to take, and I think that\u2019s the right thing to do. In a democracy it is perfectly understandable that people have a range of views and disagree. Judgments can be formed now. Judgments will be formed in due course. I think the most important thing now, though, is to do everything that we can now, as individuals in our communities and in government, to follow the steps that will limit the spread of this disease.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Gove initially sidestepped a question about whether the government was still expecting hundreds of thousands of deaths before the coronavirus outbreak was contained. </strong>When pressed on this, he said it would depend on what people did.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested the rules announced last night could be made even stricter. </strong>He told Burley:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We will review in three weeks\u2019 time exactly who how these measures are working. Let me be clear: this is a public health emergency, a national emergency. We must do everything that we can to stop this virus spreading. The prime minister said in his statement if the virus spreads in an unconstrained way, it will overwhelm the health services of any nation. So that is why we are taking the steps that we are taking ... We will keep it under review. And in three weeks\u2019 time we will be able to say whether or not the path that we\u2019ve followed needs any further intensification, or whether there are one or two of the existing restrictions that may be capable of being lifted.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KayBurley/status/1242372505911857162\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"In three weeks time we'll be able to say whether or not the path we've followed needs intensification.\"<br><br>Cabinet boss <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgove?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@michaelgove</a> says the government will assess whether they can lift lockdown restrictions at the end of three weeks.

  "<p>The musician Manu Dibango, who has died aged 86 after contracting Covid-19, covered a vast spectrum of styles, from traditional African roots music to jazz, soul, Afrobeat, reggae, gospel, French chanson, Congolese rumba, salsa and solo piano. Most importantly, he was a founding father of funk.</p> <p>In 1972 he made his mark with the hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0CeFX6E2yI\" title=\"\">Soul Makossa</a>. As soon as it was released, as the B-side of a tribute to the Cameroon football team, there were at least five different cover versions in the American charts. The use of the refrain \u201cmama-say, mama-sa, mama-kossa\u201d, on Michael Jackson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Uj3zitETs4\" title=\"\">Wanna Be Starting Something</a>, from his 1982 album Thriller, earned Dibango substantial compensation two decades later.</p> <p>Dibango was an unmistakable figure, with a shaved head, shades, a benign grin and a deep, reverberating laugh. The instantly recognisable tone of his music was always swinging, melodic and invigorating. Although best known as a saxophonist, Dibango was also a consummate keyboard and vibraphone player and a great arranger, who could get the best from a quartet or a 28-piece orchestra.</p> <p>As he once said: \u201cWhat is special is that Africa has a long historical relationship with sound, and a communion between sound and the visual stronger than in any other culture. The sound carries the rhythm and the movement creates the images. The way an African moves compared with the environment is different from the western conception.\u201d</p> <p>Emmanuel Dibango was born in Douala, in French-administered Cameroon. His father was a high-ranking civil servant, his mother a fashion designer, and both parents were devout Protestants who disapproved of secular music. Manu received encouragement from the musical director of his church choir, and surreptitiously broadened his musical perspective with a bamboo flute and a home-made guitar. In 1944 he was in the school choir for the state visit of Charles de Gaulle to Cameroon.</p> <p>During the second world war, West Africa provided many reluctant recruits to the allied forces and Dibango would recall helping to cut loose the ropes binding \u201cvolunteers\u201d press-ganged into the French army. One of them was an uncle of his.</p> <p>In 1949 his parents sent him to France to study and, as an incentive, promised to pay for music lessons. He arrived on a steamer to take up his education at Saint-Calais in the region of Sarthe. The only black child in this small country town, he got on well with his schoolmates, who remembered him bringing the first bananas they had ever seen. For his part, he found snow exotic and tried to post some home in an envelope.</p> <p>He was adopted by the community and settled quickly into the French way of life, but his individuality, his cultural roots and, possibly, memories of the \u201cvolunteers\u201d, prevented him from accepting the complete national identity expected by his host country. Due to his parents having different ethnic backgrounds, he was never satisfied with an imposed identity. He was unhappy to be classified as an African musician, preferring to be considered as an artist, and an African.</p> <p>Considered too old to take up the violin, his preferred instrument, he studied classical piano for four years. His fellow students included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/jan/30/101-strangest-spotify-francis-bebey\" title=\"\">Francis Bebey</a>, who would become a novelist and musicologist, with whom Dibango played classical and jazz pieces, although for student dances they became a blues band.</p> <p>While he was on holiday in 1953, a friend lent him a saxophone and Dibango took to the instrument, enrolling for two years of private tuition. After doing the rounds of French jazz clubs he moved to Belgium, where his soulful style attracted the owner of the Bantou club. Within months Dibango had been signed up by Joseph Kabasele, the founding father of modern Congolese music, whose band, African Jazz, spearheaded a musical revolution in Africa. In Brussels he also met his future wife Marie-Josee (known as Coco), whom he married in 1957.</p> <p>In 1959 Kabasele recorded the pan-African anthem Ind\u00e9pendence Cha Cha and invited Dibango to the Congolese capital, L\u00e9opoldville (now Kinshasa), to work with him. They made many hit records for the Ngoma label in the prevailing rumba style. Dibango also ran a recording band called African Soul in which he played the organ on his own interpretations of American music. He managed a nightclub, the Tam Tam, but despite financial success he and Coco experienced racism, so they moved to Abidjan in Ivory Coast.</p> <p>After a period as leader of the Ivoirian national broadcast orchestra, Dibango realised that the creative \u201cmiracle\u201d he thought he was observing in Africa had turned into a mirage, and he returned to France.</p> <p>In the late 1960s and early 70s he recorded film soundtracks \u2013 including that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/12/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne</a>\u2019s celebrated feature, Ceddo (1976) \u2013 incidental background music and commercials, and singles for the African market.</p> <p>In 1972 he joined the Congo rumba combo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=pqSEKbu_Mlw\" title=\"\">Ry-Co Jazz</a> for a tour of Algeria, along with the guitarist Jerry Malekani, who thereafter became his permanent accompanist. Following the death of the US tenor sax supremo King Curtis in 1971, Dibango released a tribute single which identified the American as a major influence on his technique. In 1978 he recorded two albums for Chris Blackwell\u2019s Island label in Jamaica, Afrovision and Gone Clear.</p> <p>In 1982 Dibango worked on a masterful triple album, Fleurs Musicales du Cameroun, which gathered contemporary and traditional musicians from the various ethnic groups of Cameroon.</p> <p>In the same year he toured France with the American jazz trumpeter <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-don-cherry-1578669.html\" title=\"\">Don Cherry</a>, exploring everything from soul to Malian folk music and Thelonious Monk. Soon after, he was blowing ice-cold funk on his album Electric Africa (1985), which featured Herbie Hancock, and the hit single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph5GB8RArks\" title=\"\">Abele Dance</a>. He collaborated with a long list of top class performers: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/23/hugh-masekela-obituary\" title=\"\">Hugh Masekela</a>, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-fela-kuti-1243789.html\" title=\"\">Fela Kuti</a>, Tony Allen, Fania All-Stars, Ray Lema, Bill Laswell, Sly and Robbie, Ladysmith Black Mambazo and many up and coming Cameroonians.</p> <p>In 1984 he joined more than a dozen artists on the fundraising single Tam Tam Pour l\u2019Ethiopie, released indignantly in response to Band Aid, which many Africans considered condescending. Dibango\u2019s 1994 album Wakafrika featured King Sunny Ad\u00e9, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/peter-gabriel\" title=\"\">Peter Gabriel</a>, Salif Ke\u00efta, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/arts/music/papa-wemba-congolese-king-of-rumba-rock-is-dead-at-66.html\" title=\"\">Papa Wemba</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/youssou-n-dour\" title=\"\">Youssou N\u2019Dour</a>.</p> <p>Back in 1967 he had been bandleader on Pulsations, the first black music programme on French TV, and in the early 1990s he hosted his own prime-time French TV show, Salut Manu. In 1998 his achievements were celebrated by the rural community where he grew up, with the naming of a cultural centre after him. He reciprocated by donating the saxophone he had used on Soul Makossa.</p> <p>In later years he was an ambassador for Unicef, received several honours from African countries and, in 2010, was made a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur. He was still working last year, on tour with Symphonic Safari, blending jazz with classical music.</p> <p>In the UK his frequent concert appearances included a 2008 Africa Day show in Trafalgar Square, but the most satisfying for him were the regular bookings at Ronnie Scott\u2019s club, where he enjoyed being recognised as a \u201cjazz man\u201d.</p> <p>Coco died in 1995. He is survived by his daughters, Georgia and Marva, and son, Michel.</p> <p>\u2022 Manu (Emmanuel N\u2019Djok\u00e9) Dibango, musician, born 12 December 1933; died 24 March 2020</p>",

But we should not lose sight of the fact that this crisis will pass. Indeed, amid all the negative news, the success in containing the coronavirus in China and other Asian countries is being overlooked. And this is where the coordinated policy response will really matter. Assuming that firms and workers emerge from the crisis relatively unscathed, fiscal and monetary easing should lay the foundation for a swift rebound for the economy.</p> <p> An economic recovery, when it materializes, is not consistent with the pound at its current levels. A number of factors have prompted the pound\u2019s slump. Demand for safe-haven dollars is one, but the UK\u2019s reliance on the \u201ckindness of strangers\u201d is also important given its large current account deficit.</p> <p>In our view, the UK will cope no worse than others in the downturn, nor will it miss out on the rebound.

New orders also took a significant hit as the rapid realisation of the significance of COVID-19 applied an abrupt brake on consumer-facing businesses. </p> <p>\u201cShortages of manufacturing components following global factory closures dislocated manufacturing supply chains and led to the greatest lengthening of delivery times since the index began in 1992. A surge in demand for food and pharmaceutical products led to rising output in some parts of the manufacturing sector, but this was more than offset by a slump in production elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cAs more serious measures are considered by the UK Government, the effect of coronavirus on businesses will get much worse.

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic could wipe out populations of chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, leading scientists have warned.</p> <p>Our closest living relatives, which share about 98% of human DNA, are known to be susceptible to catching respiratory diseases from people.</p> <p>Even pathogens producing mild symptoms in humans have been lethal to great apes in the past. The fact that Covid-19 is fatal for some humans leads experts to fear it could potentially prove devastating to great apes.</p> <p>No <a href=\"https://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/great_apes/\">great apes</a> have yet been reported to have contracted Covid-19, so the true impact is unknown. But many great apes are already at risk of extinction due to forest destruction and poaching, so the researchers say closing national parks, reserves and zoos must be seriously considered.</p> <p>National parks in Congo and Rwanda have already shut to tourists and researchers, but the decision is not an easy one. Without a human presence, the risk of poaching rises.</p> <p>\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic is a critical situation for humans, our health and our economies,\u201d said Thomas Gillespie, at Emory University, US, and a lead author of a letter from 25 experts <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00859-y\">published in the journal Nature</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s also a potentially dire situation for great apes. There is a lot at stake for those in danger of extinction.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople who are younger, who may be less at risk for severe illness from Covid-19, are the ones who are more likely to be hiking into the national parks of Africa and Asia to see great apes in the wild,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cIt would be extremely difficult to monitor whether they were infected with Covid-19 since they may not have obvious symptoms.\u201d</p> <p>Research in 2008 revealed the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18222690\">first direct evidence of virus transmission</a> from humans to wild apes. Since then common human respiratory viruses have caused lethal outbreaks in wild great apes that have become used to people. In 2016 scientists reported the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6021434/\">transmission of a human coronavirus</a> to wild chimpanzees in the Ta\u00ef National Park in Ivory Coast.</p> <p>In 2017, Gillespie co-authored a report showing that 60% of the more than 500 primate species worldwide are threatened with extinction, while 75% have declining populations.</p> <p>The number of surviving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/mountain-gorilla-population-rises-above-1000\">mountain gorillas has been rising</a>, with about 1,000 now living in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, and the species was moved from critically endangered to endangered. It is the only great ape believed to be increasing in number.</p> <p>\u201cBut the recent gains could rapidly reverse if disease is introduced, so protection is key at this critical time,\u201d said Cath Lawson, Africa conservation manager at WWF UK.</p> <p>Action is also being taken to protect some orangutans, with the Sepilok Rehabilitation Centre closing in Malaysian Borneo. \u201cThis disease could be fatal for the already critically endangered orangutan: it is a risk that we cannot to afford take,\u201d said Susan Sheward of Orangutan Appeal UK.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.internationalprimatologicalsociety.org/docs/Final%20-%20SARS%20CoV-2%20and%20Great%20Apes%20Joint%20Communique%2016-05-20.pdf\">latest guidance</a> from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature says the distance normally kept between people and great apes should increase from 7m to 10m. It also says no one who is ill, or who has been in contact with anybody ill in the preceding 14 days, should be allowed to visit great apes.</p> <p>The authors of the Nature article conclude: \u201cWe hope for the best but should prepare for the worst and critically consider the impact of our activities on these endangered species.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has issued his most dire statement yet about the coronavirus pandemic, warning that coronavirus infection rates are rising much faster than expected and the state\u2019s hospitals are woefully unequipped for the deluge.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe inescapable conclusion is that the rate of infection is going up,\u201d Cuomo said at a press conference on Tuesday morning. \u201cIt is spiking. The apex is higher than we thought, and the apex is sooner than we thought. That is a bad combination of facts.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-fauci-meme-coronavirus-response\">Trump retweets Fauci meme criticizing his coronavirus response</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In New York state, 25,665 cases of coronavirus were confirmed as of Tuesday morning, with 210 deaths \u2013 far higher numbers than elsewhere in the US \u2013 as 14,776 cases and 131 fatalities were concentrated in New York City alone. New York is conducting more testing per capita than countries such as South Korea, which may partially explain the spike in numbers.</p> \n<p>The Democratic governor also attacked the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the crisis, saying federal authorities had offered his state just 400 ventilators when an estimated 30,000 additional machines will be needed.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to be smarter about this \u2026 we need the federal help and we need it now,\u201d he said, calling on Donald Trump to utilise the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force companies to produce medical equipment and provide them the necessary financial support to do so. So far, the administration has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/22/masks-ppe-3m-coronavirus/\">relied on volunteer efforts</a> that Cuomo said were not appropriate for the urgency of crisis.</p> \n<p>He also rejected the suggestion, floated by the president in recent days, that advice from public health officials could be rowed back in a matter of weeks to protect the US economy, saying that sensible steps in both areas could be made now without increasing risk to more vulnerable people in society.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy mother is not expendable,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe will not put a dollar figure on human life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking later in the day, the vice-president, Mike Pence, said the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had sent New York 2,000 ventilators and plans to send 2,000 more on Wednesday. Trump said he wanted restrictions to be lifted by Easter Sunday on 12 April, and to see churches \u201cpacked\u201d with people.</p> \n<p>At the daily White House briefing, coronavirus coordinator Dr Deborah Birx said New York was the country\u2019s hardest hit area, and advised people who have travelled from New York City to other parts of the country in recent days to self-quarantine for 14 days to try to contain the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio directly contradicted Trump during his press conference Tuesday, saying it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that the city would return to normal by April.

New York hospitals can currently support only 53,000 beds, and even the mandated 50% increase in capacity Cuomo announced yesterday will do little to undercut this severe dearth in resources.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the forecasters said we were looking at a freight train coming across the country. We\u2019re now looking at a bullet train,\u201d Cuomo said.</p> \n<p>Cuomo\u2019s urgent message comes as a spokesperson for the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the US has the potential to become the next global hotspot for the pandemic. The country already has more than 46,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases, resulting in close to 600 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat happens to New York is gonna wind up happening to California, and Washington state and Illinois. It\u2019s just a matter of time. We\u2019re just getting there first,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cLook at us today \u2026 where we are today, you will be in four weeks or five weeks or six weeks. We are your future.\u201d</p> \n<p>The outbreak has led to a dramatic change in America\u2019s social fabric: as of Monday, the New York Times estimated that more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/coronavirus-updates-usa-world.html#link-72d95537\">158 million</a> people in 16 states would soon be under strict orders to stay at home \u2013 approaching half of the population. In New York, bars, restaurants, clubs and gyms have shuttered, Broadway productions have gone dark, airports have emptied out and streets normally filled with activity have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/new-york-coronavirus-cases-worldwide-covid19\">largely become ghost towns</a>.</p> \n<p>But even as state and local governments took drastic measures to promote social distancing and self-isolation, Trump on Monday indicated the country may restart its economy long before expected, and before some health experts recommend.</p> \n<p>\u201cAmerica will again, and soon, be open for business \u2013 very soon \u2013 a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting,\u201d Trump said <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-9/\">during a press briefing</a>. \u201cA lot sooner. We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.\u201d</p> \n<p>The shift in messaging came after James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, predicted unemployment could reach 30% nationwide, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-22/fed-s-bullard-says-u-s-jobless-rate-may-soar-to-30-in-2q\">according to Bloomberg News</a>, and as negotiations for a coronavirus stimulus package dragged on for days in the US Senate.

  "<p>There are no books on how to talk to kids about a global pandemic. Three experts share advice on what to tell them about the coronavirus.</p> <h2><strong>Is there a right moment to talk to your kids about the coronavirus?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Madeline Levine</strong><strong>: </strong>As soon as your child has questions, or notices that things are different, you\u2019re going to have to be prepared to talk to them. The issue is how differently you talk to a five-year-old and a 15-year-old. Five-year-olds still live in a world of magic, things are real to them in ways they aren\u2019t to older children. So the virus is a terrifying thing, and they can\u2019t think logically. Keep your answers short \u2026 mostly they\u2019ll be reading how you\u2019re feeling more than anything that you have to say.</p> <p>You might say, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed things are different around here, do you have any questions?\u201d You can use this simple, open-ended question, from time to time. Really young kids don\u2019t need a lot of information, they need their questions answered.</p> <h2><strong>What do you do when your child starts worrying about their own mortality, or the health of their parents and grandparents?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Levine: </strong>Kids have an extraordinary amount of partial information. They\u2019re not distinguishing simple things: many people who are sick don\u2019t have coronavirus; most people who have coronavirus aren\u2019t going to die. If you have older kids it\u2019s a great opportunity to work with them around how they hear media, what it means, and what reliable media sources are.</p> <p>The answer is: No we aren\u2019t all going to die.You can say, \u201cWe\u2019ve had other problems like this before, everybody is working really hard to make things safe for people.\u201d Kids think everybody who is sick is going to die from coronavirus, but most people who are sick have a cold or the flu. Once kids are seven or eight they can start teasing that out because they can think logically.</p> <p><strong>Ashanti Woods:</strong> If a child has a fear about how the coronavirus is going to affect grandma and grandpa, a parent should be honest. They might say, \u201cYou know, coronavirus can make older people more sick than younger people, and that\u2019s why \u2026\u201d and then we include a health tip. \u201cThat\u2019s why we want to make sure we\u2019re washing our hands \u2026 that\u2019s why when we sneeze we\u2019re using a clean Kleenex \u2026 that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing FaceTime visits with grandma and grandpa.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>How do you explain to a child the importance of physical distancing?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Levine: </strong>I think the presentation, again, depends totally on the child\u2019s age. Most kids around seven to 11 are really good logical thinkers. I think that you have to pose that \u2026 it\u2019s hard for the moment, but they can talk to their friends on FaceTime and Skype. Kids in that age group are interested in being helpful. Coronavirus doesn\u2019t mean anything to them, so you talk to them about germs. Make sure they know that it isn\u2019t endless. This will end, every pandemic and epidemic will end. Right now for three weeks we have been asked to take care of ourselves and our neighbors. We are all taking care of each other.</p> <p><strong>Joshua Klapow:</strong> The basic concept is to avoid airborne or surface droplets. So explain that the farther everyone is away from one another, the less the chance that a sneeze, cough or even a breath can push the virus out of one person and on to or in another. It\u2019s a simple concept for all ages \u2013 the more people you stay away from (and the farther you stay away), the less chance of getting sick or passing on the virus. Showing them specifically how far 6ft is, and explaining maybe in pictures or videos the concept of droplets, for younger children, will give them a visual that will make sense.</p> <h2><strong>How do you emphasize to younger kids the importance of washing their hands without creating anxiety?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Klapow: </strong>Let a child know, especially younger children under age 12, that washing their hands is not something we do just because there is a virus or sickness going around. This is exactly what we want you to do every day. Every time you eat, come in contact with someone, touch a surface, touch your face. Explain to them that this is what people need to do every day. Once they understand that, stress that right now we are going to be extra careful to wash all the germs off of our hands. By normalizing the behavior, which is in fact a normal hygiene behavior, we empower children because they mostly know how to do the action.</p> <p><strong>Woods: </strong>You can start off with a reward system. Make it fun, it doesn\u2019t have to be singing happy birthday. You can sing Baby Shark or any cool song. That kid who is anti-20 seconds and has ants in their pants, hand sanitizer might be the next best option.</p> <h2><strong>How do you ensure </strong><strong>children aren\u2019t getting the wrong messages from others, for instance when President Trump refers to Covid-19 as the \u2018Chinese virus\u2019?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Levine: </strong>Viruses don\u2019t have nationalities. With a younger child you can ask, \u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d It\u2019s a great opportunity to correct misinformation.</p> <h2><strong>Panel:</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Dr Madeline Levine, PhD, is a practicing child psychologist, author and co-founder of Challenge Success, a project of the Stanford Graduate School of Education</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Dr Joshua Klapow, PhD, clinical psychologist and adjunct associate professor of public health, University of Alabama at Birmingham</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p>Dr Ashanti Woods, MD., FAAP, specializes in general pediatrics at Mercy Family Care Physicians in Baltimore, Maryland</p></li> </ul>",

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/17/moria-is-a-hell-new-arrivals-describe-life-in-a-greek-refugee-camp\">notorious Moria camp</a> on Lesbos houses nearly 20,000 people in a space designed for 2,200.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the EU fails to take immediate action, the situation on the Greek islands will become unmanageable with the risk of many deaths. This is an emergency and the EU has to react accordingly,\u201d the letter states.</p> \n<p>The MEPs want people over 60 with existing health conditions evacuated first, but do not spell out whether they should go to other EU member states or the Greek mainland.</p> \n<p>The European commission said it was working with Greece on an emergency response plan to deal with a potential outbreak of coronavirus on the islands. A commission spokesperson said Greek authorities were taking action to prevent the spread of the disease, with compulsory temperature testing of new arrivals to the camps, suspension of visits, regular cleaning of communal areas, and the setting up of quarantine and recovery areas.</p> \n<p>The spokesperson also referred to an ongoing push to encourage EU member states to give a home to unaccompanied children on the Greek islands. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/eu-to-offer-2000-to-migrants-willing-to-go-home-from-greek-islands\">Seven countries pledged earlier this month to take in 1,600 children from the islands</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cDiscussions are ongoing about the operational, practical aspects of the relocation [of children] as a matter of urgency and we are very much hoping to have this up and running as soon as possible,\u201d a commission spokesperson said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Growing restrictions on everyday life across Europe raise questions about how quickly relocation can happen.</p> \n<p>Greece went into nationwide lockdown on Monday, limiting residents to their homes for all but essential journeys.</p> \n<p>A few days before the lockdown began, Ylva Johansson, EU commissioner for home affairs, told journalists that Greek authorities were carrying out age assessments on asylum seekers in order to begin relocation of children.</p> \n<p>She also said asylum procedures in many EU member states were slowing down. \u201cMany member states have put asylum processes on hold because they don\u2019t want to do face-to-face meetings and then there are no interviews with asylum seekers. Some member states are beginning to do that on Skype instead, but this brings some delay into the system.\u201d</p> \n<p>Restrictions on travel from Europe are also slowing the return of people whose asylum claims have been rejected, to their country of origin. \u201cThis is not really a problem yet, but there are a lot of cases that we know are on hold and that could cause problems in the long run,\u201d Johansson said.</p> \n<p>Human rights groups have urged Athens to take action. In a joint statement on Tuesday , 21 groups said: \u201cExtremely limited access to running water, toilets, and showers, as well as hours-long lines for food distribution and insufficient medical and nursing personnel, make it impossible to abide by the guidelines for protection from the coronavirus, putting people at significantly heightened risk in the face of the growing threat of widespread Covid-19 transmission.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian last week, the Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis expressed hope that around 5,000 migrants would help ease the pressure by \u201ctaking up\u201d the EU\u2019s \u201cgenerous offer\u201d, but acknowledged it was just the tip of the iceberg. The scheme to relocate up to 1,600 unaccompanied minors to other member states wasn\u2019t expected to be in place until May, he said.</p> \n<p>As an emergency step, authorities have placed all of the migrant camps on lockdown since March 16, banning visitors, including aid agencies, from entering them. The measure was enforced a week before similar restrictions came into effect nationwide.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month, some 450 people, who arrived on the outposts after March 1<sup>st</sup>- when Greece closed its borders to asylum seekers following Turkey\u2019s threat to \u201copen the gates to Europe\u201d - were moved in a tank landing vessel to detention centres on the mainland. Athens\u2019 migration minister Notis Mitarachis said authorities had deliberately kept the new arrivals away from the camps to reduce the risk of an outbreak. But he conceded that it is only a matter of time before the virus reached the camps. \u201cIt is a given that there will be cases,\u201d he told Sunday\u2019s Eleftheros Typos newspaper.</p>",
  "<p>Just a few weeks ago, I was confident that Donald Trump\u2019s days in the White House were numbered. The economy was tanking; coronavirus cases were soaring. And what was the president doing?

On the same day, the Dow Jones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/global-stock-markets-post-biggest-falls-since-2008-financial-crisis\">plunged more than 2,000 points</a> and Trump cheerfully retweeted <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-plunge-coronavirus-spreads-and-trump-retweets-image-of-himself-playing-a-fiddle-with-an-ominous-message-2020-03-08\">a doctored photo of him playing a violin</a>, remarking: \u201cWho knows what this means, but it sounds good to me!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-nero-meme_n_5e658685c5b68d61645632c2\">\u201cNero\u201d</a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-nero-meme_n_5e658685c5b68d61645632c2\"> immediately started trending</a>.</p> <p>Trump may be fiddling while the world burns, but, over the past week, he has sharply changed his tune. The guy who recently assured us that Covid-19 would \u201clike a miracle \u2026 disappear\u201d now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\">insists</a> that, actually, he knew it was \u201ca pandemic long before it was called a pandemic\u201d. Having realised he can\u2019t just bluster coronavirus away, Trump has rewritten the past, adopted a newly sombre tone and reinvented himself as a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/22/819672681/trump-tries-on-the-mantle-of-wartime-president\">\u201cwartime</a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/22/819672681/trump-tries-on-the-mantle-of-wartime-president\">\u201d president</a>. Last Monday, Trump finally admitted the gravity of the situation and announced a 15-day plan to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.16.20_coronavirus-guidance_8.5x11_315PM.pdf\">\u201cslow the spread\u201d</a> of the virus.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s new pandemic persona has been playing well. Last Tuesday, CNN\u2019s chief political correspondent, Dana Bash, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/03/17/cnns_dana_bash_on_coronavirus_president_trump_is_being_the_kind_of_leader_that_people_need.html\">lavished praise on the president</a>. \u201cHe is being the kind of leader that people need,\u201d Bash told viewers, \u201cin a tone that people need and want and yearn for in times of crisis and uncertainty.\u201d The public seems to agree. A poll released on Friday by <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/coronavirus-upends-nation-americans-lives-changed-pandemic-poll/story?id=69696172\">ABC News and Ipsos</a> found that 55% of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling the Covid-19 crisis. That is a 12% increase from a poll taken on 11-12 March. A <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/03/20/trump-approval-coronavirus-response/\">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted from Tuesday to Friday last week similarly found that 53% of Americans approve of the way he has dealt with the pandemic.</p> <p>Trump has managed to turn himself from Nero to hero in a week. This is incredible, when you consider the fact that he has not done anything substantial; he has just acknowledged that Covid-19 may be more serious than the flu after all. But that is the beauty of setting an incredibly low bar for yourself; it is easy to fail upwards.</p> <p>Alas, it seems as if a week of halfheartedly listening to global health experts has proved too much for Trump. On Sunday night, clearly frustrated that the stock market keeps diving, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241935285916782593\">he tweeted</a>: \u201cWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.\u201d In a press conference on Monday, he announced that the US will be open for business soon, and seemed to reject the idea that restrictive public health measures would continue for months. What does that mean exactly? Who knows. The only thing that is clear at the moment is that Trump cares more about the health of the stock market than the health of Americans.</p> <p>It is easy to dump on Trump, but it is not like the Democrats have inspired much confidence during this crisis either. Nancy Pelosi, the house speaker, recently shot down an idea to send cheques to every American because she wanted to <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/18/refusal-pelosi-consider-universal-cash-payments-response-coronavirus-pandemic\">means-test the payments</a>; not exactly a way to win hearts and minds. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, the presumptive presidential nominee, was <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/3/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-presidential-campaign\">missing in action</a> for most of last week; his absence caused <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/20/whereisjoe-biden-trends-sanders-host-coronavirus-roundtable-address-pandemic\">#WhereIs</a><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/20/whereisjoe-biden-trends-sanders-host-coronavirus-roundtable-address-pandemic\">Joe to trend on </a><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/20/whereisjoe-biden-trends-sanders-host-coronavirus-roundtable-address-pandemic\">Twitter</a> and sparked conspiracy theories that the 77-year-old is ill. <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/coronavirus-upends-2020-race-biden-seeks-offers-presidency/story?id=69697395\">A source told ABC</a> that Biden desperately wanted to be in daily contact with Americans, but was facing a few logistical challenges to video briefings; the ceilings in his home were low, you see, making lighting a challenge.</p> <p>If Biden can\u2019t figure out a home studio, I don\u2019t know how he is going to solve a global health crisis. Unless coronavirus kills us all first, it seems highly likely that we have another four years of Trump to look forward to.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>The Trump administration badly undermined the effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak by getting rid of most staff tasked with identifying global health problems in China while repeatedly attempting to slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to a new report by an environmental watchdog.</p> <p>Over the past three years, the Trump administration has drastically reduced a team working in China to identify global health threats like Covid-19, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

It has also attempted to reduce funding to help countries in Africa still suffering from the Ebola epidemic, overseen the loss of 61 staff from the CDC\u2019s disease prevention program and proposed deep cuts to the CDC\u2019s environmental health work.</p> <p>Christopher Sellers, an expert in the environment and health at Stony Brook University and a lead author of the report, said the Trump administration\u2019s actions slowed down the response to the virus and probably affected the preparedness of hospitals and various government agencies to the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe administration has repeatedly and systematically corroded critical parts of the CDC,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cThis was just begging for an epidemic to hit us. It was a perfect storm of lack of preparation.\u201d</p> <p>Sellers added: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of incredible they are now trying to rewrite history to say we have plenty of resources when they\u2019ve systematically targeted them. They should be held responsible by the American people as it is outrageous.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Trump initially reacted to the onward march of coronavirus by calling it a \u201choax\u201d before then, also inaccurately, claiming that the US had completely contained the disease.</p> <p>The president has since declared a national state of emergency but the federal response has been dogged by a severe lack of testing, a dearth of crucial medical supplies such as ventilators and false and misleading statements by Trump over the need to avoid large gatherings of people.</p> <p>On Sunday, the president was asked in a press conference about the administration\u2019s cuts to the CDC, in particular the removal of an epidemiologist embedded within China\u2019s own CDC equivalent.</p> <p>Trump said: \u201cWe actually gave CDC more money, not less money. They said we defunded. It turned out it was more money. Every one of those things that were said were 100% wrong, and this sounds like another one them.\u201d</p> <p>Trump then sought to blame China for the crisis. \u201cI wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem,\u201d the president said about a disease that emerged in December and was then reported by China to the World Health Organization in January. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d</p>",

What about the street next door?\u201d</p> <p>Safety is her third worry. Already there are <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51964507\">reports of scammers</a> taking advantage of vulnerable people, including by offering to do their shopping. \u201cIf it\u2019s your neighbour, and you know them and like them, you\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s what happens if it\u2019s someone you\u2019ve never met before.\u201d</p> <p>With self-isolaters unable to get out to cashpoints, she worries that people will be tempted to hand over bank cards and pin numbers. \u201cAlthough there are gorgeous people doing wonderful things, there are some real scumbags out there,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Alsina is talking to other charities and to the government about ensuring that any help for older and younger disabled people is comprehensive, and that a balance is struck between fostering neighbourhood volunteering and protecting vulnerable householders. The potential silver lining of the crisis, she thinks, is that we will emerge a stronger and more cohesive society in which many more of us will know our neighbours and not have to resort to saying, when asked, that they kept themselves to themselves.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting positive that could come out of this,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s turn this tricky, negative situation into something terribly positive where we reconnect with family, friends and neighbours or connect with neighbours for the first time.

However, it has also been losing money on its day-to-day activities, which include providing a friendship service for around 2,5000 people identified as chronically lonely and running advice helplines. Its <a href=\"https://www.independentage.org/annual-report-and-accounts-2018\">latest published accounts</a> from 2018, show that the charity had to draw on \u00a314.5m from its reserves.</p> <p>Alsina joined IA from Bowel Cancer UK where she was chief executive for a decade and led its strong growth from a starting point of, in her words, \u201cnear-collapse\u201d. She applied for the job because she sees ageing as a cause still not fully recognised by society, and Alsina says she is is drawn to underdogs.</p> <p>At AI she faces paradoxical tasks of putting the charity in good financial order while at the same time planning to spend more of its resources to increase its impact.

  "<p>In 1902, before what would prove Reggie Schwarz\u2019s final summer as an Englishman, Surrey\u2019s Henry Leveson-Gower wrote a preview of the county season in which the then Middlesex player received a brief mention. \u201cIt seems that all those who appeared for the metropolitan county last year will again be available, though Mr RO Schwarz is not likely to play.\u201d That\u2019s because he wasn\u2019t good enough: just about good enough to be on Middlesex\u2019s books, Schwarz \u2013 who had already played three times for England at rugby union \u2013 was not considered good enough to actually play for them.</p> <p>As it happens he did get a few games in 1902 but didn\u2019t do much to change anyone\u2019s opinion of him, averaging 8.12 with the bat across 18 innings, bowling only 30 overs and taking a single wicket. On 1 September his final innings ended with a duck, and six days later he boarded the Kingfauns Castle, heading for a new life in South Africa. The following March the Sportsman mentioned him in a summary of Cape cricket: \u201cHe has been singularly unlucky, and in his last few matches has been dead out of form. It may be that the change of climate has had its effect on his play.\u201d</p> <p>Just two years later he was back \u2013 and transformed. Picked to play for South Africa predominately as a batsman, he did not bowl until the second innings of their fourth match, against Oxford University, with the students already on 116 for two. Precisely 7.2 overs later he had five wickets, all clean bowled, and Oxford were all out for 167. He ended the tour as the leading wicket-taker, with 96 at 14.81.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/the-nightwatchman/2020/mar/23/life-measured-out-in-cricket-bats\">Life measured out in cricket bats | The Nightwatchman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMr Schwarz\u2019s bowling has come as an unpleasant revelation in its new form to his old comrades,\u201d wrote the Sportsman after he had \u201cplayed havoc\u201d as the tourists beat Middlesex. The Evening Standard said he \u201chas improved beyond all knowledge as an all-round exponent of the game since he played for Middlesex a few years back\u201d. And he hadn\u2019t even reached his peak.</p> <p>In fact he had picked up the skills that would transform his reputation while still at Middlesex, where he had played alongside Bernard Bosanquet, inventor of the googly. A fast-bowler at school and a medium-pacer by the time he emigrated, he returned a googly specialist. Some accounts suggest the key lessons actually took place during that 1904 tour, but it seems extremely unlikely not to have happened before, given the pair\u2019s longstanding friendship \u2013 Bosanquet had, for example, invited Schwarz on a short tour of the United States he organised in the autumn of 1901.</p> <p>Nicolas Bosanquet, Bernard\u2019s brother, later wrote that Schwarz had benefited from \u201cmany hours of patient instruction from the inventor, whose only pupil he was\u201d and if the instruction was patient, so was the subsequent improvement. \u201cHe openly boasted of his unsuccessful efforts when he first attempted to imitate Bosanquet\u2019s style,\u201d the Reading Observer wrote. \u201cFor weeks he persevered in the nets of the wanderers club at Johannesburg without getting a ball within yards of the wicket. Other cricketers used to assemble in order to play off their latest jokes at him. But it made no difference; Schwarz kept on and, so he says, when the ball did go inside the net he was cheered to the echo.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eaea9a5f3d8050ea55c2c763751ff81158de0bcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaea9a5f3d8050ea55c2c763751ff81158de0bcd/116_0_2635_1581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Africa 1907\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The South Africa team that toured England in 1907: (back row, l-r) Dudley Nourse, Harry Smith, William Shalders, Maitland Hathorn, Aubrey Faulkner, manager G Allsop; (middle row, l-r) Jimmy Sinclair, Reggie Schwarz, Rev Cyril Robinson, Percy Sherwell, Louis Tancred, Bert Vogler, Johannes Kotze; (front row, l-r) Tip Snooke, Gordon White, Stanley Snooke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: S&amp;G/S&amp;G and Barratts/EMPICS Sport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In time the googly became Schwarz\u2019s stock ball; he could manage a delivery that went straight, but never mastered the leg break. What he could do, however, is bowl his googly at previously unimagined pace. \u201cSchwarz, in form, was many lengths ahead of any of the household names among bowlers,\u201d the Guardian wrote in 1921. \u201cAlone among bowlers of the highest class Schwarz could, and did, break the ball from the off to a greater width and more quickly than any other bowler ever seen.\u201d Indeed, Schwarz could get so much turn that CB Fry suggested professors of applied mathematics should take a look at his action. \u201cIf Reggie could bowl a leg-break he would be the best bowler in the world,\u201d said Gordon White, another member of the 1904 touring side. \u201cNobody would be able to stand against him. But for the life of him he cannot break from the leg side \u2013 only from the off. Still, Schwarz is our greatest man. Bowling with him is a passion.\u201d</p> <p>White was one of several South Africans to whom Schwarz passed on his skills, and when the team returned in 1907 that pair, along with fellow practitioners Aubrey Faulkner and Bert Vogler, were unplayable. Schwarz, at his zenith, led the way, taking 143 wickets at 11.5. South Africa won 10 matches and lost two, though England won the nations\u2019 first Test series 1-0 after two draws. In 1908 Leveson-Gower, who had written Schwarz off only a few years earlier, wrote an essay on \u201cthe era of that weird and wonderful googly\u201d. \u201cBosanquet is the proud owner of the patent; but though owner, he was never really a master of it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was left to the South Africans to master his theory.\u201d </p> <p>In 1909-10 England lost a five-Test series in South Africa 3-2, with Schwarz\u2019s influence now fading and Vogler and Faulkner responsible for 65 of 88 English wickets to fall. When the first world war broke out Schwarz joined the King\u2019s Royal Rifles. English newspapers gave sporadic updates of his progress, including an injury to his right hand inflicted by his own horse, and his promotion to deputy assistant quartermaster general (\u201cA big promotion for the greatest of all googly bowlers,\u201d trilled the Mirror).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Spin\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>South Africa\u2019s four googly specialists nearly made it through the war.

sector \u2013 and what\u2019s going to happen.<br></p> \n  <p>A walk down your local shopping strip will show you that some retailers have already pulled the plug rather than try to tough it out any further in a sector that\u2019s already been smashed by years of persistently low consumer confidence, which means households are reluctant to spend.</p> \n  <p>The hospitality and entertainment sectors have already been almost completely shut down, tipping huge numbers of people into the dole queues we\u2019ve seen stretching around the block over the past two days.</p> \n  <p>Non-essential retail is also getting hammered and is in line to be shut down next \u2013 remember, the Victorian and NSW governments announced just that on Sunday afternoon, before abandoning the plan later that evening at national cabinet.<br>Shopping centre owners have already lost their foodcourts and analysts say they are likely to have to give up trying to collect rent from at least some tenants \u2013 a big turnaround from their usual habit of regularly hiking rents.<br></p> \n  <p>Analysts at Macquarie forecast this will cut shopping centre rents in half for at least three months.<br></p> \n  <p>Macquarie analysts and their rivals at UBS both think most shopping centre operators have enough money in the bank to absorb the pain.</p> \n  <p>But their tenants are in a lot more trouble.</p> \n  <p>Today, Retail Food Group, which is the franchiser of a raft of foodcourt favourites including Gloria Jean\u2019s, Brumby\u2019s, Donut King, Michel\u2019s Patisserie, Pizza Capers and Crust Pizza, withdrew its profit forecasts.</p> \n  <p>\u201cA reduced customer count amongst RFG\u2019s domestic franchise network, as a consequence of the increasingly onerous restrictions made in a series of announcements by the government since last week, is anticipated by the company (and supported by recent trading data referable to that period),\u201d it told the ASX.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe trend will likely be more pronounced, in the company\u2019s view, amongst outlets operating within shopping centres.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

UK producers Chase &amp; Status concoct a menacing, dubstep-adjacent beat for the prowling Wait Your Turn, while the appropriately named Hard employs industrial-strength bravado (\u201cbrilliant, resilient, fan-mail from 27 million\u201d) to paper over any cracks in her armour. As well as trying out different genres, from the aforementioned dabbles in dubstep to the excellent Fire Bomb\u2019s 80s OTT rock balladry, Rated R also sees Rihanna sparring with more cliched masculine tropes. So the Slash-assisted Rockstar 101 finds her revelling in tortured genius territory, rolling lines like \u201csleep all day, long nights\u201d around in her mouth with renewed relish, while G4L\u2019s bass-heavy hip-hop peacocking features more natural charisma than an entire compilation of male rappers could muster.</p> <p>Still, Rihanna\u2019s personal life bleeds into the morbid atmospherics of mid-tempo lead single Russian Roulette, specifically during the excellent, emotionally charged middle eight: \u201cAs my life flashes before my eyes, I\u2019m wondering will I ever see another sunrise,\u201d she sings with a previously unheard emotional connection. It crops up again on the twisted revenge fantasy of the chugging Fire Bomb. This being a Rihanna album, there are flashes of pure, escapist pop \u2013 the lascivious Rude Boy, the Latin-tinged love story Te Amo \u2013 but the ultimate takeaway is of a pop star who had previously been defined by other people \u2013 be it her early mentor Jay-Z, or more catastrophically, Brown \u2013 making a statement above and beyond the narrative being written for her. </p> <h2><strong>The three albums to check out next</strong></h2> <p><strong>Good Girl Gone Bad (2007)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1mU6h4Xdxc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E1mU6h4Xdxc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Rihanna: Disturbia \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>2007\u2019s Good Girl Gone Bad (and 2008\u2019s equally hit-heavy Reloaded re-release) marked the point Rihanna morphed from radio-slaying popstar to fully blown pop culture-dominating megastar.

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic has brought urgency to the defining political question of our age: how to distribute risk. As with the climate crisis, neoliberal capitalism is proving particularly ill-suited to this.</p> <p>Like global warming, but in close-up and fast-forward, the Covid-19 outbreak shows how lives are lost or saved depending on a government\u2019s propensity to acknowledge risk, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/how-did-china-get-grips-with-coronavirus-outbreak\">act rapidly to contain it</a>, and share the consequences.</p> <p>On these matters, competence and ideology overlap. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/south-korea-rapid-intrusive-measures-covid-19\">Governments willing to intervene</a> have been more effective at stemming the virus than laissez-faire capitalists.

Until recently, his government put more money into shielding the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/opec-poised-to-slash-oil-output-as-coronavirus-cuts-demand\">oil industry</a> than providing adequate testing kits. He reportedly ordered officials to downplay early warnings because he did not want bad news in an election year. The US now has one of the fastest rising numbers of new cases in the world.</p> <p>In Brazil, the ultra-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/brazils-jair-bolsonaro-says-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-media-trick\">equally reckless</a>. He claimed the risks of coronavirus were overblown, until 17 of his aides and security detail tested positive after a trip to the US. Last weekend, he ignored his own government\u2019s advice and chose to shake hands and pose cheek-to-cheek for selfies at a mass rally of supporters. As cases and deaths surge, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/brazilians-protest-bolsonaro-coronavirus-panelaco\">support has plummeted</a>.</p> <p>In the UK, Boris Johnson acknowledged the risk, but did little about it. Though not as extreme in his denial as Trump or Bolsonaro, Johnson\u2019s government first dithered, then dabbled with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-expert-advice-wrong\">policy of \u201cherd-immunity\u201d</a>that was reportedly driven by Dominic Cummings\u2019 desire to protect the economy, even if it cost pensioners\u2019 lives. The UK has since shifted tack and enforced a lockdown, but its controls are still haphazard. Last week, daily deaths in the UK were reckoned to be on a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1240723388336877569?s=21\">steeper upward curve</a> than Italy was at the same stage.</p> <p>By contrast, more interventionist governments \u2013 generally but not exclusively those which are centrist or leftwing \u2013 have acted more quickly and shared the burden of risk more widely. Norway, Denmark and Sweden already appear to have flattened the coronavirus curve. Spain and France implemented lockdowns at around 200 deaths, which the UK and US have far surpassed.</p> <p>In Asia, China initially attempted to hide the problem from the public when the virus emerged in Wuhan, then mobilised huge public resources to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">enforce a strict lockdown</a> and provide extra hospital beds. South Korea, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/coronavirus-outbreak-taipei-taiwan-china\">Taiwan</a> and Thailand also appear to have turned the corner thanks to different combinations of extensive testing, quarantine measures and public health education.</p> <p>Other factors are at play. Asian countries with prior experience of the Sars epidemic appear to have been better prepared. Italy, one of the worst affected countries, has one of the world\u2019s oldest populations. In Japan\u2019s case, the relatively flat curve of confirmed cases may also be a result of the government\u2019s unwillingness to do widespread testing because it could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-2020-olympics-will-be-postponed-within-days-due-to-coronavirus\">jeopardise the Olympics</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, the relatively low number of cases in the global south has raised hopes that warmer weather <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615381/coronavirus-spread-could-slow-with-warmer-weather/\">might slow the disease</a> \u2013 but this is far from certain. A comparatively low number of coronavirus cases could be the result of a lag caused by distance from the origin of the disease, relatively lower levels of international traffic, and fewer resources for testing.</p> <p>This pandemic has amplified the importance of assessing and controlling risk before it gets out of hand. But the political champions of the neoliberal right, such as Trump and Bolsonaro, are more inclined to deny and delay, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/26/the-guardian-view-on-the-threat-of-bolsonaro-tropical-disaster-is-man-made\">climate politics have shown us</a> in recent years.</p> <p>When it comes to a pandemic like Covid-19, that position is untenable. No leader can deny the science, nor can they endlessly delay action as they have done on global heating. Muddling through until the next election is not an option; leaders will be judged on deaths next week, not emissions reductions in 2050.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/24/uk-coronavirus-live-news-lockdown-boris-johnson-sports-direct-abandons-talk-of-opening-stores-as-gove-clarifies-scope-of-lockdown-rules\">Coronavirus UK live news: Gove not ruling out tighter lockdown as supermarkets police in-store distancing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The demographics are also completely different. Unlike the climate crisis, the virus predominantly threatens the elderly \u2013 the right\u2019s core support group \u2013 rather than millennials. So far, the worst affected regions are also closer to the centre of economic power: the cool industrialised north rather than the warmer developing south (though the latter may suffer more in the future due to weaker healthcare systems).</p> <p>For the right, this makes the pandemic a greater political threat than the climate crisis has ever been. Unless they can quickly get on top of the disease, they will lose any claim to being champions of national security. It is entirely possible that the effects of this pandemic could be one of the most catastrophic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-exposed-extent-uk-social-crisis\">failures of free-market capitalism</a>.</p> <p>This should also be a lesson for the left.

Until now, the left has recognised these dangers, but done little to act on them because economic growth has always taken precedence.</p> <p>The pandemic has proved that delays are deadly and expensive. If we are to avoid a cascade of future crises, governments must <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\">think beyond a return to business as usual</a>. Our conception of what is \u201cnormal\u201d will have to change. We\u2019ll need to invest in natural life-supporting systems such as a stable climate, fresh air and clean water. In the past, those goals have been dismissed as unrealistic or expensive, but recent weeks have shown how quickly the political compass can shift.</p> <p>First though, we need to accept \u2013 and share \u2013 risk. Instead of deferring risks to future generations, weaker populations and natural systems, governments need to transform risks into responsibilities we all bear. The longer we hesitate, the fewer resources we will have at our disposal, and the more risk we will have to divide.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Watts is the Guardian\u2019s global environment editor</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Hospitals in England will run short of critical care beds for Covid-19 patients within the next two weeks if the numbers becoming severely ill escalate on the scale experienced in Italy, say doctors.</p> \n<p>A paper by a team at the University of Cambridge says that five of the seven NHS commissioning regions will have more patients needing critical care than the number of beds normally available in hospital intensive care units (ICUs) within a fortnight.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/24/uk-lockdown-gove-tries-to-clarify-confusion-over-rules\">announcement of a partial lockdown</a> on Monday night, telling everyone to stay at home, is intended to prevent a disastrous scenario in the NHS, in which the health service is inundated with coronavirus patients and cannot cope.

It is a good model, although scary.\u201d The Imperial modellers calculated that 200 ICU beds would be needed per 100,000 people in the population, said Ercole.

  "<p>The economic rescue packages to deal with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/prepare-for-the-coronavirus-global-recession\">impact of the coronavirus</a> must also be green, a growing chorus of environmental campaigners have urged, concerned that hasty measures will lock the world into a high-carbon future.</p> \n<p>\u201cGovernments need to put huge amounts of money into trying to sustain jobs and livelihoods,\u201d said Mary Robinson, a former Irish president and UN high commissioner for human rights, who served twice as UN climate envoy. \u201cBut they must do it with a very strong green emphasis. The threat from climate change is as real as the threat from Covid-19, though it seems far away.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cMoney has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/global-banks-climate-crisis-finance-fossil-fuels\">poured</a> into the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement [of 2015],\u201d she said. \u201cThat can\u2019t continue.\u201d</p> \n<p>But she said the changes wrought in societies around the world by dealing with Covid-19 would also demonstrate to people that the changes needed to achieve a low-carbon future were much less drastic and far more palatable. As far as the climate was concerned, \u201cwe must not go back to bad habits afterwards\u201d, she said. \u201cIt will be easier to persuade people, as we have had to change so dramatically because of this threat.\u201d</p> \n<p>Economic plans worth trillions of dollars in public money are being rolled out to stave off the immediate collapse of some badly hit businesses, such as airlines and tourism \u2013 and to protect the incomes of workers in danger of redundancy as normal life becomes impossible across Europe and large parts of the US, as it already has in many parts of east Asia.</p> \n<p>But while people\u2019s health and the immediate welfare of workers caught up in the crisis are paramount, campaigners and experts fear that if the longer-term packages are not carefully designed they will only entrench fossil fuel dependence across the global economy.</p> \n<p>\u201cGovernments are drawing up stimulus plans to counter the economic damage from coronavirus,\u201d said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. \u201cThese stimulus packages offer an excellent opportunity to ensure that the essential task of building a secure and sustainable energy future doesn\u2019t get lost amid the flurry of immediate priorities.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Bank of England is resuming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/bank-of-englands-qe-programme-is-bigger-than-the-city-expected\">its quantitative easing programme</a> of buying up assets to create liquidity in the financial system, as it did after the 2008 crash, but there are concerns that the programme has previously been used to buy bonds from fossil fuel companies including Shell, BP and Total.</p> \n<p>There have been calls in some areas, such as eastern Europe and in Asia, to ignore climate concerns and pour stimulus money into existing high-carbon businesses and fossil fuels, rather than seeking a balance with a longer-term view that includes the need to curb emissions.</p> \n<p>John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said governments must act urgently to protect people\u2019s livelihoods, which could be done without directing the money to prop up ailing sectors whose long-term future was already threatened by the climate crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cDecisions are being made now about whether to spend billions rescuing airlines, cruise ships, the oil and gas industry, among many others,\u201d he said. \u201cBailing out the shareholders of dirty industries to continue businessasusual rather than protecting workers and their families means we would have learnt nothing from the bank bailout during the financial crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>Green campaigners have long talked about a \u201cjust transition\u201d that would enable workers to move away from fossil fuel-dependent jobs and into skilled jobs with long-term low-carbon prospects.

But I would expect the UK to prioritise the immediate economic impact while also applying a climate lens and thinking about the longer term.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the US, campaigners are concerned that Donald Trump\u2019s hostility to climate science and wooing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/27/fossil-fuel-industry-clout-trump-era\">of fossil fuel industries</a> will skew the economic rescue packages in harmful ways. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/america-airlines-bailout-shareholders-coronavirus\">planned bailout</a> for airlines and the cruise industry\u2019s request for cash are an immediate worry.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven that airlines produce a very large and growing amount of climate pollution, any financial assistance should include requirements that these companies take action to reduce their emissions,\u201d said Annie Petsonk of the US-based Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cThe cruise industry, which has also requested billions in aid, has serious environmental impacts as well, and should meet new standards in exchange for government funding.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said that in return for public money, companies should give firm commitments on carbon. \u201c[That] would be a major step in the fight against climate change. Taxpayers, many of whom are now struggling financially, have the right to expect responsible behaviour in exchange for bailouts. They should not be funding private businesses only to see them create more costs for the public \u2013 in the form of climate impacts \u2013 in the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>For many experts, the vital point is that the lessons from the stimulus following the financial crisis more than a decade ago are learned. Then, as now, global greenhouse gas emissions paused as the crisis hit. But after the immediate impact, emissions began their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/29/carbon-emissions-nuclearpower\">steady rise again</a> and have continued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/paris-climate-deal-world-not-on-track-to-meet-goal-amid-continuous-emissions\">to do so since</a>, partly because the chance was missed to use the vast amounts of public money to set the world on a green path.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven the state will never again play such a powerful role in our economy, and more broadly the global economy, if there was ever a time to join the dots between responding to the health emergency and the climate and nature emergency then this is it,\u201d said Sauven. \u201cThe worst case would be that you haven\u2019t used this awful crisis to reorientate the economy to achieve a much better outcome for people and the environment globally.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><strong><br>The accident and emergency doctor</strong></p> <p><strong>Gus Khan, Greater London<br></strong>I have been treating coronavirus patients for the past month. A few weeks ago, when we were seeing the odd patient who had come back from China or Italy, we were being very cautious. We put on aprons and gowns and took all the right precautions. Then all of a sudden that stopped.</p> <p>We have been given flimsy aprons and were told surgical masks were OK rather than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/our-face-mask-future-do-they-really-help-beat-flu-coronavirus-and-pollution\">N95 masks</a> we had been using previously. No one has given us a satisfactory explanation for the change. It\u2019s obvious they are in short supply, but nobody wants to admit it. Yesterday, when I went into the \u201cdirty zone\u201d, which is where all the coronavirus patients are, I was told to use the flimsy apron and a surgical mask. That\u2019s like having a piece of paper in front of you to protect you, and I was in there for five hours.</p> <p>Remember that if we get sick when you get sick, we can\u2019t help you.

If I need food, my wife leaves it on the stairs for me. There is going to be an epidemic of stress among healthcare workers. There is talk of bringing back 72-hour weeks, and people are terrified. I haven\u2019t felt this way for a very long time.</p> <p>Procedures have been changing daily and we have been getting information by email. Clinicians are really confused about the pathways for getting people into hospital, and their managers are not being updated with the latest guidelines. We are only seeing a handful of patients at the moment, but we are struggling with the protocols, we are struggling with equipment, we are struggling with staff. Hospital workers will become ill and, when healthcare workers are themselves hospitalised, the service cannot function. When this really hits, it will be like nothing we have ever seen before.

I\u2019m a student at the university and have been working there for three years. I\u2019m contracted to work for 10 hours a week, but I have been working about 25 hours a week during the crisis. I was worried that I wouldn\u2019t qualify for sick pay because it only applies to staff who work a minimum of 12 hours, but last week we got a company email to say that if we were ill they were going to pay us regardless of our sick-pay qualification.</p> <p>It has been unpleasant working here with people breathing over you and having to handle money. The company was slow to put in any safety measures considering we have to touch people\u2019s bags and have high levels of contact with customers. They have given us hand sanitiser but no gloves or mask. I have been starting my shifts 20 minutes early to clean the place where I sit.</p> <p>The company is taking more measures now. They have put tape around the tills so that people can\u2019t come within a metre of you, but it\u2019s difficult because they have to make card payments and hand over cash, which is hard to do from a metre away. We have got a lot of older customers and you worry about them getting the virus, especially when they are mixing in the store with younger people who may have it without showing symptoms. My mother has loads of health problems, so I have been avoiding seeing her and my gran.</p> <p>The panic buying has been appalling \u2013 we have introduced a limit of two items on every product line. We\u2019ve had to bring in a security guard to help us enforce it. We have had abuse from customers because of the empty shelves and had to put a sign up warning people not to abuse the staff. Some make a joke about it, but there\u2019s a lot of anxiety.</p> <p><strong>The nurse</strong></p> <p><strong>Jennifer Hayes, south-east England<br></strong>I\u2019m a children\u2019s nurse and in the third trimester of my pregnancy. From the beginning we were made to nurse children who we thought might have coronavirus \u2013 they were nursed in A&amp;E without a mask and in open bays. It was not taken seriously. Gowns, masks, visors, gloves, handwash and sanitiser are all running low.</p> <p>We have been split into two wards: a \u201cclean ward\u201d and a \u201ccoronavirus ward\u201d, with nurses and doctors moving from one to the other and potentially cross-contaminating. Meanwhile, management are nowhere to be seen and are dictating through email. There have also been cases where children have been admitted who then develop symptoms, so they have to be moved from the clean side to the Covid-19 side. I put these in my incident reports, but I\u2019ve heard nothing back.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I am pregnant, but have been told by my managers that pregnant women are not exempt from caring for coronavirus patients</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Staff in contact with coronavirus patients have been told that self-isolating \u201cdoes not apply to healthcare workers \u2013 if it did there would be none left\u201d. They don\u2019t even want you to self-isolate if you have a family member who is showing symptoms. I am seven months pregnant, but have been told by my managers that pregnant women are not exempt from caring for coronavirus patients. I\u2019ve asked to be reallocated to a safer working environment, but this has been denied.</p> <p>My mental health is now horrific and my doctor has signed me off sick for two weeks \u2013 but the hospital still wants me to go back. I feel they don\u2019t care about me. I\u2019m going on maternity leave soon, and after that I plan to leave. I have lost all respect for the management. If I need anything or I\u2019m in danger, I\u2019m the least of their worries. They just see me as a number.</p> <p><strong>The care home cleaner</strong></p> <p><strong>Brian Crowne, Lancashire<br></strong>I\u2019m 42 and have been working as a cleaner in a care home for two years. I moved up north a couple of years ago, and it was the only job I could get. The home I clean in is for dementia patients, many of whom have very challenging behaviour. The owner of the home is fantastic, and has been working really hard to find out how she can limit the impact of this. Most of the residents are over 70 and if it gets in the house, everyone\u2019s a goner. With all the attention on hospitals, the work going on in care homes to keep the vulnerable safe often gets forgotten.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m imagining everywhere that is being touched, going round in circles, wiping and rewiping</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lots of the residents here have one-to-one care, so there are many carers coming in. Their temperature gets taken before they enter the building and, if it\u2019s high, they get sent home straight away. If we start losing staff because of illness, it will be exhausting for the ones left because it\u2019s very hard to isolate the residents. Some have to be watched the whole time and would tear the place apart if they were left alone.</p> <p>I usually clean the bedrooms, but am also working in the communal areas during the crisis. You have to use a second-stage cleaner (cleaning and then sanitising) and make sure you clean every door handle and anywhere likely to be touched, twice. They have very few cleaners, so often I\u2019m there by myself, fighting the invisible man, trying to imagine everywhere that\u2019s being touched, going round and round in circles wiping and rewiping. I\u2019ve got a herniated disc, which is slowing me down, but I\u2019m working a couple of hours more every day and doing weekends. If there\u2019s something I can do, I have to do it to be able to sleep at night. That sounds melodramatic, but these are people who can\u2019t care for themselves and the little bits may matter. I\u2019d like to think society might value cleaners\u2019 jobs more after this, but I don\u2019t suppose it will.<br></p> <p><strong>The paramedic</strong></p> <p><strong>Martin Meadowcroft, south of England<br></strong>I\u2019m a 53-year-old paramedic practitioner, trained to do things a doctor would traditionally have done. I\u2019m working in an urgent treatment centre \u2013 a satellite of the main hospital designed to take the pressure off it and off GPs.</p> <p>I live alone and am avoiding people as much as I can, because I\u2019m terrified the virus could be on my uniform. I wash my scrubs every day; I wash my hands assiduously; every time I get in and out of my car it\u2019s a risk; if I stop at the shops on the way to work to buy some food, it\u2019s a risk. It\u2019s a pretty sad and lonely life outside of work. It\u2019s stressful being on your own after a long shift. It\u2019s just work and sleep; it\u2019s relentless.</p> <p>It\u2019s a really strange atmosphere. I would call it a phoney war. We were mobbed until a few days ago and I was working 14-hour days, but now people have stopped turning up, either because they are scared of getting coronavirus here or because they are taking NHS advice not to bring it into a hospital. But we know that is going to change when the confirmed infected numbers begin to rise. Probably the main hospital will cease doing all minor injuries, and we will have to carry the can for that. Plus, the population panics more and wants to be seen and reassured, so we\u2019ll get a lot more people coming in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s stressful being on your own after a long shift.

If you come in with a broken wrist but you have also got coronavirus, we still have to treat your broken wrist. We ask people at reception if they have any coronavirus symptoms and, if they do, they are seated in a separate area and given a mask. If the triage nurse then thinks you have coronavirus, we are warned and don full PPE [personal protective equipment] while we examine and treat that patient.</p> <p>I used to work in Africa but became ill with something viral that destroyed my pancreas, so now I\u2019m very high-risk myself. If I get coronavirus, I\u2019m in a lot of trouble. That\u2019s makes doing this job very worrying for me, but your sense of duty and pride in the NHS kick in.

My mother is Chinese and at the very beginning, when the coronavirus was first breaking in China, she came to the UK to look after my son. She had recently had surgery for lung cancer and was wearing a mask \u2013 less because of the virus than because she found it very cold in the UK. But a man passed her in the street and shouted to her: \u201cWe don\u2019t wear that in England.\u201d</p> <p>She was upset and so was I, because I didn\u2019t think the fact she was wearing a mask should have bothered anybody. It was her choice. A lot of my Chinese friends have had similar experiences to my mother, and I\u2019ve heard racist language been spoken to Chinese kids about the virus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We are risking our lives to look after the kids.

I was working up till the final week before my school was closed, by which time you could feel people were worried. More and more staff and students had stopped coming in. Even though my school has now closed, I may have to go back to teach the children of keyworkers and children with special needs. I would be very worried if I did have to go back, especially with my mother being in a high-risk health category.</p> <p><br>In the UK there is a reluctance to wear masks.

  "<p>The health minister Greg Hunt has asked for an urgent briefing about the clinical trial of a decades-old drug in the prevention of Covid-19, as countries race to find a way to prevent serious cases and slow the spread.</p> <p>But infectious disease experts have warned the drug, hydroxychloroquine, is far from proven as effective in treating Covid-19 and that it could take several months for results to be conclusive. In previous studies for other conditions, hydroxychloroquine has been shown to cause heart damage and toxicity.</p> <p>On Tuesday Hunt spoke about government support for two trials involving hydroxychloroquine, which is an anti-malarial drug also used to treat autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/24/australia-is-crying-out-for-clearer-messaging-on-coronavirus-rambling-politicians-told\">Australia is crying out for clearer messaging on coronavirus, 'rambling' politicians told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The first trial, announced one week ago and being conducted by the University of Queensland, is looking at whether a hydroxychloroquine and an HIV drug used either in combination or on their own can reduce severity and length of Covid-19 if given to patients with the virus early after diagnosis.</p> <p>The second trial, being conducted by Melbourne\u2019s Walter and Eliza Hall Institute and which Hunt said had \u201cthe potential for possible prevention\u201d of the virus, will focus on giving 2,250 health workers around Australia hydroxychloroquine preemptively before and while they are exposed to patients with the virus. Researchers want to see if health workers taking the drug for four months are prevented from getting it.</p> <p>Infectious disease physician Prof Marc Pellegrini is leading that study and said health workers were at the frontline of treating the virus so any preventative drugs would be valuable.</p> <p>While hydroxychloroquine is effective for treating autoimmune conditions, Pellegrini said researchers were not sure exactly why it worked. They also do not know if it will have the same effect in viruses.</p> <p>\u201cThe little bit we do know about the drug is it changes the way the cells make and distribute proteins, so we have speculated it might interfere with the ability of coronavirus to make its essential proteins,\u201d he said. The trial is yet to receive ethics approval, but Hunt said the trial would be reviewed with urgency. Even fast-tracked, ethics approval can take six weeks and it would be up to six months before researchers had initial trial results, Pellegrini said.</p> <p>The French, US, Indian and many other governments are rolling out trials for hydroxychloroquine in combatting Covid-19. The World Health Organization announced a large global trial, called SOLIDARITY, to find out whether existing drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, can treat or prevent the virus.</p> <p>There are many benefits to looking at existing drugs to treat Covid-19, as they have already been tested and approved for use in humans, side effects are already known, and that means clinical trials can be conducted more quickly.</p> <p>But there are good reasons media do not normally report on these clinical trials until they are complete and have undergone peer-review. Last week US president Donald Trump touted hydroxychloroquine as possibly \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\u201d. He also said that \u201cit\u2019s not going to kill anybody\u201d, and incorrectly announced the drug\u2019s approval had been fast-tracked. Soon after <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2020/03/23/man-dead-from-taking-chloroquine-after-trump-touts-drug-for-coronavirus/#739ef3ba72e9\">a US man died after he began drinking chloroquine because he was scared of getting sick</a>.</p> <p>The US drugs regulator also warned the drug could do more harm than good. There is months, if not years, of research that needs to be done to prove that something that kills the virus in a test tube will be both safe and effective in Covid-19 patients. There is a real risk of building false hope in a drug that has not been well-tested for this particular disease. Evidence from trials to date has been inconclusive and other evidence has been purely anecdotal.</p> <p>Dr Gaetan Burgio, from the John Curtin School of Medical research at the Australian National University, said \u201crecent results from clinical trials indicated a possible improvement in shortening the duration of the infection\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/so-you-think-you-have-coronavirus-what-australians-should-do-if-they-are-unwell\">So you think you have coronavirus: what Australians should do if they are unwell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHowever the results are disputed and the clinical trials are inconclusive,\u201d he said. \u201cTo date there are no clear indications that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are a treatment option. Additional clinical trials will tell us whether hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine are viable options for Covid-19 treatments.\u201d</p> <p>Covid-19 is an exceptional case because it is novel, is rapidly spreading, and countries are uniting to combat it, expediting ethics approvals for trials. Politicians are talking about these potential treatments almost daily, leading to media reporting on them, and the public, fearful of deaths, are hopeful for a cure.</p> <p>Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician who has worked as an advisor to the World Health Organization, said there were no quick fixes. \u201cIf I got Covid-19 tomorrow, I wouldn\u2019t want any of those drugs being tested [on me],\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt could help with treatment, it could do nothing, or it could be very harmful, and at at the moment we don\u2019t know which of those statements are true,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHydroxychloroquine is quite a worry for two reasons, including that people are already using it when there are marginal benefits for it, and people can take too high a dose and experience toxicity. So often, clinical trials give preliminary results that look promising but in doing the proper larger studies you realise not only that it doesn\u2019t work, but it does more harm than good.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Australian health authorities have provided a stream of continuously updated advice about the coronavirus, and it can be confusing to navigate. We have distilled some of that advice here to help answer your key questions.</p> <h2>What are the symptoms of Covid-19?</h2> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus\">World Health Organization</a>, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/australian-stock-market-down-733-in-worst-day-since-gfc-as-coronavirus-sparks-recession-fears\">Australian stock market down 7.33% in worst day since GFC as coronavirus sparks recession fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p> <p>The Australian government also warns that people with suppressed immune symptoms, such as cancer patients, are at elevated risk. So, too, are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, people in detention, and people in group residential settings like aged care homes face an elevated risk.</p> <h2>What do I do if I am sick, or have symptoms?</h2> <p>First, you should <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert\">read the Australian government health advice</a>, which is updated daily, and the advice of your local state and territory health department (contacts <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments\">here</a>). The Australian health department has compiled a list of resources <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-resources#find-the-facts\">here</a> for medical professionals and members of the community.</p> <p>The advice from state and territory health authorities is that if you develop a fever, cough, sore throat or shortness of breath within 14 days of any overseas travel or contact with a confirmed case you should contact your doctor. You are also asked to contact your doctor and request a test if you have pneumonia, even if you have not travelled or had known contact.</p> <p>As of 16 March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/all-overseas-arrivals-in-australia-must-self-isolate-for-14-days-amid-new-coronavirus-rules\">all returned travellers to Australia</a>, from every country, are required to self-isolate for 14 days. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/how-australia-will-enforce-coronavirus-self-isolation-rules-for-overseas-arrivals\">Penalties apply if this quarantine is breached.</a> As of 24 March, four state and territories in Australia \u2013 Tasmania, South Australia, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia \u2013 also require interstate visitors to undergo 14 days of mandatory self-isolation. </p> <p>The Queensland state border is closed to all but freight and essential travel.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, has repeatedly requested that people do not attempt to get a test for Covid-19 unless they are a returned traveller, have had contact with a confirmed or suspected case, or have pneumonia. </p> <p>This is to ensure testing of the most at-risk cases can be done quickly. </p> <p>Healthcare workers who work directly with patients and have a respiratory illness and fever can also get tested.</p> <p>Australian borders are now closed to all but citizens and residents, and those returning to Australia will be put in a hotel by the government for 14 days upon return. Those then travelling to another state after those 14 days will need to isolate again.</p> <p>The New South Wales chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said that testing of people who have recently returned from overseas was one of the best ways to slow the progress of the infection.</p> <p>People who are unwell are advised to contact their GP or, for more serious illness, attend hospital. In both cases you are advised to phone ahead and tell them you suspect you may have the coronavirus. If a hospital near you has a fever clinic, go there rather than the general emergency ward.<strong> </strong>You can locate them by calling <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments\">your state or territory health department.</a> The numbers are below.</p> <h2>What if I have respiratory symptoms but I haven\u2019t travelled overseas?</h2> <p>First, if you are unwell in any way, do not go to work or school. Do not send unwell children to school. It is still more likely, if you have cold-like symptoms, that it\u2019s just an ordinary cold, but it\u2019s best to be extremely cautious. By reducing the rate of general sickness in the community, we reduce the overall load on doctors and hospitals.</p> <p>Rates of confirmed community transmission in Australia remain low but it has been reported in several states.<strong> </strong> The first recorded instance was a cluster in northern Sydney associated with an aged care home, where three elderly residents have died after testing positive.</p> <p>Murphy said there was no need for people to get tested, or seek medical advice, unless they are a returned traveller, or have had close contact with a confirmed case. We\u2019re going into the flu season \u2013 people will have symptoms that are just the ordinary cold.</p> <p>That advice may change if the rate of community transmission in Australia grows. Currently, there is a global shortage of the test kits that pathologists use to diagnose Covid-19. This is why there is targeted testing instead of widespread testing. Healthcare workers who works directly with patients and who have a respiratory illness and a fever can get tested regardless of whether they have travelled overseas or have had close contact with an infected person.</p> <h2>Should I call my GP or go to hospital?</h2> <p>There have been several national roundtables with the aged care and primary care sectors. But some GPs have reported that they do not feel equipped to respond to this crisis.</p> <p>The advice from authorities is for people who suspect they may have Covid-19, but are not severely unwell, to get tested by their GP to keep the pressure off emergency departments. But if your GP tells you they are not equipped to help, <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments\">contact the health department in your state or territory</a> and ask if there are any specialist fever clinics near you.</p> <p>The Australian government has also committed $100m toward creating a Medicare item number for telehealth services, to allow doctors to triage or treat people with milder symptoms, or vulnerable people, remotely. People can now have a consultation with their GP over the phone. </p> <h2>Do I have to self-isolate? What is self-isolation?</h2> <p>Anyone returning to Australia from overseas, or entering a state or territory that has border controls,<strong> </strong>must self-isolate for 14 days. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/how-australia-will-enforce-coronavirus-self-isolation-rules-for-overseas-arrivals\">Penalties apply if this quarantine is breached</a>. You are also required to self-isolate if you have been tested for Covid-19 but do not yet have the results, or if you have been in close contact with a confirmed case.</p> <p>If you are under isolation, you do not go in to work or school or to any outings except to see your medical practitioner. If you need to travel, it\u2019s recommended you use a private car, or <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-drivers-and-passengers-using-public-transport\">follow this advice</a>.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/03/coronavirus-covid-19-information-about-home-isolation-when-unwell-suspected-or-confirmed-cases.pdf\">federal government\u2019s advice on home isolation</a>, you can go into your backyard, garden or balcony while isolated but not into public areas. If you live in an apartment, it\u2019s recommended you wear a surgical mask and walk quickly through the common areas. Masks do not protect you from getting the infection, but it lowers the chance that the person wearing the mask will spread it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-face-mask-facts-spreading-covid-19\">Can a face mask stop it spreading? Coronavirus facts checked</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You cannot receive visitors and only people who are part of the household should be allowed in the home. Ask family or friends who are not in isolation to deliver food and supplies.</p> <p>Other members of the household are not required to isolate unless you develop the symptoms of the coronavirus, in which case it will be determined on a case-by-case basis by health authorities.</p> <p>If your infection is confirmed they will be defined as close contacts and be required to isolate with you.</p> <p>Close contact is defined as being face to face with someone for at least 15 minutes, or being in the same enclosed space for at least two hours. </p> <p>Authorities recommend the person under isolation stay in different rooms to other family members and use a separate bathroom if available. Wear a surgical mask when in common areas and clean high-contact areas (taps, door handles and benches) daily with a disinfectant or diluted bleach.</p> <p>Monitor your symptoms and your health throughout the 14-day isolation period. If you are unwell, or your symptoms worsen, report any change to your doctor.</p> <p>If you need medication, you can have a phone consult with your GP under Medicare, and have the script sent to the pharmacy, the pharmacy can then send it out to you.</p> <h2>What if my child becomes unwell?</h2> <p>If your child is showing symptoms of a viral respiratory illness and either they or you have recently returned from overseas, or they or you have had close contact with a confirmed case, then seek medical advice and ask if they should be tested for Covid-19.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/rolling-in-the-aisles-australians-turn-to-tiktok-to-mock-toilet-paper-panic-buying\">Rolling in the aisles: Australians turn to TikTok to mock toilet paper panic-buying</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If they are unwell and considered to be at risk then they should not attend school or public gatherings and should be isolated at home for 14 days. As their parent, you\u2019re a close contact, so if they test positive for the virus you will also have to be isolated at home for 14 days.</p> <p>Schools in Victoria and the ACT closed from 24 March. Schools in other states and territories remain open, but in some states \u2013 like NSW \u2013 students have been told to stay home if possible.</p> <p>Children can catch the virus, but they generally have very mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. It\u2019s a good idea to keep children separate from vulnerable family members, like elderly grandparents, who are at greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. Under new rules for aged care centres, visitors aged under 16 will need special permission because of the risk they could spread the virus.</p> <h2>What do I do if my elderly parent or grandparent is sick?</h2> <p>Older people are the most at risk of a severe illness from Covid-19. Ensure that their treating doctor has all relevant information about high risk co-morbidities so your loved one can be triaged appropriately. Most hospitals have set up isolation wards to care for patients who are severely unwell from Covid-19.</p> <p>Many aged care homes have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-aged-care-homes-need-audit-of-infectious-disease-protocols-advocates-urge\">placed stricter conditions around visiting because of the Covid-19 outbreak</a>. As of 18 March, visits to aged care homes are also limited by federal rules that ban large group visits, allow visitors by children aged under 16 by exception only, and limit visitors to a maximum of two at one time per day.</p> <p>Do not visit an aged care home if you are unwell, even if you have not recently returned from overseas \u2013 influenza is also a risk to aged care homes.</p> <p>If your elderly parent or grandparent is well enough to care for themselves, and either has been or is suspected of being exposed to the coronavirus, they will be advised to go into self-isolation. You can help by delivering food and necessities, and by ensuring you wash your hands and practice good hygiene so the virus doesn\u2019t spread. If you are their carer, or have recently visited, you might be a close contact and be required to go into isolation if their infection is confirmed.</p> <p>If they live with you, you may be required to go into isolation as well depending on whether they are a confirmed case and you have had close contact with them.</p> <ul> <li><p>The coronavirus health information hotline is 1800 020 080</p></li> <li><p>The state health department contact numbers are:</p></li> <li><p>NSW \u2013 1300 066 055</p></li> <li><p>Victoria \u2013 1800 675 398</p></li> <li><p>Queensland \u2013 13 HEALTH or 13 432 584</p></li> <li><p>South Australia \u2013 1300 232 272</p></li> <li><p>Western Australia \u2013 1300 62 32 92</p></li> <li><p>Tasmania \u2013 1800 671 738</p></li> <li><p>ACT \u2013 Business hours: 02 5124 9213, after hours: 02 9962 4155</p></li> <li><p>Northern Territory \u2013 08 8922 8044</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Last Tuesday, Jessica Altchiler led a ballet class. But instead of the long, sleek barre she would normally rely on for support, she grasped on to a TV stand. And if that alone didn\u2019t prove she wasn\u2019t at a conventional dance studio, the red-and-black plaid pet bed in the background gave her away.</p> <p>Still, she tendued, relev\u00e9d and coached other dancers, even though she couldn\u2019t see them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/23/rosie-o-donnell-broadway-livestream\">Broadway in a garage: the clumsy pleasures of Rosie O'Donnell's star-studded livestream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m already sweating!\u201d she said as she ducked into the camera frame. \u201cI hope other people are sweating, too.\u201d</p> <p>Not even a week before she was teaching on Instagram Live, Altchiler had been in Detroit as part of her first professional job in the national tour of Fiddler on the Roof. While she and her fellow cast members performed in the show, they saw headlines about Broadway shutting down and March Madness being cancelled. Then, their own tour dates were postponed, and a suddenly unemployed Altchiler boarded a nearly empty flight back to her family home in Connecticut.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange for me to think about people still having a job because, for me, the world was just turned upside down,\u201d she said.</p> <p>All of the savings that she and her co-workers had been carefully growing to move to New York, pay for an apartment or invest in classes now have to be redirected toward survival during this unprecedented time in theater history, and some of her colleagues are scrambling to find a place to stay after months on the road.</p> <p>As the world wrestles with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a>, Altchiler\u2019s new reality isn\u2019t particularly uncommon among artists. Theater professionals are frightened, and they\u2019re mourning a lot of art that may never again see the light of day as venues shutter at least temporarily and would-be audiences disappear. But even as performers suffer great personal and professional losses, they\u2019re working overtime to send messages of hope and peace, provide necessary resources to others who are struggling and offer a balm for the social-distanced and self-isolated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aac11d82f6491e73ea7255754c0fbc600f43605c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aac11d82f6491e73ea7255754c0fbc600f43605c/0_0_3866_2578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A note outside the theater for the hit play Hamilton explains why they have closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A note outside the theater for the hit play Hamilton explains why they have closed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On an at-home edition of The Tonight Show last Wednesday, Lin-Manuel Miranda joined Jimmy Fallon to raise money for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights Aids\u2019 Covid-19 <a href=\"https://donate.broadwaycares.org/campaign/covid-19-emergency-assistance-fund/c276873\">emergency assistance fund</a>. The Hamilton star performed his song about parents wanting to give the best possible version of the world to their children, as parents everywhere, including Fallon and Miranda, stare down a global crisis alongside their own kids.</p> <p>Also online, the theater legend and radio host Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley, his producer husband, quickly organized <a href=\"https://actorsfund.org/about-us/news/stars-house\">twice-daily at-home performances</a> to fundraise for the Actors Fund. A long list of Broadway A-listers immediately signed up.

Susi Damilano, co-founder and producing director of the San Francisco Playhouse, said she hasn\u2019t had to fire anyone, and she\u2019s asking hourly workers to submit their schedules on a week-to-week basis for compensation.

  "<p>The term \u201ccrisis\u201d derives from the Greek \u201ckrisis\u201d, meaning decision or judgment.

The terror that drove government action in the autumn of 2008 was that money would stop coming out of the cash machines, unless the banking system was propped up. It turns out that if people stop coming out of their homes, then the circulation of money grinds to a halt as well. Small businesses are shedding employees at a frightening speed, while Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/18/amazon-whole-foods-workers-stores-warehouses-coronavirus\">advertised for an additional 100,000 workers</a> in the US. (One of the few, and far from welcome, continuities from the world we\u2019re leaving behind is the relentless growth of the platform giants.)</p> <p>The decade that shapes our contemporary imagination of crises is the 1970s, which exemplified the way a historic rupture can set an economy and a society on a new path. This period marked the collapse of the postwar system of fixed exchange rates, capital controls and wage policies, which were perceived to have led to uncontrollable inflation. It also created the conditions in which the new right of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan could ride to the rescue, offering a novel medicine of tax cuts, interest rate hikes and attacks on organised labour.</p> <p>The 1970s inspired a vision of crisis as a wide-ranging shift in ideology, which has retained its hold over much of the left ever since. The crisis involved a contradiction that was largely internal to the Keynesian model of capitalism (wages were being pushed up faster than productivity growth, and destroying profits), and an overhaul in the dominant style of business: out with rigid heavy manufacturing, in with flexible production that could respond more nimbly to consumer tastes.</p> <p>There was also an important spatial dimension to the 1970s crisis. Capital abandoned its iconic industrial strongholds in northern England and the American midwest, and (with help from the state) headed towards the financial and business districts of slick global cities, such as London and New York.</p> <p>For over 40 years after Thatcher first took office, many people on the left have waited impatiently for a successor to the 1970s, in the hope that a similar ideological transition might occur in reverse. But despite considerable upheaval and social pain, the global financial crisis of 2008<strong> </strong>failed to provoke a fundamental shift in policy orthodoxy. In fact, after the initial burst of public spending that rescued the banks, the free-market Thatcherite worldview became even more dominant in Britain and the eurozone. The political upheavals of 2016 took aim at the status quo, but with little sense of a coherent alternative to it. But both these crises now appear as mere forerunners to the big one that emerged in Wuhan at the close of last year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a grim truth at the centre of the present crisis that makes it feel closer to a war than a recession</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We can already identify a few ways that 2020 and its aftermath will differ from the crisis of the 1970s. First, while its transmission has followed the flightpaths of global capitalism \u2013 business travel, tourism, trade \u2013 its root cause is external to the economy. The degree of devastation it will spread is due to very basic features of global capitalism that almost no economist questions \u2013 high levels of international connectivity and the reliance of most people on the labour market. These are not features of a particular economic policy paradigm, in the way that fixed exchange rates and collective bargaining were fundamental to Keynesianism. They are features of capitalism as such.</p> <p>Second, the spatial aspect of this crisis is unlike a typical crisis of capitalism. Save for whichever bunkers and islands the super-rich are hiding in, this pandemic does not discriminate on the basis of economic geography. It may end up devaluing urban centres, as it becomes clear how much \u201cknowledge-based work\u201d can be done online after all. But while the virus has arrived at different times in different places, a striking feature of the last few weeks has been the universality of human behaviours, concerns and fears.</p> <p>In fact, the spread of smartphones and the internet has generated a new global public of a sort we have never witnessed before. Events such as September 11 provided a glimpse of this, with Nokias around the world vibrating with instructions to get to a television immediately. But coronavirus is not a spectacle happening somewhere else: it\u2019s going on outside your window, right now, and in that sense it meshes perfectly with the age of ubiquitous social media, where every experience is captured and shared.</p> <p>The intensity of this common experience is one grim reason that the present crisis feels closer to a war than a recession. In the end, government policymakers will ultimately be judged in terms of how many thousands of people die. Before that reckoning is reached, there will be horrifying glimpses beneath the surface of modern civilisation, as health services are overwhelmed and saveable lives go unsaved. The immediacy of this visceral, mortal threat makes this moment feel less like 2008 or the 1970s and more like the other iconic crisis in our collective imagination \u2013 1945. Matters of life and death occasion more drastic shifts in policy than economic indicators ever can, as witnessed in Rishi Sunak\u2019s astonishing announcement that the government would cover <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">up to 80%</a> of the salaries of workers if companies kept them on their payroll. Such unthinkable measures are suddenly possible \u2013 and that sense of possibility may not be easily foreclosed again.</p> <p>Rather than view this as a crisis of capitalism, it might better be understood as the sort of world-making event that allows for new economic and intellectual beginnings.</p> <p>In 1755, most of Lisbon was destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami, killing as many as 75,000 people. Its economy was devastated, but it was rebuilt along different lines that nurtured its own producers. Thanks to reduced reliance on British exports, Lisbon\u2019s economy was ultimately revitalised.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/britain-covid-19-head-start-squandered\">Britain had a head start on Covid-19, but our leaders squandered it | Devi Sridhar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the earthquake also exerted a profound philosophical influence, especially on Voltaire and Immanuel Kant. The latter devoured information on the topic that was circulating around the nascent international news media, producing early seismological theories about what had occurred. Foreshadowing the French revolution, this was an event that was perceived to have implications for all humanity; destruction on such a scale shook theological assumptions, heightening the authority of scientific thinking. If God had any plan for the human species, Kant concluded in his later work, it was for us to acquire individual and collective autonomy, via a \u201cuniversal civic society\u201d based around the exercise of secular reason.</p> <p>It will take years or decades for the significance of 2020 to be fully understood. But we can be sure that, as an authentically global crisis, it is also a global turning point. There is a great deal of emotional, physical and financial pain in the immediate future. But a crisis of this scale will never be truly resolved until many of the fundamentals of our social and economic life have been remade.</p> <p>\u2022 William Davies is a sociologist and political economist.

  "<p>In the hedgerows the blackthorn is shooting sprays of small white blossom upwards, thus signalling the end of the winter. If this is so, then we have had an exceptionally warm and wet season. Perhaps counter-intuitively, such weather can spell disaster for many insects; adapted as they are to sitting out a season, their biggest enemies become mould and bacteria that may proliferate in their dormant tissues. Concern turns to the potential impact on already struggling populations of insects that have faced so many challenges in recent times, most blatantly the fragmentation and pollution of their habitats. We must firmly add climate change to this list, the most recent evidence coming from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/glowing-glowing-gone-plunge-in-glow-worm-numbers-revealed\">a long-term study of glow-worm populations</a> in Essex that found an overall fall of 75% in their numbers on 19 sites.</p> <p>Glow-worms are enigmatic and intriguing animals at every level.

According to research published in the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry\">British Journal of Psychiatry</a>, North America and Europe experienced 10,000 more suicides during the 2008 recession.

Bloomberg\u2019s decision to transfer $18m to the Democratic National Committee rather than create a new political action committee that would essentially act as the sequel to the campaign left many staffers without insurance benefits or healthcare coverage. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T19:37:46.740Z\">at 7.37pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7909be8f08e46329cb4791\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T19:13:04.830Z\">7.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello, Tom Lutz here taking over the blog for now.

There\u2019s a real fear among non-frontline staff that they\u2019re just being sold a dummy. The places where they have been most successful in containing spread among healthcare workers they have been much more aggressive with the PPE (giving it to all healthcare workers). The doctors are seeing other vulnerable patients without Covid. If they\u2019re asymptomatic and seeing patients, it\u2019s the perfect medium to spread Covid.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said one department at his hospital ordered alcoholic hand gel but only got a tenth of the amount they had requested. He said trusts were largely doing what they could but added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The feeling is the government is putting healthcare workers at risk because of the inefficiency of planning. You\u2019re putting staff in an environment where they feel unsafe to work. You\u2019re putting patients at risk and staff at risk. NHS staff are treating Covid patients and non-Covid patients sequentially all the time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The consultant said that by distributing the correct specification of PPE among all healthcare workers, countries such as Singapore and South Korea had reduced spread. By contrast, he said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In Italy the frontline medical workers had an eight times Covid risk than the general public. I haven\u2019t seen anyone spraying the front of my hospital [with disinfectant] like we see in Korea. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On testing, he said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What you want to do is <strong>test early</strong>. Then, if they test positive, for all intents and purposes they\u2019re likely to be immune (when they recover). If they don\u2019t have Covid they can work. If they do have Covid, they can self-isolate.</p> \n   <p>A lot of healthcare workers are in relationships with other healthcare workers. Children have fevers or coughs all the time. If you lose staff for 14 days every time they have a fever or cough or have contact (with someone with symptoms or who has tested positive) that is a problem. We\u2019ve got to test the medical staff and potentially even test their contacts. </p> \n   <p>The crux of this is having enough doctors and nurses and ventilators. We are in week four of a crisis. In four of five weeks I am probably going to have everyone self-isolating (in my team).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T14:43:47.874Z\">at 2.43pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e78b7948f08e0999e6b88ff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/josh-halliday\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T13:20:51.537Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Six <strong>ambulances</strong> have had their <a href=\"https://www.kentonline.co.uk/thanet/news/holes-drilled-in-tyres-as-six-ambulances-attacked-224229/\">tyres deliberately punctured</a> in <strong>Kent</strong>, in what must be one of the more depressing acts of mindlessness during the outbreak.<br><br>The South East Coast ambulance service said the vehicles were targeted overnight in Thanet, adding the strain of its staff, who were already under \u201csignificant pressure\u201d.<br><br>The MP <strong>Tracey Crouch</strong> described whoever did it as \u201can utter scroat\u201d: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tracey_crouch/status/1241790444104749057\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">6 ambulances had their tyres punctured last night.

There is nothing particularly surprising about its arguments \u2013 you will have read many of them in the Guardian, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-coronavirus-crisis-much-worse-is-to-come\">our leader today</a> says \u201cas we career into highly dangerous and uncharted waters, it is right to ask whether our ship\u2019s captain is up to the job\u201d - but Johnson expects to be criticised by the Guardian. If the Times is having a go at him too, that will cause more concern in No 10.</p> \n  <p>On the plus side for Johnson, the Times leader is qualified. The general thrust of it is more \u201cmust do better\u201d than \u201ccompletely useless\u201d. Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The truth is that [Boris Johnson\u2019s] performance so far has been chequered. Since the start he has appeared behind the curve. Considerable time that could have been spent preparing for the crisis appears to have been squandered. The World Health Organisation first warned of the risk of a deadly global pandemic in mid-January, by which point the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in China and parts of Asia. Yet the government spent much of February apparently distracted with fights with some of Britain\u2019s institutions, including the civil service, the judiciary and the BBC. Even at the time many questioned why the prime minister disappeared from view for a week in the middle of the month to his grace-and-favour home in Kent. He did not preside over his first Cobra meeting to discuss the crisis until March 3. Even as the scale became apparent, Mr Johnson\u2019s response to it has been uneven. For the most of the first half of March, the official advice was simply to wash one\u2019s hands. On March 12, as countries across Europe and the world closed schools, restaurants, bars and shops and introduced lockdowns and travel bans, the government merely advised that those ill with coronavirus symptoms should self-isolate for seven days ...</p> \n   <p>Mr Johnson\u2019s liberal instincts and reluctance to restrict civil liberties would normally be admirable. But dithering over whether to shut schools, bars and restaurants, combined with anonymous briefings warning of imminent lockdowns that are then ruled out by ministers, may have only made the crisis worse. Panicked shoppers have stripped supermarkets of supplies while many Londoners will have escaped to the country, almost certainly further spreading the virus. City traders say that doubts about Mr Johnson\u2019s response contributed to the run on sterling. Britain\u2019s death toll is now at the same level as Italy\u2019s two weeks ago, yet already one hospital says that it has been overwhelmed and the NHS is warning of shortages of ventilators and protective clothing ...</p> \n   <p>And if the government is forced to introduce even more stringent restrictions to halt an escalating epidemic, they may ask why they weren\u2019t introduced sooner, as they have been in much of the rest of the world. The country needs to know that Mr Johnson has a coherent strategy.

They say they are concerned that \u201chighly exposed\u201d NHS staff are currently not being tested as the pandemic takes hold and the UK hurtles towards Italy-style levels of infection. </p> \n  <p>In a letter sent to the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the Commons health committee, they estimate that the real number of infected cases in the UK is likely to be 15 times higher than \u201crecorded\u201d cases of those tested so far, which only takes place in hospitals. On current numbers this would mean around 150,000 people currently have the virus in the UK, with the vast majority undiagnosed. Morris writes:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Germany has been testing at least four times as many people per population, and as a result has the lowest morbidity per capita of cases recorded in Europe. I attribute their success is by testing people and catching a positive test in their initial asymptomatic phase of infection, ie the first 5 days after inoculation before they notice symptoms. By quarantining this cohort early, it slows down spread and applied nationally will \u2018flatten the curve\u2019.</p> \n   <p>The new recorded UK cases are \u2018probably\u2019 1/15th the actual cases. The problem is \u2018probably\u2019. Testing will allow the NHS to prepare for the cases. Our model will define this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The consultants argue that mass testing in line with their proposals will save more than 70% of deaths estimated over the next six months, mostly patients over 60. They have written to Boris Johnson and spoken to Hunt and to Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer. They suggest air-freighting medically certified kits from China and immediately setting up a network of testing centres \u201cright across the country\u201d. These could be administered in drive-through locations and sent as postal kits, to avoid the virus spreading. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T10:27:32.573Z\">at 10.27am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7886498f08a08573fbfabb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T09:58:47.001Z\">9.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Nando\u2019s</strong>, <strong>Costa Coffee</strong> and <strong>Subway</strong> are the latest restaurant chains to close all of their UK outlets due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Here are the main points he has been making.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock confirmed that the government was considering moving towards a European-style near-curfew, which would involve people being told not to leave home unless they had a specific reason for doing so. </strong>Asked if this was an option, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course we\u2019re looking at what other European countries are doing ... All the way through we have said we are prepared to take the actions that are necessary, and we are.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said that parks, where people did not observe the two-metre rule, were a particular problem. Asked if there could be stricter enforcement of these rules, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can\u2019t say any more on the detail of it because these are discussions that are live, that are ongoing and we are considering it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He did not rule out the government using the police to enforce social distancing rules.</strong> Asked if the government might have to use the police, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes, and in fact on Saturday I signed <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/327/pdfs/uksi_20200327_en.pdf?utm_source=hootsuite&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=post\">the order</a> to give the police the power to shut restaurants and bars and pubs if they\u2019re still open.

And the actions that we have taken over the last week ... are unprecedented. And taking those decisions is a huge thing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also rejected the suggestion that Johnson did not deliver a clear message about social distancing at his press conference yesterday. When this was put to him, Hancock said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, the message yesterday was incredibly clear, and it is across every single front page, which is that if people don\u2019t follow the rules, we are going to have to get tougher still.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said that people who were ignoring the two-metre distance rule in parks yesterday were \u201cvery selfish\u201d and were putting lives at risk.</strong> Asked why people were ignoring the guidance, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, I don\u2019t know, because it is very selfish. The NHS is doing everything it can and preparing for this spread of this virus. And if people go within two metres of others who they don\u2019t live with, then they are helping to spread the virus, and the consequence of that costs lives, and it means for everyone this will on for longer.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The first words of that answer were also interesting, because Hancock claimed not to know why people were ignoring the two-metre rule. Others have argued that people are ignoring this rule because Johnson and his government have not spelled it out with sufficient clarity. This is what<strong> Rosena Allin-Khan</strong>, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership and an A&amp;E doctor told the Today programme this morning, having spent the weekend working in her local hospital. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The prime minister simply said yesterday he wants people to enjoy themselves outside while also saying that people should stay two metres apart outdoors. This relaxed style, mixed messaging will cost lives and I believe people are struggling to follow guidelines because they are just not clear.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Labour MP <strong>Yvette Cooper </strong>has also posted a detailed critique of the government\u2019s messaging in a Twitter thread starting here.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YvetteCooperMP/status/1241849797155393537\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I watched the Prime Minister\u2019s press conference in despair.

A particular concern is to ensure social distancing in court and in the court building.</p> \n   <p>This morning no new trials are to start. Jurors summoned for this week are being contacted to ask them to remain at home, and contact the court they are due to attend. They will only be asked to come in for trials where specific arrangements to ensure safety have been put in place. In some cases, this may mean that jurors may be called in to start a new trial later on Monday. All hearings in the crown court that can lawfully take place remotely should do so and other hearings not involving a jury should continue if suitable arrangements can be made to ensure distancing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a966db5e21a6132c6dda5c570bffedb3feff51ca\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a966db5e21a6132c6dda5c570bffedb3feff51ca/0_110_3500_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty O\u2019Connor/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T09:22:05.857Z\">at 9.22am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7879c28f08a08573fbfa63\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T08:56:53.786Z\">8.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from <strong>Laura Kuenssberg</strong>, the BBC\u2019s political editor.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1242011054986723328\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Govt considering next steps like closing non-essential retail or whether to start treating people flouting the stay at home advice as acting against the law - all being discussed - huge decisions, nothing final</p>\u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1242011054986723328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 23, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7878038f08dcc95cc215f1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T08:52:27.758Z\">8.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">British rail franchise agreements suspended</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government is effectively nationalising the state\u2019s railways for a temporary period, it has been announced, my colleague <strong>Ben Quinn</strong> reports.

Not surprisingly, leaders who are attempting to attribute COVID-19 to certain national or ethnic groups are the very same nationalist populist leaders who have made racist and xenophobic rhetoric central to their political platforms.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7913938f0887f6e2b5c345\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T19:54:20.610Z\">7.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Edouard Philippe, the French prime minister, has said that country\u2019s lockdown could last several more weeks, with new restrictions \u2013 including limits on daily exercise outside the home \u2013 now in place:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/js_paname/status/1242175109248548864\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Any morning constitutional/jogging now has to be within 1km of home, 1 hour max, alone, and only once per day. <a href=\"https://t.co/3CvQzDtZpb\">https://t.co/3CvQzDtZpb</a></p>\u2014 Joseph Schmid (@js_paname) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/js_paname/status/1242175109248548864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 23, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7912658f08cc9a81946fcb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/seaningle\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T19:49:14.904Z\">7.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Olympics reportedly 'to be postponed'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/international-olympic-committee\">International Olympic Committee</a> is facing almost irresistible pressure to postpone the Tokyo Olympics this week rather than wait until its mid-April deadline \u2013 with a growing number of athletes, governments and national federations saying it is unfair to keep them in limbo during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Veteran IOC member Dick Pound <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2020/03/23/olympics-2020-ioc-member-tokyo-games-postponed-dick-pound-coronavirus/2899848001/\">told USA Today</a> that the Games would be postponed, likely to 2021, with the details to be worked out in the next four weeks. \u201cThe parameters going forward have not been determined, but the Games are not going to start on July 24, that much I know.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Pound said he believed that the IOC would announce its next steps soon. \u201cIt will come in stages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will postpone this and begin to deal with all the ramifications of moving this, which are immense.\u201d</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/23/athletes-across-the-globe-call-for-olympic-postponement-as-countries-pull-out\">Athletes across globe call for Olympic postponement as countries pull out</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7910a28f08cc9a81946fbf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/shaun-walker\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-23T19:40:43.866Z\">7.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the Czech Republic, where as of the middle of last week there is ban on being in public spaces without wearing a face mask or some kind of facial covering, volunteers have set to work sewing masks at home.<br></p> \n  <p>Zdenek Hrib, the mayor of Prague, wrote on Twitter last week: \u201cOn Prague public transport, it is mandatory to have a covered mouth and nose!

But he said he remained optimistic.</p> \n  <p>Germany has closed all its schools, and on Sunday ruled that no more than two people can gather at once, except for families or people sharing a household.</p> \n  <p>Wieler said that current data on Germany\u00b4s Covid 19 cases indicates that the average age of those infected is 45, the average age of those who have died is 82. Fifty-seven per cent of those with confirmed infections have so far been men, 43% are women. Of the symptoms people have experienced, the most common is coughing (55%) and fever (40%).</p> \n  <p>In his daily briefing, which has just ended, he appealed to German medical students to volunteer in the increasing effort to track all new cases, which he said continued to be an important part in the fight against the virus. </p> \n  <p>A nationwide collection data point called Cosmos, which is gathering data on how the illness is being fought, shows a considerable increase in awareness of the virus, but still a considerable gap between awareness and behaviour, he said. Mobile phone data monitored anonymously at the weekend, of 30 million mobile phone users, showed that people have considerably reduced their mobility, but still not as much as was necessary, he said. Keeping a distance, regular hand washing and sneezing or coughing into the elbow still remained the most effective ways to avoid the spread of coronavirus, he added. \u201cKeeping your distance is the order of the day,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>There are about 24,859 cases of coronavirus in Germany.

After days of being accused of sending mixed messages about what the public should do, the prime minister ratcheted up Britain\u2019s response with an address to the nation on Monday evening, warning that people \u201cmust stay at home\u201d, and will only be allowed outside to buy food or medication, exercise alone once a day, or to travel to work if absolutely necessary.</p> <p>Confirmed cases in the UK have reached 6,726 and there have been 336 deaths from the virus in the country.</p> <h2>More than 100,000 recoveries but pandemic is \u2018accelerating\u2019</h2> <p>According to figures from Johns Hopkins University, 100,958 people confirmed to have contracted Covid-19 have now recovered from the illness, more than half of them in China.</p> <p>That figure represents almost a third of the people known to have been infected around the world. However, these figures are partly based on official releases and could, therefore, underestimate the number of confirmed cases. The institution has counted 378,287 confirmed cases and 16,497 confirmed deaths.</p> <h2>Trump says US will open up in weeks not months, for sake of economy</h2> <p>In a televised press conference from the White House on Monday evening, Donald Trump said he hoped to get the US economy going again as soon as possible and was not open to the idea of restrictive public health measures going on for months.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking at months, I can tell you right now,\u201d he said adding that a bad economy caused deaths as well, due to suicide. Trump\u2019s comments came as the US recorded 552 deaths and more than 43,600 confirmed cases of the virus.</p> <h2>India announces majority of country under complete lockdown</h2> <p>India has announced that it is stopping domestic flights and said the majority of the country was under complete lockdown. The country has reported 499 cases of coronavirus, and 10 deaths, one of whom was a 54-year-old man with no history of foreign travel, suggesting the start of community transmission of the virus, officials said. Health experts have said that a big jump could be imminent, which would overwhelm the underfunded and crumbling public health infrastructure.</p> <h2>UN calls for global ceasefire to fight Covid-19</h2> <p>Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, has appealed for an immediate global ceasefire, calling on an end to all armed conflicts so that the world can instead focus on fighting coronavirus. \u201cSilence the guns; stop the artillery; end the airstrikes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is crucial to help create corridors for lifesaving aids.

Of those, 13% have needed to be cared for in hospital, around a quarter of whom are in intensive care, and 157 people have died. Dr Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, said that in New York, the virus attack rate was close to 1 in 1,000 and that 28% of submitted specimens were positive in this area, compared with about 8% in the rest of the country.</p>",

In letters to the providers, Yost said they were in violation of a 17 March order issued by the state health director.</p> <p>In Ohio, Planned Parenthood, one of the providers that received the letter from Yost\u2019s office, said it was in compliance with the order and would continue to provide abortions.</p> <p>\u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s top priority is ensuring every person can continue accessing essential healthcare, including abortion,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Ohio said in a statement. \u201cUnder that order, Planned Parenthood can still continue providing essential procedures, including surgical abortion, and our health centers continue to provide services that our patients depend on.\u201d</p> <p>Amid the moves by Ohio and Texas, a coalition of anti-abortion groups urged its allies across the nation to ask governors to ban most abortions on the grounds they were not essential.</p> <p>\u201cIf abortion is a choice, then abortion is an elective procedure,\u201d said Mark Harrington, president of the anti-abortion group Created Equal.</p> <p>Abortion-rights leaders nationwide decried the tactic, saying it was an affront to women grappling with difficult decisions amid the disruptions of the pandemic.<br>\u201cAbortion is time-sensitive, essential health care,\u201d said Katherine Hancock Ragsdale, president of the National Abortion Federation. \u201cWomen deserve better than a craven exploitation of a health care crisis in furtherance of an anti-abortion agenda.\u201d</p> <p>In Ohio, abortion clinics planned to remain in operation.</p> <p>Jennifer Branch, an attorney for the Women\u2019s Med Center of Dayton, said the clinic had already taken steps to minimize the use of personal protective equipment \u2013 one of the issues raised in the state\u2019s order.</p> <p>The CEOs of two Planned Parenthood affiliates in Ohio said their clinics also were in compliance, having cut back on the use of equipment that is in short supply.<br></p>"
