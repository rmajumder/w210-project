coronavirus by people with no symptoms is \u201cvery rare\u201d, saying this guidance could pose problems for governments as they seek to lift lockdowns, <strong>Reuters</strong> reports. </p> <p> Maria van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and the WHO\u2019s technical lead on the Covid-19 pandemic, said on Monday that many countries undertaking contact tracing had identified asymptomatic cases, but were not finding they caused further spread of the virus. \u201cIt is very rare,\u201d she said. </p> <p> \u201cI was quite surprised by the WHO statement,\u201d said Liam Smeeth, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who added that he had not seen the data Kerkhove\u2019s statement was based on. </p> <p> \u201cIt goes against my impressions from the science so far that suggest asymptomatic people \u2013 who never get symptoms \u2013 and pre-symptomatic people are an important source of infection to others.\u201d </p> <p>Smeeth and other experts said understanding the risks of transmission among people with mild or no symptoms is crucial as governments begin to ease the lockdown measures they imposed to try and reduce the pandemic\u2019s spread and gradually replace them with case tracking and isolation plans. <br></p> <p> \u201cThis has important implications for the track/trace/isolate measures being instituted in many countries,\u201d said Babak Javid, a Cambridge University Hospitals infectious diseases consultant. </p> <p>The co-head of Singapore\u2019s coronavirus taskforce told Reuters on Monday there had been asymptomatic transmission cases there, between people living in close quarters. However, China said last week that 300 symptomless coronavirus carriers in its central city of Wuhan, the pandemic\u2019s epicentre, had not been found to be infectious. </p> <p> Keith Neal, a professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Britain\u2019s University of Nottingham, said that while the question of how big a role asymptomatic transmission plays in new infections is unclear, what is known is that people with symptoms are responsible for most of the spread of the disease. </p> <p> \u201cThis reinforces the importance of any person who has any of the symptoms of Covid-19 arranges a test .\u2026 as soon as possible and isolating until they get their test result,\u201d he said. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T12:24:18.754Z\">at 1.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5edf72428f083999a26dd07b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T11:42:19.983Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hundreds more fatalities from Covid-19 in the north-west of <strong>England</strong> and in care homes have driven up the number of excess deaths since the <strong>UK</strong> went into lockdown to more than 63,000, a toll believed to be greater than those anywhere else except the US, writes <strong>Robert Booth</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, in London. </p> <p>The number of deaths from the virus in England and Wales fell to 1,822 in the last week of May, the fewest for eight weeks, according to the latest data from the Office of National Statistics.

Many economists believe the pandemic will push the German economy into its biggest decline since the end of the second world war in the second quarter.</p> <p>Seasonally adjusted exports fell 24% on the month while imports slid by 16.5%. The trade surplus shrank to \u20ac3.2bn, the federal statistics office said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall by 15.6% and saw imports down 16%. The trade surplus was expected to come in at \u20ac10bn.</p> <p>Alexander Krueger, an economist at Bankhaus Lampe, said a recovery may have already started due to a loosening of the lockdown and reopening of borders, but little was left of the last decade\u2019s export boom. \u201cThe road out of the corona trough is long, rocky and above all uncertain, especially for foreign trade,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Despite a \u20ac130bn stimulus package announced last week, which comes on top of \u20ac750bn worth of measures announced in March, the government expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year. Economists expect a slow recovery and the pace will depend largely on how fast Germany\u2019s European neighbours and other trade partners, including China and the US, emerge from the crisis.</p> <p>Exports to France and the US, hit hard by the coronavirus, fell most while those to China, which was first affected by the virus but which has since started to see some signs of recovery, fell slightly less sharply, the office said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T07:06:53.637Z\">at 8.06am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5edf2e208f0883ec2fc1d94a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T06:41:24.053Z\">7.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>China\u2019s</strong> education ministry has warned that Chinese students should consider whether to study in <strong>Australia</strong>, amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Canberra, Reuters reports.

  "<p>A triple threat of Brexit, tightening budgets and unchecked expansion has seen the rankings of UK universities in an international league table slump for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jun/19/cambridge-slips-to-lowest-ever-place-in-world-university-table\">fourth year in a row</a>.</p> <p>Nearly three-quarters of the country\u2019s universities slipped down the rankings in the UK\u2019s worst-ever performance in the table compiled by data and research group QS.&nbsp;</p> <p>Imperial College London climbed one spot to reach eighth, making it the only UK university in the top 20 to improve. Oxford University slipped from fourth to fifth place and University College London fell two places to 10th, while Cambridge University held on to seventh place and the University of Edinburgh the 20th spot.</p> <p>The compilers attributed the falls to poor teaching and declining research impact. Of the UK\u2019s 84 ranked universities, 66 saw their staff to student ratio decline while 59 had a drop in research citations. International student numbers at 51 universities also fell.</p> <p>Ben Sowter, director of research at QS, said the falls at UK universities mirror those in North American and European countries as a result of increasing investment in higher education elsewhere in the world. However, this has been compounded by Brexit, the hostile environment, financial uncertainty and rapid expansion, he said.</p> <p>\u201cInvestment in teaching capacity would serve the British higher education sector well, and help it to regain lost ground. So, too, would concerted efforts to ensure that Britain continues to remain an attractive place for talented academics and students to study in the future, and a national desire to continue collaborating with our European and global partners on transformative research projects.\u201d</p> <p>Universities\u2019 finances are likely to further deteriorate this academic year as they contend with falling domestic and international student numbers due to the coronavirus pandemic. Recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/08/universities-face-460m-loss-from-expected-drop-in-east-asian-students-coronavirus\">British Council research</a> predicted that 14,000 fewer international students will enrol in September, resulting in \u00a3460m losses for universities, while an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/20/uk-universities-facing-760m-hit-one-in-five-students-plan-defer\">equivalent survey</a> of UK applicants suggested one in five were considering deferring.</p> <p>Sowter said that although it is difficult to pinpoint the exact impact of Brexit, the UK\u2019s performance has trended \u201cconsistently downwards\u201d since the Brexit vote in 2016. \u201cNumerous sources \u2013 from Ucas to the Higher Education Policy Institute \u2013 have drawn the same connection between Brexit and lower British appeal among the global international student community,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He added that top UK universities may have expanded too quickly since the government lifted the numbers cap in 2013. \u201cIncreases in student numbers need to come alongside sufficient increases in teaching capacity, without which there is an increased likelihood that teaching quality will suffer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The University of Bristol, which has come under fire from its local council for rapid expansion, slipped outside the top 50 for the first time, falling nine places to 58th. The remaining UK universities in the top 50 include the London School of Economics, which fell five places to 49th, King\u2019s College London, which rose to 31st, and the University of Manchester, in 27th.</p> <p>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) retained the top spot for the ninth year, ahead of Stanford University in second and Harvard University in third, whose ranks remained unchanged. Their success runs counter to the overall US performance, which has seen the country\u2019s share of the top 100 universities fall from 32 to 27 over five years.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Asian universities enjoyed their best-ever showing. Twenty-six universities in China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan now feature in the top 100.</p> <p>The QS world rankings methodology is based on employer and academic reputation, class sizes, research output and international staff and student numbers. It is one of the most highly regarded international league tables.</p>",
  "<p>The grounding of air travel during the coronavirus pandemic could prompt a jobs crisis in British aviation on the scale of the coal mining industry\u2019s collapse during the 1980s, a report has warned.</p> <p>Putting ministers on notice for a surge in redundancies as airlines confront a future with fewer journeys made by plane even after the outbreak recedes, the New Economics Foundation (NEF) said at least 70,000 jobs in the wider aviation industry \u2013 including engineering, catering and duty free shopping \u2013 were at risk before the end of summer. Thousands of workers in the industry will have to retrain in other areas of the economy, it said.</p> <p>Compiled in collaboration with the TUC, aviation unions and the climate action charity Possible, the study warned this figure would match the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/dec/18/the-demise-of-uk-deep-coal-mining-decades-of-decline\"> job losses in the coal industry in 1980-81</a> in the early years of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s newly elected Tory government, which left lasting scars for communities across the north, Midlands, Wales and Scotland.</p> <p>The warning on aviation jobs comes at a crucial time for firms that have furloughed workers in the UK. Covering the wage bill of almost 9 million workers, the transition away from the furlough scheme is expected to trigger a wave of redundancies in the coming weeks, as the government gradually reduces the support available from August until the scheme closes at the end of October.</p> <p>Redundancy consultations require between 30 and 45 days, depending on the number of staff affected, meaning companies deciding to cut jobs will have to start the process in the coming days.</p> <p>Firms will have to decide whether they can afford to keep staff on furlough when they have to start contributing towards the cost of the government scheme or choose to make workers redundant.</p> <p>Airlines have been among the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/airlines-and-carmakers-benefit-from-uk-covid-relief-scheme\">biggest beneficiaries of government support</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/ba-to-press-ahead-with-job-cuts-plans-despite-furlough-extension-willie-walsh-coronavirus-airline\">British Airways</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/easyjet\">easyJet</a> placing more than 25,000 staff on furlough between them and borrowing \u00a31.5bn using cheap government-backed loans from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/04/chemicals-firm-basf-biggest-beneficiary-of-uk-coronavirus-loan-scheme\">Bank of England</a>. However, against a backdrop of new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/08/what-are-the-uks-new-quarantine-rules-that-face-a-legal-challenge\">quarantine restrictions</a>, reduced passenger demand due to the health risks from Covid-19, and with fewer planned journeys expected in future, the airlines still plan to make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/easyjet-plans-to-cut-up-to-30-per-cent-of-staff-because-of-covid-19-crisis\">thousands of job cuts this year</a>.</p> <p>Faced with the prospect of mounting job losses at aviation industry hubs across Britain, the NEF urged ministers to transform the furlough wage subsidy scheme into a retraining programme to help people move into other sectors.</p> <p>Calling on the industry to negotiate redundancy limits with trade unions, it also said any airline industry bailouts should come with tough conditions forcing the suspension of shareholder dividends, excessive executive pay and tax avoidance, while also demanding firms invest more in green technology and decarbonisation.</p> <p>Of the&nbsp;70,000 jobs immediately at risk over the next three months, the leftwing thinktank said 39,000 were directly in aviation jobs. The remainder are likely to be lost in the wider supply chain surrounding the sector in engineering, food catering, and duty free shopping.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden\u00a0email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The NEF said at least 17,000 workers in the sector would need to permanently move into other areas of the economy, warning that aviation sector employment is unlikely to ever return to pre-crisis levels due to service cutbacks, automation and technological developments.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot consign these workers to the despair of unemployment,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC.</p> <p>\u201cAviation needs immediate support \u2013 and not just to protect the incomes of billionaire airline owners.

  "<p>The US\u2019s top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic was far from over, calling Covid-19 his \u201cworst nightmare\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIn a period of four months, it has devastated the whole world,\u201d Fauci said, speaking to executives at a conference of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p> <p>About 7 million people have been infected with the coronavirus and 400,000 people are known to have died. Many countries, including the US where <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">more than 110,000 </a>have died, are now relaxing quarantine rules despite rising rates of infection in some areas.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s millions and millions of infections worldwide. And it isn\u2019t over yet. And it\u2019s condensed in a very, very small time frame,\u201d said Fauci.</p> <p>In a videotaped discussion Fauci said he had known that an outbreak like this could occur but he was surprised by how \u201crapidly it just took over the planet\u201d. Fauci attributed the rapid spread to the contagiousness of the virus and extensive world travel by infected people.</p> <p>The top White House infectious disease adviser said the coronavirus pandemic differed significantly from other recent public health crises including Ebola and HIV.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI mean, Ebola was scary. But Ebola would never be easily transmitted in a global way,\u201d he said. \u201cHIV, as important as it is, was drawn out over an extended period of time. I mean, I think the ultimate impact of Aids almost certainly will be greater than anything we\u2019re talking about now.\u201d</p> <p>The coronavirus just \u201ctook over the planet,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Fauci described research on the disease as \u201ca work in progress\u201d and said there were still questions about whether or not survivors who were seriously ill would fully recover. The disease has been shown to have a wide range of effects on people \u2013 leaving some without symptoms while others suffer lung damage, strokes, clotting disorders and severe immune responses.</p> <p>Fauci was speaking after the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/who-expert-backtracks-after-saying-asymptomatic-transmission-very-rare\">rolled back guidance </a>that it was \u201cvery rare\u201d for the disease to be transmitted by people who have the virus but no symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cWhere is it going to end? We\u2019re still at the beginning of it.\u201d</p> <p>But Fauci said he was \u201cvery heartened\u201d by the pharmaceutical industry, which he said, \u201cstepped up to the plate\u201d. There are more than 124 Covid-19 vaccines under development as of 2 June, according to the WHO, and Fauci said he was \u201calmost certain\u201d that more than one would be successful.</p> <p>\u201cThe industry is not stupid.

This raises the total to 28. All three arrived from Guam, but originated from the United States.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Guam:</strong> The WHO has recorded 171 confirmed cases with five deaths. This is an increase of five cases from last week.</p></li> <li><p><strong>West Papua:</strong> The Jakarta Post reports there have been 1,243 cases in the provinces of Papua and West Papua. Nine people have died. The government of Papua New Guinea last week agreed to open its borders to 30 PNG nationals who had been held since January by Indonesian authorities. Indonesian officials said 25 had been convicted of crimes, and five were overstayers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Papua New Guinea:</strong> The country remains stable at eight reported cases, but concerns are still high, especially considering the situation on its porous western border with Indonesia. The governor of East Sepik, Allan Bird, has called on the government to collect local data about the effects of Covid-19, citing a study in that province that showed 4% of 1,100 people tested had Covid-19 antibodies in their bloodstream, despite no one in the region testing positive for Covid-19 during the state of emergency. </p></li> <li><p><strong>French Pacific Territories:</strong> There are 20 recorded cases in New Caledonia, with no new infections recorded since last week. The most recent case, a police officer, arrived in Noumea in mid-May. He tested negative prior to departure. In French Polynesia, the number of cases remains unchanged from last week, at 60. The leader of French Polynesia\u2019s largest church has joined a chorus demanding that rotation of officials from France be suspended. Travellers from virus-free Wallis and Futuna are the first people to travel to New Caledonia without undergoing quarantine.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fiji:</strong> With 18 infections all cleared up, and no new cases in a month and a half, the nation has declared itself virus-free. A curfew remains in place between 10pm and 5am. Schools will reopen on 30 June.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Solomon Islands:</strong> The first four Covid-19 tests to be carried out in-country all came back negative. The country remains under a state of emergency until 25 July. Government data reveals that tourist arrivals into the country fell nearly 50% in the first quarter of 2020, with only 752 people coming in to the country during March.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Vanuatu:</strong> The country is still virus-free, and is focused now on repatriation efforts. A Radio Australia report suggests that over 7,000 Vanuatu citizens and residents are waiting to return home. The bulk of them are seasonal workers in Australia and New Zealand, but hundreds were trapped while traveling casually, and risk overstaying temporary visas.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Marshall Islands:</strong> Community pressure continues for the government to ease the requirement that container ships undergo 14 days quarantine before having their cargo unloaded. The quarantine requirements are leading to fresh produce being spoiled and putting up costs.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Cook Islands:</strong> Citizens and work permit holders who have been in New Zealand for a period of at least 30 days will be allowed to return to Cook Islands as of 15 June.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ead9e38a0be05dff3f4b906399fd716352c7f31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ead9e38a0be05dff3f4b906399fd716352c7f31/0_0_3543_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nurse sits at a screening station for anyone presenting with a cough or flu like symptoms at Warangoin Clinic in East New Britain province, Papua New Guinea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nurse sits at a screening station for anyone with a cough or flu-like symptoms at Warangoin Clinic in East New Britain province, Papua New Guinea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kalo Fainu/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What are Pacific governments doing?</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Papua New Guinea:</strong> The country is still treating the virus as a live threat. Parliament voted by 80-2 to extend the state of emergency to 16 June. Schools have resumed but there are serious challenges caused by social distancing requirements and lack of resources. The government received another US$600,000 worth of personal protective equipment, or PPE, as well as six new ventilators. </p></li> <li><p><strong>New Caledonia:</strong> Anti-independence members of the French National Assembly have castigated the government in Noumea for accepting what they called a usurious $US270m loan from the French Development Agency. They warned that repayment terms would stifle attempts to get the local economy back on its feet, and widen the economic divide between rich and poor.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fiji:</strong> The government last week declared the nation officially virus-free. Fuelling rising hopes that the tourism sector might be resurrected, a survey of Americans listed Fiji in third place among countries they would most like to visit when borders reopen.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Vanuatu:</strong> The Australian government is providing more than A$4.3m in assistance to help Vanuatu roll out its own massive bailout package. The money will be spent on improving underresourced financial administrative systems in order to speed the processing and delivery of funds. </p></li> <li><p><strong>Samoa:</strong> The associate minister for health has been accused of breaching restrictions on social gatherings after a video emerged, apparently showing more than five people had attended an open house. Tofa Li\u2019o Foleni denied the allegations, insisting that only five people had been invited. The rest of the people present were his children, he said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>French Polynesia:</strong> With borders reopening to tourists, the territory announced a number of requirements for visitors. These include a negative test no more than 72 hours prior to departure, or an immunity certificate showing a successful recovery.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Marshall Islands: </strong>The Marshall Islands Journal reports that the government has approved a $6m Covid-19 economic relief program to support local businesses.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e1aed7907a1bef84d101fa32d827328faddd902\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e1aed7907a1bef84d101fa32d827328faddd902/0_146_4737_2842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four thousand New Zealanders marched in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in Auckland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Four thousand New Zealanders marched in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement in Auckland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Bradley/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Australia and New Zealand</h2> <p>The number of confirmed cases for New Zealand remains unchanged from last week at 1,154 with 22 deaths.

  "<p>From the moment Colin Kaepernick first took a knee during the national anthem to call attention to police brutality and systemic racism before a San Francisco 49ers preseason game back in 2016, he stood alone while the meaning of his silent demonstration was hijacked, contorted and undermined by detractors cloaked in patriotism, either misguidedly or deliberately, as a protest against the US military. The most tremendous of these bad actors was, of course, Donald Trump, at an Alabama rally the following year when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests\">infamously challenged the league\u2019s owners</a> to release anyone who refused to stand: \u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He\u2019s fired. He\u2019s fired!\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rather than back the players\u2019 right to freedom of expression, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell gifted Trump a decisive optical victory early in his administration by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/10/nfl-boss-roger-goodell-says-all-players-should-stand-for-the-national-anthem\">unveiling a policy</a> requiring every player, coach, trainer, ballboy, referee and executive to stand for the anthem or face punishment.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Four years later \u2013 after the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer choked the life from George Floyd in a gruesome extrajudicial murder that was beamed into living rooms throughout the country, sending hundred of thousands into the streets across America to demand police reform \u2013 Kaepernick\u2019s protest appears not merely justified but prescient. On Thursday, more than a dozen of the NFL\u2019s biggest stars including Patrick Mahomes, Saquon Barkley, Michael Thomas and Deshaun Watson, the sorts of in-their-prime stars who might have shied away from social issues in the past, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2ctjBvEmRY\">posted a video</a> demanding the NFL state that it condemns systemic racism and \u201cadmit wrong in silencing our players from peacefully protesting\u201d. And<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/democrats-unveil-police-reform-plan-congress-george-floyd-protests\"> congressional legislation tackling police reform</a> that would have been dismissed as politically quixotic only weeks ago has planted itself squarely in the national discourse.</p> \n<p>Ever since he first seized on Kaepernick\u2019s protest as a fountainhead of easy political points, Trump has co-opted American sports as not merely a proxy battle in the culture wars that reflect a country\u2019s deep divides but the primary theatre. He\u2019s returned to the well time and again when the polling numbers have called for a jolt, but the events of the past week have shown that the reservoir has run dry.</p> \n<p>The horrifying deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery have made it so the public can no longer stand by as Kaepernick\u2019s protest is misrepresented: the reality of the long-marginalized scourge of state-sanctioned murder of black and brown people has finally reached a mass audience. Consider New Orleans Saints star Drew Brees, who issued a public apology after he was blasted by teammates and fans for saying he \u201cwill never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States\u201d.</p> \n<p>On Friday, only hours after Trump publicly excoriated Brees for backing down on his long-held stance, Goodell surprised many by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/roger-goodell-nfl-sorry-kneeling-protests-kaepernick\">releasing the mea culpa</a> his players asked for: \u201cWe, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"96a3d449c37b8a98421c09cb53ae650b349af9fd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96a3d449c37b8a98421c09cb53ae650b349af9fd/0_0_4251_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Kaepernick\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester in Washington wears a face mask with Colin Kaepernick\u2019s image.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sport holds a mirror up to society and the reflection isn\u2019t always pleasant. But Goodell\u2019s long-overdue reversal is less noteworthy as a courageous stand, which it is not, and more the barometer of public sentiment it surely is. A <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_060220/\">recent Monmouth University poll</a> states that a majority of Americans believe police officers are generally more likely to treat black people unfairly than to mistreat white people. And more than three-quarters of the country, including 71% of white Americans, believe \u201cracial and ethnic discrimination is a big problem in the United States\u201d \u2013 a 26-percentage-point spike from four years ago when Kaepernick was dismissed by large swatch of the public as an extremist and a clout-chaser.</p> \n<p>Goodell may have fumbled the handoff that Kaepernick first gave him in 2016, but he wasn\u2019t going to do it twice. And the commissioner\u2019s tacit endorsement has ensured that taking a knee will become the new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/912018945158402049\">locking arms</a> \u2013 that is to say, an acceptable and thereby meaningless form of protest. Whenever the next NFL season kicks off, kneeling will become another form of pre-game window dressing: just another patriotic thing to do when the anthem plays.</p> \n<p>But this mainstreaming of ideas once regarded as radical is proof that Kaepernick\u2019s protest, and the sacrifice of his NFL career that came with it, was worth the price.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3293aae03c57694a70233e027ca43363ecebc48f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3293aae03c57694a70233e027ca43363ecebc48f/0_0_3600_2396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Kaepernick, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural of Colin Kaepernick, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in Miami.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johnny Louis/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The NFL\u2019s diversity problem is its decision-making ranks has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/22/nfl-rooney-rule-diversity-draft-pick-incentives\">exhaustively documented</a>, but football itself is the most integrated sport we have in America. It\u2019s not just for black kids, it\u2019s not just for white kids. You can be fat and play on the line. You can be skinny and play wide receiver. You can be a total non-athlete like Tom Brady and win multiple Super Bowls.&nbsp;Which made it somewhat depressing that Brees, a 41-year-old who\u2019s spent more than half of his life around black teammates while becoming a symbol of hope for a city that endured one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/22/hurricane-katrina-recovery-lower-ninth-ward\">worst racial injustices in American history,</a> continued to push a false narrative in conflating a protest of extreme police brutality with disrespect for the military \u2013 especially when he\u2019d been given four years to get up to speed.</p> \n<p>Yet Brees\u2019 thoughtful response to Trump\u2019s broadside, addressed directly to the president, represents the sort of teachable moment that\u2019s bound to reach an audience beyond Kaepernick\u2019s influence and further the movement toward justice.</p> \n<p>\u201cThrough my ongoing conversations with friends, teammates, and leaders in the black community, I realize this is not an issue about the American flag. It has never been,\u201d Brees wrote. \u201cWe can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when?</p> \n<p>\u201cWe as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Or as LeBron James put it, in more <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAq3fpCgyve/?utm_source=ig_embed\">economical language</a>: \u201cDo you understand NOW!!??!!??\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAq3fpCgyve/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

  "<p>Environmental groups have accused a Russian mining firm of emphasising the role of global climate change in last week\u2019s historic oil spill in part to avoid punishment for its ageing infrastructure and potential negligence in the accident.</p> \n<p>The World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace Russia said that although climate change likely played a role in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/03/vladimir-putin-orders-state-of-emergency-huge-fuel-spill-siberia-power-plant-kerch\">spillage of more than 20,000 tons of diesel fuel</a> that turned two rivers crimson near the Arctic city of Norilsk, the risks of thawing permafrost to Arctic infrastructure were publicly known and could have been addressed months or years earlier. </p> \n<p>The accident is one of the largest in Russian history and had been compared by Greenpeace to the Exxon Valdez spill.</p> \n<p>Regional officials on Tuesday said some pollutants from the leak had reached Lake Pyasino, a large body of water that leads to the Kara Sea. But the main damage has been done to the local Ambarnaya and Daldykan rivers and may take a decade to clean, local officials and environmentalists have said. Nornickel said that its monitoring did not show that the lake had been contaminated, citing the \u201cendeavour and the sacrifice of the accident responders\u201d who had responded to the spill and placed sea boons to halt the fuel\u2019s spread. A Russian emergency official on Tuesday also said that contamination levels in the lake remained \u201cwithin the maximum permissible concentration,\u201d according to data from Russia\u2019s environmental watchdog Rosprirodnadzor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"148adc3b-5522-49c4-b316-a4d287d07869\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nckCjv0VdOk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The operational director for the mining firm Nornickel, Sergei Dyachenko, had earlier denied that negligence at its subsidiary could have caused the accident. In a company press release, he said that \u201canomalously warm temperatures\u201d may have sped the thaw of permafrost beneath a gas tank and led to its collapse. In another press release, the company blamed the accident on \u201ca&nbsp;sudden sinking of&nbsp;supports of&nbsp;the storage tank which served accident-free for more than 30&nbsp;years\u201d.</p> \n<p>Experts have pointed to the broad impact of climate change in Russia\u2019s Arctic region over the past decade, noting in particular how thawing permafrost has led to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/14/thawing-permafrost-destroying-arctic-cities-norilsk-russia\">fissures in apartment buildings</a>&nbsp;in Norilsk.</p> \n<p>But environmental groups say they are worried that Nornickel, a company that has been attacked in the past as one of Russia\u2019s biggest polluters in the Arctic, is now seeking to twist concerns about climate change to its defence.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to write off Nornickel\u2019s failure in risk management and ecological safety on the fashionable topic of climate change,\u201d said Alexey Knizhnikov of the World Wildlife Federation. \u201cThe main factor is mismanagement.\u201d</p> \n<p>The accident, and a government investigation into its causes, is likely to have serious repercussions for Russian industry in the Arctic. Russian oversight agencies have drafted plans to review oil reservoirs throughout the region and investigators have charged one power plant official with violating environmental protection rules, which carries a maximum sentence of five years.</p> \n<p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, also gave a public scolding last week to Vladimir Potanin, the billionaire president of Nornickel, about the company\u2019s ageing reservoirs. \u201cIf you had changed them on&nbsp;time, there would have been no environmental damage and&nbsp;no need to&nbsp;foot such costs,\u201d Putin told Potanin in a televised video call. Nornickel has pledged to cover all costs for the cleanup and to restore the local environment.</p> \n<p>Greenpeace Russia last week put out a statement titled \u201cThe melting of the permafrost is not an excuse for Nornickel\u201d, noting it believed the company \u201csought to avoid responsibility for the accident\u201d by blaming it on climate change.</p> \n<p>The environmental organisation noted that as far back as 2009 it had reported on the risks to Russia\u2019s oil-and-gas infrastructure from thawing permafrost.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not possible that the company did not know about [thawing permafrost], but it is possible that the company used a dangerous facility irresponsibly,\u201d said Vasily Yablokov, Greenpeace Russia\u2019s climate project manager.</p> \n<p>Weak enforcement and business cost decisions meant companies were hesitant to replace technology, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn principle, the interests of businesses are put above the ecology,\u201d said Yablokov.</p> \n<p>A Nornickel spokesperson said: \u201cSo far, we have only named a possible version of what happened. Final conclusions can be drawn only after the investigation is completed.\u201d She also said the company was actively involved in the clean-up from the accident.</p> \n<p>During a conference call with investors and analysts on Tuesday, Dyachenko said the company believed that thawing permafrost was the cause of the accident. He said: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any precise monitoring being done on permafrost before [the accident],\u201d adding that local efforts to monitor the thawing permafrost were focused on the city of Norilsk and its residential building stock.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In a statement provided after publication, Nornickel said it \u201ccategorically rejects accusations of any attempts to avoid blame or downplay its responsibility for the diesel spillage in the Arctic,\u201d adding that such accidents were \u201cabsolutely unacceptable regardless of their primary cause.\u201d</p> \n<p>The company said it was cooperating with law enforcement agencies and had launched \u201ca full and thorough internal investigation\u201d into the accident.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe unequivocally accept that climate change risks, including those of abnormally high temperatures in the Arctic, must be properly addressed and mitigated. Nornickel has immediately launched a comprehensive inquiry into the increased risks we are now facing so to avoid climate-change related accidents in future.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe fully accept our responsibility for the event and are making appropriate financial provisions and arrangements for related legal liabilities as well as additional voluntary commitments in order to mitigate the inflicted environmental damage,\u201d the company said.</p>",
  "<p>A collective of senior black music industry executives from companies including Warner, Sony, Universal Music Group, BMG, Live Nation, Spotify and the Music Managers Forum has published an open letter to business leaders calling for immediate action on racism and marginalisation within the sector.</p> <p>The newly formed Black Music Coalition welcomed industry statements of support on last week\u2019s #BlackoutTuesday, a music industry-endorsed day of reflection during the ongoing global Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the death in police custody of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;in Minneapolis, but said that it was time to transform that support into \u201ctangible changes\u201d.</p> <p>The letter states: \u201cThe music industry has long profited\u202ffrom the rich and varied culture of black people for many generations but overall, we feel it has failed to acknowledge the structural and systematic racism affecting the very same black community and so effectively, enjoying the rhythm and ignoring the blues.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ukmusic.org/assets/general/UK_Music_Diversity_Report_2018.pdf\">A diversity report commissioned by UK Music in 2018</a> found that ethnic minorities represented 17.8% of roles within the British music industry. While 25.9% of workers age 16-24 age bracket are from an ethnic minority, that number drops steadily to just 11.4% in the 45-64 age bracket, indicating low representation at senior levels.</p> <p>A push for industry diversity had resulted in a lot of black employees in entry-level positions, said Char Grant, a senior A&amp;R manager at BMG. \u201cBut the support structure and the infrastructure for development hasn\u2019t been there so they\u2019ve been left to work it out for themselves. That can be quite a difficult place when you\u2019re not supported.\u201d</p> <p>The coalition, which formed over WhatsApp, has called for the implementation of specific career development programmes for black staff to advance future generations of leaders. It asked for change regarding the lack of black staff in senior management and the complete absence of black female presidents and chairwomen across the industry.</p> <p>The major disparity was with industry \u201cdecision makers\u201d, said Afryea Henry-Fontaine, senior marketing manager at Virgin EMI/ Universal Music Group. \u201cPeople that control the budgets, decide if an act is going to be signed. That\u2019s where there isn\u2019t diversity at all, at that capital-controlling level.\u201d</p> <p>The coalition called for businesses to create dedicated internal task forces to review, drive and challenge its equality and diversity aims, as well as the advancement of black executives across the business, with a focus on equal pay, mentorship and career progression.</p> <p>The lack of black music industry executives has a negative effect on the UK\u2019s rising black musicians, said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cThings are lost in translation. There\u2019s not a sensitivity to different cultural nuances. Those that are advising them outside of management don\u2019t understand the culture in the way that they should.\u201d</p> <p>Following #BlackoutTuesday, Republic Records, home to Ariana Grande and Drake, pledged to stop using the term \u201curban\u201d to describe music made by black artists. The coalition\u2019s signatories called for music companies across the board to cease use of the term and replace it with \u201cblack music\u201d.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Urban\u2019 does often relate to R&amp;B, hip-hop \u2013&nbsp;sub-genres of blackness,\u201d said Whitney Boateng, a promoter at Metropolis Music. \u201c\u2018Urban\u2019 strips away the actual blackness from the music. Black is not a swear word. To say \u2018black music\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean that people who are not black are not included \u2013&nbsp;it just means that you\u2019re giving credit to the actual genre and its makers and forefathers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8843d831e686f313f0e5e52a8d7ee19527ebb85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8843d831e686f313f0e5e52a8d7ee19527ebb85/0_169_6109_3665/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AJ Tracey, whose single Dinner Guest is currently in the UK Top 10.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">AJ Tracey, whose single Dinner Guest is currently in the UK Top 10.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Grant said the term was outdated regarding today\u2019s charts, where black British music is a dominant fixture. \u201cIt\u2019s full of artists that have built their brands and their identities through strong fanbases, and they deserve to be on a level playing field with all the other artists at the top of the charts. \u2018Urban\u2019 doesn\u2019t support the advancement of people\u2019s understanding of the layers of black music. It contributes to the mentality of: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s urban \u2013&nbsp;you need to graduate to pop.\u2019 We need to be rid of that.\u201d</p> <p>The coalition asked music companies to commit a portion of their annual budget to offer financial support to black organisations, educational projects and charities. \u201cThey need more funding,\u201d said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to come from the government or the National Lottery, and so I think it\u2019s disingenuous for an industry that profits so incredibly well from black culture and black music not to support those projects.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to mandatory anti-racism and unconscious bias training across each company for all non-black members of staff, led by black educators, the coalition asked for complimentary counselling and holistic services to be made available to black members of staff with immediate effect in order to address the effects of workplace racism and global violence against black people.</p> <p>\u201cBlack executives have been experiencing men and women that look like them being racially targeted and murdered by an institution that is supposed to serve and protect,\u201d said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that play out on the news, on social media, in horrific and callous ways, and then we\u2019re expected to go into a work environment and operate as if everything is normal.\u201d</p> <p>She said it was important for companies to equip black employees with mental health provision and support. \u201cOften our experiences \u2013 especially as black women \u2013 are [dismissed as] \u2018You\u2019re being a bit dramatic\u2019 or, \u2018It wasn\u2019t that bad\u2019 and it\u2019s brushed under the rug. So it\u2019s really important to be able to speak to somebody that can identify and understand and help to unpick that situation without the fear of losing your job.\u201d</p> <p>Sent to CEOs, presidents and industry leaders on Monday morning , the letter has received a positive response. \u201cThis is not going to happen in 24 hours,\u201d said Henry-Fontaine. \u201cThis is a longstanding commitment that we\u2019ve made, and it\u2019s about pushing the conversation forward. It\u2019s about assessing that understanding and working with internal teams to make and push forward long-lasting change.\u201d</p> <p>The open letter follows US executives Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas\u2019s #TheShowMustBePaused initiative on 2 June, which called for the music industry to cease activity for a day in order for black participants to take space for their mental health and for allies to reflect on their obligations to black music communities.</p> <p>While the day provoked a mass social media movement beyond the music industry, some musicians and industry employees criticised the blackout for pledging silence at a time when social media had become a key tool for the spread of information between protesters on the ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Henry-Fontaine said she understood the scepticism, but affirmed the importance of the day. \u201cThis is the first time the entire industry has stopped and been so public in their support. The whole purpose is to be in dialogue, to hold companies accountable. These are the first five immediate calls to action. There are many more to come because this is a multifaceted issue.

He says it was striking that <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> used cabinet this morning to reset his response to the <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> protests, reinforcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/i-hear-you-boris-johnson-to-black-lives-matter-protesters\">the message he conveyed in a video message last night.</a></p> \n  <p>In a tweet on Sunday night, after BLM protesters tore down the <strong>Edward Colston</strong> statue in Bristol and a minority of BLM protesters in London got involved in clashes with the police, Johnson posted this on Twitter.</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Boris Johnson #StayAlert<strong>\u2714</strong>@BorisJohnson</p> \n   <p>People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

The spokesman said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The PM began cabinet by discussing the anger and the grief felt not just in the US but around the world following the death of George Floyd. He said those who lead and govern simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered.</p> \n   <p>He said there was an undeniable feeling of injustice and that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination, in education, in employment and in the application of criminal law.</p> \n   <p>He said we are a much, much less racist society than we were, but we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do in eradicating prejudice and creating opportunity. Cabinet reiterated its commitment to that effort.</p> \n   <p>The PM said his message to all those who protested lawfully was \u2018I hear you and I understand\u2019. However, he said this cause is not an acceptable [reason] for violence or [relaxing the rules] regarding to social distancing. He said those who attack public property or the police are undermining the cause they claim to represent and will face the full force of the law.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This also suggests that No 10 has now crafted what it views as a better response to the question \u2018Is Britain racist?\u2019. <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked this on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday at the weekend and he said that it wasn\u2019t, although he said there was still injustice that needed to be tackled. At the No 10 lobby briefing yesterday, in response to the same question, the spokesman said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/08/uk-coronavirus-johnson-says-anti-racist-protests-were-subverted-by-thuggery-live-news-covid19-updates?page=with:block-5ede2ee48f0883ec2fc1cf7e#block-5ede2ee48f0883ec2fc1cf7e\">Johnson did not think the UK was a racist country. </a>Now the line is that the UK is \u201cmuch, much less racist\u201d than it was.</p> \n  <p>At today\u2019s briefing the spokesman was also asked if Johnson felt that any of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-record-sexist-homophobic-and-racist-comments-bumboys-piccaninnies-2019-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\">his various racially offensive comments in the past</a> had contributed to the UK\u2019s problems in this regard.

I understood the arguments, it certainly seems anachronous, and while the thoughts of its removal in no way concerned me, I simply considered it someone else\u2019s decision to make. On reflection I think this attitude was probably a fault and an act of complicity in allowing the damage of Rhodes\u2019 actions during his lifetime, and the century of their legacy to go unchallenged. I believe now is the time to remove the statue from the college and that is it is in all our interest that is done proactively and peacefully.

  "<p>Britain needs a green job-filled recovery from the coronavirus crisis. Unlike <a href=\"https://www.businessgreen.com/news/4016109/green-recovery-germany-unveils-plans-eur40bn-climate-spending-surge\" title=\"\">Germany</a> and South Korea, it is far from clear that we will get one. While Berlin and Seoul are retooling their <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-southkorea-environment-newdeal-analys/jobs-come-first-in-south-koreas-ambitious-green-new-deal-climate-plan-idUKKBN23F0T3?utm_campaign=Carbon%20Brief%20Daily%20Briefing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter\" title=\"\">fossil fuel-reliant economies</a> to be greener and cleaner, the UK has yet to announce a policy that deals with the environmental emergency and the spectre of mass unemployment.</p> <p>Unless a vaccine for coronavirus is found soon, Britain faces a surge in joblessness at the end of October, when all forms of wage support stop. The size of this spike in unemployment will determine how long it is before we may return to normal. Currently, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52977098\" title=\"\">12 million people</a> are covered by the job retention scheme for furloughed workers and its equivalent for the self-employed. There are few takers for the idea that there will be a sharp bounce-back to business as usual.</p> <p>Torsten Bell, who worked in the Treasury when the financial crash struck in 2008 and now runs the Resolution Foundation thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.cityam.com/coronavirus-unemployment-could-take-seven-years-to-rebound-says-think-tank/\" title=\"\">told</a> MPs on the Treasury select committee that if unemployment hits 10%, which is about what the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates, it would take at least seven years to return to where we were before the pandemic struck. If none of the workers being supported by wage subsidies get their jobs back, it could take decades to return to normal.</p> <p>Sustained unemployment imposes significant economic, personal and social costs: joblessness leads to <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/unemployed-almost-twice-as-likely-to-suffer-from-ill-health-than-those-with-a-job-official-figures-9228662.html\" title=\"\">ill health</a> and reduced life expectancy, and to the undermining of human relations and family life. The state has been playing the role of \u201cinsurer of last resort\u201d to keep the economy running, so that it can be restarted once the emergency has passed. A physically distanced economy will be different to the carefree one we were used to. The furlough scheme has helped lower-paid and part-time staff, and it is hard to see all of these workers returning to their roles in the leisure, travel and hospitality sectors.</p> <p>Yet Boris Johnson was wrong to suggest earlier this month that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/03/uk-coronavirus-live-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-lockdown-easing-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates-news\" title=\"\">many, many job losses</a>\u201d were inevitable. This will only happen if policy choices do not change. The answer to large-scale layoffs is for the public sector to create jobs, especially in those regions where there will be no or few openings, and for such a scheme to be designed to recast the economy in an environmentally sustainable way. Large public spending could transform the economy with an industrial base that would be net zero in carbon emissions.</p> <p>The harm from climate change is not as immediately obvious as that of the pandemic, but it is bigger and longer-lasting. There are encouraging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/04/boris-johnson-under-pressure-to-ensure-green-recovery-uk-coronavirus\" title=\"\">reports</a> that the Treasury is looking at a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d to create jobs for those made redundant through the economic fallout from the pandemic. But where\u2019s the beef? Leaving lockdown will not be inherently climate-friendly. Mr Johnson must make it so by decoupling future economic activity from carbon emissions and ecological destruction.</p>",
  "<p>First it was Adidas and Nike, the two biggest names in global sportswear, that sought to draw attention to their backing of the Black Lives Matter movement through a collaborative tweet.</p> <p>Now Britain\u2019s homegrown brand behemoths are jumping on the bandwagon \u2013 with PG Tips and Yorkshire Tea uniting under the hashtag #solidaritea.</p> <p>The two rivals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/30/pg-tips-and-lipton-tea-poised-for-sale-as-young-people-switch-to-coffee\">the second- and third-biggest tea sellers in the UK</a>, became the latest businesses to declare their support for the BLM protests that have broken out around the world since the death of George Floyd.</p> <p>Yorkshire Tea was responding to a tweet from a far-right activist, Laura Towler, expressing satisfaction that the brand had not come out in support of the movement.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m dead chuffed that Yorkshire&nbsp;Tea&nbsp;has not supported BLM,\u201d Towler tweeted on Monday, along with a smiley face emoji.</p> <p>But Yorkshire Tea, which is owned by the Harrogate-based Bettys and Taylors Group, replied: \u201cPlease don\u2019t buy our tea again.

  "<p>Share prices took a breather on Tuesday, but the wider story is the speediest stock market recovery in history. If you bought a FTSE 100 index tracker fund on 23 March, which we can now call the bottom of the market for the first stage of the Covid-19 crisis, you\u2019ve made a 27% gain in 11 weeks. Other markets, especially the US, have done even better.</p> <p>And, if you were really cute, brave or lucky, you could have made truly spectacular profits by betting on the most battered stocks \u2013 easyJet up 60% in a month, for instance. Perspective is needed, naturally. The FTSE 100, at 6336, is still 1,000 points lower than it was at the end of February. But the point remains: this market rally has been extreme.</p> <p>Can it last? Anything\u2019s possible, of course. The V-shaped rebound thesis is being reheated in some quarters as economies reopen. It is conceivable (just) that a coronavirus vaccine could be available by the end of this year or early 2021. And, if we\u2019ve learned anything in the last few weeks, it\u2019s that today\u2019s central bankers are pumped-up versions of their predecessors in the 2008 banking crisis. Money floodgates have been opened to near-maximum; some of the cash was bound to slosh up in stock markets when interest rates are near-zero.</p> <p>Listen, though, to a wise old head \u2013 Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of Boston-based fund manager GMO, who has successfully steered a way through most big market events of recent decades. He expressed the disconnect between the stock market and the economy in striking terms in a letter to investors last week: \u201cWe are in the top 10% of historical price earnings ratio for the S&amp;P [the broadly-based US index] on prior earnings, and simultaneously are in the worst 10% of economic situations, arguably even the worst 1%!\u201d</p> <p>Such statistics are hard to ignore, especially when you add Grantham\u2019s key point that uncertainty \u201cin some ways seems the highest in my experience\u201d. He\u2019s talking about the properly big stuff where the virus could finally force real change: \u201cdeficiencies in capitalism; inequality; climate change and our environment\u201d, and so on.</p> <p>If that seems too hazy, try deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe\u2019s gritty reminder in a speech on Tuesday that the Bank of England\u2019s analysis last month indicated banks could face credit losses of up to \u00a380bn in the next two years. \u201cThe Covid crisis is far from over,\u201d said Cunliffe, a statement that only needed to be made because financial markets are giving the opposite impression.</p> <p>\u201cFuture news about the health crisis and consequent policy measures, or about geopolitical tension, could well spark another very sharp repricing of economic prospects and financial assets,\u201d Cunliffe added, spelling it out.</p> <p>Grantham\u2019s take feels correct: \u201cThe current market seems lost in one-sided optimism when prudence and patience seem much more appropriate.\u201d There are never any certainties with markets, but this rally looks a case of too much, too soon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden\u00a0email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Bellway pays its way</h2> <p>Here\u2019s an unusual sight: a major housebuilder that declines to grab a government handout.</p> <p>Bellway has not accessed the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme, despite being eligible to do so and despite furloughing most of its 3,000 employees during April and May. Instead, it paid full basic salaries itself.</p> <p>\u201cHousebuilders have benefitted from schemes like Help to Buy,\u201d says chief executive Jason Honeyman. \u201cIt seems a bit disingenuous if we now need government support to help with our wages.\u201d He\u2019s not ruling out possibly accessing the scheme in future, but there are \u201cno current plans to claim\u201d. Good stuff.</p> <p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak, as he counts the huge cost of the furlough scheme, should take note. The job retention scheme was necessarily introduced in a hurry and was designed with broad parameters.

  "<p>On my way to Parliament Square for Saturday\u2019s Black Lives Matter protest, I \u2013 for the first time \u2013 noticed the statue of Robert Clive in its place of honour near the Churchill War Rooms, a stone\u2019s throw from 10 Downing Street and seemingly equidistant from Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster. One would imagine such a location ought to be dedicated to those who best exemplify British values.</p> <p>On Sunday, as I watched protesters in Bristol dump the statue of Edward Colston into the harbour (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 7 June), the action an echo of the countless captive men and women whom Colston\u2019s crews mercilessly threw overboard, I thought of Clive.</p> <p>Few individuals in UK history have committed more treacherous, genocidal acts than Colston and Clive, the former against the populations of west Africa, the latter against the hundreds of thousands dead in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh through plunder and famine. What unites the two in particular is that their cruelties were done for personal profit and shareholder return. Their global corporate violence against people of colour makes them some of the most negative historical examples for our time, not the sort who should be immortalised as heroes in places that communicate British values to the world. Let us now ask this government to justify Clive\u2019s ongoing glorification in one of Britain\u2019s most revered places.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Matthew Woolsey</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 While I understand the anger that led to the toppling of the Colston statue, we must accept that Britain\u2019s rise to world dominance in the 18th and 19th century was built on the plantation economy and colonial exploitation. Trade in sugar, tobacco and cotton produced by slave labour and the wholesale looting of India generated the capital that fuelled the industrial revolution. Slavery and colonial exploitation has made us the nation we are today. We must acknowledge this. Rather than toppling statues and renaming streets, I suggest we put up information boards explaining who these people were, how they attained their wealth and power, and who paid the price for it. People walking down Buchanan Street in Glasgow might learn about his slave plantations in Virginia. People visiting a statue of Churchill might learn about Gallipoli and the Bengal famine.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Alastair Macphail</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Turin, Italy</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/the-guardian-view-on-colstons-statue-a-long-time-in-going\" title=\"\">editorial</a> (8 June) rightly says that discovering \u201chow to remember the vicious business of slavery\u201d and the UK\u2019s \u201cimperial project\u201d is \u201cnot just a challenge for Bristol\u201d. It\u2019s clear that there are certain aspects of British history that have to be made compulsory in schools. Some of the key points that appear to have become distorted in recent years have to be given extra emphasis, like the roles of colonial soldiers in both world wars, the wealth gained from the slave trade paying in a large part for the 19th century\u2019s industrial revolution, and details of how colonies were ruled and looted.</p> <p>The truth can only be revealed by the opening up to historians of the 1.2m history files secreted away in the Hanslope Park archives in Milton Keynes.

It is history</a>, 8 June) that Colston financed his philanthropy by committing what would now be regarded as crimes against humanity. What he does not say is that this criminality, far from being exceptional, was Europe\u2019s way of recruiting the labour required to satisfy its demand for New World products. Finding the indigenous population insufficient and Europeans unwilling to endure the hardships involved, it turned to Africa, with the result that, prior to 1820, African settlement exceeded European by a ratio of roughly five to one: 10 million versus 2 million.

Here are three suggestions: ex\u2013slave Olaudah Equiano, who, with his searing autobiography, was a leading 18th-century campaigner in Britain against slavery and the slave trade. Frederick Douglass, the great black American anti-slavery campaigner, who toured Britain in 1845-46.

They qualified their distaste by suggesting such statues should have been removed long ago in a dignified manner. This made me think. How many statues can readers suggest be removed with decorum? One of many I can think of is Henry Havelock in Trafalgar Square, at the top of Whitehall \u2013 the man lauded for \u201cputting down\u201d the Indian rebellion.

It was wealth created by the forced labour of enslaved human beings. If it was anybody\u2019s money, it was theirs.

Speaking at the virtual CogX technology conference, Blair said that such a system would operate alongside track and trace programmes as the economy reopens. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You can create a digital ID today that is much more easily protected so you can deal with a lot of the privacy and surveillance issues that worry people.</p> <p>It is a natural evolution of the way that we are going to use technology in any event to transact daily life and this Covid crisis gives an additional reason for doing that.</p> <p>I think people\u2019s disease status - have they been tested, what is the result of that test and have they had the disease, do they have the disease - unless you are able to record some of this data in a way people can use, it is going to be difficult to go back to anything like a near normal in things like transport.</p> <p>If you are going to start international travel again, how can you do that unless people can be easily tested and have some record of that test?</p> <p>There has always been a good case for introducing some form of digital ID but I think that case is even more powerful today.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dbdf7433424286c8cd5311005866baf8ee3750f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dbdf7433424286c8cd5311005866baf8ee3750f/0_184_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Blair.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Blair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T15:32:15.682Z\">at 4.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5edfa64b8f08758335228acd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T15:13:08.701Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the press conference to launch the report on the test and trace system from the Independent Sage pressure group (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/09/uk-coronavirus-live-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5edf5a458f08bd75dbb64ce1#block-5edf5a458f08bd75dbb64ce1\">11.25am)</a>, its chair, <strong>Sir David King</strong>, a former government chief scientific adviser, suggested there had been a \u201closs of moral authority\u201d on the test and trace issue.

Independent Sage is <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/who-is-on-the-independent-sage/\">a group of 12 senior scientists (mostly professors)</a>, set up to shadow the official Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. They have already published <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/\">other reports critical of the government\u2019s coronavirus policy</a>, although today\u2019s is probably the harshest. Ministers have until now largely ignored them, treating them as minority voices in the science community. But it is hard to dismiss them as not credible. Independent Sage is chaired by <strong>Sir David King</strong>, who was the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser (ie, one of Sir Patrick Vallance\u2019s predecessors) between 2000 and 2007.</p> <p>The report should be on <a href=\"https://www.independentsage.org/\">the Independent Sage website </a>shortly. But here\u2019s an extract from its news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new report from the Independent Sage ... says the virus will only be contained if 80% of contacts of infected people are traced. It describes this as \u2018impossible\u2019 under the current system and says a radical restructuring is necessary with responsibility handed over to local public health directors.</p> <p>The report expresses particular concern that the erosion of trust in government in recent weeks is likely to have a major effect on compliance and that no attempt has so far been made to engage with local communities. BAME communities, in particular, it says have suffered \u2018a disproportionate loss of trust\u2019.</p> <p>Currently, the government is using a centralised system of \u2018test, track and trace\u2019 led by Baroness Dido Harding with private contractors providing 25,000 contact tracers. The report notes that New Zealand has shown that eliminating the virus is possible but that containing it depends on tracing at least 80% of contacts who then must remain isolated for 14 days. \u2018This is clearly not happening,\u2019 the report says and urges the government to adopt an existing approach used by public health authorities, \u2018Find, Test, Trace, Isolate and Support\u2019 (FTTIS).</p> <p>Individuals must be supported, the report says, financially and in other ways as surveys from late May have shown that compliance with government guidelines decreased.

They are:</p> <p><strong>1. Local directors of public health (who work for councils) should take the lead in test and trace, the report says.</strong> A local approach would be \u201cmost effective\u201d it says.</p> <p><strong>2. There should be effective community engagement to build trust in the scheme, the report says.</strong></p> <p><strong>3. Test and trace data should be embedded within NHS and council data, the report says.</strong></p> <p><strong>4. Material support, including food and money, should be available for people asked to isolate, the report says. It is this is \u201ccritical\u201d if FTTIS is going to work.</strong></p> <p><strong>5. Key performance data should be published weekly, the report says.</strong></p> <p>Commenting on his report, King said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>The government has placed huge emphasis on their test, track and trace system in recent weeks, even labelling it \u2018world beating\u2019. It is clear from our research that this simply isn\u2019t the case, indeed the system as it stands is not fit for purpose. This is the critical moment for the government to act now or risk further spikes. We believe that a new approach is required, one that moves away from a centralised system that utilises a local first approach. We are calling on the government to urgently rethink their course to ensure that we have a system in place that will help and not hinder the country\u2019s recovery.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Later today Independent Sage is holding a public consultation, followed by a press conference at 1.45pm.</p> <p><em>UPDATE: </em>The Independent Sage criticisms largely relate to how test and trace operates in England.

The government expects children to be able to return to early years settings, and for reception, year 1 and year 6 to be back in school in smaller sizes, from this point. This aims to ensure that the youngest children, and those preparing for the transition to secondary school, have maximum time with their teachers. Secondary schools and further education colleges should also prepare to begin some face to face contact with year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in support of their continued remote, home learning.

  "<p>\u201cI can\u2019t explain how deeply I trust you, but I want you to know.\u201d</p> <p>For an oncologist, there could scarcely be more gratifying words. Or more terrifying. To know that not only have patients chosen to trust you, but also it has helped them is an endorsement that one alternately desires and discourages; for although the rewards are wonderful, the disappointments can be crushing.</p> <p>I first experienced this as a locum for a respected oncologist. Day after day, I gave my very best to his many patients but although uniformly polite, the flash of concern and even occasional panic on their face was unmissable. I realised that it wasn\u2019t just professional expertise they cared for but something as intangible as it was powerful: a bond of trust forged over time with one individual. I later grumbled to the oncologist that his patients felt short-changed because they had longed to see him and got me instead. One day it will happen to you too, he smiled. I thought he was generous and mistaken. But years later, his prediction came true and strangely enough, now I muse at its consequences.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/07/it-was-quite-intimate-a-tiny-funeral-for-a-big-family-man\">'It was quite intimate': a tiny funeral for a big family man</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pandemic has touched every aspect of our lives. Most of us can hope to resume some form of normality one day, but for terminally ill patients and their carers this has been an impossibly difficult time. In their final months, my sickest patients see me more than their relatives because there are so many conversations we need to have. Whether to have a treatment of last resort or preserve quality of life; when and what to tell the kids; whether to bring a marriage or a vacation forward; what dying involves; where to die.</p> <p>Emergency physicians often encourage oncologists to have these conversations earlier because the alternative is unfair. First, there is the matter of the glare of lights, machines and crashing vital signs and then, the awfulness of having a complete stranger interrogate patients about their final wishes. These are some of the most important and consequential conversations in all of medicine and it takes all of one\u2019s tact, courage and compassion to get them right. Just because these conversations are important doesn\u2019t meant they aren\u2019t intensely sad. Humans are surprising resilient but when the news is bad, the depletion of hope is real and it takes every bit of mutual trust to navigate the future.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have seen the inadequacy of a shaky video link or a halting phone call instead of a real visit like the \u2018old times\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So, what happens when very long relationships of mutual liking and trust end with the patient\u2019s death? Mostly, the grief is private and the agreed price one pays for the privilege of being a doctor. But each year, I accept an invitation to some funerals, the reason for which is best summed up by a paediatrician who confesses that she goes for the family but also for herself because sometimes, no other closure will do.</p> <p>This has always struck me as a genuine and respectful reason to slip into the very back row of mourners although over the years, I\u2019ve been mortified to find how many people want to say thank you. It\u2019s sobering to think how many people must refer to their oncologist in their discussions. In turn, I have learned to admit my own fondness for the patient and be unafraid to say how much the relationship enriched me.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, she is on multiple screens at the same time! Guys, you have to take a look!\u201d</p> <p>The triumphant shouts of my youngest child reverberate around the house as his siblings race to the table.

Incantations in different languages fill my ears as I try to make out the faces. Is that his dad or brother? Is her son crying and where is his sister? Will her husband manage the eulogy?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While we won\u2019t forget those who are gone, our patients would want us to pay it forward</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During the pandemic, I\u2019ve lost several patients although none from an infection. But in my heart, I can\u2019t help feeling that the unprecedented shock of global circumstances caused them to lose that extra little zest and hope that had kept them going. It may be unscientific but then, I have seen the inadequacy of a shaky video link or a halting phone call instead of a real visit like the \u201cold times\u201d, when I could draw my chair closer, smell fear, sense regret and most of all employ trust to acknowledge distress and open avenues of hope.</p> <p>As it turns out, I could barely even visit my dying patients given the restrictions on visitors and hours. Every extra minute I spent at the bedside was a minute less for the family to coalesce. No Zoom meeting ever replaced the solace of grieving with relatives. Everything felt unfair and uncertain and yet my brave patients never protested, instead thanking me via text.

It comes from losing long-term patients who thought we\u2019d accompany them until the very end but then we got locked out.

  "<p>We are not even halfway through it, but already it is indisputable that 2020 will forever be seen, for all the wrong reasons, as a flashpoint in Australian history.</p> <p>Bushfires have ravaged a sizeable portion of the country. We watch the United States tear itself apart in an explosion of violence over matters of race and are forced to ask ourselves again whether we are in a position to point fingers. And a global pandemic continues to turn our lives upside down.</p> <p>Against that backdrop it seems almost insignificant to be talking about sport. Nonetheless it is a discussion gradually re-entering our lives. Rugby league was the first of our two major football codes to re-enter the conversation. And on Thursday evening, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/25/afl-season-restart-fixture-announcement\">when Richmond meet</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/25/afl-season-restart-fixture-announcement\"> Collingwood</a>, so will AFL football.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/09/afl-fans-allowed-into-stadiums-proposal\">AFL gets green light for 2,000 fans to attend weekend's game in Adelaide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given the havoc Covid-19 has already wreaked upon the AFL, that the abruptly aborted 2020 season is resuming at all is a triumph of sorts. The restart isn\u2019t just a welcome turn of events; for a host of AFL clubs forced to lay off up to 80% of their staffs and having gone without match returns for three months, it could literally be a lifesaver.</p> <p>It is a far rosier scenario than seemed likely when a halt was called to proceedings after just one round in March.</p> <p>Back then, the AFL had on the table proposals like an entire season compacted into just a couple of months, with teams playing several games per week. The ridiculous notion of a grand final played the week before Christmas was a distinct possibility.</p> <p>They were worst-case scenarios, of course. And the adept management of the pandemic throughout the country, coinciding with a power of work by the AFL to cover all bases and eventualities, has brightened the picture considerably.</p> <p>Provided there is no significant spike in coronavirus cases and a sharp deterioration in the health picture as the country begins to open up again, the tentative date for the grand final is 24 October.</p> <p>The fixtures, though released only in four-week blocks, at this stage closely resemble a typical season\u2019s roster, games on Thursday and Friday evenings, four on Saturdays and three on a Sunday.</p> <p>There will still be obvious and significant differences, of course. A 17-round season with each team playing each other just once, and reduced game times, with quarters now only 16-and-a-half minutes plus time-on compared to the usual 20 minutes plus time-on are two changes which had already been incorporated when things kicked off on 19 March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ee6296b363d6733e05e10d27618902176def43b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ee6296b363d6733e05e10d27618902176def43b/0_200_3020_1813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jy Simkin and Bailey Scott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jy Simpkin (left) and Bailey Scott prepare for the season restart at a North Melbourne training session.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dodge/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest logistical change is the temporary domiciling of six teams \u2013 Brisbane, Gold Coast, Adelaide, Port Adelaide, West Coast and Fremantle \u2013 at a hub on the Gold Coast, where all will play both home and away games during the first part of the season.</p> <p>And the most obvious change of all will be the absence of large crowds. That produced a strange vibe during round one. Even three games decided by a goal or less seemed strangely flat.</p> <p>Perhaps we will get used to it. Perhaps the much-discussed fake crowd noise which the TV networks have had their experts beavering away at (while not scouring the globe for new reality show concepts) and some deft placement of life-sized cardboard cutouts will at least partially fill the void.</p> <p>Perhaps we won\u2019t have to get used to it. There will be more than 2,000 fans at the Showdown in Adelaide on Saturday and if the pandemic line continues to flatten we may even see some decent-sized crowds sooner rather than later. The NRL last Friday announced it planned the return of spectators on a limited basis from July. The AFL chief executive, Gill McLachlan, said the same day that he still harboured hopes of a grand final played in front of 100,000 people.</p> <p>Hopes is the operative word. Because there is still much uncertainty around AFL 2020. What if the season is abruptly halted again? What if one or more of the 800-plus listed players records a positive test? What happens with games involving the hub teams after they return home? And so on.</p> <p>Maybe the biggest unknown of all, however, concerns how this season will be received by that group we are constantly told is the lifeblood of the game \u2013 the fans.</p> <p>We already know life, certainly in an economic sense, will not simply return to normal, even after the health problems abate. How about in a cultural sense? Will AFL football still mean as much now, even to those who have followed it most fervently?</p> <p>The actual games are one thing. But will the torrent of contrived or inflated issues that drive much of the agenda in between rounds hold nearly as many of us spellbound given the sizeable shot of perspective we have all been delivered recently?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/take-that-covid-19-you-cant-stop-the-compulsory-emotional-juggernaut-that-is-footy\">Take that Covid-19, you can't stop the compulsory emotional juggernaut that is FOOTY! | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Or will it seem more often like the mindless and trivial filler much of it has been while the season was in abeyance?</p> <p>AFL football can provide a wonderful escape from the stresses of day-to-day life. But our lives haven\u2019t been that for some time now. And the extent to which football actually does sustain us is a question plenty have been pondering these last few months.</p> <p>The pause in the AFL season has lasted long enough to perhaps have fundamentally changed the relationship between the game and its supporters, a bond the strength of which has always been a given.</p> <p>But maybe even that can no longer be taken for granted.

I cannot understand how the EFL has come up with this solution and, most of all, I cannot believe so many clubs voted for PPG to end the season because it\u2019s so, so unfair.

  "<p>The Conservative manifesto made a clear promise. It <a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf\">pledged</a> that in the government\u2019s trade talks, \u201cwe will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards\u201d. Just six months after the election, the promise has been ditched. Our government is now <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/03/britain-ready-allow-import-chlorinated-chicken-us/\">proposing</a> that chlorine-washed chicken, beef treated with growth hormones, pork from animals injected with a drug that makes their meat leaner, called <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/47032-time-for-us-to-ban-ractopamine.html\">ractopamine</a>, and scores of other foods produced in the United States by dangerous, cruel and disgusting means will be allowed into this country, as long as higher trade taxes (tariffs) are applied to them.</p> <p>&nbsp;The trade secretary, Liz Truss, has made it clear that any such tariffs would be <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chlorinated-chicken-us-trade-talks-boris-johnson-trump-a9549656.html\">removed within 10 years</a>. It\u2019s impossible to see the American trade negotiators allowing them to pass in the first place. The US intends to secure \u201ccomprehensive\u201d access to our food markets, while \u201c<a href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Summary_of_U.S.-UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf\">reducing or eliminating tariffs</a>\u201d. This nonsense about higher tariffs is a blatant attempt to soften us up, to sugar the toxic pill of US imports that don\u2019t meet our standards. When I say sugar, I mean high-fructose corn syrup.</p> <p>&nbsp;It\u2019s not as if our standards are wonderful. But by comparison to the revolting practices in the US, our food rules, laid down by the European Union, are a haven of sanity. As well as washing chicken flesh with chlorine to compensate for the filthy conditions in which it is raised and processed, and injecting dangerous substances into cattle and pigs, Big Farmer and Big Food in the US use 72 pesticides that are<a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-019-0488-0\"> banned</a> in the UK and food colourings that have been linked to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17825405/\">hyperactivity in children</a>, impose no limits on the amount of <a href=\"https://www.sgs.com/en/news/2015/12/global-regulatory-requirements-for-baby-food\">sugar in baby food</a> and permit cow\u2019s milk to contain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/02/chlorinated-chicken-foods-us-trade-deal-uk-eu\">twice the amount of pus</a> that the UK allows.</p> <p>&nbsp;What this all means is that we will bring into this country food whose production is banned here. Either our farmers and food processors will be outcompeted, or our domestic production standards will be brought down to match. Some Conservative MPs attempted to <a href=\"http://www.farmbusiness.co.uk/news/minister-claims-unintended-consequences-as-agriculture-bill-import-standards-amendment-is-defeated.html\">insert an amendment</a> into the agriculture bill last month to uphold the manifesto promise. But it was decisively slapped down by government loyalists. The bill returns to the House of Commons on Wednesday. </p> <p>&nbsp;The US government argues that these matters should be left to <a href=\"https://www.farminguk.com/news/chlorinated-chicken-should-be-offered-in-uk-us-ambassador-says_53138.html\">consumers</a>. We should each be allowed to decide whether we buy cheap vegetables containing residues of pesticides that are banned here. But I suspect that, rather than having to read and interpret the labels on everything we buy from shops, takeaways and restaurants, most of us would prefer to know that all the food on sale is safe to eat. Anyway, just in case we did try to exercise such choice, the US also insists that all <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chlorinated-chicken-us-trade-talks-boris-johnson-trump-a9549656.html\">useful labelling be banned</a>. Perversely, it has argued that <a href=\"https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/news/2019/nov/27/leaked-papers-us-uk-trade-talks-guide-revelations\">warning labels are \u201charmful\u201d</a> to public health.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t end with food. In the same section of their manifesto, the Conservatives promised that \u201cin our trade talks \u2026 the NHS is not on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs is not on the table. The services the NHS provides are not on the table.\u201d The <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-us-trade-deal-nhs-leaked-papers-dossier-corbyn-a9220916.html\">leaked dossier of trade documents</a> released by the Labour party last year revealed that the US was seeking \u201cfull market access\u201d to the NHS. If the promised food and farming standards were a lie, how long will it be before we discover that the NHS pledge was also worthless?</p> <p>&nbsp;I suspect this has been the agenda all along. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot\">neoliberal extremists</a> who populate the front benches have long sought to rip down our public protections, rip down our public services, rip down everything that stands in the way of the most vicious form of capitalism. A trade deal with the US allows them to do so while disclaiming responsibility for the consequences. Once they have signed it, they can claim that, sadly, their hands are tied. They could say that unfortunately, the rules don\u2019t allow us to maintain food standards and force us to open the NHS to competition. Perhaps mistakes were made during the negotiations but it\u2019s a done deal now, enforced by legal instruments, and there\u2019s nothing we can do.&nbsp;They know they could never obtain public consent for these policies. A US trade deal would impose them without consent.</p> <p>&nbsp;Even parliamentary consent is unnecessary. The <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-01/0120/cbill_2019-20210120_en_1.htm\">trade bill</a>, which has now reached the committee stage in the House of Commons, makes no provision for <a href=\"https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/news/2020/may/20/trade-bill-slap-face-mps-say-campaigners\">parliamentary scrutiny</a> of any deal. Parliament has <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2020/05/the-tory-trade-bill-threatens-parliamentary-sovereignty/\">no legal right under this bill to debate or vote on a trade deal</a>, or even to know what it contains. The bill also grants the government <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/period/tudor/what-are-henry-viii-powers/\">Henry VIII powers</a> to change the law on trade agreements <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8854/?doing_wp_cron=1591707554.6092081069946289062500\">without parliamentary approval</a>. The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are granted no formal role in negotiating or approving trade treaties. In other words, nothing is being left to chance. This is not democracy. This is elective dictatorship.</p> <p>&nbsp;To make matters worse, the US is likely to insist that the deal is enforced by an offshore tribunal, which allows corporations to sue governments if domestic law affects their \u201cfuture anticipated profits\u201d. This mechanism has been used<a href=\"https://stopisds.org.uk/what-is-isds/\"> all over the world</a> to punish nations for laws their parliaments have passed. It ensures that, over time, legislation everywhere has to be tailored to the <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/topic/globalization-trade/corporate-power-expanded-isds/\">demands of corporate power</a>. Far from taking back control, a trade deal on these lines with the US involves a massive renunciation of sovereign power.</p> <p>&nbsp;The government knows that accepting such a deal means no deal with the EU. US food rules are incompatible with EU standards. In the leaked documents, US officials remark that \u201cthere would be <a href=\"https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/news/2019/nov/27/leaked-papers-us-uk-trade-talks-guide-revelations\">all to play for in a no-deal situation</a>\u201d. I suspect our government sees it the same way.</p> <p>The&nbsp;pigheaded&nbsp;obstructionism of the UK in the current EU talks is at stark odds with its willingness to prostrate itself before US power. Dominic Cummings says he intends to stay in his post as adviser at No 10 <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/under-fire-dominic-cummings-considering-22104633\">for the next six months</a>. In other words, he will stay for long enough to ensure that the transition period for leaving the EU is not extended, making a no-deal Brexit more likely.</p> <p>Just as Donald Trump seeks to erase Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, Boris Johnson and Cummings seek to erase Clement Attlee\u2019s much deeper legacy. It\u2019s not about sovereignty. It\u2019s not about taking back control. It\u2019s not about British values or British autonomy. It\u2019s about locking deregulation and the demolition of public services in place, by means that cannot be challenged by either people or parliament. The combination of a no-deal Brexit and a coercive US trade agreement will allow the government to rip down a wide range of rules and protections, creating a paradise for the disaster capitalists funding the party, and hell for the rest of us.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>They intend to pursue this agenda regardless of the pandemic, regardless of <a href=\"https://www.campaigns.nfuonline.com/page/56262/petition/1?locale=en-GB\">a food standards petition</a> that has already gained 800,000 signatures, regardless of the economic and political harm it might do. This is their game, and we must use every democratic means to stop it.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>The world stands on the brink of a food crisis worse than any seen for at least 50 years, the UN has warned as it urged governments to act swiftly to avoid disaster.</p> <p>Better social protections for poor people are urgently needed as the looming recession following the coronavirus pandemic may put basic nutrition beyond their reach, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cUnless immediate action is taken, it is increasingly clear that there is an impending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-double-number-of-people-going-hungry\">global food emergency</a> that could have long-term impacts on hundreds of millions of children and adults,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to act now to avoid the worst impacts of our efforts to control the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>Although harvests of staple crops are holding up, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\">export bans and protectionism that experts feared</a> have so far been largely avoided, the worst of the impacts of the pandemic and ensuing recession are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/global-hunger-could-be-next-big-impact-of-coronavirus-pandemic\">yet to be felt</a>. Guterres warned: \u201cEven in countries with abundant food, we see risks of disruption in the food supply chain.\u201d</p> <p>About 50 million people risk falling into extreme poverty this year owing to the pandemic, but the long-term effects will be even worse, as poor nutrition in childhood causes lifelong suffering. Already, one in five children around the world are stunted in their growth by the age of five, and millions more are likely to suffer the same fate if poverty rates soar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-covid-19-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most Covid-19 cases and deaths?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guterres laid out a three-point plan to repair the world\u2019s ailing food systems and prevent further harm. These are: to focus aid on the worst-stricken regions to stave off immediate disaster, and for governments to prioritise food supply chains; to strengthen social protections so that young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women and other at-risk groups \u2013 including children who are not receiving school meals in lockdown \u2013 receive adequate nutrition; and to invest in the future, by building a global recovery from the pandemic that prioritises healthy and environmentally sustainable food systems.</p> <p>Maximo Torero, the chief economist of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, said the world\u2019s food systems were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/16/race-against-time-to-prevent-famines-during-coronavirus-crisis\">under threat as never before in recent times</a>, as the pandemic and lockdowns hampered people\u2019s ability to harvest and buy and sell food. \u201cWe need to be careful,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very different food crisis than the ones we have seen.\u201d</p> <p>Harvests are healthy and supplies of staple foods such as grains are \u201crobust\u201d, according to the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/coronavirus/un-secretary-general\">UN report on the impact of Covid-19 on food security and nutrition</a>, published on Tuesday. But most people get their food from local markets, which are vulnerable to disruption from lockdowns.</p> <p>Increasing unemployment and the loss of income associated with lockdowns are also putting food out of reach for many struggling people. Though global markets have remained steady, the price of basic foods has begun to rise in some countries.</p> <p>Lockdowns are slowing harvests, while millions of seasonal labourers are unable to work. Food waste has reached damaging levels, with farmers forced to dump perishable produce as the result of supply chain problems, and in the meat industry plants have been forced to close in some countries.</p> <p>Even before the lockdowns, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/12/malnutrition-leading-cause-of-death-and-ill-health-worldwide-report\">global food system was failing</a> in many areas, according to the UN. The report pointed to conflict, natural disasters, the climate crisis, and the arrival of pests and plant and animal plagues as existing problems. East Africa, for instance, is facing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jun/08/rolling-emergency-of-locust-swarms-decimating-africa-asia-and-middle-east\">worst swarms of locusts for decades</a>, while heavy rain is hampering relief efforts.</p> <p>The additional impact of the coronavirus crisis and lockdowns, and the resulting recession, would compound the damage and tip millions into dire hunger, experts warned.</p> <p>\u201cThe Covid-19 crisis is attacking us at every angle,\u201d said Agnes Kalibata, the UN secretary general\u2019s special envoy for the 2021 food systems summit. \u201cIt has exposed dangerous deficiencies in our food systems and actively threatens the lives and livelihoods of people around the world, especially the more than 1 billion people who have employment in the various industries in food systems.\u201d</p> <p>She pointed to Latin America and the Caribbean, where a third of the population already live in a precarious state of food insecurity, and where Brazil is fast becoming a hotspot for coronavirus cases. \u201cAcross the region, the pandemic has weakened economies and disrupted supply chains, leading to food price hikes,\u201d she warned.</p> <p>The pandemic risks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-turn-back-the-clock-30-years-on-global-poverty\">reversing the progress that has been made in recent decades </a>on lifting people out of poverty and improving their access to healthy food, the UN found.</p> <p>Any remedies must also target the climate emergency, which is strongly linked to the world\u2019s food systems, said Elwyn Grainger-Jones, the executive director of the CGIAR System Organization, a global agricultural research body. \u201cSolutions need to be science-based and coordinated across sectors to provide immediate response and assistance for those most in need, ongoing and inclusive support in recovery and \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 future resilience to all shocks, including climate extremes.\u201d</p> <p>Kalibata said there was also an opportunity for countries to improve food systems alongside reducing poverty and increasing global resilience to shocks.</p> <p>\u201cFood has always brought people together and it can again if we build back better as it relates to our food systems,\u201d she said.</p>",

  "<p>Palestine will declare statehood over all of the West Bank and Gaza, with Jerusalem as its capital, and push for global recognition if Israel goes ahead with plans to annex land it occupies, the Palestinian prime minister has said.</p> <p>Mohammad Shtayyeh&nbsp;described the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/what-would-israel-annexing-the-west-bank-mean\">possible step</a> pledged by the Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to a decades-long international effort for Israelis and Palestinians to reach an agreement that establishes two states side by side.</p> <p>He said Palestine would not continue to wait on statehood just to honour previous agreements made with Israel if it broke them by annexing territory. \u201cIt takes two to tango.\u201d</p> <p>Shtayyeh said he was leading a concerted push to gather diplomatic pressure against Israel and wanted world powers to threaten sanctions on Netanyahu\u2019s government so that \u201cIsrael does not get away with murder\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we want is that Israel should feel the heat,\u201d Shtayyeh said at a press conference held by the local Foreign Press Association in Ramallah on Tuesday.</p> <p>Palestinian leaders have declared statehood in the past, including Yasser Arafat in 1988. In 2012, Palestine&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/29/united-nations-vote-palestine-state\">gained UN observer state status</a>. However, with the Palestinian territories remaining occupied by Israel, and in the absence of an agreement, there has not been full international recognition.</p> <p>Shtayyeh, for example, is the prime minister of the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Palestinian Authority, a body created in 1994 and intended to be a pre-state interim government.</p> <p>\u201cThe fruits of peace have never actually materialised since the signing of the agreement,\u201d Shtayyeh said.</p> <p>With Israeli forces in control of the Palestinian territories, any declaration of statehood would be largely symbolic. However, Shtayyeh\u2019s government might hope that growing international unease over Israel\u2019s annexation plans could encourage governments to formally back Palestinian claims.</p> <p>His comments will also be interpreted as further exasperation from the Palestinian leadership, which has seen Israel \u2013 with backing from Donald Trump \u2013 move to solidify its already tight territorial grip.</p> <p>Palestinian officials have been scrambling to respond to Israeli threats of annexation for months. In May, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/palestinian-leader-mahmoud-abbas-ends-security-agreement-with-israel-and-us\">announced</a> that all previous agreements signed with the US and Israel, including security cooperation, were void.</p> <p>During the past year, Netanyahu has made repeated promises to annex, or \u201capply sovereignty\u201d to, different areas of the West Bank, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a>&nbsp;captured from Jordan in 1967.</p> <p>Under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/netanyahu-takes-office-in-deal-that-could-see-west-bank-annexation\">a unity government deal</a>, the Israeli leader has pushed to bring annexation plans&nbsp;to the cabinet for discussion as soon as 1 July.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting and pushing for Israel not to annex,\u201d Shtayyeh said. \u201cIf Israel is going to annex after July 1st, we are going to go from the interim period of the Palestinian Authority into the manifestation of a state on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does a manifestation of the state on the ground mean? It means that there will be a foundational council. There will be a constitutional declaration. And Palestine will be on the borders of [19]67, with Jerusalem as its capital. And we will call on the international community to recognise this land. That is where we are.\u201d</p> <p>In a phone conversation last week with James Cleverly, the UK\u2019s minister for the Middle East and north Africa, Shtayyeh called on London to recognise Palestine as a state.</p> <p>Cleverly had told parliament in May that the UK would not support Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank because it would make a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d harder to achieve. The UK has not recognised Palestinian statehood.</p> <p>Shtayyeh, however, said he was optimistic that European governments would consider recognising Palestine as a response to annexation. \u201cI think the British government and all European governments are really looking at this very seriously. The tone I have heard was very different, too,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Asked for comment, a British Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK will recognise a Palestinian state at a time of our choosing, and when it best serves the objective of peace.\u201d</p>",

It is history | David Olusoga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despair, pain and anger have been running high within black communities. The recent killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/06/04/tony-mcdade-black-trans-man-killed-police-officer-name/\">Tony McDade</a>, and George Floyd echoed the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/sandra-bland-video-footage-arrest-death-police-custody-latest-news\">Sandra B</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/sandra-bland-video-footage-arrest-death-police-custody-latest-news\">land</a>, Michael Brown and many others. These terrible events have ignited much more than mass demonstrations: they have triggered feelings that many within black communities have been suppressing for a long time, in order to simply be able to carry on living their lives. The issue of <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/lifestyle-buzz/what-does-intergenerational-trauma-and-healing-look-like-for-black-women/ar-BBVfjnZ\">intergenerational trauma</a> that is often explored when studying the history of slavery has resurfaced in the most violent way. </p> <p>What these killings and subsequent protests have also captured are the chaotic ways most former colonial powers have been avoiding an honest reckoning with the impact of the past. This is a story of the legacies that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/racism-british-society-minority-ethnic-people-dying-excessive-force\">shaped societies</a> in the most dramatic way, putting black and brown people at the bottom of the social ladder. It is about the many forms of racism that have led to discriminatory practices. These have, in turn, prevented large swathes of society from having access to decent jobs or the ability to benefit from social mobility. Floyd\u2019s death has pushed people into uncomfortable trenches, where they must reckon with a difficult history.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Britain, the death and protests were also followed by a mass show of solidarity from institutions and companies around the country. That seemed like a positive step \u2013 but it was also incredibly puzzling for those of us who have long been fighting for racial equality. Some of these institutions are routinely accused of lacking a multiracial representation among their staff members \u2013 while others continually fail to address endemic racism.</p> <p>The dissonance between these performative shows of solidarity and the inability to connect what was happening in the US with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/racism-george-floyd-britain-america-uk-black-people\">Britain\u2019s own history of discrimination</a> was uncanny. The disingenuous argument often used is that Britain doesn\u2019t have the same record of police brutality \u2013 or that a series of race relations acts are proof that the UK is committed to racial equality.</p> <p>What is striking here is the failure to make a link between numerous pressing issues: the dispute over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/06/labour-accuses-government-of-cover-up-over-bame-covid-19-report\">the release and findings</a> of Public Health England\u2019s report on the high number of coronavirus deaths within BAME communities; the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/28/windrush-scandal-only-60-victims-given-compensation-so-far\">Windrush scandal</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/08/commonwealth-veterans-accuse-uk-immigration-limbo-home-office-mod\">hostile environment</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52900700\">inner contradictions</a>; the lack of support for victims of the Grenfell fire; the resistance to teaching British black history and the continued glorification of the British empire\u2019s legacies. Each deserves a full article, but let us try to disentangle the racialised knot at the heart of these stories and their links with policing black and brown bodies. Let us start by setting the record straight.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/systemic-racism-police-brutality-british-problems-black-lives-matter\">Police brutality towards black people</a> \u2013 as well as against Asian and other minority ethnic groups \u2013 has taken many forms over decades in Britain. We all remember the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">Macpherson </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\">report</a> from 1999, following the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, that established that the Metropolitan police was institutionally racist. Since then, several groups have done a tremendous amount of work to bridge the gap between communities and police forces. Yet trust still needs to be built \u2013 and police forces still lack officers from minority ethnic communities. Government austerity cuts have further eroded efforts to tackle this imbalance. In recent months we have even seen <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-52905787\">excessive fines</a> against BAME groups for breaching lockdown rules during the pandemic.</p> <p>Yet the issue at the heart of our current situation is not the police, but poverty, exclusion, and accepted institutionalised and <a href=\"https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/understanding-everyday-racism/book3570\">everyday racism</a>. This has led many in the majority group to view black people as either exceptional \u2013 the \u201cchosen one\u201d who has shown remarkable abilities and therefore deserves to be praised \u2013 or as a criminal, a member of the <a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/race-and-the-undeserving-poor/9781788210386\">undeserving poor</a>, or finally as a foreigner, even when their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/windrush-institutional-racism-hostile-environment\">ancestors have contributed</a> to the wealth of this nation.&nbsp;</p> <p>How do we move past the current dangerous moment where young black people are caught up in places of despair and rage? How do we offer a potential for hope? Some argue that we can\u2019t fix <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/dr-cornel-west-on-whether-us-can-break-down-racial-barriers\">a system that isn\u2019t working</a> and that the police should be abolished; others support the idea that local and community collective endeavours are the answer to failed leadership. My belief is that governments, institutions and organisations have a lot to learn from those grassroots movements. The task is enormous but let us imagine how genuine joint efforts could transform our cities, towns and country.&nbsp;</p> <p>People in cities have already shown that they can take this difficult history into their own hands. On Sunday, those protesters in Bristol toppled the statue of Edward Colston, responsible for the transportation of nearly 85,000 African captives in the late 17th century.</p> <p>The statue was erected in 1895, long after his death, in honour of Colston\u2019s philanthropic deeds towards parts of the community in Bristol. He was for generations of Bristolians one of the fathers of the city. However, the presence of the statue has been a source of division for many years, with previous efforts to have the statue removed continuously stalled. At the weekend, young people removed the bronze statue in the most dramatic way and then threw it into the harbour, to cheers from onlookers. The home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Priti Patel</a>, described the event as an act of vandalism.</p> <p>The reality was a much more complex history, in which a very specific local past and a present marred by decades of appalling racial and social inequalities finally collided. What happens next is unclear: many other slave traders are still celebrated in Bristol, while poverty, racism and all forms of inequalities are, more than ever, in urgent need of being tackled.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Olivette Otele is professor of history and memory of slavery at the University of Bristol.

He clarified that staff were \u201cnot banned\u201d from joining anti-racism demonstrations, as long as it was in an \u201centirely private capacity\u201d.</p> <p>In a letter to staff that followed public pushback from the UN\u2019s own special rapporteur on freedom of assembly, Guterres insisted that a memo from its ethics board did not mean that staff were required to \u201cremain neutral or impartial in the face of racism\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe position of the United Nations on racism is crystal clear: this scourge violates the charter and debases our core values,\u201d Guterres wrote to staff.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day, in our work across the world, we strive to do our part to promote inclusion, justice, dignity and combat racism in all its manifestations.\u201d</p> <p>The letter follows guidance, issued late last week, which caused concern inside the UN secretariat after employees were told that as \u201cinternational civil servants\u201d they should not participate in public demonstrations.</p> <p>\u201cParticipation in public demonstrations in the current circumstances may not be consistent with the independence and impartiality required of us as international civil servants,\u201d said the memo, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/08/united-nations-staff-george-floyd-protests/\">first reported in Foreign Policy</a>, which was endorsed by Guterres and also cited health concerns during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIn New York City or other locations in which curfews have been imposed, staff members must observe such curfews and similar public orders,\u201d it instructed.</p> <p>\u201cInsofar as some of the protests have given rise to violence and property damage, the risk that a United Nations staff member could be swept up in an uncontrolled demonstration, including facing arrest or detention, could bring substantial disrepute to the organisation.\u201d</p> <p>Among those who went public criticising the memo was the special rapporteur on freedom of assembly, Cl\u00e9ment Voule who posted a highly critical statement on his office\u2019s website.</p> <p>However, in a new communication sent personally to staff, Guterres insisted that the ethics panel circular should not be read as a ban.</p> <p>\u201cTo the contrary, there is no ban on personal expressions of solidarity or acts of peaceful civic engagement, provided they are carried out in an entirely private capacity.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the recent guidance by the ethics panel \u201cwas meant to emphasise the need to balance such activities with one\u2019s best judgment as international civil servants and our official duties\u201d.</p> <p>While Guterres himself has been outspoken about Floyd\u2019s murder and the wider issue of racism, some UN personnel felt uncomfortable about the initial guidance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-pandemic-is-becoming-a-human-rights-crisis-un-warns\">Coronavirus pandemic is becoming a human rights crisis, UN warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Citing the example of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/nfl-decision-to-permit-kneeling-protest-by-players-enrages-donald-trump\">NFL\u2019s recent U-turn</a> on protest in support of Black Lives Matter, Voule said: \u201cI encourage the UN to allow their staff to publicly join this important and historical movement to end institutional and other forms of racism and violence.</p> <p>\u201cTo allow their staff to exercise their right to peaceful protest like thousands of others fighting for justice, dignity and equality.

King is a black man of God. I don\u2019t know of Katori\u2019s spiritual beliefs, but in The Mountaintop she generously explores how the weight and fatigue of the struggle can enhance insight and the inspiration of conviction.</p> <p><strong>The play is a two-hander. Camae, the young woman who visits King, is brilliantly drawn and feels like an under-represented character in theatre. Do you think there are certain stories that UK theatre has largely failed to represent?</strong>&nbsp;<br>A character like Camae is certainly a good example, but I would say that UK theatre needs to not relegate those stories to small theatre spaces, regional theatres or small organisations. Many under-represented stories and experiences exist, and those stories need to be seen on big stages and should be part of the narratives of international exports and given wider visibility.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>How does theatre\u2019s lockdown pose a risk to diversity?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Many people of colour do not trust the sector or the institutions. The feeling is that unconscious biases will mean that only the roles that white people occupy will be retained.

  "<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/03/exclusive-coronavirus-began-accident-disease-escaped-chinese/\">interview with the Telegraph</a>, the former head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove cited an \u201cimportant\u201d scientific report that suggested that the novel coronavirus had not emerged naturally, but had been created by Chinese scientists. Dearlove said he believed the pandemic had \u201cstarted as an accident\u201d after the virus escaped the lab. A month earlier, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, had said he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory\">\u201cenormous evidence\u201d</a> that Covid-19 had originated in a lab in China, only to backtrack from this claim on <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/interview-pompeo-sends-mixed-messages-coronavirus-wuhan-lab-993341/\">live TV</a> in the same sentence.</p> <p>Suggestions that Covid-19 is a manmade virus are the latest chapter in a tale of blame, misinformation and finger-pointing. Cue the <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/collections/new-coronavirus-collection/\">conspiracy theorists</a>, marching out their narrative about the high-security BSL-4 lab in Wuhan, where mysterious experiments to design \u201cfrankenviruses\u201d led to the tragic global pandemic. Cue the genetic analyses pointing to \u201cunexpected\u201d insertions in the code of A, G, T, and C that explain how this virus could <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1.full.pdf\">not have evolved naturally</a>. Cue political posturing against China, with calls for an inquiry, trade sanctions and even reparations.</p> <p>Determining the origins and emergence of a pandemic is as messy and complex as studying a plane crash. Just as an air crash investigator pieces together fragments at a crash site, pinpointing the origins of a new virus is painstakingly difficult and time-consuming, and requires logic and reason. I know, because this is exactly what <a href=\"https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/\">our organisation</a>, EcoHealth Alliance, does. We work around the world to identify the origins of pandemics, map them and analyse them, and use these results to predict where the next pandemic will likely emerge. We then target these \u201chotspots\u201d for enhanced surveillance, capacity-building and risk-reduction programmes to prevent diseases emerging.</p> <p>I also know the work of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, because we have partnered with them on research projects. For the past 15 years we\u2019ve been working in China to analyse the group of viruses from which Sars and now Covid-19 have emerged. Sampling more than 16,000 bats, <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/nih-halted-study-unveils-its-massive-analysis-bat-coronaviruses\">we showed that S</a><a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/nih-halted-study-unveils-its-massive-analysis-bat-coronaviruses\">ars emerged from a cluster of coronaviruses carried by horseshoe bats</a> that are abundant across southern and central China and traded frequently in wet markets. We found Sars-related viruses that could infect human cells in the lab, cause diseases in lab animals, and evade drugs and vaccines designed to protect us. We worked with the scientists behind the breakthrough drug <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/remdesivir-drug-to-be-available-for-selected-nhs-covid-19-patients\">Remdesivir</a> to show that it was effective against known human coronaviruses and the viruses we suspected might be the next to emerge. We raised the red flag on these viruses and pointed out their potential to cause the next pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our 15 years of work in China now puts us in a unique position to identify, with a remarkable degree of confidence, the likely origin of Covid-19. In a recent paper, soon to appear in a peer-reviewed journal, we reported 781 genetic sequences of bat-origin coronaviruses previously unknown to scientists. These include the closest known relatives to Sars-CoV, Sars-CoV-2 and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0010-9\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0010-9\">ads-CoV</a>, a virus that killed more than 25,000 pigs in Guangdong in 2016 and 2017. All are carried by horseshoe bats that are found across southern China and neighbouring countries. Our report firmly concludes that Covid-19 originated in bats, in a hotspot of viral evolution along the border of Yunnan province in China, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam.&nbsp;</p> <p>Most people (including former heads of intelligence agencies) aren\u2019t trained in how to decipher genetic codes, so we have to assess the rigour of competing research to determine the truth of claims that Covid-19 was manmade. Writing in the peer-reviewed journal <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9\">Nature Medicine</a>, researchers strongly refuted the idea that the code had been purposefully manipulated. Whereas the article in Nature Medicine<em> </em>was written by senior virologists, one author, John Fredrik Moxnes, the chief scientific adviser to the Norwegian military, has already withdrawn his name from the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/DBBC0FA6E3763B0067CAAD8F3363E527/S2633289220000083a.pdf/biovacc19_a_candidate_vaccine_for_covid19_sarscov2_developed_from_analysis_of_its_general_method_of_action_for_infectivity.pdf\">paper</a> cited by Dearlove \u2013 while scientists from the Francis Crick institute and Imperial College London also dismissed its conclusions.</p> <p>And the claim in the earlier version of this paper to have proven \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt that the Covid-19 virus is engineered\u201d was removed in the later version. This claim relied on an insertion in the genetic code for the spike protein of the virus, the place where the virus locks into our own cells. But the <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(20)30662-X.pdf\">discovery</a> of another novel bat coronavirus in southern China, very closely related to Sars-CoV-2, that includes a similar insertion shows this can evolve naturally.&nbsp;</p> <p>Contrary to the idea that Chinese scientists deliberately released the virus, existing patterns of infection suggest that the wide spread of Covid-19 was a question of when, not if. Only a handful of people work on bat coronaviruses in labs in China, and they wear masks and gloves so as not to contaminate their laboratories. In 2018, we conducted a pilot survey of people living in rural Yunnan province and found nearly <a href=\"https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Virologica-Sinica-SARSr.pdf\">3% had antibodies for bat coronaviruses</a>. Expanding this data to cover the densely populated area in southeast Asia where there are bats known to harbour coronaviruses, we can safely estimate that between one and seven million people are infected with bat coronaviruses each year.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this sort of logic will not deter conspiracy theorists. The dark power of the internet means that anyone, anywhere, can find evidence to echo even the most outlandish of claims. Theories that Sars originated from space or that HIV was manmade are readily available, but it doesn\u2019t make them true. Such conspiracies play to our most base instincts and paranoias \u2013 fears that dissolve logic and reason. The details of how this virus emerged naturally are far less exciting. They\u2019re about how humans and animals have interacted for millennia, now at an unprecedented rate. They\u2019re about how human domination of the world\u2019s ecosystems as we encroach on animal habitats is opening new pathways for viruses, once hidden in the depths of the forest, to be transmitted to humans.</p> <p>Even as Covid-19 continues to spread across the world, analysing its origin is of critical importance for our species on this planet. If we allow myths and rumours to set our pandemic prevention agenda, we miss, quite literally, the forest for the trees. We estimate that there are <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/872\">1.7</a><a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/872\">m</a><a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/872\"> undiscovered viruses</a> in wildlife in emerging disease hotspots such as rural southeast Asia. Rather than chasing conspiracies, we should be focusing our efforts on these regions and the communities on their frontlines. A pandemic such as this one isn\u2019t a once-in-a-lifetime tragedy. Ignoring the guidance of the global scientific community about how and why they emerge will come at a great cost to us all.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Daszak is president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to analysing and preventing pandemics</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2020 to make clear the writer\u2019s past work with researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

results were better than expected).</p> \n  <p>The Covid-19 committee then heard from the ATO commissioner, <strong>Chris Jordan</strong>, on the second error \u2013 that the ATO believed many more employees were covered due to errors in employers\u2019 responses.</p> \n  <p>Jordan said a small number of the 900,000 businesses made errors such as putting their phone numbers, ABN or bank account details into the employees-covered field, and some put in 1,500 or multiples of 1,500. </p> \n  <p>He said 0.1% of employers appeared to think the field was asking for \u201cthe amount payable to, rather than the number of employees\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He said many categories of error were picked up but:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>We did not build rigorous analytics behind that field that asked for the estimated number of employees that businesses had [claimed for].</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Jordan said the ATO told treasury about the error on 21 May, before the public update on 22 May.</p> \n  <p>Explaining why it took so long to detect, the ATO said the numbers enrolling in jobkeeper \u201cseemed to be on trajectory consistent with estimates ... but once [we] began to confirm employees covered, we identified within a fortnight the numbers were less than expected\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The ATO conducted outreach to big employers and believed the discrepancy was due to big employers not completing the second stage of their application (confirming which employees they were claiming for). Eventually, it \u201cbecame evident\u201d there was another factor: the employers mis-entering the number of employees. </p> \n  <p>Jordan said this \u201ctemporarily obscured the size of a demand driven program\u201d but did not result in incorrect payments.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T02:45:47.392Z\">at 3.45am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edef0808f083999a26dcb7b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-09T02:15:22.707Z\">3.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cormann defends $60bn jobkeeper 'estimates variation'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The finance minister, <strong>Mathias Cormann</strong>, is before the Senate Covid-19 committee, explaining that the $60bn underspend in the jobkeeper program (from $130bn to $70bn) was an <strong>\u201cestimates</strong><strong> variation ... </strong><strong>not an accounting error as it has been falsely described by some\u201d</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Cormann explained the government was \u201cexpecting the worst\u201d and was \u201cprudently planning for the worst\u201d, but the variation was due to \u201csubstantially changed\u201d parameters \u2013 as the health outlook was much better than expected.</p> \n  <p>He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>It is a usual estimates variation in relation to a demand driven program.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The size [of the variation] is a function of the high degree of uncertainty, and the potential size of the program.

  "<p>Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Justine Landis-Hanley and it\u2019s Tuesday 9 June.</p> <h2>PM warns \u2018difficult decisions\u2019 looming</h2> <p>Prime minister Scott Morrison told a Coalition joint party room meeting today to prepare for \u201cdifficult decisions ahead\u201d as the government tries to salvage Australia\u2019s economy while staying on top of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told the room that the government could not afford to keep income supports in place indefinitely. This week, the government announced that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/government-free-childcare-doesnt-suit-the-coalitions-ideology-we-get-what-we-voted-for\">childcare sector</a> would<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/jun/08/coronavirus-australia-news-updates-covid-19-protests-morrison-travel-parliament-recession-nsw-qld-vic\"> lose the jobkeeper wage subsidy,</a> days after Morrison told reporters it was guaranteed until September.</p> <p>Frydenberg warned the next federal election would be a battle about the role of government, claiming the Labor party sees it as \u201ca limitless provider\u201d, while the Coalition sees it \u201cas an enabler\u201d.</p> <h2>Australia records three coronavirus cases</h2> <p>Australia has recorded only three new coronavirus cases overnight, two in NSW and one in the ACT.</p> <p>NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said the two cases in NSW were both from overseas, meaning \u201cthere were no extra or new community transmission cases overnight\u201d.</p> <p>A foreign diplomat, who was exempt from the 14-day quarantine, is only the second ACT coronavirus case in weeks.</p> <p>Australia has reported at least one new case every day since 29 February.</p> <h2>Government defends $60bn jobkeeper shortfall</h2> <p>Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy told the Covid-19 Senate committee today that he took full responsibility for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/22/jobkeeper-to-cost-60bn-less-than-originally-forecast-due-to-reporting-error\">overestimating the cost of jobkeeper by $60bn.</a></p> <p>The Treasury originally budgeted $130bn for the program that it now expects will only cost $70bn.</p> <p>Finance minister Mathias Cormann told the committee the underspend was an \u201cestimates variation \u2026 not an accounting error, as it has been falsely described by some\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important that we erred on the side of prudence, rather than put ourselves at the risk of a potential deteriorating situation, [in which case] we might have been forced to make an estimates variation in the other direction, which would not have been good for confidence,\u201d Cormann said.</p> <p>Also appearing before the Covid-19 Committee, ATO commissioner Chris Jordan said the ATO believed many more employees were covered by the scheme due to errors in employers\u2019 responses in their jobkeeper applications.</p> <h2>South Australia gives AFL green light \u2026</h2> <p>The South Australian government will allow the AFL to host 2,000 spectators in the general admission section at Adelaide Oval for this Saturday\u2019s \u201cshowdown\u201d between the Crows and Port Adelaide.</p> <p>Premier Steven Marshall said he believed it would be \u201cthe first time we have had a significant crowd at any sport in Australia for months and months and months\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2026 but refuses coming Black Lives Matter rally</h2> <p>Meanwhile, South Australia police commissioner Grant Stevens said police would not allow a second <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/06/australian-black-lives-matter-protests-tens-of-thousands-demand-end-to-indigenous-deaths-in-custody\">Black Lives Matter</a> rally in Adelaide to go ahead this weekend.</p> <p>Protestors were allowed to gather in Victoria Square last weekend.</p> <p>But Stevens said that \u201cin this current context, and acknowledging the sentiments of the community, to continually allow people to disregard the restrictions we have in place would make a mockery of the good efforts of everybody else who are doing their very best to abide by the restrictions\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>How to sign up to other Guardian Australia emails</strong></h2> <p>From next week, this email will be sent once a week \u2013 on Friday afternoon \u2013 instead of every weekday.</p> <p>If you want to stay up-to-date with all the latest Guardian Australia news, below is a selection of our other email newsletters.</p> <h2>Guardian Australia morning mail</h2> <p>Guardian Australia\u2019s morning mail is a daily wrap of what\u2019s happening, stories we love and the latest news, both from the Guardian and elsewhere around the web.

  "<p>Last November, as Siya Kolisi hoisted the World Cup into the Yokohama sky, it felt like rugby union had finally shaken itself free. An inspirational black captain, clad in a Springbok jersey, proving to the world his sport did not discriminate. For all those who believe in racial equality and yearn for a more enlightened, harmonious future it was an iconic image.</p> <p>And now? The sickening death of George Floyd, the subsequent global outrage and the increasingly stark evidence of white privilege has caused everyone to do a mental stocktake. How many of us have railed loudly enough against racism and deep-rooted injustice, as opposed to showing passive support from afar? In rugby union, as with most sports in this country, the word \u201cinclusive\u201d is far easier to write than to make happen.</p> <p>And how much value is there nowadays in well\u2011intentioned hand-wringing? Over the weekend it seemed more useful to consult the Wasps forward Simon McIntyre, among the longer-serving English-born black players in the Premiership. McIntyre does not want this to be about him but his personal testimony is important.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/07/britains-sporting-apartheid-must-end-says-sport-englands-chris-grant\">Britain's sporting 'apartheid' must end, says Sport England's Chris Grant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Growing up in Manchester, McIntyre was around 13 when he experienced his first overt racism, at a local rugby club. His Broughton Park team contained several black kids and not all their opposition were colour blind. \u201cOne day we were winning \u2013 which we did a lot \u2013 and me and my teammates were called \u2018cotton-pickers\u2019. I didn\u2019t really understand the connotations and remember going over to my dad to ask him.\u201d</p> <p>It was a seminal moment for both. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me then because he wanted me to carry on playing rugby but I could tell from his face it was something bad.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Ken McIntyre, an educational psychologist, had already felt the need to sit down his son and educate him about what may lie ahead. Recent events have brought such unsettling memories bubbling to the surface.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing up I remember my dad trying to have the conversation with me. He said people were going to treat me differently and I wouldn\u2019t really understand why at certain times. It\u2019s a hard message to have to give to your children. Over the past week, talking to friends, you realise there are stories you\u2019ve buried in the back of your mind because they\u2019re too raw and hurtful.\u201d</p> <p>There were other grim episodes during McIntyre\u2019s youth. In his mid-teens he had a coach who, whenever the player was in earshot, would tell a crass racist joke under the pretext of banter. When McIntyre finally asked him why, he was told it was to toughen him up.</p> <p>The prop has gone on to enjoy a successful professional career but he firmly believes he has done so in spite, not because, of the obstacles placed in front of him. \u201cThere definitely is a barrier. When you look around squads there are not many people who look like you. It\u2019s a question you ask yourself internally but you can\u2019t really seem to voice it. It\u2019s not the norm you being there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3d3096c008a272d9fb8445da64d6aea27fa6faa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3d3096c008a272d9fb8445da64d6aea27fa6faa/0_194_4954_2973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Siya Kolisi lifts the World Cup in Yokohama last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siya Kolisi lifts the World Cup in Yokohama last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Rose/World Rugby via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once those doubts surface, the effect can be corrosive. \u201cA lot of the overt racism I encountered was at lower\u2011club level but once I started to progress it was more subtle. There\u2019s a feeling that when you walk into a room you\u2019re having to change an opinion that has already been formed. That\u2019s not right. It\u2019s almost like impostor syndrome. You have to work harder in a lot of ways. I think that\u2019s the case for a lot of players. Judgments are made that aren\u2019t based on reality.\u201d</p> <p>Others within the rugby community feel similarly. The Dragons wing Ashton Hewitt has spoken movingly about being repeatedly stopped and searched by police for no other reason than the colour of his skin. The former Gloucester centre Eliota Fuimaono-Sapolu has recalled being openly told there was no way, even as the club\u2019s player of the year, he could earn more than international players from closer to home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a02f232e37c13be3ae7099c2f9812b39794ed97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a02f232e37c13be3ae7099c2f9812b39794ed97/0_0_3300_4839/682.jpg\" alt=\"Dragons wing Ashton Hewitt.\" width=\"682\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dragons wing Ashton Hewitt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Fairweather/Huw Evans/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even now, in 2020, there are too few homegrown black coaches and specialist backroom staff in top-level English rugby. McIntyre, 29, also still feels it is way easier for youngsters to find black role models in football, boxing and athletics. \u201cI do believe rugby is behind those sports in a lot of ways. I dare rugby to be bolder, to be more in the forefront of society and pushing these social agendas. We talk about rugby as an inclusive sport \u2013 and in many ways it is \u2013 but it can be pushed further.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/05/premiership-rugby-to-resume-season-on-15-august\">Premiership Rugby sets provisional date of 15 August to resume season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their first move should be to listen to the views of McIntyre and others such as him. \u201cI think questions need to start being asked. Are there obstacles to black players in this country? Is rugby still predominantly a middle\u2011class sport? A lot of people are wanting to change society for the better and make it more inclusive but until you start getting to the root of problems and looking internally I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s really going to change.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s something black players talk about but it\u2019s not an open conversation. There\u2019s still a fear or a stigma that by asking these questions you\u2019ll be seen as a troublemaker. It\u2019s something that\u2019s conditioned from an early age. You\u2019re told not to rock the boat. There\u2019s clearly a lot of ignorance out there but, hopefully, there\u2019s now a willingness to listen. I want the experience to change for young players coming through.\u201d</p> <p>If that comes to pass, McIntyre\u2019s brave and honest testimony will have helped to accelerate it. It is 25 years this month, coincidentally, since president Nelson Mandela, clad in a Springbok No 6 jersey, and Francois Pienaar were united in joy by South Africa\u2019s 1995 World Cup triumph. As with Kolisi, one iconic image should not obscure the evil still lurking in the shadows.</p>",
  "<p>The Sims is often held up as a shiny, romanticised example of the capitalist ideal: work hard, earn money, acquire stuff, and happiness will follow. The game is stranger and funnier than that in reality \u2013 browse Sims YouTube for half an hour and you\u2019ll quickly see that the stories players tell within this world are far weirder and more diverse than \u201cget money, get happy\u201d, often involving ghosts, thwarted dreams and scandalous pregnancies \u2013 but it\u2019s still very much Conspicuous Consumption: The Game.</p> <p>Last week, however, The Sims went explicitly eco-conscious with a new expansion pack, Eco Lifestyle, which lets you design Sims and neighbourhoods around sustainability and climate-conscious choices. Or sack all of that off and live in a filthy, smoggy nightmare town covered in trash. The Sims has never judged you.</p> <p>Eco Lifestyle adds features that The Sims\u2019 enormous Gen Z audience had long been asking for, such as septum piercings and boho fashions that would look great down the allotment \u2013 and loads that surely nobody was asking for, including candle-making and the attractive prospect of having sex in dumpsters, thus fulfilling every older pearl-clutcher\u2019s worst imaginings about the filthy eco-conscious young. How your Sims live affects how their neighbourhood develops, and they can vote on and participate in community initiatives that will eventually turn a run-down port town into a renewable energy-powered green oasis.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2ce9VSNsjE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q2ce9VSNsjE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cEvery neighbourhood has its own eco footprint that most interactions feed into,\u201d explains George Pigula, the game\u2019s producer at developer Maxis. \u201cYour neighbourhood could be on the industrial end with a bit more smog and pollution: this gives bonuses to power generation, fuel burning slower, and maybe a few more trash piles. Or you can go green and have your solar panels produce more power, your plants grow better ingredients, and you get to marvel at auroras overhead. Power and water utilities now have to be managed. You can continue to buy your power and water off of the grid, or you can generate it yourself. You will have to choose green options or fuel-burning options, and then live with the consequences of each.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d443806407b2ac43e1c35b90a407ec0284e8bc78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d443806407b2ac43e1c35b90a407ec0284e8bc78/0_0_1325_1765/751.jpg\" alt=\"George Pigula of Maxis, producer of The Sims: Eco Lifestyle.\" width=\"751\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Pigula of Maxis, producer of The Sims: Eco Lifestyle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EA/Maxis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pleasingly, these systems make Eco Lifestyle more than a superficial eco aesthetic featuring dungarees, kombucha and plenty of indoor plants. It doesn\u2019t overtly push the player towards any particular path of action, but it does lay out the relationship between how we live and how the environment responds, and offers some satisfying fantastical ways to live well \u2013 such as fabricator machines that can make rugs and furniture out of trash, or reclaiming old railway lines to make sky gardens. It can even free Sims from the need for money altogether, if you choose to go full freegan and found a neighbourhood where everyone shares, or pull discarded furniture out of the trash and fix it up. (In a cute touch, discarded furniture resembles old designs the very first Sims game.)</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t describe The Sims: Eco Lifestyle as overtly educational. It is a playful stage-setting themed around sustainable living, not a game with a message about what we\u2019re doing to the planet. \u201cReal-world climate change is an issue that the best minds are constantly working on. I don\u2019t think we will solve that here,\u201d agrees Pigula. \u201cBut we are allowing the player to play around with the concept of changing everyday habits that all feed into a larger system.\u201d</p> <p>In the real world, the climate crisis is of course about more than just individual action: it is about corporate and government engagement to change the way the world works. The video games industry is itself a significant contributor to global emissions. PCs and consoles are made of plastics and rare minerals that must be mined somewhere, not to mention the immense energy used by both players and development studios. A UN-backed initiative called Playing for the Planet has encouraged some (but not all) of the industry\u2019s biggest companies to sign up and work towards the idea of carbon-neutral game development and educating players about global heating. Electronic Arts, the company that owns The Sims\u2019 developer Maxis, was not among them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33721a2ac19a5703cd2dfedc829b26d69c010420\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33721a2ac19a5703cd2dfedc829b26d69c010420/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sims hard at work upcycling in the Eco Lifestyle expansion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sims hard at work upcycling in the Eco Lifestyle expansion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EA/Maxis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Sims: Eco Lifestyle does not reflect this bigger picture, focusing instead on the potential of&nbsp;individual action and choices. But it was, according to Pigula, inspired not just by players\u2019 demands but by the changes that the people making the game have found themselves making to their lives.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve upped my recycling game, insulated my house, and switched to a wooden comb. Solar options, water reduction, reusable bags, meatless Mondays and electric vehicles are hugely popular among the team members,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of the Sims is about taking a lens to everyday life and embellishing it towards joy. I will say, I don\u2019t think bills and recycling are fun in real life \u2013 but we have made them fun in Eco Lifestyle.\u201d</p>",

Graham told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a> last week: \u201cTo lay the blame at President Trump\u2019s feet for the division in this nation is a pretty short-sighted view of it.\u201d</p> <p>But a growing chorus of Republicans and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/james-mattis-comdemns-trump-george-floyd-protests\">military leaders</a> have condemned Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-mark-esper-opposes-trump-threat-deploy-military\">aggressive response</a> to the protests, which included a threat to deploy American soldiers on the streets and showed little intellectual or emotional grasp of centuries of racial injustice.</p> <p>Last week, Trump\u2019s former defence secretary, the retired general Jim Mattis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/james-mattis-comdemns-trump-george-floyd-protests\">spoke out against</a> what he called Trump\u2019s \u201cdeliberate\u201d efforts to divide the country.

People just cannot abide it. It\u2019s one thing to say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s rough around the edges but he gets things done,\u2019 but now he\u2019s failing in so many dimensions that people are no longer tolerant of it.\u201d</p> <p>Some Republicans fear that Trump\u2019s unpopularity, which led to defeat in the House of Representatives in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-midterm-elections-2018\">2018</a>, could cost them their Senate seats in November. Wilson added: \u201cHis political standing has collapsed so greatly that it\u2019s easier for these folks to not feel the same risk level. There\u2019s going to come a point very soon where having a nasty tweet from the president is a badge of honour and a tool of survival because my rule of \u2018everything Trump touches dies\u2019 is real.</p> <p>\u201cThe people that are trying to get away from it now, I think, are going to end up in a better position than they would have been prior to this. There are many more people that are going to put daylight between themselves and this president because he is political herpes. They don\u2019t want to be touched by it.\u201d</p> <p>There are reasons to be cautious, however. Trump has the backing of more Republican elected officials than he did in 2016, with many having learned to bite their lips and be grateful for his tax cuts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/donald-trump-judges-create-new-conservative-america-republicans\">conservative judges</a> and other policies.</p> <p>Those now criticising the president did not vote for him in 2016 either, and Romney pinned his colours to the mast when he was the sole Republican to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS-aFfJe20U\">vote for Trump\u2019s removal from office</a> after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-impeachment\">impeachment</a> trial. Moreover, attacks from party elders have sometimes been counterproductive, reinforcing Trump\u2019s image as a Washington outsider who will shake up the status quo.</p> <p>The president\u2019s base remains solid, and his \u201claw and order\u201d response to the protests is likely to harden it even further. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/poll-trump-loses-ground-key-2016-voters-n1226971\">NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll,</a> Biden stands at 49% and Trump at 42%, though among self-identified Republicans, the margin is 92% to 4% in favour of the president.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/politics/trump-base-analysis/index.html\">A CNN analysis noted that,</a> since 2000, no Republican ever had more than 91% of Republicans supporting him at this point in ABC News/ Washington Post polling. But Trump is faring worse at this point with independents and Democrats than any Republican over the same period. The base alone may not be enough to secure a second electoral college win.</p> <p>Despite a global pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">economic</a> slump and mass protests, Trump, who in April tweeted that Mutiny on the Bounty was one of his favourite films, has been quick to crush any signs of rebellion. Murkowski, Powell and Romney were all met with disparaging tweets, a clear warning to anyone else who might be tempted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/donald-trump-re-election-nixon-protests-strategy\">Trump reaches for Nixon playbook after protests that have rocked America</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.fordham.edu/info/24277/ma_in_elections_and_campaign_management_faculty/6866/monika_l_mcdermott\">Monika McDermott,</a> a political science professor at Fordham University, said: \u201cIn terms of officeholders, I think what\u2019s always held them back is fear of the retribution because he\u2019s shown with [retired senator] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/03/jeff-flake-trump-supporters-threats-interview\">Jeff Flake</a> and others that he will wreak havoc or vengeance on those who don\u2019t toe his line.

Yoshie Watanabe, a retired business executive, lives alone. News of the catastrophe takes him back to the end of the second world war. As a boy, Yoshie miraculously survived the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs, but has spent his life trying to escape his memories of the horror and the shame of his double <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibakusha\">hibakusha</a></em> status. Yoshie lost his closest family and was brought up by his aunt and uncle.

  "<h2>Top story: Education secretary expected to concede defeat</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with you to flip through the matters of greatest import.</p> \n<p>Plans to push ahead with reopening schools in England are in disarray after the government admitted not all primary school pupils will be able to return before the end of summer. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is expected to concede today that many primary pupils will not return until the new school year in autumn. Boris Johnson last month announced the opening of primary schools for reception, year one and year six from 1 June. Now, government sources acknowledge that with little more than six weeks remaining before schools close for summer, the practicalities are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/09/plans-to-reopen-english-primary-schools-before-summer-in-disarray\">too difficult for the planned return of all children</a>.</p> \n<p>Ministers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/08/uk-ministers-face-legal-challenge-for-refusal-to-order-ppe-inquiry\">facing a high court legal challenge</a> after they refused to order an urgent investigation into the&nbsp;shortages of personal protective equipment&nbsp;faced by NHS staff during the coronavirus pandemic. About 300 UK health workers have so far died of Covid-19, and many&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;staff groups and families claim inadequate PPE played a key role in exposing them.</p> \n<p>Scotland\u2019s strict lockdown regulations could be eased more quickly after Nicola Sturgeon, the first secretary, announced on Monday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/scotlands-lockdown-could-be-eased-soon-after-deaths-diminish\">no deaths had been recorded for two days running</a>. Sturgeon has been pressed to explain her&nbsp;much more cautious approach&nbsp;than the government in Westminster, or the Welsh and Northern Irish administrations. She is due to announce on Thursday 18 June how much more the lockdown might be eased.</p> \n<p>At&nbsp;Heathrow airport&nbsp;there has been some confusion as the first passengers subject to new quarantine restrictions&nbsp;landed. From Monday arrivals are being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/first-arrivals-under-uk-quarantine-rules-coronavirus\">required to self-isolate for 14 days</a>.

  "<p>I wore this LaQuan Smith Lycra bodysuit, all-black everything, when I opened for Chris Rock as part of his Total Blackout tour at the Barclays Arena in Brooklyn in December 2017. It was the biggest show I\u2019d ever done \u2013 I\u2019d never had 60,000 people come to see me before.&nbsp;</p> <p>I was in my zone. There was this feeling of: \u201cI\u2019ve been called for such a time as this; go slay this dragon.\u201d The outfit made me feel like a superhero. You know how Beyonc\u00e9 has Sasha Fierce? This made me feel like: \u201cYou want these jokes, I\u2019m about to give it to you.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>I had a photoshoot in the bathroom, where I was using the handlebars in the stall and pretending I was kicking down every barrier to my dreams and saying I\u2019m here to stay. When you\u2019re a child of immigrants, an immigrant black woman, your destiny is mapped out for you \u2013 the parameters of where you can go are already modelled. Me performing on a grand stage is not something my parents ever dreamed would be a part of their, or their child\u2019s, story.</p> <p>Just like Chris Rock picked me to share in his moment, I make a point to wear an outfit from an African designer in every frame of my new HBO special. And when me and Luvvie Ajayi do live shows for our podcast Jesus and Jollof, we make a point to have a piece of ankara and mix it with American style. It\u2019s saying: \u201cWe can mix a thing that connects us to our culture and also what the mainstream world would consider high fashion\u201d \u2013 until one day we will see that African styles are considered high fashion. Some brands that aren\u2019t by people of colour, or descendants from Africa, have made things out of African wax fabric that our tailor custom makes for us back in the village, but they are selling them for thousands of dollars, as opposed to giving others a platform to shine in their own right and profit.</p> <p>I\u2019m a tomboy by nature so I choose comfort over couture. I was raised with older brothers and I would wear oversized clothes. For me they were cool and I thought wearing their clothes would also make me cool. It didn\u2019t. But even now, as a thirtysomething woman, I love taking men\u2019s fashion and incorporating it into my wardrobe.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5bb5d4ef07c73726189a810e7b8aa0bc199057a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5bb5d4ef07c73726189a810e7b8aa0bc199057a/0_349_5477_3288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yvonne Orji (right) with Issa Rae in Insecure.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yvonne Orji (right) with Issa Rae in Insecure.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justina Mintz/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The way [my character] Molly dresses in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/07/insecure-review-hbo-issa-rae\">Insecure </a>is very different to how I dress.

It\u2019s power suits at work because Molly is trying to be a partner and advance in the high ranks of corporate culture.

  "<p>On 4 June 2020, as darkness enveloped Hong Kong, thousands of people broke through barricades and slipped into the tree-lined Victoria Park in the heart of the city. Shielding their candles from the wind, and carefully sitting 1 metre apart, they filled the length of the open space. The annual Tiananmen Square vigil had been banned, with police citing coronavirus concerns. But Hong Kong was determined to mark the anniversary as it always has. For three decades, the city has been the only place within China where the massacre can be publicly remembered. The commemoration is by far the world\u2019s largest, but also its most vulnerable. Its tiny flames speak to the endurance of hope and memory, and to their looming extinction.</p> <p>When the People\u2019s Liberation Army massacred hundreds of demonstrators in Beijing on 4 June 1989, the response in Hong Kong was overwhelming. One million or more residents marched in mourning. People from across society \u2013 clergymen, activists, Cantopop stars, businesspeople, foreign diplomats, even triad gangs \u2013 worked together to smuggle \u201cmost wanted\u201d student leaders off the mainland and to safety.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just horror and sympathy that Hong Kongers were feeling in 1989; it was foreboding. The British colony was due to be handed back to China eight years later, and in the days before the killings, as rumours of an impending crackdown spread, local activists had held signs warning \u201cToday China, tomorrow Hong Kong\u201d.</p> <p>By that point, the Chinese and the British had already made the handover agreement that would come into effect in 1997. Hong Kong would be allowed to maintain its autonomy and way of life for 50 years, until 2047, under the formulation known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d. It was a fudge, probably the best outcome achievable under the circumstances \u2013 a binding international treaty, but one that everyone knew was essentially unenforceable should China break its pledge.</p> <p>About 500,000 people left between the signing of the deal in 1984 and 1997. Prince Charles, who attended the handover ceremony, wrote after his departure: \u201cThus we left Hong Kong to her fate and the hope that Martin Lee, the leader of the Democrats, would not be arrested.\u201d</p> <p>Yet at the time of the handover, the fear in Hong Kong was matched by a certain excitement. One supporter of the current protests, Li, who is 71 and came to Hong Kong as a teenager from Guangdong, popped two bottles of champagne to celebrate: \u201cOne to say farewell to Britain, and one to welcome the People\u2019s Liberation Army to Hong Kong,\u201d he remembered. As a child, Li had witnessed the mass famine caused by the Great Leap Forward and the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, but now he felt hopeful. \u201cWe expected tomorrow to be better. We\u2019re Chinese people, not just Hong Kongers,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As the handover passed and life in Hong Kong appeared to be continuing pretty much as promised, sympathy for the mainland grew. China\u2019s years of double-digit growth brought economic rewards to the region and optimists hoped that its ongoing economic liberalisation would, over time, bring political change, too: the mainland might become more like Hong Kong. In 1997, one in five Hong Kongers identified as Chinese; 10 years later, one in three saw themselves that way.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The Tiananmen vigil has always been a barometer of anti-Beijing sentiment; the first, in 1990, attracted 150,000 people, while only 30,000 gathered in 2000. When the activist Bonnie Leung first attended as a student, a few years later, she was seen as \u201ca weirdo\u201d, she said. Every one of the friends she invited refused. But its relative unpopularity did not, to her, diminish its importance. Its very existence showed why Hong Kong was different: \u201cEven when we don\u2019t care, we always know.\u201d</p> <p>Every so often, Beijing would tighten its grip on Hong Kong, and attendance at the vigil would surge again \u2013 as in 2004, after a huge backlash killed off an attempt by the Hong Kong government to pass a national security bill that might have paved the way for peaceful critics of the Chinese Communist party to be jailed. Still, it seemed inevitable that the commemoration would gradually dwindle. Some wondered how long it would be before the vigils died away, and the memory of Tiananmen Square passed with them.</p> <p>But on 4 June 2019, 30 years after the massacre, 180,000 gathered in Victoria Park. It was the biggest turnout for years. The public had been galvanised by the threat of an extradition bill that would allow suspects to be taken to the mainland to face Communist party-controlled courts. If the bill became law, it seemed to spell the end for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy from China. Anger had spread well beyond the usual community of activists and intellectuals. Even then, few saw what was brewing. On 9 June, when 1 million people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/09/vast-protest-in-hong-kong-against-extradition-law-china\" title=\"\">marched</a> to demand that the law be scrapped, the organisers \u2013 who included Leung, now in her 30s \u2013 were as astonished as anyone. A few days after that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/16/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam-china\" title=\"\">another march</a> drew 2 million people: more than one in four of the population.</p> <p>In the months that followed, even as the movement grew more radical, support continued to rise. By this spring, 58% of residents backed the protesters. A city once seen as orderly and materialistic has discovered itself to be idealistic and angry. In the past year, police have arrested more than 8,000 protesters, including children as young as 11 and pensioners as old as 83. Demonstrators and police have fought pitched battles outside shopping malls, government offices, police stations and the international airport. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ca13c77dd931f1b43f27ac259df2e7972cb76f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ca13c77dd931f1b43f27ac259df2e7972cb76f9/0_0_5643_3762/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman shouts at police officers as they advance towards protesters in Hong Kong in July 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman shouts at police officers as they advance towards protesters in Hong Kong in July 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any choice but to fight. We have to try to do something,\u201d said 25-year-old Kelvin Chan, sitting alone near the waterfront of Victoria Harbour as dusk fell. It was a Sunday in early August, nine weeks into the protests. Chan, in a loose black T-shirt and a facemask that barely covered his face, did not look ready to fight, but said he was \u201cwaiting for the battle\u201d that would inevitably take place once the police arrived. Protesters nearby made a barricade outside the Intercontinental Hotel as curious guests watched from the stairs. Like many of his generation, Chan believed that soon he would no longer have the chance to attend protests like these. \u201cIn the future, 2047 or earlier, I think China will brainwash Hong Kong people. China wants to control Hong Kong,\u201d he said.</p> <p>That future is arriving more abruptly than anyone anticipated. Late on 21 May, China\u2019s national legislature announced plans to impose an anti-sedition law on Hong Kong, going even further than the bill shelved by the Hong Kong government 17 years ago and the subsequent extradition law. \u201cHong Kong as we know it is finally dead,\u201d said Claudia Mo, an opposition lawmaker and longtime pro-democracy campaigner. \u201cThis is the start of a new but sad chapter for Hong Kong.\u201d The new legislation will give the government the power to silence critics and dissidents through vague charges of subversion, and to install Chinese national security agencies in the city. The nature of the move is as alarming as its content: it sets a precedent of Beijing forcing unpopular legislation on Hong Kong, which under the terms of the handover was promised \u201ca high degree of autonomy\u201d. </p> <p>Days later, police announced that they were banning the Tiananmen vigil, citing Covid-19 measures. By then, the idea of a candlelit commemoration seemed to belong to another Hong Kong: to the restrained, almost genteel activism that endured for so long. But Tiananmen\u2019s legacy persists, even among young protesters who have grown dismissive of the vigil over the years. When unrest reached its height last autumn, with molotov cocktails arcing over roads and tear gas grenades bouncing off the tarmac, graffiti appeared on a wall in the centre: \u201cIs it our 4 June 1989 now?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Understanding the protests shaking Hong Kong requires delving back far beyond 1989. Hong Kong as we know it began to take shape in the years after the second world war. In just a decade, the population quadrupled to about 2.5 million, as former residents who had escaped the brutal wartime Japanese occupation returned, and mainland Chinese fled across the border to escape the civil war between the nationalists and communists, and after 1949, the beginning of Communist party rule.</p> <p>This was an exhausted, impoverished, crowded, hungry city. But it was also dynamic. Its inhabitants had experienced how bad things could get, and were intent on establishing a life for themselves. The new arrivals provided much of the cheap labour that powered the city\u2019s postwar manufacturing boom in the 50s and 60s, with the textile sector soon supplemented by clothing, plastic and electronics factories. This success, along with the city\u2019s heritage of trade and of the rule of law, and from 1978 onwards China\u2019s own economic liberalisation, would later make it a global financial centre.</p> <p>Until the prospect of the territory\u2019s return to China loomed, during a century and a half of colonial rule, Britain showed little interest in giving Hong Kong\u2019s citizens the power to elect their leaders. But to serve British interests, the administrators had introduced powerful institutions such as an independent judiciary. Thus Hong Kong had what the last governor, Chris Patten, described as \u201cliberty without democracy\u201d, enjoying free speech, free media and the right to protest, without the right to choose who ran the place.</p> <p>Under this system, protests became a crucial way to challenge British authorities, and later Beijing. In the 60s, major demonstrations, which developed into deadly riots in 1967, were brutally put down by police. But these events also pushed the colonial administration into tackling the needs of the local population: housing, labour rights, education. Aware of Hong Kong\u2019s anachronistic status in a post-colonial world, the British became highly conscious of the need to respond to public demands. Partly in response, protests tended to be targeted in their aims and cautious in means. After the handover, demonstrations would force authorities to abandon plans for a national security law in 2003, and the imposition of \u201cmoral and national education\u201d classes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/world/asia/thousands-protest-chinas-curriculum-plans-for-hong-kong-schools.html\" title=\"\">in 2012</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bff9529d92a789c69c526c26d2ada27c54a6e646\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bff9529d92a789c69c526c26d2ada27c54a6e646/0_0_2000_1270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2003 march to protest the Hong Kong government\u2019s anti-subversion bill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"635\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 2003 march to protest the Hong Kong government\u2019s anti-subversion bill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the most part, though, political activity remained a fairly marginal business, and the democratic movement was law-abiding, even sedate. It wasn\u2019t until the excitment of the 2008 Beijing Olympics faded that the mood clearly began to shift. Many protesters remember that year as a turning point in their views on the mainland. Many were shocked by the steady stream of reports on corruption and other abuses in China. They included the embezzling of donations sent by Hong Kongers to victims of the Sichuan earthquake and the Sanlu infant formula <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/24/china-executes-milk-scandal-pair\" title=\"\">scandal</a>, when officials suppressed warnings about tainted milk and 300,000 children fell ill as a result.</p> <p>Over the next few years, Hong Kongers were outraged by the moral and national education controversy, and protested against the extension of the mainland\u2019s high-speed train line, fearing it was another sign of how the mainland wanted to swallow up Hong Kong. They were also alarmed by Beijing\u2019s increasing authoritarianism and repression \u2013 particularly after Xi Jinping took power in 2012 \u2013 and the mainland\u2019s growing impact on the city. It began to become evident that the mainland\u2019s economic boom was not making it more like Hong Kong, as some had once thought inevitable. It was making Hong Kong more like the mainland.</p> <p>Alongside the political anxieties came economic frustrations. Hong Kong is one of the most unequal developed economies in the world. In a city full of designer stores and flashy restaurants, it is impossible to ignore the gap between the rich and the poor. A handful of ultra-rich families prosper while the very poorest dwell in tiny \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/29/hong-kong-coffin-homes-horror-my-week\" title=\"\">coffin homes</a>\u201d, less than 2 square metres in size. Even middle-class young people see no hope of moving out of cramped family apartments. Since 1997, about 1 million new residents have arrived from the mainland, without a corresponding increase in public spending, adding to the pressure on services and contributing to soaring property prices.</p> <p>Over the past decade, Max Chung, an activist from a residential area near the border with China, has seen his neighbourhood transformed by visitors from the mainland who come to Hong Kong on weekend shopping trips. \u201cYou can\u2019t even get a table at a restaurant,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to take back our normal lives. We don\u2019t want the Chinese suitcases to roll over our feet. We want to have normal food, not the expensive ones. We really want to take back what we used to have.\u201d</p> <p>There is undoubted snobbery, and at times outright bigotry, in the way that many in Hong Kong talk about mainlanders \u2013 casting them as uncouth, uncultured \u201clocusts\u201d straining services and taking over the town. But Hong Kong has also chafed at what it sees as the arrogance of the mainland: the belief that Mandarin should take precedence over Cantonese, and that Hong Kong should simply adapt to the expectations of new arrivals. \u201cThey think: I give you money, so I am the boss. So they can be rude. They can do anything they want,\u201d said Jay, a 21-year-old student \u2013 like many activists, he preferred not to give his name.</p> <p>The hollowness of liberty without democracy has become clear to all. Hong Kong\u2019s 3.8 million voters can choose district councillors to handle matters such as bus routes. But the city\u2019s chief executive is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/22/hong-kong-chief-executive-election-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">elected by</a> a committee of only 1,200, composed of representatives from business and other groups, as well as elected legislators. The system ensures that the successful candidate is Beijing\u2019s candidate. It has also traditionally given the wealthy a big say in choosing the leader, in a society where a tiny number of tycoon families already have disproportionate power, owning everything from supermarket chains and insurance firms to utility companies and housing.</p> <p>Beijing has now begun to accuse the same oligarchs it once relied upon of being greedy. It sees the protests, at root, as an economic problem, seized upon by \u201ctroublemakers\u201d and hostile foreign powers. But the tradeoff that the party has offered on the mainland \u2013 material security in place of political freedoms \u2013 does not attract Hong Kongers. People don\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting a decent economic deal, and they see political space as a right, not an optional extra. The grievances about their standard of living have morphed into deeply political sentiment.</p> <p>Over time, as discontent grew, so did the number of protests. In 2004, there were 1,975 protests in Hong Kong; by 2015 that had risen to 6,029. Tactics began to diversify. Attendance at the Tiananmen vigils began to rise. The friends who once snubbed Bonnie Leung now called her and asked if they could go together.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Despite the mounting frustrations of Hong Kongers, by early 2019, the pro-democracy movement looked to many as though it was in terminal decline. The last major protests, which took place in 2014, had ended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/01/hong-kong-protests-produce-no-real-winners\" title=\"\">in failure</a>, and since then the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms had accelerated. On 31 March 2019, the usual stalwarts \u2013 Martin Lee, pro-democracy politicians and Joshua Wong, the teenage face of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/-sp-hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-pro-democracy-protests\" title=\"\">2014 umbrella movement</a> \u2013 demonstrated against the extradition bill. The implications of the bill seemed obvious: if Hong Kong\u2019s residents could easily be extradited to face the party-controlled mainland legal system, did \u201ctwo systems\u201d really exist any more? It looked like a death blow to Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. Yet recent history had showed the severe costs of challenging Beijing. The crowd totalled just 12,000.</p> <p>To understand the movement that has taken shape over the past year, you need to understand its relationship with its predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/dec/11/hong-kong-protests-timeline-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the umbrella movement</a>. Those protests also centred on a demand for real universal suffrage, electrified the city and grabbed international attention. But they did not achieve their goals, and today many scorn the earlier movement as timid and unserious. \u201cAfter umbrella, I felt totally disappointed in Hong Kong people,\u201d said Jay, the student. \u201cI was there on 28 September 2014. I was shot by teargas and pepper spray. The next day people were singing songs like it was a carnival. So I think they\u2019re hopeless.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29004360d4d64179f875529e18a7c88a42cc44ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29004360d4d64179f875529e18a7c88a42cc44ec/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poster in Hong Kong after the end of the umbrella movement protests in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster in Hong Kong after the end of the umbrella movement protests in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Yip/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From 2014 onwards, Beijing did everything it could to crush the possibility of another umbrella movement. Members of the Democratic Legislative council were disqualified from the parliament. Independent bookshops disappeared, while five <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/31/a-chapter-closes-last-hong-kong-bookshop-selling-titles-banned-in-china-shuts\" title=\"\">booksellers</a> dealing in salacious titles about China\u2019s leaders were kidnapped and transported to the mainland. Hong Kong University rejected the highly regarded human-rights scholar Johannes Chan for a senior position after pro-Beijing newspapers waged a campaign against him, increasing concerns about pressure on academia. The umbrella movement leaders were jailed; the best-known, Wong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/14/joshua-wong-the-student-who-risked-the-wrath-of-beijing-its-about-turning-the-impossible-into-the-possible\" title=\"\">warned that</a> Beijing\u2019s encroachment had already diminished one country, two systems to \u201cone country, one-and-a-half\u201d.</p> <p>The defeat of the umbrella movement had looked to most like an end, not a beginning. In retrospect, it was the moment when many Hong Kongers started to believe that polite protest wouldn\u2019t work. For people like Jay, the umbrella movement has been a useful example of what not to do. Those protests demanded universal suffrage; this time round, they are primarily a stand against the erosion of rights. Those had charismatic leaders; these are leaderless and decentralised. Those were led by academics and students; these span classes, with construction workers and finance professionals joining forces. Those were committed to polite civil disobedience; these are more radical, and at times violent. Above all, the umbrella movement fractured quickly, while this time \u2013 despite all the government\u2019s efforts to split the movement \u2013 people have stayed unified.</p> <p>Yet when the mass protests began in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/jun/10/hong-kong-protests-in-pictures\" title=\"\">June </a>2019, they were peaceful. In mid-June, after police fired tear gas on protesters outside the seat of the government, the Legislative Complex, protesters formed what is known as the \u201cfive demands\u201d, which included the withdrawal of the bill and an independent inquiry into police brutality. On 15 June, Carrie Lam, the city\u2019s chief executive, announced she was suspending the legislation. But as many as 2 million people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/jun/16/hong-kong-streets-flooded-by-extradition-bill-protesters-in-pictures\" title=\"\">took to the streets</a> the following day.</p> <p>Though he is known as Hong Kong\u2019s father of democracy, Martin Lee was initially reluctant to join the demonstration. He thought it was time to negotiate: \u201cI would have liked the movement to stop,\u201d he admitted when we met last autumn at his wood-panelled chambers in central Hong Kong, where a bust of Winston Churchill stood on a shelf. In the end, he concluded he should march because the bill had been postponed rather than scrapped and might yet be revived. Lee embodies the city\u2019s tradition of courageous but pragmatic, cautious activism. But he, like so many in the city, found himself swept along by the tide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f6ac6da56ada6329aca6e9c2ef38707ef825341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f6ac6da56ada6329aca6e9c2ef38707ef825341/0_186_2784_1670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Lee in his Hong Kong chambers in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Lee in his Hong Kong chambers in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Davidson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others in the movement began to adopt more radical tactics, storming the legislative council on 1 July. Harsher police crackdowns spurred further protests as demonstrators escalated in response. Authorities refused permission for rallies and police violence intensified. Officers arrested bystanders for heckling them, drove vehicles directly at protesters and fired at journalists, in one case leaving a woman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/16/an-eye-for-an-eye-hong-kong-protests-get-figurehead-in-woman-injured-by-police\" title=\"\">blind in one eye</a>. Thugs were unleashed upon protesters and prominent activists, leaving them bloodied and beaten. In August, protesters paralysed the airport, forcing thousands of flights to be cancelled as police began to use live rounds. On 1 October, China\u2019s national day, a police officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/01/hong-kong-protester-shot-with-live-round-during-china-national-day-rally\" title=\"\">shot</a> a 21-year-old student in the chest, while across town, a middle-aged man arguing with protesters was set on fire. The government invoked the emergency regulations ordinance, awarding itself draconian powers. In November, universities were turned into fortified camps for protesters, leading to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/we-couldnt-hesitate-escaping-hong-kongs-university-siege\" title=\"\">12-day siege</a>. Hundreds have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/31/fresh-unrest-in-hong-kong-after-44-protesters-charged-with-rioting\" title=\"\">charged</a> with the vaguely defined offence of rioting, which can carry a 10-year prison sentence, and more than 1,000 children have been arrested.</p> <p>If the protests were initially motivated by fear about Hong Kong\u2019s future, as they continued, a new sense of identity and community formed. It was evident in the flashmob performances of the new \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/12/glory-to-hong-kong-pro-democracy-anthem-embraced-by-protesters\" title=\"\">anthem</a>\u201d, Glory to Hong Kong, held in the shopping malls that once seemed to epitomise the city\u2019s individualism and devotion to consumption. It was evident, too, in the networks that formed to provide mutual aid, from feeding activists to treating the injuries of protesters who were too afraid of arrest to go to hospital. (These networks would find new purpose when the coronavirus reached Hong Kong. While the government dithered, the people took action: tracking cases and warning of apparent hot spots; distributing masks to the poor and elderly.) </p> <p>The sheer inventiveness of protesters helped to maintain a movement that most expected to fizzle out within weeks. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/27/hong-kong-way-peaceful-protest\" title=\"\">Hong Kong Way</a>, a 30-mile human chain that stretched across the city in late August, revived the spirits of supporters. Other actions had a concrete effect. The landslide for pro-democracy candidates in November\u2019s local elections didn\u2019t just send a message to Beijing. District councillors are among the few allowed to vote for the chief executive \u2013 potentially giving pro-democrats a greater say in who replaces Lam. It was followed by a surge in the formation of pro-democracy trade unions. </p> <p>For Helen, a protester in her late 20s, the past year has redefined how she sees Hong Kong. \u201cWe valued economics over a lot of things before,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time around, you see that people care for freedom and rights over economics. We found out how much we loved this place.\u201d </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>While most protesters remained peaceful, a significant number started to adopt more extreme tactics, attacking Chinese state-owned businesses and companies seen to sympathise with the government. In a few cases, they assaulted locals sympathetic to Beijing. One man was killed by a stone thrown, seemingly by a protester, in a clash.</p> <p>Along the route of a march in September, someone had scrawled under a bus stop: \u201cToday Xinjiang, tomorrow Hong Kong.\u201d To outsiders, it might have seemed incredible to compare this still largely rural region of western China, which is kept under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/07/why-uighur-muslims-across-china-are-living-in-fear\" title=\"\">extraordinarily repressive</a> security, to this cosmopolitan global financial centre, still by far the freest part of China. Protesters saw Xinjiang as a warning: if they did not take a stand now, they would never be able to do so. People were fighting not to win, but because they knew what losing meant.</p> <p>Many young protesters speak of a willingness to die for the cause, writing wills and last messages for their families to find. \u201cThere is some part of me that has changed,\u201d says Niko Cheng, 22, a nursing student who volunteers as a medic. For months she has been prepared to be arrested, sacrificing her future. And at the height of the protests in the summer, she was ready to die if that would help to expose the brutality of the police. \u201cIf you have been to the frontline once, you feel that everyone surrounding you loves Hong Kong so much, and they are willing to do everything for it,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of them have already given up their future to be here. After that, you can\u2019t go back to being a normal person again. You can\u2019t just watch,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b7aeee85871e9a018a48a303bcb1c8a4cbb721d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7aeee85871e9a018a48a303bcb1c8a4cbb721d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cOne Nation, One Hong Kong\u201d graffiti left behind by protesters on a wall in Hong Kong - 24 May 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti left after a protest in Hong Kong last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Willie Siau/SOPA Images/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though there is no doubt that protesters have been violent, there is widespread suspicion in the movement \u2013 rightly or not \u2013 that undercover officers have acted as agents provocateurs. There is also fury that no police have been held responsible for outrages. Before the protests, just 6% of the population said it had no trust in the police; now, <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/11/09/surveys-show-majority-of-hong-kong-people-have-lost-trust-in-the-citys-police-force/\" title=\"\">more than half</a> report zero trust. The population is traumatised and exhausted. A study by the University of Hong Kong suggested that one in three adults <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/10/hong-kong-nearly-a-third-of-adults-report-ptsd-symptoms-study\" title=\"\">had symptoms</a> of post-traumatic stress disorder, comparable to rates in conflict zones. (This may underestimate the extent of the problem, since only those over 18 were surveyed, while many protesters are younger.) </p> <p>As support for the movement has intensified, so has opposition to it. A large chunk of the population, not only recent arrivals from the mainland, is equally passionate in rejecting the movement. Friends have fallen out. Parents have kicked out activist children. Helen, the protester whose view of Hong Kong has been transformed by the protests, hadn\u2019t spoken to her father for months, even though they live in the same small flat. He couldn\u2019t understand how irresponsible she was being. She couldn\u2019t understand how a man who had swum across the sea to escape Mao\u2019s China had become so loyal to Beijing.</p> <p>The rallying cry for Helen\u2019s generation has been \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\u201d. Now some have become supportive of the idea of full independence from the mainland, even if they believe it unrealisable. As people gathered late last month to protest Beijing\u2019s announcement of the national security law, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anger-still-there-hong-kong-defiant-one-year-anniversary-first-protests-china\" title=\"\">chanted a slogan</a> rarely heard before: \u201cHong Kong independence, the only way out!\u201d</p> <p>Activism in Hong Kong was always constrained by the understanding of how little was possible. Margaret Ng, a veteran democratic activist and former legislator, describes Hong Kong\u2019s struggle with Beijing as \u201cDavid and Goliath, without the sling\u201d. But the political space has shrunk so far that, for some, the end result is not caution but nihilism. An ideology of self-destruction known as lam chao, or \u201cIf we burn, you burn with us\u201d, has gained momentum. More radical demonstrators believe the collapse of Hong Kong is the only way to really bring change. \u201cWe are not afraid. If the Chinese army comes out, we will celebrate. The entire Hong Kong business environment will collapse. If they call the military here, it would ruin Hong Kong and also mainland China\u2019s economy,\u201d said Yan, 26.</p> <p>\u201cI have hope, but my hope is that we take China down with us,\u201d Helen said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Beijing has abandoned any pretence of winning hearts and minds. With the prospect of pro-democracy candidates making inroads in this September\u2019s elections for the legislative council, and the international cover afforded by the coronavirus pandemic, repression by authorities has dramatically intensified. Now they are doing through fear what they failed to do through persuasion.</p> <p>In the months before the new national security law was announced, Beijing replaced its envoy in Hong Kong with an enforcer lacking experience of the region but known for his hardline tactics. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office described protesters as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/china-calls-hong-kong-protesters-a-political-virus\" title=\"\">political virus</a>\u201d that required elimination. In April, 15 of the region\u2019s best-known pro-democracy figures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\" title=\"\">were arrested</a> on charges of illegal assembly. They included Margaret Ng, the media tycoon Jimmy Lai, Lee Cheuk-yan, a key vigil organiser \u2013 and Martin Lee, who had until now avoided the fate that Prince Charles had feared in 1997. \u201cI\u2019m relieved and very proud to finally be listed as a defendant after seeing so many brilliant young people arrested and charged,\u201d the 81-year-old told reporters.</p> <p>Even after these ominous moves, the news of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/hong-kong-what-are-the-implications-of-china-sedition-laws-national-security-beijing\" title=\"\">national security law</a> was shattering. \u201cIf the extradition bill was a rifle aimed at our rights, the national security legislation is a machine gun,\u201d Lai wrote. Johannes Chan, the legal scholar, said: \u201cHistory tells us the law will soon apply to all kinds of political dissidents, then it will apply to media, NGOs, the lawyers and basically anyone who criticises the government.\u201d That is how the mainland\u2019s laws are used. The Nobel peace prize laureate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/13/liu-xiaobo-nobel-laureate-chinese-political-prisoner-dies-61\" title=\"\">Liu Xiaobo</a> died while serving an 11-year sentence for incitement to subvert state power. His crime was a call for democratic reforms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"016fcb4be03fa24f6bdc7d26590064dcf6b6c0d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/016fcb4be03fa24f6bdc7d26590064dcf6b6c0d2/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam in June 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the announcement, downloads of VPNs soared, as did calls to immigration consultants. Some in Hong Kong always saw the movement as a last-ditch bid to stay in their home. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d one professional said when the anti-extradition bill first drove him to the streets in anger in July. But the spur for many protesters was the knowledge that they would not be able to do so. \u201cAcross classes, people in Hong Kong have completely lost trust in the PRC. They just give up hope entirely. If they cannot leave, what can they do? Many people are asking this question,\u201d says Ming Sing, an associate professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p> <p>Authorities insist there is nothing to fear, claiming that the new law will only target \u201ca narrow set of acts\u201d, and that the vast majority of Hong Kong residents will not be affected. Yet Carrie Lam has refused to rule out the law being applied retrospectively, and her statements seem designed to induce rather than allay people\u2019s fears: \u201cWe are a very free society, so for the time being, people have the freedom to say whatever they want to say\u201d, she told reporters in May.</p> <p>Some Hong Kong residents are genuinely anxious to put the unrest behind them as the city plunges deeper into recession. But many are also under intense pressure to demonstrate support for Beijing. Victor Li, the son of the billionaire tycoon Li Ka-shing, said he hoped that the legislation would help the city\u2019s society and economy return to normal. The heads of five of the city\u2019s universities also endorsed the law, along with hundreds of celebrities and artists. State media claim that 2.93 million residents have signed a petition backing the law, though protesters believe this figure is wildly implausible.</p> <p>With the law yet to be drafted, Hong Kong\u2019s protesters hope international pressure could still have some impact on its final form, and how it is implemented and enforced. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure even Beijing would have not preferred to exercise this nuclear option \u2026 we made Beijing pay the full price,\u201d the researcher and activist Lokman Tsui wrote in a Facebook post the morning after the announcement. \u201cTaiwan is watching. The United States is watching. Beijing is on notice, in front of the entire world. We have hope because we act. We take the hit, we get up and we live to fight another day.\u201d</p> <p>Beijing appears unfazed by US threats or international criticism. Even as the Chinese economy struggles to recover amid the pandemic, it no longer \u201cneeds\u201d Hong Kong as it once did. In 1997, Hong Kong\u2019s economy was equivalent to 20% of the mainland economy; now it is about 3%. Either Beijing has gambled that Trump won\u2019t follow through on threats to remove the region\u2019s special trade status, or \u2013 more likely \u2013 it has concluded that asserting its own power takes precedence. It, too, can take the hit.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>Though the fear in Hong Kong is palpable, resistance has not yet disappeared. This year has seen a marked shift to what political scientist Edmund Cheng calls \u201ceveryday resistance\u201d, such as trade unionisation and the \u201cyellow-ribbon economy\u201d, supporting only local businesses that back the protests. This is what opposition might look like in the long-term.</p> <p>The Tiananmen commemoration, too, is evolving. Despite the ban, thousands of Hong Kong residents descended on Victoria Park. Others held vigils throughout each of the city\u2019s districts. \u201cYou can seal the park but you can\u2019t seal people\u2019s hearts,\u201d said Han Dongfang, a labour rights activist who led protests in Beijing in 1989.</p> <p>For many, this year\u2019s commemoration was no longer just about those who died in Beijing, but Hong Kong\u2019s struggle. The usual slogans calling for the CPC to reckon with the massacre were drowned out by chants of the protest movement, as well newer slogans calling for independence: \u201cOne-nation Hong Kong\u201d. The crowd included the older generation and young activists, who now see the events of 1989 as a warning.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t do something now, maybe someday Hong Kong will become like June 4,\u201d said Zack Ho, 18, who attended a vigil near his home before rushing to join the main one in Victoria Park. \u201cWe saw how the tanks rode over students. That\u2019s the real picture of how evil the Chinese regime is. We have to remind Hong Kongers that maybe that\u2019s the future of Hong Kong.\u201d</p> <p>The massacre, and the vigils to commemorate it, planted the seeds for today\u2019s Hong Kong: the understanding of what is at stake, and the sacrifices that may be required to defend it. The CPC drew its own lessons from the events of that year \u2013 not just Tiananmen, but the collapse of the Soviet Union. It learned to avoid a bloody crackdown if you can help it \u2013 the costs are too high \u2013 but also to avoid concessions, and to hold on to political power at all costs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/08/chinas-memory-manipulators\">China\u2019s memory manipulators</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Will Hong Kong ever see another mass commemoration of 1989? \u201cI think it will be one of the things that they really want to get rid of,\u201d said Leung. \u201cIt is totally peaceful. We hold candles. We do nothing but mourn, and be the guardians of the truth. But the idea is so threatening to the Communist party.\u201d</p> <p>It echoed her earlier remark that Hong Kongers knew, even when they didn\u2019t care: not just about 1989, but about all the events that had followed in its wake \u2013 as mainlanders could not. The vigil stood not only for the city\u2019s freedoms of assembly and expression, but also of information. That knowledge gave them the choice to exercise their rights or not, and to imagine another future, however impossible it might be to realise. No one can doubt, now, that Hong Kong people care.

  "<p>A large unit within the NHS\u2019s blood and organ transplant division has been found to be \u201csystemically racist\u201d and \u201cpsychologically unsafe\u201d, according to an internal investigation into working conditions that was leaked to the Guardian.</p> <p>The report will raise renewed concern about discriminatory practices across the NHS, following allegations last week from the Royal College of Nursing that nurses routinely faced \u201cstructural racism\u201d.</p> <p>The investigation\u2019s conclusions were damning, finding that the atmosphere in the department was \u201ctoxic\u201d and \u201cdysfunctional\u201d. The study backed up claims from black, Asian and minority ethnic employees that for years they had been subject to discrimination in the awarding of jobs, amid numerous complaints that white candidates were given posts ahead of black applicants who were better qualified.</p> <p>BAME staff \u201ctolerate a significant amount of poor behaviour from management that would not be acceptable in other workplace environments. Being ignored, being viewed as ineligible for promotion and enduring low levels of empathy all seem to be normal. These behaviours have created an environment which is now psychologically unsafe and systemically racist,\u201d stated the report by Globis Mediation Group, which specialises in workplace relations. The independent investigation was commissioned in response to numerous complaints from BAME employees working within a division of NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT).</p> <p>The report found that \u201crecruitment is haphazard, based on race and class and whether a person\u2019s \u2018face fits\u2019.\u201d One employee told the report\u2019s author: \u201cA team leader said to me, \u2018I don\u2019t want a Muslim in my team.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>NHSBT employs about 5,000 people in 16 locations, working to encourage people to donate blood, organs and tissues, and handling donated material. This report focused on the experiences of 450 staff within one unit, the Colindale site in London, and in particular on the experiences of staff in the manufacturing unit (where plasma and platelets are processed), where out of 68 members of staff, 80% are BAME.</p> <p>However, the report noted that the Birmingham and Manchester NHSBT sites also have poor reputations for dealing with race-related incidents. The organisation acknowledged yesterday that internal equality surveys showed employees in different parts of the organisation had reported bias in recruitment and promotion.</p> <p>BAME staff told the report\u2019s author they had repeatedly been rejected for jobs they felt they should have got, with white candidates securing posts despite having less experience and qualifications. One BAME employee described being laughed at after applying for a promotion.</p> <p>\u201cIt was commented that BAME employees with the required skills to carry out a role do not perform well at interview and are not given the job. However, white employees who have less experience and skills are often promoted,\u201d the report noted.</p> <p>\u201cA number of BAME colleagues commented that when they say hello to line managers in manufacturing, they (the managers) do not respond although they reply to white colleagues. There was an ongoing theme about what I would describe as the incivility of managers and leaders. At least two BAME colleagues asked rhetorically \u2018are we slaves?\u2019\u201d the report stated.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very clear that there is great work being done ... The work saves lives and enhances the lives of many people. However, in relation \u2026 to the experiences of BAME employees, there is evidence of systemic racism,\u201d noted Clive Lewis, the chief executive of Globis Mediation Group, who wrote the report. \u201cThe recruitment problems at Colindale have led to deeply embedded feelings of anger and distrust amongst the BAME population.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association\u2019s ruling council, said: \u201cThis report highlights all too painfully the racial prejudices and discrimination we are seeing across healthcare. We must renew efforts to challenge these behaviours and bring an end to the enduring injustices faced by black people and BAME healthcare workers here in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The report\u2019s author was told of one Asian employee, with a degree and 15 years\u2019 experience, who applied for the same position as a white colleague. \u201cThe white colleague had no qualifications and very little experience, but still got the job,\u201d the investigation heard.</p> <p>A black colleague, with a biomedical degree and experience in management who was on the band 5 pay level, applied for a job at band level 6. \u201cA white female colleague who had no degree and was only at band 4 level with no management experience was not only given the job but was subtly told that she would get the job even before the interview stage.</p> <p>\u201cWithin two years she had been offered a manager position when two other black colleagues with experience and qualifications were pushed out from the department,\u201d one employee told the author of the report.</p> <p>Dame Donna Kinnair, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, who last week highlighted \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcquestiontime/status/1268664276039974914?lang=en\">structural racism</a>\u201d being faced by nurses in the NHS, said: \u201cA national institution with the status of the NHS can ill afford any suggestion of this kind. My profession, and all of healthcare, celebrates its diversity -&nbsp;race should never be a barrier to advancement. Where there are concerns, we will press for investigation and the highest possible standards.\u201d</p> <p>Employees with NHSBT raised the possibility that the chronic <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00074hj\">shortage of BAME blood donors</a> nationally and longstanding difficulties recruiting more donors may somehow be linked to insensitive management attitudes. A recent internal study into the issue found that some frontline staff showed \u201cinsufficient cultural sensitivity\u201d.</p> <p>Betsy Bassis, the chief executive of NHSBT who took over last year, said she had commissioned the report after listening to a large group of BAME colleagues talk about their experiences. \u201cIt was very difficult to hear their stories \u2013 of not feeling valued, of being passed over for promotions,\u201d she wrote in a letter to staff, appended to the report.</p> <p>She acknowledged <a href=\"https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/who-we-are/our-values/diversity-and-inclusion/improving-diversity-and-inclusion/\">that problems affected the organisation more widely</a>. \u201cWhilst this report focuses on a particular site, we know that these issues are evident in other parts of our organisation.&nbsp;I am truly sorry to anyone at NHSBT who has experienced bias, discrimination and or microaggressions.&nbsp;This is unacceptable.&nbsp;We have and will continue to take action until NHSBT is a truly diverse and inclusive organisation,\u201d she said.</p> <p>One long-term staff member said: \u201cThis organisation is killing us mentally. We have tried for years to work with the organisation to make things better, but time is up and we need change and action now. This is not limited to Colindale; the issues of institutional and systemic racism are across NHSBT.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, said: \u201cThis report sets out in stark detail racist behaviour that is shocking and inexcusable.</p> <p>\u201cSince Betsy Bassis took over at NHSBT she has been driven by a desire to work closely with all her colleagues to stamp out racism. This report is an important part of bringing about change.</p> <p>\u201cI love the NHS, and I will not tolerate racism in any part of the NHS - or anywhere else. We will back Betsy Bassis, Millie Banerjee and the NHSBT leadership to the hilt in the robust action they must now take to tackle racism wherever they find it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2020 to replace the erroneous word \u201csystematically\u201din headline and first paragraph with \u201csystemically\u201d, and to add a comment from Matt Hancock that was received after the initial publication deadline.</p>",
  "<p>From top to bottom, from big to small, from freelancer to staffer, from humble hall to grand auditorium, the world of classical music is facing its biggest crisis in living memory. Most musicians in the UK work freelance, even members of many big-name orchestras, so for them no gigs means no earnings. Some qualify for help for the self-employed, but many don\u2019t. Conservatoires \u2013 employers of musicians, producers of future talent \u2013 are facing a financial crisis as overseas students stay away. All the backroom people who usually keep the show on the road, from agents to publishers, are haemorrhaging money. Concert halls and opera houses cannot earn.</p> <p>In London, the Royal Albert Hall and the South Bank have warned of imminent catastrophe. The Royal Opera House can keep going \u201cfor a few months\u201d, says its chief executive, Alex Beard. But when your art form is \u201ca hundred people on stage, a hundred in the pit and 2,700 in the audience\u201d, when your financial model means you break even when you sell 95% of your tickets, when public subsidy accounts for only 20% of your income, rather than 80% as it would in Germany, it is obvious that you are going to hit the buffers. \u201cIn many ways all this is a purification, a chance to start again,\u201d says John Gilhooly, director of London\u2019s Wigmore Hall. \u201cBut there is huge anxiety and hardship. Orchestras could be going to the wall in the next 12 weeks.\u201d</p> <p>There is a deep contrast beginning to open up between the UK and much of continental Europe. For our neighbours, public investment in culture is much greater, and organisations are less reliant on box-office income, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">the Covid-19 crisis</a> is not an existential one, as it is in the UK.

Others, including John Summers, the outgoing managing director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/halle-orchestra\">the Hall\u00e9 in Manchester</a>, think differently. \u201cIt\u2019s time to batten down the hatches,\u201d he says. \u201cDoing concerts to small numbers of people can\u2019t do anything but lose you money.\u201d</p> <p>Martyn Brabbins, music director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/english-national-opera-eno\">English National Opera</a>, isn\u2019t alone in voicing an urgent need to get going as soon as possible. \u201cWe have a wonderful orchestra, chorus, lighting and tech team \u2013 everyone we need to make an amazing series of events,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be irresponsible and lazy not to be trying to do something.\u201d The company is planning a <a href=\"https://eno.org/news/eno-is-launching-eno-drive-live-a-series-of-live-opera-performances-that-audiences-can-safely-drive-to-and-stay-in-their-cars-for-the-experience/\">drive-through La Boh\u00e8me</a> at Alexandra Palace in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d51e7a59ad8415ea6a0b4c6d476dfe4513b6afad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51e7a59ad8415ea6a0b4c6d476dfe4513b6afad/38_145_3505_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A car park concert in Peckham \u2026 \u2018The idea that music of high stature has to be performed in buildings of high stature closes things down,\u2019 says Kate Romano.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A car park concert in Peckham \u2026 \u2018The idea that music of high stature has to be performed in buildings of high stature closes things down,\u2019 says Kate Romano.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ambra Vernuccio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is no consensus: but having houses only 20-30% full, as is being planned for socially distant performances in Europe, is economically impossible in the UK without a huge injection of government support. Beyond that bald fact are dozens of intricacies. What to do about the toilets? What to do about the bar? Will audiences pay full whack for a short concert? Will they come at all, particularly those who are older? What do you do if you tour to multiple venues, each with their own distinct insurance arrangements? And how would you travel? What do you do if you are based in Wales, but tour to England, where regulations are different? What do you do about evidence of the spread of the virus by aerosolisation? Spit, not to put too fine a point on it, is the inevitable byproduct of singing and brass.&nbsp;</p> <p>This crisis is largely hidden from the public. No great figures of the music world have spoken out publicly; the only remarks to have made the headlines have been Prince Charles\u2019s anguished mumblings, in an <a href=\"https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/exclusive-programmes-prince-of-wales/\">interview with Classic FM</a>, about the importance of the Royal Opera House. By contrast, figures in British theatre, who face many similar problems,&nbsp;have been much more adept at raising awareness. Many \u2013 directors Rufus Norris and Vicky Featherstone, producer Sonia Friedmann, playwright James Graham and more \u2013 have been writing articles and appearing on TV and radio for weeks.</p> <p>The classical music world in the UK is used to being on the defensive, each part conserving its own precious inheritance from the past. Theatre, however, is used to creating new narratives. \u201cWe\u2019ve been banging on about the crisis in classical music for ages,\u201d says clarinettist and producer <a href=\"http://kateromano.co.uk/we-need-to-talk-about-classical-music/\">Kate Romano</a>. \u201cThe drop in provision of GCSE music, the ageing audience. Now we\u2019ve really got a crisis, it\u2019s just not the one we thought we were going to have. Maybe it\u2019s <em>not</em> the pandemic that\u2019s the real crisis. It\u2019s underlying things in the way we operate. We could be looking for something better now \u2013 if we have the guts to talk about it.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec243a395d7cb2106de6bc95ebdd747cade8ebee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec243a395d7cb2106de6bc95ebdd747cade8ebee/0_0_4500_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Extravagant \u2026 John Luther Adams\u2019s In the Name of the Earth involved eight choirs and more than 600 singers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extravagant \u2026 John Luther Adams\u2019s In the Name of the Earth at the Proms involved eight choirs and more than 600 singers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Allan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The environment, for example, has become an urgent new focus of conversation, given how the deeply damaging airport-to-concert-to-airport lifestyle of classical\u2019s jetset has juddered to an emergency stop. \u201cThe days of all these orchestras going over the globe \u2013 this is unthinkable,\u201d said Rattle. John Summers of the Hall\u00e9 says touring \u2013 sticking 90 musicians and their instruments on a plane to somewhere that already has an orchestra of its own \u2013 is a form of \u201cvanity publishing\u201d.</p> <p>Of the LSO, McDowell says: \u201cWe might limit long haul to once a year. For Europe, a single long trip by train. It would be better for everyone\u2019s health and wellbeing.\u201d John Gilhooly, who runs the Wigmore Hall, says that instead of having a pianist like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/24/igor-levit-pianist-online-twitter-concerts-life-saving-lockdown-berlin\">Igor Levit</a> come to and from London several times a season to perform a series, he is thinking of inviting him for a single, concentrated period. Which seems blazingly obvious, once you think about it.</p> <p>Levit has been one of the musicians who has poured out his soul online, posting performances on his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/igorpianist?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter feed</a> during his lockdown in Berlin. Audiences have felt attracted to this candid kind of music-making, so intimate, so humanly and grittily imperfect. Stripped of the usual ritual around concerts, such performances have seemed to get closer to exposing the raw stuff of music itself than many a sleeker, more formal production.</p> <p>How to raise significant amounts of money in the online realm is an unanswered question, but many musicians and institutions are beginning to conquer an aversion to what is often seen as a secondary medium. Income from streaming services such as Spotify, though, is a bad joke. Violinist Tasmin Little recently told Radio 4 she has earned, from more than 5m streams, the princely sum of \u00a312.34.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bc0bfb30d93a16e31caf5fb3511bc275e3c1d7fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc0bfb30d93a16e31caf5fb3511bc275e3c1d7fe/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Well positioned \u2026 organisations such as Manchester Collective already perform in non-traditional spaces.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Well positioned \u2026 organisations such as Manchester Collective already perform in non-traditional spaces.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Frankowski</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting around 200,000 streams of our content a day,\u201d says David Burke, managing director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/london-philharmonic-orchestra\">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. \u201cOur income from this comes out at about \u00a330,000 a year. That would pay for rehearsals for a single broadcast.\u201d Composers and performers get stung because streaming services don\u2019t take into account the length of a track. From a two-minute song to an hour-long orchestral piece, the payment is the same.</p> <p>The immediate future for classical music may be radically local, with small groups of musicians bringing their art to communities outside of traditional concert halls. There is plenty of good, old-fashioned precedent here: Benjamin Britten in Aldeburgh, Suffolk; Peter Maxwell Davies in Orkney. This could be a wholly positive thing. \u201cThe idea that music of high stature has to be performed in buildings of high stature closes things down and prevents people from thinking about different ways of people hearing music,\u201d says Romano.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People who imagine we will come back the same are deluding themselves</p> <footer> <cite>Simon Rattle</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some organisations are already there, poised and ready, because such an approach is in their blood. <a href=\"https://manchestercollective.co.uk/\">Manchester Collective</a>, which often performs in non-traditional spaces, is contemplating a new project combining digital and live, adaptable to fluctuating health regulations. The BBC, too, will play an important role in the gradual recovery, bringing live music into audiences\u2019 homes before it is safe for people to congregate.</p> <p>Many in classical music foresee no return to the old ways. \u201cThe people who imagine we will come back the same are deluding themselves,\u201d Rattle said. The next weeks and months could be immensely painful but, with the right government support and the right intelligence, the way music finds and touches audiences could change for the better.</p> <p>\u201cThis big thing that we do is made up of so many small rules that have become normal,\u201d says Rakhi Singh, music director of Manchester Collective. \u201cBut nothing we humans do is normal, really. The sun rising in the morning is normal \u2013 but anything that human beings do can be changed.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

But it is significant, the reader said, because of Vidor\u2019s reputation.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/black-lives-matter-vidor/\">excerpt from the Texas Monthly magazine</a>, which covered the protest:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Vidor has been known for many things\u2014among them the activities of the local Ku Klux Klan; its status as a \u201csundown town,\u201d in which blacks were not allowed in city limits after dark; and an ugly fight in the early nineties over a federal effort to desegregate public housing in the city, which caused <em>Texas Monthly,</em> in <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/vidor-in-black-and-white/\">a cover story</a> that year, to describe Vidor as Texas\u2019s \u201cmost hate-filled town.\u201d The census <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/vidorcitytexas/PST120219\">estimates it</a> to be 91 percent white. </p> \n   <p>So when word started to circulate that a Black Lives Matter rally was being planned in Vidor, many people on social media thought it was a trap\u2014and expressed skepticism the event\u2019s supposed planner, 23-year-old Maddy Malone, even existed. (She <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/a-qa-with-the-organizer-of-the-black-lives-matter-march-in-vidor/\">does</a>.) To black folks with knowledge of the region, who had been told never to stop in Vidor, the idea seemed insane. \u201cA civil rights rally in Vidor\u201d is the punchline to a joke, not a thing that could happen in this world.

Yet annexation had continued into the modern era. Indonesia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/30/east-timor-indonesias-invasion-and-the-long-road-to-independence\">annexed East Timor</a> in 1975, Iraq briefly annexed Kuwait in 1990, Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Israel, too, has joined the club. In 1980, it annexed majority Palestinian East Jerusalem, and a year later, it annexed the Golan Heights, captured from Syria.</p> <p>In short, annexation is when a country declares that a piece of land outside its borders is part of the state. Often this is done after military occupation and whether the people living there want it or not. International law is <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24716&amp;LangID=E\">fairly clear</a> about annexation \u2013 it is illegal.</p> <h2>What precisely does Israel want to annex?</h2> <p>Netanyahu has made repeated promises during the past year to annex, or \u201capply sovereignty\u201d, to different areas of the West Bank, a chunk of land Israel captured from Jordan in 1967.</p> <p>In April last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/07/netanyahu-vows-to-annexe-jewish-settlements-in-occupied-west-bank\">Netanyahu said he planned to annex Jewish settlements</a>, outposts in the West Bank where hundreds of thousands of Israelis live, to global condemnation. In September, the Israeli leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/netanyahu-vows-annex-large-parts-occupied-west-bank-trump\">added he would also annex the Jordan Valley</a>, which makes up to one-third of the West Bank and borders Jordan.</p> <h2>Doesn\u2019t Israel already control that land?</h2> <p>Yes. Israel has run a military occupation for more than half a century that has created a situation in which <a href=\"https://www.nad.ps/en/media-room/press-releases/dr-saeb-erekat-ongoing-israeli-settlement-announcements-occupied-palestine\">Palestinian officials say</a> there is already de facto annexation.</p> <p>The country has deepened its grip over the land, squeezing many of the roughly 2.5 million West Bank Palestinians into urban enclaves. It has also established a robust civilian presence. Foreign tourists visiting Israel on bus trips to the Dead Sea drive right through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories\">Palestinian territories</a>&nbsp;without realising they have left the country. West Bank road signs often display Hebrew and frequently ignore Palestinian communities, pointing out Israeli settlements instead. Many factories, petrol stations and shops are Israeli-run.</p> <h2>So why now?</h2> <p>Ultranationalists in Israel see Trump\u2019s presidency as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to carry out measures that were long considered taboo in Washington.</p> <p>Going against decades of US foreign policy, Trump has slashed aid to Palestinians,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/10/palestinian-officials-washington-diplomatic-mission\">cut</a>&nbsp;diplomatic ties and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/donald-trump-us-jerusalem-israel-capital\">declared</a>&nbsp;the city of Jerusalem \u2013 part of which Palestinians claim \u2013 as Israel\u2019s capital.</p> <p>With Trump\u2019s White House tenancy potentially due to expire in a November election, much of the far-right in Israel believes now is the time for action.</p> <h2>Is it definitely going to happen?</h2> <p>Annexation was a key pledge made by Netanyahu during election campaigns over the past year. Under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/netanyahu-takes-office-in-deal-that-could-see-west-bank-annexation\">a unity government deal</a>, the Israeli leader has pushed to bring plans for annexation&nbsp;to the cabinet for discussion as soon as 1 July.</p> <p>However, weeks from that date Netanyahu has still not articulated exactly what he plans to do.</p> <p>Netanayhu\u2019s unofficial biographer, Anshel Pfeffer, believes the 70-year-old leader will never go ahead with annexation, which has already attracted considerable international opposition.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen because Netanyahu doesn\u2019t really want annexation. At least not now,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-there-will-be-lots-of-annexation-talk-from-netanyahu-but-no-action-1.8826440\">wrote</a>. \u201cNetanyahu had focused on the promise of annexation as a lever to bring out the right-wing base to the ballot box \u2026 But Netanyahu doesn\u2019t need it to win an election anymore.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18477d08aaf4429a5d151d3c1a7986cb435e31b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18477d08aaf4429a5d151d3c1a7986cb435e31b1/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest under coronavirus restrictions against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plan to annex parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in Tel Aviv, Israel 6 June 6 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators protest under coronavirus restrictions against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plan to annex parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in Tel Aviv, Israel 6 June 6 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amir Cohen/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What will the effect be if it does go ahead?</h2> <p>Jordan\u2019s king has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/netanyahu-takes-office-in-deal-that-could-see-west-bank-annexation\">hinted</a> that an Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement would be in jeopardy.

Many who still support the idea of a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d say annexation would be the killing blow, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/13/one-state-solution-gains-ground-as-palestinians-battle-for-equal-rights\">others argue</a> that ideal perished years ago.</p> <p>One significant change may be one of perception. Israel\u2019s half-century occupation of the West Bank has long been referred to as something that is temporary. That has allowed Israel to deflect thorny questions around why Israeli settlers in the West Bank have citizenship, while Palestinians do not.</p> <p>If Israel was to annex so much of the West Bank that it would effectively and permanently control the land and all the people in it, then questions around inequality under the law might be more difficult to answer.</p> <p>Benjamin Pogrund, a South African-born Israeli writer and former ally of Nelson Mandela, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benjaminpogrund\">long argued against the use of the term \u201capartheid\u201d</a> to describe Israel\u2019s treatment of West Bank Palestinians.</p> <p>But in an interview with the Times of Israel last week, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/annexation-will-mean-apartheid-warns-mandela-ally-who-always-fought-comparison/\">he said</a> annexation would change his assessment.</p> <p>\u201c[At] least it has been a military occupation. Now we are going to put other people under our control and not give them citizenship. That is apartheid. That is an exact mirror of what apartheid was [in South Africa].\u201d</p>",

But then Jones, who attended the Conservatorium high school that\u2019s situated in the gardens, herself became the central motif in a film that Kathy Drayton now describes as a meditation on her daughter\u2019s future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_05jxrb5pOU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_05jxrb5pOU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Filmed over six years, The Weather Diaries follows Jones from when she was a 15-year-old violinist struggling to find her identity within a conservative school, to when she releases her first album, Swallow Me Whole, and ends up touring with Sarah Blasko and Grimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In parallel to her daughter\u2019s story, Drayton shadows rescuers working with the megabats, and researchers who are subjecting the Parramatta red gum to the conditions of a 3C hotter climate (predicted by 2070). During the course of filming, temperatures reach 47C and the flying foxes start dying in droves. The final scenes, shot in December 2019, show the devastation of the bushfires.</p> <p>As one of the researchers, Mike Aspinwall, from the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, comments: \u201cChanges aren\u2019t likely to happen until people really start to hurt.\u201d But by the time people hurt, he concedes, it\u2019s too late.</p> <p>In turn, Drayton reflects on Aspinwall\u2019s data collection, as he weighs and measures our descent into disaster: \u201cPerhaps we\u2019ll be the first species to record its own extinction,\u201d she says in the voiceover. \u201cAnd that will be our most remarkable achievement.\u201d</p> <p>Drayton acknowledges that documentaries about the climate emergency are seen in the industry as ratings killers: to find an audience they need to offer grounds for optimism.
