  "<p>It is possible that the first foreign words I learned were Kalashnikov (better known as the AK-47) and Antonov. They signify what it means to be born in the midst of a war.</p> <p>The Kalashnikov is infamous across the world. The Antonov was Khartoum\u2019s deadliest weapon during the war with the country that is now known as South Sudan. The Sudan airforce turned the Russian-made plane into an \u201cangel\u201d of death, spitting fire from the skies. The plane would carry out indiscriminate aerial bombings that cut down trees, demolished buildings, and disfigured and killed people. From the children to the chickens, we became familiar with the cries of the Antonov.</p> <p>The chickens, my mother said, sounded the first alarm that danger was approaching. They became restless, clucking noisily, flapping their wings and running aimlessly. I knew then, mum stressed, it was time. \u201cI\u2019ll begin herding the children into the foxholes.\u201d Foxholes were deep holes in the ground to provide protection from the aerial bombings. The one we had in our compound was covered with wood and iron sheets for extra protection. But it was never a complete protection. If the bomb landed close to the foxhole, it would bury everyone in it alive. If it landed on top of it, that was it: \u201cThere was nothing left to bury.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/i-thought-i-was-coping-in-isolation-but-this-week-something-in-me-snapped\">I thought I was coping in isolation but this week something in me snapped | Brigid Delaney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was no warning, beside the chickens, of when the Antonov came. You lived with the frightening certainty that it would come but didn\u2019t know when or the destruction it would leave behind. That sense of uncertainty and unease is the essence of the experience of war and displacement. Most refugees of war-torn South Sudan woke up one day and found their lives changed forever. And over time, they watched the abnormal becoming normal: families torn apart and eventually becoming strangers; parents losing children too young to die, or watching them slowly and pitifully wither away in refugee camps; and gradually, after fleeing from one country to another, forgetting the feeling of home.</p> <p>Until recently, many people living here in Australia could not imagine how life can change so quickly. How life can go from normal to fighting over toilet paper.</p> <p>Now that we are faced with a world that has changed drastically in a short period of time \u2013 just like wars abruptly uproot lives \u2013 I wonder if people are comparing their somewhat more challenging, less comfortable circumstances with those whose lives are very much harder and more frightening. Perhaps, when faced with a level of pain, we are better able to value our privilege. It is also helpful to learn from others and from history. To know that, in comparison, ours is not the greatest suffering. That history repeats itself and far worse has happened. However, as individuals, we experience events immediately and personally. For people who have lost, and those who will lose, a loved one to the coronavirus, no amount of contextualising will make it easier to bear. It will be devastatingly personal. Mark Twain wrote that: \u201cNothing that grieves us can be called little: by the eternal laws of proportion a child\u2019s loss of a doll and a king\u2019s loss of a crown are events of the same size.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping in mind both the personal and the contextual during this pandemic can be beneficial, as experts sound the alarm about the emotional footprint this virus will leave behind. That speaks to the challenge still ahead and the work many, if not all, of us will have to undertake to find meaning and value while the normal things we relied on, like having a job and easy connection to family and friends, are no longer guaranteed. To balance the global and the personal requires acceptance of the fact that no matter our past suffering or current privilege, no one is exempt from the act of living life as it presents itself. We experience it, each of us, essentially on our own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/i-was-born-anxious-so-why-am-i-not-panicking-about-coronavirus\">I was born anxious, but I'm coping with coronavirus \u2013 here's why | Adrian Chiles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No matter how relatively privileged we undoubtedly are to be living in Australia, there is only so many times you can tell yourself \u201cI am so lucky\u201d before it is no longer a useful coping tool. It takes you far, just not all the way. So what I am suggesting is a pause. A pause to acknowledge that things have changed and that it hurts, sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. A pause long enough to allow you to gauge your ability to be resilient. That is, to allow time to look, without judgment, whether our well of resilience is running dry because, in my experience, resilience is a finite internal resource. Checking into oneself without judgment allows us to take a true account of how we\u2019re coping and if/how we need to replenish that well. To know when we need to call a friend, when we need to go for a walk, when we need to clear our mind, perhaps even when we need to cry.</p> <p>By paying attention to the world and the wider society, we can practise empathy, which is also a source of replenishment. We can practise kindness. We can look to the world, thankful for our relative good fortune, without discounting our personal journey through this global upheaval.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nyadol Nyuon is a lawyer at Arnold Bloch Leibler</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

involvement with multilateral institutions aligns with its national interests.</p> \n<p>It is believed that any identified shortcomings are likely to spark calls for reform to those bodies rather than wholesale disengagement.</p> \n<p>Herv\u00e9 Lemahieu, the director of the Asian Power and Diplomacy Program at the Lowy Institute, said the world had changed drastically since Morrison made his speech on \u201cnegative globalism\u201d and the forthcoming report need not be a scathing assessment of international institutions.</p> \n<p>Lemahieu said the impression he got from <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/speech-lowy-lecture-our-interest\">last year\u2019s speech</a> was that Australia \u201ccould cherrypick its way through the international rules-based system and

Australia should not go down the US route of scrapping funding to international agencies because this was \u201cshooting yourself in the foot\u201d and guaranteeing others \u2013 such as China \u2013 even more influence.</p> \n<p>He said it did not help that Australia\u2019s contributions to multilateral organisations, including the United Nations and its specialised organisations, had already decreased by about 25% since 2014-15.</p> \n<p>Australia should work with other middle powers to jointly bring money and reform ideas to the table \u201cand try to make a constructive pitch for the

  "<p>Can the world\u2019s greatest coral reef system be rescued from the rapid march of the climate crisis?</p> <p>With global temperatures already about 1C higher than pre-industrial levels, Queensland\u2019s Great Barrier Reef has been through three mass bleaching events in only five years.</p> <p>Corals are dying and the system is changing rapidly as temperatures keep going up and greenhouse gases keep accumulating in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the Australian government revealed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/brightening-clouds-and-coral-larvae-study-picks-best-great-barrier-reef-rescue-ideas\">$150m research and development program</a> to build the reef\u2019s resilience to future warming.</p> <p>Ken Anthony, a principal research scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like the Apollo 11 mission. It really is on that scale. We have to be able to look Australians in the eye in in 10 years\u2019 time and say that in the time we had, we did our best.\u201d</p> <p>On its own, the project \u2013 called the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program \u2013 is a clear signal that scientists now know cutting greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to sustain a vibrant reef.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/05/rescuing-the-great-barrier-reef-how-much-can-be-saved-and-how-can-we-do-it\">Rescuing the Great Barrier Reef: how much can be saved, and how can we do it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s time for intervention at a scale never seen before, scientists say, and they\u2019re in a race against time to find enough solutions before climate change bites even harder.</p> <p>Some 43 concepts are being backed under the plan, from futuristic cloud brightening to using concrete blocks to stabilise damaged reefs.</p> <p>The program has split the concepts into seven groups and scientists say none of them will be enough in isolation \u2013 it\u2019s more likely that a combination deployed at different scales will give the reef the best chance. These seven categories fall broadly into three approaches:</p> <ul> <li><p>Shading and cooling reefs to cut sunlight or lower ocean temperatures;</p></li> <li><p>Stabilising and rebuilding reef structures damaged from bleaching, cyclones or ocean acidification;</p></li> <li><p>Helping corals adapt to warmer temperatures and then moving their larvae around en masse.</p></li> </ul> <p>So what\u2019s being planned, and could these approaches really buy the reef enough time?</p> <h2>Shading and cooling the Great Barrier Reef</h2> <p>In early March, Daniel Harrison, a biological oceanographer at Southern Cross University, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/scientists-trial-cloud-brightening-equipment-to-shade-and-cool-great-barrier-reef\">led a trial of equipmen</a>t that sprays trillions of nano-sized salt crystals into the air.</p> <p>The idea is the salt crystals reach existing low-level clouds and, because of their tiny size, encourage the formation of smaller cloud droplets that reflect more sunlight than larger droplets.</p> <p>The process mirrors what happens over the oceans every day as winds carry salty ocean spray into the air to help form clouds.</p> <p>Harrison is leading a project to try to scale-up the trial to see if clouds over hundreds of kilometres could be brightened. If this was possible, the brightening effect could slightly lower ocean temperatures below \u2013 perhaps keeping corals just cool enough to prevent them from bleaching.</p> <p>Such a system could be turned on and off quickly, and could be deployed when weather forecasts and models show that corals are under dangerous levels of heat stress.</p> <p>Harrison, who is leading the cooling and shading efforts under the government program, says: \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of light and temperature that causes corals to bleach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cbfa02b48e4d7dcb1cfe0a25387800c45c04594\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cbfa02b48e4d7dcb1cfe0a25387800c45c04594/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scientists have carried out a trial of prototype cloud brightening equipment on the Great Barrier Reef\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scientists have carried out a trial of prototype cloud brightening equipment on the Great Barrier Reef.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Southern Cross University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are pursuing the things that are really big in scale, but also looking at small scale actions that could support outcomes on a local level at high value reef sites.\u201d</p> <p>Other methods under this \u201cshading and cooling\u201d category include machines to create artificial low-hanging sea fog that could provide shade over smaller areas. Researchers are also looking at ultra-thin reflective films that could temporarily cut the sunlight over small areas.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a race against time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can go really hard on emissions and meet or beat the Paris [climate] targets, then these interventions have the potential to help get the reef to a sustainable future \u2013 but only under that very aggressive emissions reduction scenario.\u201d</p> <h2>Stabilising damaged reefs with scaffolding</h2> <p>Anyone who has walked around an ancient Roman city will have seen restorers working behind steel props and scaffolding that hold up what\u2019s left of a once majestic temple or amphitheatre.</p> <p>Coral bleaching and cyclones can weaken the structure of reefs, known as the substrate. Scientists think that if reefs could be stabilised, it might give other methods a chance to take hold and restore individual reefs.</p> <p>There are question marks over the economics of deploying mesh or 3D printed frames at scale, but the restoration programs suggest there could be small-scale deployments that could help reefs recover.</p> <p>Removing natural rubble around reefs could also help create space for new corals to grow, and is another area under investigation.</p> <p>Modelling for the program found these approaches tended to only be cost effective if emissions in the future were very low. But they could still help at smaller scales.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8858c6376a1f5b30463493ece9d33644e0efddc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8858c6376a1f5b30463493ece9d33644e0efddc7/0_0_5253_3238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great Barrier Reef coral bleached in the most recent event\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Barrier Reef coral bleached in the most recent event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIA/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anthony says if temperatures stay below 2C \u201cthen there is so much we can do\u201d across all the approaches.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s both daunting to look at the challenge ahead, but also we know we have to come up with a plan,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cAt 3C the reef will look very different \u2013 it would be a sad story, but you still wouldn\u2019t give up.\u201d</p> <h2>Transporting corals and larvae</h2> <p>Prof Peter Harrison, at Southern Cross University, is a global expert on how coals reproduce and was among the first to discover their mass spawning on just a few nights of the year after full moons.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like an underwater snowstorm and billions of eggs and sperm get released,\u201d he says.</p> <p>One approach under development is to find ways to capture larvae during natural spawning and then move them in \u201cslicks\u201d and drop them in places that need help to recover.</p> <p>Harrison says there is always masses of excess coral larvae that would float away or be eaten and, before the impacts of climate change, \u201cit didn\u2019t matter if 99% [of the larvae] drifted away or got eaten fish, because there were so many of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause the production of larvae has been so dramatically impacted because of the mass bleaching, we are now looking to see how we could use what we know about coral reproduction and more effectively transfer them onto damaged reef systems.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/08/snow-white-coral-of-once-vibrant-great-barrier-reef-a-sign-urgent-action-must-be-taken\">Snow-white coral of once-vibrant Great Barrier Reef a sign urgent action must be taken | Adam Morton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harrison says methods being researched under the new program include scaling up floating ocean pools to transfer coral larvae, or eggs and sperm raised in aquaculture ponds, onto reefs.</p> <p>Corals get much of their colour and nutrients from the symbiotic relationship they have with special algae. Harrison says that some corals are more heat tolerant than others, and the same goes for the algae.</p> <p>Combining heat tolerant algae and heat tolerant corals, and then producing more heat tolerant larvae, could give reefs \u201cmore scope for growth under warming conditions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe think we can get an increased tolerance [of corals] of just a few degrees. Ultimately, unless the political leadership round the world enables a realistic approach to managing greenhouse gas emissions and bringing the rate of climate change under control, the system will become so overwhelmed we won\u2019t be able to use these corals.</p> <p>\u201cWe are buying time to help coral species to evolve and adapt and buy enough time to get some real action on climate change.

The nurse\u2019s husband has reportedly told how an ambulance crew refused to take her to hospital nine days before she died of coronavirus, after he took her there himself by car.</p> \n<p>Other Filipinos who have died include John Alagos, 23, who become the third UK nurse to die after caring for coronavirus patients and is believed to have become the youngest British medic to succumb to the virus.</p> \n<p>His mother, Gina Gustilo, has spoken of how her son fell ill at Watford general hospital after a 12-hour shift.</p> \n<p>Other victims included Oscar King Jr and Elbert Rico, two porters at Oxford\u2019s John Radcliffe hospital who died last weekend weekend. King Jr, who was described as a devoted father to his 10-year-old daughter, died on Saturday an hour after being brought to hospital after isolating at home with symptoms consistent with the virus. King Jr\u2019s wife, Twilight, has been recovering after she was also taken to hospital.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The partner of Leilani Medel, 41, a nurse in Bridgend, South Wales, who died on 10 April has also been treated after being brought to hospital with severe symptoms of the virus.

The married mother of one was described by colleagues as a woman who brought \u201clove, light and joy\u201d to everyone she met.</p> \n<p>Cruz, who trained in the Philippines and came to the UK several years ago, died on 14 April after being treated for coronavirus in the intensive care unit at Morriston hospital in Swansea.</p> \n<p>Elvira Bucu, an NHS care worker and mother of three whose husband was also infected, died on 3 April. Leilani Dayrit, a clinical nurse sister at the hospital of St Cross in Rugby, died of suspected Covid-19 on 7 April.</p> \n<p>Members of the community who were not healthcare workers include Arnel Ganias, a courtesy driver at Heathrow airport, and Romeo Castillo Jr, 34. Known to friends as \u201cRomy\u201d, he died after contracting Covid-19 on a work trip to Mauritius, which he had won as a reward for his good work.</p> \n<p>Antonio Lagdameo, the Philippine ambassador to the UK, said: \u201cWe are are deeply saddened by reports of Filipino staff at the NHS who are either infected by Covid-19 or have succumbed to the disease.

Vallance did not question the importance of finding a vaccine. But he did at least twice stress that finding one might take time. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>First of all, we\u2019ve got to get a vaccine. That isn\u2019t two days away, it\u2019s not two months away. Making a vaccine is a difficult, complicated process. It doesn\u2019t only have to work, it has to be safe, and of course for a disease like this it has to be very safe if you are going to use it right across the population. So there is a lot to do before we\u2019re in that position.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And later he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Just to put some realism on vaccine development, each single project does not have a high probability of success.</p> \n   <p>So although everyone goes out with great enthusiasm and we hope they work, it\u2019s never the case that you know you\u2019ve got a vaccine that\u2019s going to work. So that\u2019s the first thing that we need to be sure of. </p> \n   <p>The second thing is then the safety and it\u2019s incredibly important that these vaccines are tested properly, that\u2019s why it takes some time to get to the clinical trials and understand the potential unwanted effects of a vaccine.</p> \n   <p>And then only when that has been done can this be used widely across the population and so those are the stages we need to go through.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said that government advisers would decide on Tuesday next week whether to recommend a change of policy on face masks.</strong> At the moment the government does not advise members of the public to wear them. Vallance said this was in line with World Health Organisation recommendations. But Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said that people on public transport should be advised to wear them (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/17/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-last-three-weeks-dominic-raab-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9951c88f08ea7431f447ad#block-5e9951c88f08ea7431f447ad\"> 7.53am)</a> and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said he thinks a change in policy is inevitable.

It\u2019s not easy to really get a firm position on some of it, and there aren\u2019t really good trials of masks. We are looking at the evidence now. We\u2019ve looked at it this week twice. We\u2019re going to look at it again on Tuesday and hope to be able to make some advice around whether any changes are needed or not at the moment. We\u2019re entirely in line with the WHO recommendations. </p> \n   <p>The difference between this disease and others is the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic spread which adds an added complexity to where masks may or may not fit into this. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fab8e92f76afdfe1cbb866925115fdade568690d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fab8e92f76afdfe1cbb866925115fdade568690d/1625_342_1755_1053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alok Sharma (left) and Sir Patrick Vallance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alok Sharma (left) and Sir Patrick Vallance.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/Crown Copyright/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T17:20:10.455Z\">at 6.20pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e99e1128f08bade1f2954a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T17:02:27.775Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ec6f3359b26b67de0d9317e625d60f45618600b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ec6f3359b26b67de0d9317e625d60f45618600b/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People exercising and maintaining physical distance on Thames Walk, Erith, Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People exercising and maintaining physical distance on Thames Walk, Erith, Kent.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e99dc8e8f08bade1f295425\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T16:43:45.897Z\">5.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sharma</strong> ends by thanking people for the sacrifices they are making.</p> \n  <p>And he repeats the message about staying at home to protect the NHS.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s it.

Web searches have now fallen back to close to levels seen on average during 2019. This suggests new UC claimants will fall again next week.

When<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-workers-support-package\"> it was originally announced</a> it was open for a period of three months, until the end of May.</p> \n  <p>Now it will be extended for a month. In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-scheme-to-end-of-june\">a press notice</a> the Treasury said this decision was being announced in the light of the decision yesterday to extend the lockdown for at least three weeks. It will now be open until the end of June, \u201cproviding businesses with the certainty they need\u201d, the Treasury says.</p> \n  <p>In a statement Sunak said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve taken unprecedented action to support jobs and businesses through this period of uncertainty, including the UK-wide job retention scheme. With the extension of the coronavirus lockdown measures yesterday, it is the right decision to extend the furlough scheme for a month to the end of June to provide clarity.</p> \n   <p>It is vital for people\u2019s livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The scheme is due to formally open on Monday next week, although payments will be backdated to 1 March.</p> \n  <p>Even thought a one-month extension may not sound like something hugely significant, this amounts to an immense spending announcement, perhaps costing the Treasury \u00a310bn or more. That is because the scheme itself amounts to a colossal public spending commitment. The Resolution Foundation has estimated that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\"> it will cost the government between \u00a330bn and \u00a340bn every three months.</a></p> \n  <p>This is one reason why the Treasury is so keen for the lockdown not to last too long. At this price, ministers reportedly believe that keeping the scheme going through the summer and beyond would be simply unaffordable.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"371b3e51089071d9b822cc41a14fa7c753a040cd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/371b3e51089071d9b822cc41a14fa7c753a040cd/0_88_3196_1919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T14:57:31.358Z\">at 3.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e99c0dc8f08b7689b0305f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/carolinedavies\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T14:46:23.125Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The<strong> Duchess of Cornwall</strong> recorded a video message of support for the official opening of <strong>NHS Nightingale Hospital North West</strong> in Manchester. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ClarenceHouse/status/1251150212480897024\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today the new NHS Nightingale Hospital North West was opened in Manchester. <br><br>To mark the occasion, The Duchess of Cornwall sent a message of support from Birkhall, her home in Scotland. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHSNW?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NHSNW</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHSuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nhsuk</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PD3PP3JiGf\">pic.twitter.com/PD3PP3JiGf</a></p>\u2014 Clarence House (@ClarenceHouse) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClarenceHouse/status/1251150212480897024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 17, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p> Speaking from Birkhall, Prince Charles\u2019s home on the Balmoral estate, Camilla said the new field hospital was bringing \u201clight at a dark time\u201d.

It establishes clearly that the PM\u2019s colleagues were not being fully truthful about how ill he really was in the days before his admission to intensive care. Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>By the weekend it was becoming clear to the few in contact with him that the prime minister was struggling to do his job. On Saturday 4 April, Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 pregnant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/carrie-symonds-recovering-from-coronavirus\">and self-isolating</a> with coronavirus symptoms \u2013 grew agitated, friends said, crying down the phone. [Matt] Hancock claimed all was well, telling Sky News on Sunday morning the prime minister was \u201cworking away\u201d and had his \u201chand on the tiller\u201d.</p> \n   <p>In reality, Johnson\u2019s breathing had deteriorated. On Sunday afternoon the plan to admit Johnson to St Thomas\u2019 was rebooted. That evening he was driven across the Thames and taken to a private room on the 12th floor. Downing Street did not deny reports he was immediately given oxygen. Once again, his spokesman sought to downplay events, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">saying this was \u201ca precautionary step\u201d</a>. The consultant in charge of the prime minister\u2019s care was Dr Richard Leach, the clinical director of the hospital\u2019s pulmonary team and a leading lung expert.</p> \n   <p>The following day, Monday 6 April, things took an almost Soviet turn. While the prime minister was gasping for breath, aides insisted at a lunchtime press briefing that he was busy working his way through red boxes.</p> \n   <p>At 5pm the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, even claimed Johnson was in charge and \u201cleading\u201d. Asked when he had last spoken to him, however, Raab replied it had been Saturday.</p> \n   <p>It appeared the government was covering up, or incompetent, or both. (No 10 says when Raab spoke he was unaware of his boss\u2019s sudden decline.)</p> \n   <p>On Monday afternoon the prime minister\u2019s condition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">got significantly worse</a>. A decision was made to transfer him to one of St Thomas\u2019 two intensive care units. Johnson was put in a side room, on the east wing\u2019s first floor. The development stunned Downing Street.</p> \n   <p>At 8.10pm it announced the prime minister was in critical care, saying he had asked Raab to deputise for him. The fiction of Johnson being in command had ended. World leaders and politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/global-leaders-send-messages-of-support-to-boris-johnson\">sent him good wishes</a>. His aides were knocked over, distraught.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here is the full article, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lukeharding\">Luke Harding</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\">Rowena Mason</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh\">Dan Sabbagh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mattha-busby\">Mattha Busby</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deniscampbell\">Denis Campbell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/owenbowcott\">Owen Bowcott</a>.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/17/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-last-three-weeks-dominic-raab-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9982698f0895d83068fd07#block-5e9982698f0895d83068fd07\">11.19am.)</a></p> \n  <p>Hunt also said he thought the government should also involve councils in contact-tracing, the process that involves contacting people who have been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the reasons testing took too long to ramp up is because it was all done centrally by Public Health England. The health secretary today said that he hadn\u2019t decided whether it was going to be done centrally or with local government and I think one of the lessons we could reasonable draw from the slowness of ramping things up centrally is that this is something we should trust local government to help us with when we move out of the lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hunt said in South Korea 1,000 people were involved in contract tracing. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This could be tested out in places like Yorkshire or Cornwall because those are parts of the country which have got relatively few Covid cases - and so we could start seeing whether it was possible to lift the lockdown by replacing it with this testing and contact tracing.

  "<p>One of the many effects of the coronavirus in the UK has been to dramatically raise awareness of our food system \u2013 that is, the set of arrangements that determines how we shop and eat. Compared with education, health or housing, food is rarely thought of as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/tim-lang-interview-professor-of-food-policy-city-university-supply-chain-crisis\" title=\"\">an area of public policy</a> in which everyone has an interest. But it is. And one of the consequences of recent shortages, as well as the new and welcome emphasis on the \u201ckey\u201d roles performed by food industry workers including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/romanian-fruit-pickers-flown-uk-crisis-farming-sector-coronavirus\" title=\"\">fruit pickers</a> and supermarket employees, has been to open more people\u2019s eyes to this.</p> <p>It is too soon to predict with any confidence that the fragility of supply chains that has been revealed in recent weeks, as well as renewed warnings about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/08/human-impact-on-wildlife-to-blame-for-spread-of-viruses-says-study-aoe\" title=\"\">risks to humans from animal viruses</a>, and the light shone on the agricultural labour market, will lead to lasting changes. It is not too soon to assert that, among the many issues raised by the pandemic, questions about the future of food cannot be safely ignored.</p> <p>Already, because of Brexit and the climate crisis, food had risen from its previously lowly position on the political agenda. Leaked no-deal planning documents revealed warnings that fresh food supplies could be reduced, causing price rises (although details in the public domain are limited, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/12/defra-refuses-disclose-details-no-deal-brexit-food-supply-disruptions\" title=\"\">having refused to share them</a>). The regulations that will govern agricultural imports in any future trade deal with the US are highly contentious, with the opening up of a big European market to the US food industry \u2013 which has low standards compared with the EU \u2013 among America\u2019s chief aims.</p> <p>British consumers, as well as farmers who fear being undercut, are widely understood to be unenthusiastic about the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/10/chlorination-cheap-us-chicken-brexit\" title=\"\">chlorinated chicken</a> \u2013 and the American mega-farms that it symbolises. Antibiotics, steroid hormones and pesticides are all used more freely by farmers in the US. But in the UK, too, the number of industrial-sized pig and chicken farms (classified as holding more than 2,000 pigs or 40,000 birds) has recently gone up \u2013 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/industrial-sized-pig-and-chicken-farming-continuing-to-rise-in-uk\" title=\"\">7% since 2017</a>. Around 70% of all UK farm animals are farmed intensively in indoor units.</p> <p>This is because meat and dairy products produced in this way are cheap. At a time of widening inequality, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/food-bank-run-out-stock-before-coronavirus-lockdown-ends\" title=\"\">rising hunger</a> (along with the poor nutrition evidenced by obesity) among its most unjust manifestations, it is difficult to argue against the importance of affordability. But while anti-poverty measures must be among ministers\u2019 top priorities, both now and when the crisis eases, some means must also be found to balance the downward pressure on prices, with a more rounded assessment of what food is worth.</p> <p>Animal welfare considerations are one reason to do this. The risk of disease outbreaks in intensive farms is another. While the precise origins of Covid-19 remain uncertain, warnings about the risk of other outbreaks (avian flu, for example) must now be taken seriously. In rich western countries like the UK, there are also health reasons for most people to rebalance their diets away from animal products and towards plants (as the UK\u2019s school and hospital caterers recognised this week with a pledge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/school-and-hospital-caterers-vow-to-cut-meat-served-by-20\" title=\"\">reduce meat use by 20%</a>). Broader environmental considerations of land use and biodiversity, food security and resilience must also be part of the equation. British agriculture is skewed towards livestock and grain feed.</p> <p>Change will not be easy. Our food system is complicated, as is the global one of which it is part. Competing priorities \u2013 including price, animal welfare, carbon footprint and consumer preference \u2013 produce inevitable conflicts. But some beneficial effects could follow from our having been forced to take more notice. What we grow and eat are the result of political choices.</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global death toll exceeds 149,000</h2> <p>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, nearly 2.2 million people have been confirmed as having contracted the virus worldwide, while at least 149,024 have died.</p> <p>The figures, compiled from official releases and media reports, are likely to present an underestimation because of suspected underreporting and differing testing regimes around the world.</p> <h2>More than 14,000 have died in UK hospitals</h2> <p>The British government announced that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/17/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-last-three-weeks-dominic-raab-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e99aa648f08b7689b030455#block-5e99aa648f08b7689b030455\">further 847 people have died</a> in UK hospitals, taking the total to 14,576 since the outbreak began. That represents slightly decelerated growth. But the figures do not take into account the people who have died in other settings.</p> <h2>Nearly 100,000 EU citizens remain stranded</h2> <p>The European commission says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000?page=with:block-5e99c3e68f080ee110446dd9#block-5e99c3e68f080ee110446dd9\">98,900 EU citizens are still stuck abroad</a>, though efforts to bring them home continue. That compares with 600,000 who had reported being stranded at the start of the outbreak.</p> <p>The figures reveal the UK government has made sparing use of the EU programme to repatriate citizens, under which the bloc funds 75% of the cost of emergency flights.</p> <h2>South Asia cases reach 22,000</h2> <p>The number of people in the<strong> </strong>south-Asia region known to have been infected<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000?page=with:block-5e99a1a98f080ee110446b7d#block-5e99a1a98f080ee110446b7d\">passes the 22,000 mark</a>.

  "<p>Sometimes you\u2019re just asking the wrong question. On news programmes and at daily briefings, politicians across the world face versions of the same query again and again: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/uk-government-has-no-exit-plan-for-covid-19-lockdown-say-sources\">when will the lockdown end</a>? But that\u2019s the wrong question.</p> <p>Imagine a family has escaped a rampaging bear in the woods, seeking refuge in a log cabin. After sheltering there for days and weeks, they\u2019re desperate to know when they can come out. But they wouldn\u2019t simply be asking \u201cWhen?\u201d They would be asking \u201cWhen will it be <em>safe</em>?\u201d which is a different and tougher question, one whose answer would depend on several other questions: has the bear been tamed? If it hasn\u2019t, do we have the weapons to destroy it or at least protect ourselves against it? And are those protections strong enough that we won\u2019t have to rush back inside the cabin the moment we\u2019ve ventured out?</p> <p>We should be clear on one thing. Impatience to see an end to this mass, global quarantine is understandable. It\u2019s not just boredom or lack of stamina that prompts it. There are people struggling to put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/food-bank-run-out-stock-before-coronavirus-lockdown-ends\">food on the table</a>; there are people whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/16/psychiatric-hospital-coping-lockdown-mental-health\">mental health</a> is faltering; there are people for whom a day stuck at home is a day stuck with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/abusive-partner-lockdown-domestic-abuse-charities-women-home\">domestic abuser</a>. For them lockdown is a jail sentence and they need it to end. </p> <p>So of course it makes sense to long for an exit strategy. But it has to begin with an understanding of what lockdown is and what it is not. It\u2019s tempting to see it as a solution: everyone stays at home, we \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and then, slowly and gradually, we lift the restrictions and return to normal. But that\u2019s not how it is. Instead, lockdown is merely the crudest, bluntest instrument we could reach for when the coronavirus first struck. Its primary objective was to keep the number of people infected sufficiently low that the health service could cope. Judged by that standard, preventing, say, the NHS in Britain being overwhelmed, it has succeeded.</p> <p>But essential though it was and is, lockdown could only ever be a first step. It enjoys remarkable support \u2013 still backed by 91% of Britons, according to a <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coronavirus-updates-live-uk-pandemic-21856696?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sharebar\">YouGov poll</a> \u2013 but it was always going to be dropped the moment a better option became available. The ideal would be a vaccine, equivalent to removing the bear\u2019s claws and teeth, but that, we are warned, is 18 months away at best. So what\u2019s the other route out of hiding?</p> <p>Read the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21215494/coronavirus-plans-social-distancing-economy-recession-depression-unemployment\">expert </a><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21215494/coronavirus-plans-social-distancing-economy-recession-depression-unemployment\">plans</a>, and they all come back to one thing. Sure, social distancing will have to endure, in one form or other, but the key will be the one identified by the World Health Organization at the start: testing, testing, testing.</p> <p>And yet here, too, there is a misconception, and it is one of scale. So far, testing has been limited to those with symptoms and in hospital. But the Nobel laureate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmromer/status/1248712889705410560\">Paul Romer</a> \u2013 admittedly his prize was for economics rather than epidemiology \u2013 has got a lot of attention for a plan that argues that for the economy, and human life, to return to anything like normality, testing will need to be conducted for millions of people, all the time. He imagines health workers being tested at the start of a shift; the same would go for care workers, pharmacists, police officers and bus drivers. You might add teachers and restaurant workers. Romer wouldn\u2019t bother testing people who already have symptoms: they should be presumed positive and immediately self-isolate. It\u2019s the \u201casymptomatic spreaders\u201d you need to identify, stopping them in their tracks. The logic underpinning the plan is clear: there will be no point in reopening shops, pubs and restaurants if people feel too scared to visit them. As virologist Prof Nicolas Locker puts it, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/world/middleeast/coronavirus-antibody-test-uk.html\">\u201cYou can\u2019t lift the lockdown as long as you are not testing massively.\u201d</a></p> <p>Do the maths and the numbers are colossal: Romer estimates some 22m tests would be necessary every day in the US alone, the equivalent of testing every American once every two weeks. Consider that there\u2019s still no sign that Matt Hancock will reach his goal of 100,000 tests a day in the UK, and you realise how many orders of magnitude stand between where we are now and where we would need to be. </p> <p>The obstacles are huge and obvious, though Romer reckons he has answers for all of them. Shortage of swabs? Move to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmromer/status/1248718121311092736?s=20\">saliva tests instead</a>. Shortage of the key chemicals known as \u201creagents\u201d? The test kits that rely on them are not the only option. The sheer numbers of tests that would have to be produced? The world\u2019s manufacturers could do it; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmromer/status/1248716918925725699?s=20\">it just requires the political will</a>. Which, given that our lives depend on it, should be there.</p> <p>If that seems daunting, there is another approach. It would still require testing \u2013 though not on the same scale \u2013 followed by contact tracing: finding all those who\u2019d been in close proximity to someone who\u2019d tested positive and isolating them. \u201cTest, trace, isolate\u201d also has logic on its side, but it, too, takes lots of money and people. It\u2019s thought <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/10/contact-tracing-coronavirus-strategy/\">one contact-tracer is </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/10/contact-tracing-coronavirus-strategy/\"> required for every four cases of infection</a>.</p> <p>That means using the hiatus of lockdown to recruit and train people now in the mechanics of contact tracing. With no leadership from the top \u2013 on Thursday Donald Trump effectively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trump-coronavirus-reopening-us-economy-guidelines-governors\">announced</a> that the buck stops with the 50 states \u2013 the likes of Massachusetts are already assembling their own squads of contact-tracers. <a href=\"https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/sf-builds-contact-tracing-team-to-notify-people-of-exposure-to-coronavirus/\">San Francisco</a> is doing the same, deploying a combination of librarians and medical students. The UK government could follow their lead immediately, putting to work some of the thousands of people currently at home and itching to help. Tech can play a role, too: note this week\u2019s announcement that Apple and Google will join forces to see if they can produce the app that will make tracing easier and faster, though the threat to privacy of such <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/mass-electronic-surveillance-uk-app-lockdown-download\">surveillance</a> is obvious.</p> <p>What specific methods are deployed matter less than the bigger shift that is required, which is one of imagination. Governments need to realise that what\u2019s coming is not a decision about easing this or that rule of social distancing, but rather a massive political, industrial and collective drive unseen since the last war. It may well mean repurposing factories to mass-produce testing kits. At the very least, it should mean a dedicated cabinet minister for testing.</p> <p>This demands a huge shift by the UK government, which wasn\u2019t even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1250326413460140033\">testing people </a>coming out of hospital and going into social care until this week. But nothing less will be enough. It\u2019s not enough to flatten the curve; we have to get ahead of it. It\u2019s true that we cannot stay in lockdown for ever. But we cannot leave until it\u2019s safe \u2013 and that requires a monumental effort, starting right now.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

So what are they going to show?\u201d</p> <p>These fears are widespread, with popular soaps such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eastenders\">EastEnders</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/coronation-street\">Coronation Street</a> already cutting the number of episodes they screen to try to avoid running out of pre-filmed material.</p> <p>\u201cFor at least two years you\u2019re going to see less money on screen,\u201d said Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis, who predicted a severe shortage of scripted dramas. Actors and directors will have committed to filming multiple projects, he said, with schedules that now overlap.</p> <p>He also said that about 40% of the most popular 1,000 shows in the UK are episodes of soaps, which could soon fall off air unless production resumes: \u201cNeighbours is now on twice a week, which completely destroys the point of soaps.

They have to get on and process this stuff because livelihoods are at stake.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey said one way of speeding up the process would be for the government to underwrite 100% of the loans, which are interest-free for 12 months, but insisted this was a matter for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to decide.</p> <p>\u201cThe chancellor needs to make that decision because the public purse is at risk,\u201d Bailey said.</p> <p>Very small firms made up a high proportion of the loan applications and the question was whether the system would be unblocked if the Treasury took all the risk. UK Finance, the bank industry lobby group, said this week that 21% of the 28,460 formal CBILS applications had so far been approved. However, more than 300,000 firms have reportedly made informal inquiries <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-promises-to-guarantee-330bn-loans-to-business\">about seeking help from the scheme</a>, which is part of the government\u2019s wider business support package worth \u00a3330bn.</p> <p>Figures from the US suggest that American banks have been much quicker than those in the UK to provide loans to small companies to help them through the lockdown.

Bailey said that would depend on the level of business failures and whether the government\u2019s furlough scheme led to much higher unemployment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The International Monetary Fund said earlier this week that global financial stability could be put at risk by the deepest recession since the 1930s, but Bailey said the UK\u2019s financial system was robust enough to withstand the pressure.

  "<p>News that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, used Friday morning to announce a \u201c<a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/video/matt-hancock-lays-six-point-battle-plan-conquer-coronavirus-2153878/\">six-point battle plan</a>\u201d stirs memories of yore \u2013 Thursday afternoon \u2013 when the supply prime minister, Dominic Raab, announced his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/dominic-raab-s-five-tests-for-easing-the-lockdown\">five tests</a>\u201d. Indeed, those five tests themselves felt like the twitch of a phantom limb, redolent of the time Hancock announced his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">five pillars</a>\u201d. Five pillars \u2013 like Islam, or the lost Temple of Cybele in Rome, or a Floridian McMansion where the contractor went bust halfway through completing the portico.</p> <p>You don\u2019t hear a whole lot about Matt\u2019s five pillars these days, though the announcement of them did the job at the time. On Wednesday, Hancock drew attention away from the desperate shortage of PPE in care homes by re-announcing an NHS-style badge for those who work in care. Alas, in a development best described as ironicidal, the care badge website then swiftly ran into difficulties, leaving visitors greeted with the news that there was now a shortage of care badges. Until production is \u201cramped up\u201d, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that the chief success of the care badge was to form a psychic shield around the health secretary. It will, however, take more than a badge if he doesn\u2019t hit his 100,000 tests a day target for the end of April, having already <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/testing-for-coronavirus-covid-19-will-increase-to-25-000-a-day\">missed the 25,000-a-day</a> target for the middle of the month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-crisis-britain-young-people-future-bill\">When the coronavirus crisis is over, it should be payback time for the young | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Can you recall if the 100,000 tests was ever technically a pillar? It all feels beyond living memory. If you told me he had announced them sometime in the mid-Cretaceous period, staring soulfully into the camera even as a T-Rex pursued him, I\u2019d believe you. In fact, it was a fortnight ago.</p> <p>Still, don\u2019t take the above as an unfavourable review of the specific energy Hancock brings to the daily Downing Street press conferences. I personally respect the way he treats each one like the James Blunt <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofSnsGkops\">video for You\u2019re Beautiful</a>, delivering his painful truths right down the barrel. Just leaves it all on the stage. If you honestly can\u2019t hear another word of one of these things, I\u2019d recommend watching them with the sound down and Blunt whacked up to 11 \u2013 the pandemic equivalent of getting your test match footage from Sky but the commentary off the radio.</p> <p>Naturally, this type of artiste always divides the critics. Even so it was very disappointing recently to learn that one No 10 official had told the Sunday Times\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/inside-no-10-everyone-is-at-war-over-coronavirus-56rwtmf9q\">Tim Shipman</a>: \u201cThere is not much love for Matt Handjob here.\u201d Known to receive even less favourable notices from his officials is Raab, who gives the 5pm press conference with the air of a man who strongly suspects there\u2019s a chalk penis drawn on his back, but is just going to butch it out by facing forward till the bell goes.</p> <p>Talking of butching it out, the good news is that the government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/eu-and-uk-government-to-resume-post-brexit-talks-next-week\">going to refuse to extend</a> the Brexit transition period beyond the end of this year, even if the EU requests a delay, and against the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52304821\">urging of the International Monetary Fund</a>. I know the ultra-Brexiteers enjoy a good war metaphor, so let\u2019s just say that this out-of-the-pandemic-into-the-no-deal move threatens to give our nation a strong <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)\">USS Indianapolis </a>feel to it. By way of background, the Indianapolis was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese in 1945, in one of the worst naval attacks of the second world war. Those sailors who survived were left bobbing in the Pacific, where, over the next few days, they were subject to the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-worst-shark-attack-in-history-25715092/\">worst recorded shark attack</a> in history.</p> <p>Anyway, thus things rumble on while the prime minister remains off games. Boris Johnson is at Chequers, where his spokesman clarifies he is \u201cnot doing government work\u201d. A slightly strange styling, which makes some people assume Johnson is finishing his late-delivered Shakespeare book. I\u2019m sure nothing is further from the truth \u2013 not even Johnson himself, who has rarely been in the same hemisphere as the truth for his entire career.</p> <p>But there is clearly some trade-off as to how his stand-ins should handle this particular chit from matron. On the one hand, they keep stressing absolutely everything is proceeding in accordance with a plan laid out by the prime minister before he fell ill. On the other, they want to avoid going too far on that front, or risk casting the UK as the driverless car of governance, a largely automated enterprise where the role of prime minister is essentially meaningless. A bit like that of regimental goat, or England football captain. (The Italians, of course, just give the armband to the oldest guy on the pitch. Then again, the past couple of months have arguably shown that we don\u2019t care to learn anything much from the Italians.) </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000\">Coronavirus live news: China denies cover-up as Wuhan death toll revised up by 50%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the best thing that can be said at the moment is that at least we\u2019re not the United States.

Which is to say: no schools. All that time parent activists have spent trying to limit guns, it turned out that the smart way to do it was just to shut schools. Really makes you think.

That is worse than economists expected, with a Reuters poll having forecasted a contraction of -6.5%. </p> <p>But markets aren\u2019t fazed. Stocks in Asia shrugged off the news, with the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.7%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rising 3.1% and Australia\u2019s ASX up 1.8%. Europe is also called higher. </p> <p>Some investors seem more intrigued that American biotech firm Gilead may have found a potential drug to treat coronavirus. Others seem to be taking the view that the data could have been much, much worse. </p> <p>However, there is the age-old concern that the figures may not be telling the whole story, and many economists still question the reliability of China\u2019s data - especially when you drill down into indicators like retail sales, which were hammered after shops were ordered to close during the worst of the outbreak. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/1251021593356222464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#China</a> GDP declined 6.8% YoY in Q1 2020.

In this respect UK authorities are following established conservation practice.</p> <p>\u201cUK wildlife legislation is predicated upon the need to conserve and protect wild populations. Given that the peregrine population is currently buoyant, the taking of limited numbers will have no impact upon the wellbeing of that species in the wild.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The rumours began a week after Boris Johnson began self-isolating in the flat above No 11 Downing Street. The story, spread by the prime minister and his aides, had thus far been reassuring.</p> \n<p>Yes, he had Covid-19. But the symptoms were nothing to worry about. Mild even. And at a time when deaths from the pandemic were continuing to climb, Johnson had a firm grip on the crisis and the machinery of power.</p> \n<p>All of this changed on Thursday 2 April. At the lunchtime briefing for lobby correspondents, Downing Street <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/boris-johnson-shows-covid-19-symptoms-still-and-may-stay-in-isolation\">stuck to this soothing script</a>. The prime minister continued to have a temperature.</p> \n<p>But, subject to medical review, there was every prospect he would be able to emerge from isolation the next day, the press was assured. Seemingly, Johnson had shaken off the virus with the same alacrity as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-matt-hancock-sets-goal-of-100000-tests-per-day-by-end-of-april-video\">back </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-matt-hancock-sets-goal-of-100000-tests-per-day-by-end-of-april-video\">after a short interlude</a>.</p> \n<p>But that did not happen. Over the next five days the public were taken on an emotional rollercoaster; a prime minister who was apparently in good spirits and working hard, was then in an intensive care unit (ICU) and in real danger of \u201ctaking one for the team\u201d, as his father, Stanley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/10/boris-johnson-father-stanley-tells-relief-pm-leaves-intensive-care\">would put it</a>. A Guardian analysis of what was said in public suggests the relentlessly upbeat pronouncements from Downing Street were at odds with what was known in private.</p> \n<p>A lack of candour at a time of national crisis? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time ...</p> \n<p>Behind the scenes, colleagues were painting a more alarming picture of Johnson\u2019s health at the end of his first week of sickness. He did indeed have a fever. Left unmentioned, however, was his persistent cough: an unmistakeable splutter. During cabinet video conferences the prime minister\u2019s symptoms were painfully evident. They confirmed the growing seriousness of his condition. One source suggested the prime minister was coughing up blood. Not true, Downing Street said.</p> \n<p>Covid-19 can take different forms. Many people who catch it scarcely notice. Others grow critically ill. Those with even moderate symptoms can experience chest pains, headaches, cold spasms and extreme fatigue. The disease is novel. Clinical experts agree that the most dangerous phase is week two. Then patients generally start to recover. But some precipitously crash, as the virus attacks the lungs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

St Thomas\u2019 hospital \u2013 just across the Thames from Downing Street \u2013 began making preparations to admit the prime minister.</p> \n<p>According to one source, staff were told his condition was significantly worse than had been publicly admitted \u2013 really bad, in fact. And that he was likely to need oxygen support.</p> \n<p>Inside Downing Street, Johnson was in contact with his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, and his GP. Many of his usual advisers were themselves off sick, with Dominic Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/30/dominic-cummings-self-isolates-after-experiencing-coronavirus-symptoms\">at home </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/30/dominic-cummings-self-isolates-after-experiencing-coronavirus-symptoms\">self-isolating</a> and the director of communications, Lee Cain, away. As Johnson\u2019s condition steadily worsened, phone calls were cut down, government papers trimmed. His approach to his illness was characteristically upbeat: he would vanquish it.</p> \n<p>Stories of Johnson\u2019s decline were now circulating among Tory backbenchers and journalists. Downing Street insisted these whispers were wrong. In hindsight, this guidance seems misleading.</p> \n<p>The rumours were loosely right: the prime minister was seriously unwell, more than admitted. Perhaps Johnson was minimising how bad he was feeling, even to those in his inner circle? </p> \n<p>At 8pm that evening the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/pots-pans-passion-britons-clap-their-support-for-nhs-workers-again\">prime minister emerged on the steps of No 11</a>, to clap for NHS workers. He looked terrible.</p> \n<p>The next day, Friday 3 April, Johnson recorded a video in which he urged the public to stay at home during the forthcoming sunny weekend. He said he still had a temperature and was staying in isolation. It was day eight.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d6a01fe6-79ff-49a8-89ef-f39231b8bcc6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Q6jmZ7RLDw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In fact, Johnson was sinking in classic Covid-19 fashion.</p> \n<p>By the weekend it was becoming clear to the few in contact with him that the prime minister was struggling to do his job. On Saturday 4 April, Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 pregnant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/carrie-symonds-recovering-from-coronavirus\">and self-isolating</a> with coronavirus symptoms \u2013 grew agitated, friends said, crying down the phone. Hancock claimed all was well, telling Sky News on Sunday morning the prime minister was \u201cworking away\u201d and had his \u201chand on the tiller\u201d.</p> \n<p>In reality, Johnson\u2019s breathing had deteriorated. On Sunday afternoon the plan to admit Johnson to St Thomas\u2019 was rebooted. That evening he was driven across the Thames and taken to a private room on the 12th floor. Downing Street did not deny reports he was immediately given oxygen. Once again, his spokesman sought to downplay events, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">saying this was \u201ca precautionary step\u201d</a>. The consultant in charge of the prime minister\u2019s care was Dr Richard Leach, the clinical director of the hospital\u2019s pulmonary team and a leading lung expert.</p> \n<p>The following day, Monday 6 April, things took an almost Soviet turn. While the prime minister was gasping for breath, aides insisted at a lunchtime press briefing that he was busy working his way through red boxes.</p> \n<p>At 5pm the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, even claimed Johnson was in charge and \u201cleading\u201d. Asked when he had last spoken to him, however, Raab replied it had been Saturday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b11b0cb6-8ac7-43ab-b509-0911c14f49ad\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tbpphDSk9kw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It appeared the government was covering up, or incompetent, or both.

A decision was made to transfer him to one of St Thomas\u2019 two intensive care units. Johnson was put in a side room, on the east wing\u2019s first floor. The development stunned Downing Street.</p> \n<p>At 8.10pm it announced the prime minister was in critical care, saying he had asked Raab to deputise for him. The fiction of Johnson being in command had ended. World leaders and politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/global-leaders-send-messages-of-support-to-boris-johnson\">sent him good wishes</a>. His aides were knocked over, distraught.</p> \n<p>Typically, Covid-19 patients in ICU are put on ventilators. This is an invasive and traumatic process.

At no point was Johnson on a ventilator. Nor did he receive Cpap, a less invasive form of treatment.</p> \n<p>The source said: \u201cBefore the coronavirus crisis you could be in ICU without being on a ventilator but pretty much every bed is now taken by a coronavirus patient with a ventilator. I know people who work in ICU and I know the technicians who prepare all the equipment and they all say he was not put on a ventilator. He was taking up an ICU bed when he didn\u2019t need it. The idea that you would put a patient who didn\u2019t need a ventilator on an ICU bed is nonsense.\u201d</p> \n<p>Weighed against this was the fact that Johnson \u2013 who is 55 \u2013 fitted the pattern of other serious male cases. As a second source put it bluntly: \u201cThey have a very low threshold for people of his profile (over 50, fat).

The virus has now infected more than 2 million people globally and killed more than 140,000. China has reported 82,367 infections and 4,632 deaths across the country.</p> <p>As other countries struggle with the virus, Beijing has faced mounting criticism that it suppressed early information about the outbreak, allowing the virus to spread. On Thursday, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, hit back in a phone call with Vladimir Putin, after Donald Trump criticised China for not sharing data more quickly.</p> <p>Without referring directly to the White House, Xi said politicising the pandemic was \u201cdetrimental to international cooperation\u201d, according to state-run news agency Xinhua.

All of them received daily remdesivir doses.

  "<p>At Amazon, it\u2019s always \u201cday one\u201d. Founder Jeff Bezos coined the phrase in the company\u2019s early days, and it\u2019s now deeply woven into the firm\u2019s culture: it has appeared in every shareholder letter since 1997, and even adorns the building in which Bezos works. As tech reporter Alex Kantrowitz <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/607065/always-day-one-by-alex-kantrowitz/\">writes</a>, \u201cday one\u201d means \u201cinventing like a startup\u201d \u2013 a call for continual improvement and innovation. Dynamism is in; complacency is out. For Bezos, \u201cday two\u201d is another name for<a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2016-letter-to-shareholders\"> death</a>.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s not always wise to take corporate self-description at face value. Still, given the staggering speed and scale of Amazon\u2019s growth, it\u2019s reasonable to think that its \u201cday one\u201d mentality has had something to do with its success. Since it was founded in 1994, Amazon has become one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalisation of just over $1tn at time of writing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/15/amazon-jeff-bezos-gains-24bn-coronavirus-pandemic\">Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos grows fortune by $24bn amid coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the Covid-19 outbreak hasn\u2019t slowed Amazon down. Quite the opposite: even as other businesses have downsized or shuttered, Amazon has proved remarkably well-placed to capitalise on these new circumstances, with customers spending a reported $11,000 (\u00a38,845) a second on its products and services. As lockdown orders have trapped people indoors, many are turning to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/amazon-to-take-almost-50-percent-of-us-e-commerce-market-by-years-end.html\">home</a> deliveries via Amazon, bolstering the importance of a company that has already captured nearly 50% of the US e-commerce market. To keep up with increased customer demand, the company plans to<a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/operations/amazon-opening-100000-new-roles\"> hire</a> 100,000 new workers. Despite being a commercial entity, Amazon increasingly looks like a public utility. It has even partnered with the<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cornavirus-canada-amazon/canada-signs-agreement-with-amazon-canada-to-distribute-medical-equipment-idUSKBN21L2MO\"> Canadian</a> government to distribute medical equipment, and with the<a href=\"https://www.verdict.co.uk/coronavirus-home-test-delivery/\"> UK</a> government to deliver at-home testing kits. Indeed, it may be one of the few retailers to<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/10/21215953/amazon-fresh-walmart-grocery-delivery-coronavirus-retail-store-closures\"> emerge</a> from this pandemic stronger than before.</p> <p>But despite the outward success, Amazon\u2019s embrace of ceaseless invention has come at a cost. In the absence of a strong ethical code, the ruthlessness that makes Amazon so successful for its shareholders can become indistinguishable from cruelty toward those who are not counted in its success metrics. Amazon itself may be flourishing during the coronavirus pandemic, but not all Amazonians are benefiting equally.</p> <p>As customers turn to delivery services such as Amazon out of fear of contracting the virus, the risks appear to have merely been shifted on to workers. A warehouse worker in New York state organised a walkout last month to protest what he alleged were the company\u2019s inadequate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-safety\">safety</a> measures, including its lack of paid sick leave, and was fired; a leaked<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/amazon-chris-smalls-smart-articulate-leaked-memo\"> memo</a> indicated that Amazon\u2019s general counsel wanted to depict him as \u201cnot smart or articulate\u201d in their PR strategy (the executive who made this remark later published a statement that read \u201cI let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me\u201d).</p> <p>Amazon\u2019s poor treatment of its frontline workers \u2013 both during this crisis and beforehand \u2013 illustrates the dark side of the \u201cday one\u201d mentality. Amazon\u2019s constant push to improve productivity may serve shareholders, but it also results in working conditions so physically taxing that warehouses are stocking vending machines with <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/working-amazon-warehouse-fulfillment-center-emily-guendelsberger-on-the-clock-20190709.html\">pain medication</a>, in a tacit acknowledgement of the physical toll. For Amazon, collateral damage appears irrelevant as long as there\u2019s a steady flow of workers walking through the doors every morning.</p> <p>That Amazon is evidently not accountable to its workers should raise the question of who Amazon <em>is </em>accountable to. The more Bezos\u2019s empire <a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/coronavirus-is-speeding-up-the-amazonification-of-the-planet-21cb20d16372\">embeds</a> itself into the infrastructure of our lives, the more important it becomes to question its motives. In the midst of a crisis with an easily identifiable villain \u2013 the virus \u2013 Amazon has an opportunity to recast itself as corporate saviour for our times, the company that kept everyone stocked with necessary supplies, even when they couldn\u2019t leave their houses. As other services have slowed or ground to a halt, Prime deliveries are one of the few continuities from the world we\u2019re leaving behind. But make no mistake \u2013 Amazon is not merely a benevolent or charitable force, akin to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/220bf850-726c-11ea-ad98-044200cb277f\">Red Cross</a>. It is, after all, a commercial company, and its ownership structure is absurdly out of sync with the map of who\u2019s affected by it.</p> <p>Most technology companies reserve a large chunk of shares for founders, and Amazon is no exception. Bezos currently owns nearly 60 million shares, or 11% of the company, even <em>after </em>having<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/jeff-bezos-amazon-stock-net-worth-2/\"> liquidated</a> $12bn of shares (Bezos\u2019s ex-wife MacKenzie<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/28/tech/mackenzie-bezos-amazon-shares/index.html\"> holds</a> 4%, as part of their divorce agreement last year). Of the shares held by employees, ownership is heavily concentrated among early employees in executive roles. The workers most at risk during this pandemic are severely underrepresented: warehouse workers, who were<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/03/amazon-offsetting-pay-rise-by-removing-bonuses-union-says\"> previously</a> awarded approximately one share per year, saw their pay adjusted in 2018 to remove even that paltry grant.</p> <p>As this pandemic makes the world more dependent on Amazon, it\u2019s useful to remember who is actually doing the day-to-day work that keeps the company running. It\u2019s not Jeff Bezos making the deliveries or packing the boxes, after all. For that, we should thank the frontline workers, who are underpaid, overworked and often putting themselves at risk.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has essentially functioned as a stress test of our entire socioeconomic order, inadvertently shining a harsh light on all the ways people are being failed by this system. The result could be massive upheaval. In the US, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/04/09/ureal-unemployment-rate-jobless-claims-this-week/\">unemployment</a> rates are higher than they\u2019ve been in eight decades; millions of renters are skipping their<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/business/americans-rent-payment-trnd/index.html\"> rent</a> payments; policies that would have been considered anathema before the crisis are being seriously debated. The structure can be changed \u2013 indeed, once we emerge from this crisis, we may find that it will have already changed. Our political imaginations will need to be updated to reflect this new reality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000\">Coronavirus live news: China denies cover-up as Wuhan death toll revised up by 50%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The more Amazon effectively functions as a utility, the more we should be thinking about how to treat it that way.

Rather than an Amazon that sacrifices workers on the altar of shareholder value, we could have an Amazon that balances the needs of all relevant stakeholders.</p> <p>These suggestions might sound impossibly radical, not least because those currently in charge are unlikely to support measures to decrease their wealth and power. But maybe we can borrow a page from Amazon\u2019s book to frame this discussion in a new way. After all, there\u2019s something quite appealing in the idea of \u201cday one\u201d, with its connotations of disruption and reinvention. It\u2019s just a pity that Amazon has directed that energy exclusively towards maximising shareholder value.</p> <p>Imagine instead, if that \u201cday one\u201d spirit were directed toward the socioeconomic system that subordinated these workers in the first place, such that the fruits of their labour were shared more equitably.

By Monday afternoon, the shutters were coming down at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/17/universities-having-to-adapt-fast-to-the-coronavirus-crisis\">higher education institutions</a> across the country. Learning was suddenly a remote activity.</p> <p>Universities and drama schools are now closed for the rest of the academic year, with teaching and assessment having shifted online. It\u2019s a challenge for everyone, but especially for those subjects \u2013 like theatre \u2013 that usually rely on physical presence and contact. Just as theatres and artists are exploring ways to share their work digitally, teachers are suddenly forced to reimagine their courses for the online environment.</p> <p>Drama schools have a particularly tough task. As Lamda\u2019s director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/28/sarah-frankcom-to-leave-manchester-royal-exchange-for-london-drama-school-lamda\">Sarah Frankcom</a> stresses, it\u2019s important to recognise that some aspects of actor training need to happen in a live space. \u201cThere is no point us pretending that we could do everything online,\u201d she says, adding that the school has thought carefully about which elements of its teaching can be delivered digitally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"62bf40dc59caddb3c8bb14c790fe6069852b8460\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62bf40dc59caddb3c8bb14c790fe6069852b8460/990_0_2161_2700/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Frankcom.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Frankcom is Lamda\u2019s director.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Keenan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She is echoed by Edward Kemp, director of Rada, who says: \u201cWe know we won\u2019t be able to recreate an identical experience to face-to-face teaching.\u201d Similarly, Guildhall School has taken the decision to defer some teaching until the autumn, when they hope that they can return to face-to-face learning.</p> <p>Schools are trying to respond creatively to the pandemic. First-year acting students at Guildhall are devising a piece of online work about coronavirus with a professional theatre-maker, while the school is putting together a \u201cvirtual festival\u201d of workshops, masterclasses and projects for final-year students.</p> <p>One of the challenges is how to hold on to the collaborative and collegial aspects of theatre training while maintaining social distancing. Rada students are remaining in touch through a weekly newsletter where they can share ideas. Another solution is suggested by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, which has set up a digital platform called <a href=\"https://www.rcs.ac.uk/rcsathome/\">RCS at Home</a> to keep students and staff connected. The platform includes music, screenings, messages, advice and talks from researchers.</p> <p>A virtual scratch space has been created for Lamda students to share the creative work they\u2019re making, while the focus of much of the school\u2019s teaching has turned to individual development of voice and movement. Students record themselves completing physical or vocal exercises and share these with their teachers before receiving one-to-one feedback. \u201cThe teacher is coming in later in the process but with more specialised attention,\u201d explains Frankcom.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no point us pretending that we could do everything online</p> <footer> <cite>Sarah Frankcom</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One silver lining of this difficult situation is the solidarity and support emerging in a sector that\u2019s often forced to compete for students and resources. Across Google docs, Facebook groups and Zoom webinars, teachers of theatre from all over the world are sharing techniques and ideas, from movement exercises on TikTok to online improv games. As Frankcom and others emphasise, educators will need to collectively reflect, share and work together to get through this crisis.</p> <p>For students who are due to graduate this summer and whose final performances and showcases have been cancelled or postponed, the impact of the pandemic is devastating. Drama schools including Mountview and Guildford School of Acting have responded by creating online showcases for their graduating students, while final-term productions at Lamda and in many university drama departments have been reinvented as online projects.</p> <p>The theatre industry has also got creative, setting up various networks of remote support for students. Actors Olivia Beardsley and Isaac Stanmore have set up an <a href=\"https://showcase2020.co.uk/about\">online showcase platform</a> for graduating drama school students, while Twitter is full of offers of help, advice and publicity. Rather than cancelling, the annual <a href=\"https://www.nsdf.org.uk/\">National Student Drama Festival </a>moved rapidly online, offering more than 30 free workshops over Zoom and Facebook in the first week of April.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/404519272\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/404519272?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Actors Olivia Beardsley and Isaac Stanmore launch Showcase 2020 </figcaption> </figure>   <p>All this might just be a taste of what\u2019s to come. \u201cI\u2019ve got no idea what industry we\u2019re training them for now,\u201d says Frankcom, speculating that parts of the theatre-making process might continue to take place remotely for months or even years. It\u2019s important that students are fluent in digital creation. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a responsibility to get our students as confident and as playful and as creatively in tune as possible with the platforms they\u2019re now using,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She and Kemp stress the importance of supporting wellbeing and resiliencee. \u201cStaff and students are adapting to working in less than ideal situations, whether because of worries about family and friends, access to technology, or sharing living and working spaces,\u201d says Kemp.</p> <p>But there may be unexpected opportunities for the students who are training during this crisis. \u201cThey will be the first year that\u2019s straddled both worlds,\u201d Frankcom suggests. \u201cThey can be ahead of the curve.\u201d This situation also poses for drama students the same daunting yet creative question that theatre-makers everywhere are now facing: \u201cHow do you respond as an artist to living in an extraordinary time?\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The coronavirus outbreak has provoked a string of unsettling sights, such as the sudden widespread use of masks, shuttered businesses and deserted streets. Another unusual phenomenon is also playing out in the skies \u2013 near-empty airplanes flying through the air.</p> <p>Widespread travel restrictions around the world have slashed demand for air travel, with more than eight in 10 flights canceled. But there is a disparity in the US \u2013 while the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reported a 96% slump in passenger volume, to a level not seen since 1954, this hasn\u2019t been matched by the number of flights being scrapped.</p> <p>Slightly more than half the flights within the US have been canceled, leading to a slew of near-empty flights. Less than one in 10 seats on domestic flights were filled by passengers last week, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rutherdan/status/1248625740003696641?s=20\">according to an estimate</a> by Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation.</p> <p>\u201cThe evidence suggests that the number of people flying is dropping faster than the flights so there are a lot of empty planes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe airlines are left to figure this out for themselves and they are playing catch-up.\u201d</p> <p>This situation is leading to a \u201chuge environmental waste\u201d, Rutherford said, as planes burn huge amounts of fuel to transport just a handful of people around America.</p> <p>In March, Sheryl Pardo shared a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/solo-passenger-coronavirus-trnd/index.html\">video</a> of her being upgraded to first class and given a personalized safety briefing after being the only passenger to check in to an American Airlines flight from Washington to Boston.

The reduction in flights is expected to reduce pollution levels, with emissions from the sector dropping by almost a third last month, the Financial Times has reported.</p> <p>However, passenger numbers may well bounce back quickly following the end of the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>\u201cYou have dips around recessions but within two or three years it returns,\u201d said Rutherford. \u201cI imagine leisure travel will recover pretty quickly. In the boom years, airlines have eased off on attempts to improve fuel efficiency \u2013 what was going on was not sustainable. The million-dollar question is whether we will curb flying to protect the climate, as we are now doing to protect public health.\u201d</p> <p>The US airline industry got $25bn in assistance in the recent stimulus package to deal with the sharp downturn in business. In return, the airlines are required to maintain a certain level of service, which may be leading to the near-empty flights.</p> <p>The economics of running an airline can also be counterintuitive in that it can sometimes be cheaper to fly a commercial airliner to a planned destination than pay for a spot to simply park it.</p> <p>According to Airlines for America, an industry group, more than a third of the US fleet, about 2,400 aircraft, have been parked, with airlines burning through cash at more than $10bn a month as cancellations \u201cfar outpace\u201d new bookings. Planes have gone from \u201cload factors\u201d of 80% in January to just 11% in April.</p> <p>\u201cThe novel coronavirus pandemic has had, and continues to have, a severe and unprecedented impact on the US airline industry,\u201d a spokeswoman for the lobby group said, adding that flights are also shifting important cargo such as medical supplies, food and mail.</p> <p>Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said: \u201cThose that are flying today are doing so for important reasons.\u201d </p> <p>A spokesman for United said it was \u201cstill somewhat rare\u201d for a single passenger to be on a flight and said that the company had made investments in more sustainable fuel to lower its carbon footprint.</p> <p>The commitment of airlines in general to addressing the climate crisis has been questioned during the coronavirus shutdown, however. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/airlines-lobby-to-rewrite-carbon-deal-due-to-coronavirus?\">Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement</a> designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet.</p> <p>Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to \u201cdodge their obligations\u201d, but the industry said it was \u201ca matter of survival\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 April 2020 to replace the main image with one that was more relevant to the focus of the article.</p>",

It gives $119m a year in assessed contributions (membership dues) and $328m in donations, and is currently about <a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/finances-accountability/funding/AC_Status_Report_2020.pdf?ua=1\">$200m</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/finances-accountability/funding/AC_Status_Report_2020.pdf?ua=1\"> in arrears</a>. Whether the administration has the authority to cut off funds which have been mandated by Congress is in dispute, with the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, calling Trump\u2019s move \u201cillegal\u201d.</p> <p>A senior administration official said the Trump administration was within its rights to divert funds to other organisations in the same field. The official said the first tranche of $58m of US-assessed contributions for the year had already been paid, and the second tranche of $65m was not due until September. Meanwhile there would be a 60-day review conducted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), while other partners are sought through which to channel money earmarked for WHO donations.</p> <p>\u201cNow that money is on hold pending a policy review, so we can figure out where we can partner up with different organizations or contractors on the ground to spend it, and obviously use it for the purpose for which it was intended,\u201d the official said.</p> <p>A state department spokesman said: \u201cOur action in no way diminishes US leadership on global health matters, including the current Covid crisis. We have ample ability to provide aid ourselves or through other partners to fight the pandemic, and we will continue to do so.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the state department and the US agency for international development had committed nearly $508m in emergency health, humanitarian and economic assistance.</p> <p>The White House issued an account of a conference call between the leaders of the G7 industrialised democracies, claiming \u201cmuch of the conversation centered on the lack of transparency and chronic mismanagement of the pandemic by the WHO\u201d.</p> <p>That claim was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/g7-backing-for-who-leaves-trump-isolated-at-virtual-summit\">contradicted by accounts</a> from other G7 governments, expressing support for the organisation and urging international cooperation. Several have raised their WHO contributions. The UK offered an extra \u00a365m this week.</p> <p>US allies were taken by surprise by Trump\u2019s 14 April announcement on cutting WHO funding and were therefore unable to mount a concerted campaign to persuade him out of the decision, although the French president, Emmanuel Macron, made an attempt last week.</p> <p>\u201cMacron tried to call, but actually, the Americans \u2013 who originally told us that they were looking at the number of options for the WHO \u2013 quickly on Easter Monday decided that they would make this announcement about halting funding,\u201d the European diplomat said.</p> <p>\u201cSo to the best of my knowledge, nobody in the west had enough visibility to actually persuade them not to do it. But a number of us over the last few weeks have been saying: we know the WHO has problems, but we believe the priority is to tackle the pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>House Republicans on Thursday urged Trump to make continued US support for the WHO conditional on the resignation of its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has been widely criticised in the US for remarks praising China\u2019s handling of the pandemic. However, that is not the approach the White House has taken so far, aware that Tedros was elected by member states.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/world-health-organization-coronavirus-donald-trump\">Trump scapegoating of WHO obscures its key role in tackling pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of the options US officials have floated informally in recent days has been for the WHO to grant Taiwan observer status.

  "<p>The world\u2019s biggest trial of drugs to treat Covid-19 patients has been set up in the UK at unprecedented speed, and hopes to have some answers within weeks.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.recoverytrial.net/\">Recovery trial </a>has recruited over 5,000 patients in 165 NHS hospitals around the UK in a month, ahead of similar trials in the US and Europe, which have a few hundred.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is by far the largest trial in the world,\u201d said Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at Oxford University, who is leading it.

Politicians are also wading in. Donald Trump has backed hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic form of the old anti-malaria drug chloroquine.</p> \n<p>Used together with azithromycin, an antibiotic, it could be \u201cone of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u201d, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241367239900778501\">tweeted</a>. The French doctor Didier Raoult has claimed the combination is a cure, leading to public clamour for the drugs in France. President Macron visited Raoult\u2019s hospital in Marseille last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/macron-urges-on-trials-of-controversial-coronavirus-drug\">giving him tentative support but suggesting that trials were needed.</a> </p> \n<p>Both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being tested separately as part of the Recovery trial, and if there is any effect in patients given those drugs alone, compared with those given no drugs, they can be combined later.</p> \n<p>For now, said Horby, the data flying around in emails from enthusiasts and posted on social media about patients who have recovered after taking hydroxychloroquine proves nothing. He says there is no real evidence to support its use yet.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would say no,\u201d said Horby. \u201cThere is in-vitro evidence that it is inhibitory against the virus [in the lab]. But I haven\u2019t seen any sound clinical data.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a large number of publications. It\u2019s hard to keep up with them. Most of them are very disappointing. There was a paper that said it was a breakthrough \u2013 chloroquine works. But there was zero data in it. It seems to follow in that vein. They show a certain percentage of patients recovering, which would happen anyway.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The hype and pressure cause problems for serious researchers. \u201cThere is pushback from clinicians saying we should just use this because it clearly works and shouldn\u2019t use that because it clearly doesn\u2019t work. They are both wrong because neither of them know.\u201d</p> \n<p>The number of patients being enrolled on the Recovery trial across the UK tells a story of doctors who have faith in scientific evidence over hope alone. Ten per cent of Covid-19 patients in the UK are now taking part in the trial, and the researchers say the more people join, the sooner they will have answers.</p> \n<p>Also in the trial now are a combination of two antiretroviral drugs used in HIV treatment, lopinavir-ritonavir, known by the brand name Kaletra, and low-dose dexamethasone, a type of steroid used in a range of conditions, typically to reduce inflammation.</p> \n<p>The next one to be included, said Horby, is an interleukin 6 antagonist, one of the immunomodulator drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis and to treat cytokine storm \u2013 something that happens when the immune system goes into overdrive, as can happen in Covid-19. They are looking at tocilizumab.</p> \n<p>They are also in discussions about introducing convalescent plasma \u2013 blood from people who have recovered that contains antibodies against the virus. They want to trial remdesivir, but have not been able to obtain the stocks they need, because it is being tested in China and the US and because doctors are already prescribing it on compassionate use grounds.</p> \n<p>Repurposed drugs are first because they already have a proven safety record. But as experimental drugs come along, Recovery will include those. Patients are randomly allocated one of the drugs (or a placebo). There are already 500 to 900 patients on each of the drugs being tested and 2,000 in the control groups.</p> \n<p>The UK trial was set up with unprecedented speed. The team went to see the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, to gain his support and enrolled the first patient nine days later. The NHS and National Institute for Health Research are on board. They recruited 1,000 patients within the first two weeks.</p> \n<p>Martin Landray, professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, who co-leads the trial with Horby, says it\u2019s extraordinary and may change the landscape once the pandemic is over.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the things it tells you is what can happen when everybody is incentivised to make stuff happen as opposed to dither, delay or feelings that they will get into trouble if they say no,\u201d said Prof Landray, who has worked for 20 years on cardiovascular drug trials coordinated from Oxford. After this, he thinks, it will be hard to return to the snail\u2019s pace that has been the norm for setting up clinical trials in the UK, which can sometimes take years.</p> \n<p>The second extraordinary thing is that the clinical care of the patients and the scientific rigour involved in trialling the drugs are hand in hand in a way that doesn\u2019t normally happen, where the research might be going on in one corner of the hospital. \u201cFrontline clinicians don\u2019t know which treatments are best for patients apart from supportive care or ventilation,\u201d he said. That gives them massive motivation to get involved in the trial, which is central to the care of the patient.</p> \n<p>Horby says it\u2019s unlikely they will come up with a quick cure. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got anything like a magic bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have to temper people\u2019s expectations about these drugs. It\u2019s possible some might have an effect, but it\u2019s likely to be modest. I think what we\u2019ll be looking at in terms of making a significant impact will be moving on to combinations once we know of things that work. If we combine antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs, they might have a bigger impact.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Tell us: how have you been affected by the coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He holds out more hope for monoclonal antibodies, which worked in Ebola. \u201cIf you are saying this is an acute, serious viral infection, that\u2019s really difficult to treat, you can counter that with \u2026 well, look at Ebola.

  "<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t work on North Atlantic right whales and be a pessimist,\u201d Clay George tells me. He\u2019s a senior wildlife biologist and right whale specialist at Georgia\u2019s department of natural resources, and one of the only people in the south formally trained to disentangle a whale from fishing gear.</p> <p>Right whales are known to spend most of their time near the surface of the water, feeding and socializing. This behavior leaves them vulnerable to boat strikes and entanglement in fishing lines, almost exclusively the cause of their deaths.</p> <p>There are so few North Atlantic right whales left in the world\u2019s oceans \u2013 estimates hover around 400 \u2013 that many are known entities to the scientists who devote their careers to saving them. They often identify them by the patterns of callosity on their heads, raised tissue colored white by an infestation of cyamids, commonly known as \u201cwhale lice\u201d.</p> <p>I want to know if George feels any optimism at the slight uptick in calving in 2020, as 10 were seen in calving grounds this winter. There were <em>zero</em> calves recorded in 2018, and according to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, calving has been down 40% since 2010.</p> <p>\u201cPeople <em>always</em> focus on the calves,\u201d George says. \u201cBut what really matters is protecting the females of reproductive age. There are only 100 left, and at their current calving rates, they aren\u2019t replacing themselves, or the number of right whales killed each year by human activity.\u201d The females need to have an estimated 17-20 calves total each year to sustain the population.</p> <p>I mention Dragon, a 19-year-old female right whale spotted this year off the coast of Nantucket with a fishing buoy entangled in her mouth, dying. George pauses. \u201cI remember when she had her first calf,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s not a quick death,\u201d George adds. \u201cThey suffer out there, entangled and not able to feed. It\u2019s long and painful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"272d4845a7371a91928a30236cbaf3aa3e0b8024\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/272d4845a7371a91928a30236cbaf3aa3e0b8024/0_0_5315_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Atlantic right whale callosities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North Atlantic right whale callosities \u2013 which allow scientists to recognise individual whales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gilles Martin/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>George has watched whales struggle to survive horrendous ship strike injuries. He\u2019s seen fishing rope embedded in the whales\u2019 faces, cutting through bones, entire lips pulled off.</p> <p>One of his favorite whales is Ruffian, whom he first spotted with chunks of blubber missing after an entanglement. \u201cWe assumed he was a goner,\u201d George says. \u201cBut he came back the next season, scarred.\u201d Ruffian returned to Georgia waters another time, snow crab rope trailing behind him.</p> <p>\u201cEighty per cent of right whales have scars,\u201d George tells me. \u201cAnd 60% have been entangled twice. People would be shocked.\u201d</p> <h2>An intelligent, gentle giant</h2> <p>Right whales were once hunted to near-extinction by whalers. They were known as the \u201cright\u201d and easy whale to hunt \u2013 docile, slow-swimming and huge \u2013 52 feet long and sometimes weighing in just under 70 tons.</p> <p>Often referred to as the \u201curban whale\u201d, North Atlantic right whales spend most of their year feeding close to the shorelines of New England and Atlantic Canada. Each winter pregnant females and other members of the species migrate 1,000 miles south to Georgia and Florida, the species\u2019 only known calving grounds. Their coastal distribution places them in close proximity to large population centers, and all the human activities that go with that, from commercial fishing and shipping, to pollution and military training. </p> <p>No one really knows how long North Atlantic right whales can live, because human activity has affected their life spans so drastically. Experts presume they can live until 65 or 70, though some species of whale, like the bowhead, can live to 200. What we <em>do</em> know is that human activity has endangered this species and drastically shortened their lifespan to 35-40.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"95db188ea7617ac32c0b272ac09ba161cba90e34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95db188ea7617ac32c0b272ac09ba161cba90e34/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 9-year-old male right whale lies dead on a beach on Miscou Island in New Brunswick after being towed onto the shore the night before on June 7, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nine-year-old male right whale lies dead on a beach on Miscou Island in New Brunswick after being towed on to the shore the night before on 7 June 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Klima/Boston Globe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year\u2019s calving season of 10, while better than zero, is still not enough to sustain the species.

Make that a calving season of nine \u2013 less than half of what the right whales need to replenish themselves.</p> <p>Why is it so hard to save this intelligent, gentle giant \u2013 one so critical to the health of our planet? (Whale excrement fertilizes phytoplankton that produce a significant amount of oxygen on Earth.)</p> <p>\u201cA species that most people have never seen is harder to convince others to save,\u201d says Dr Erica Fuller, a veterinarian and a lawyer with Conservation Law Foundation in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cIf you saw one, you\u2019d be struck by how majestic they are.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Deadly entanglement</strong></h2> <p>The whales are at risk any time fishing rope is left unattended in their habitat. But ropes used on offshore gillnets, lobster pots, snow crab pots and other so-called \u201cfixed gear\u201d fisheries are particularly problematic. These synthetic ropes can be set for weeks or months at a time, and require thousands of pounds of force to break loose from.</p> <p>\u201cMuch of the frustration of the right whale work is the slowness at which agencies are taking action,\u201d Fuller says. \u201cPlus, the same federal agency charged with authorizing the commercial fisheries that entangle them is also in charge of protecting this critically endangered species. It\u2019s a terrible conflict of interest.\u201d</p> <p>The real tragedy, according to Fuller, happened when the whales traveled into the Gulf of St Lawrence looking for food and, simultaneously, the snow crab fishery exploded. This shift was the perfect storm for entanglement, responsible for several deaths in 2017.</p> <p>When I speak with Regina Asmutis-Silvia, executive director of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, she is quick to point out that no fishermen <em>intend</em> to catch whales. \u201cThey aren\u2019t doing it on purpose,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know they face hardships, too.\u201d</p> <p>Asmutis-Silvia, who has been working on these issues for 30 years, remembers seeing her first entangled whale: \u201cYou could see visible infections, and the whale was in a great deal of pain. The skin had grown over the line. For me, that\u2019s when entanglement moved from a conceptual problem to a real one.\u201d</p> <p>There hasn\u2019t yet been a broad fix to entanglement. \u201cI think we\u2019re closer with so-called ropeless fishing gear,\u201d Asmutis-Silvia says. \u201cIt\u2019s a costly transition, but it has tremendous potential. It\u2019s the most promising solution I\u2019ve seen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13614ccd2878b8e08274cc3a78db423540316035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13614ccd2878b8e08274cc3a78db423540316035/0_0_5100_3400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"North Atlantic Right Whales, off Grand Manan Island, Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">North Atlantic right whales, off Grand Manan Island, Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barrett &amp; MacKay/Getty Images/All Canada Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there\u2019s the boat collisions. More than half of the known right whale population migrated into Cape Cod Bay in the summer of 2019, following their food source of phytoplankton. As they journey there and further northward toward Canada, they cross shipping lanes, putting them at risk of death by blunt force trauma and propeller cuts.</p> <p>Research shows that slowing shipping speeds down from an average of 24 knots to 10 can help improve the odds for right whales, but several ships were fined by Transportation Canada for ignoring the warnings. The reduction in speed orders are lifted when no right whales are spotted, but detection mechanisms are faulty, and ship strikes have contributed to 30 deaths of right whales in the last three years.</p> <p>The right whale calf born to Derecha that was struck this calving season \u2013 its head sliced by the propeller of a vessel \u2013 is presumed dead.</p> <h2><strong>Noise pollution</strong></h2> <p>\u201cTrying to understand where the right whales are, and what their lives are like underwater, is difficult for humans,\u201d Dr Genevieve Davis says. She\u2019s an expert in passive acoustic monitoring, listening for whales as they pass through specific zones. Right whales are vocal \u2013 when socializing in \u201csurface active groups\u201d they scream, blow, gunshot, upcall, warble and downcall.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t think about noise pollution as a common threat, but it masks important communication cues,\u201d Davis says. \u201cA calf might not be able to find her mother. These whales need to navigate, find mates and locate food. There\u2019s a masking effect that changes communication abilities.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think about Massachusetts bays and New York harbors,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s like trying to talk on a phone in the city with sirens and traffic, versus talking on a phone in an empty field. That\u2019s what their world is like now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf2cc713fb634aa8c15248034e7b103f9cd4e0d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf2cc713fb634aa8c15248034e7b103f9cd4e0d3/0_15_1230_1537/800.jpg\" alt=\"A right whale calf and its mother swimming in the Atlantic Ocean near Sapelo Island, Ga.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A right whale calf and its mother swim in the Atlantic Ocean near Sapelo Island, Georgia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clearwater Marine Aquarium Research Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This human-caused \u201cacoustic smog\u201d travels far, and is now constant in our ocean. It includes vessels, alternative energy sources and seismic surveys, which Davis says are so loud they can cause chronic stress and physical pain, like being next to the speakers at a loud concert.</p> <p>Passive acoustic tracking is an important component of a suite of whale-tracking measures, including aerial surveys and reports from fishermen. Currently there is no reliable, compassionate way to track the right whales with GPS, which would theoretically help boat captains avoid ship strikes. Blubber and water make tagging difficult.</p> <p>\u201cNo tagging method is really long-term,\u201d Dr Davis says. \u201cThese whales are already endangered and many are in poor health \u2013 we don\u2019t want to cause more suffering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI look forward to the day when there aren\u2019t more people working to save right whales than the actual number of whales themselves,\u201d Asmutis-Silvia tells me. She recounts the time she spotted a right whale named Wart off the coast of Cape Cod, with a calf.</p> <p>\u201cThere she was,\u201d Asmutis-Silver says. \u201cA tiny little shoehorn face with no callosity. The crazy thing is that Wart had been entangled several years prior. We thought she was dead \u2013 but here she comes back, free of gear, and gives birth in Cape Cod. It was incredible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re so amazing \u2013 so resilient,\u201d she adds. \u201cThese whales have such an ability to recover if we would only give them the chance.\u201d</p> <p>Climate change is already acting as a cruel catalyst, warming the whales\u2019 habitat, causing currents to shift and altering the distribution of plankton the whales depend on. If these changes force the whales into new habitats with greater human activities but fewer protections, the results could be disastrous. This is exactly what appears to be happening in the Gulf of St Lawrence in Canada, where more than 20 right whales (5% of the existing population) have been found dead since 2017.</p> <p>\u201cEverything we think we know this summer could be different two summers from now,\u201d Dr Fuller says.</p> <p>\u201cWatching right whales has been compared to watching the decline of <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/vaquita\">vaquitas</a>,\u201d Dr Fuller tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re watching the last ones die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re responsible for the right whales\u2019 demise,\u201d she says, \u201cand we are responsible for saving them from extinction.\u201d</p> <p><em>If you see a violation or injured animal, call the Northeast Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Stranding and Entanglement Hotline: (866) 755-6622.

Using public money to bail out firms that will take us on the road which doesn\u2019t accelerate decarbonisation and doesn\u2019t address inequality is not just unaffordable, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike in the US, where the Trump administration has rolled back environmental protections, the EU has backed a green recovery.</p> <p>Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president for the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_20_583\">Green Deal at the European commission</a>, said: \u201c[Tackling the Covid-19 emergency] cannot and will not throw us off course in our efforts to tackle the climate crisis that still looms large as one of humanity\u2019s most daunting challenges.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBailouts should all be linked with clear conditions that the money will be used for a green economy and a green society. The very least that should be done is to ascertain that none of our commitments are used to harm our climate goals.\u201d</p> <p>The nature of the global economic recovery is being shaped with meetings this week of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, and by the World Bank and IMF. Much of the initial financial aid from governments was rescue packages to prevent immediate economic collapse, but further huge sums are expected to build recovery.</p> <p>Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, who was France\u2019s climate change ambassador when the global Paris climate deal was sealed in 2015, said: \u201cWe know speed is essential with so many lives and livelihoods at stake, but it would be irresponsible to knowingly lock in more human suffering by enabling more pollution.\u201d</p> <p>Lord Stern, a climate economist at the London School of Economics, UK, said: \u201cThe nature and shape of this recovery will determine our future. It is crucial [it] does not lock in our exposure to the great risks of climate change.\u201d But he said it was important to distinguish between rescue packages and recovery packages and not, for example, to withhold support for the workers in high-carbon sectors.</p> <p>Michael Liebrich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the systems of the past were already failing the world before Covid-19. \u201cAs governments again load the helicopters with money to dump on the global economy \u2026 no fossil fuel-based businesses should be bailed out without committing to science-based, net-zero targets. No money should go to industries that have been living high on the hog on fossil fuel subsidies and tax loopholes, like the airline industry, unless they accept structural reform.\u201d</p> <p>Ben Backwell, CEO at the Global Wind Energy Council, said some governments had extended commissioning deadlines for new wind farms, including those of India, Germany and Greece. \u201cBut so far no government has explicitly included stimulus packages specific to the wind and other renewable sectors. Much diplomatic effort went into brokering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/major-oil-producing-nations-agree-historic-10-cut-in-output\">OPEC+ deal to stabilise oil prices</a> but the discussion needs to move on now to ensuring that renewable energy is at the centre of economic recovery plans.\u201d</p> <p>The course of the recovery has yet to be decided, according to Tom Burke, chair of the E3G thinktank. \u201cI think it is too soon to say that the battle for funds to rebuild our economy is being won by the polluting sectors of business, especially on climate change. There are some strong political forces already pushing hard to make it a recovery that is green.\u201d</p> <p>Timmermans said a sustainable society was the only way to create lasting growth and jobs. Birol, who highlighted energy efficiency for buildings and battery and hydrogen technologies as important goals, also said that the current low oil prices were an opportunity to abolish $400bn a year of consumer fossil fuel subsidies, boosting government budgets.</p> <p>The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, was clear about the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/launch-report-socio-economic-impacts-covid-19\">need to rebuild a different global economy</a>. \u201cEverything we do during and after this crisis must be with a strong focus on building more equal, inclusive and sustainable economies, and societies that are more resilient in the face of pandemics, climate change, and the many other global challenges we face.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s better to bring in these extra measures than not have the race at all.\u201d</p> <p>Vaughters acknowledged that the desire to hold the Tour was good news for cycling\u2019s business model, however. He added: \u201cThe Tour could be a bellwether for the economy because if it happens, it\u2019s a sign that things are improving. But we also have to watch China very carefully and see what happens there as it opens up [after lockdown].\u201d</p>",

Industrial-scale contact tracing was said yesterday to be one of the conditions for lifting restrictions.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy preference is to give Australians the go of getting it right,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI will be calling on Australians to do it, frankly, as a matter of national service, to do it in the same way that people used to buy war bonds back in the war times.\u201d The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said: \u201cWe will start with voluntary and see where it goes.\u201d</p> \n<h2>WA schools to reopen in 12 days</h2> \n<p>The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, announced \u201ca soft school opening\u201d effective from Wednesday 29 April.

  "<p>Thousands of isolated, vulnerable people living at home face \u201cfalling through the cracks\u201d in the next two months unless the government steps in to protect them, the body representing their carers has warned.</p> \n<p>The United Kingdom Homecare Association said financial pressures resulting from the coronavirus crisis, including the spiralling price of personal protective equipment, could force a significant number of the UK\u2019s 8,000 home care providers to close within weeks.</p> \n<p>Some providers of home care \u2013 already widely acknowledged to be the most fragile part of the social care system \u2013 have warned that vulnerable adults could face being abandoned to die alone at home.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe lessons learned too late in the residential care system are not yet being applied in the home care system, which suffers many similar problems and looks after far more people,\u201d said Colin Angel, the policy director for the professional association of home care providers from the independent, voluntary, not-for-profit and statutory sectors.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask.</p>\n    <p>The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used.</p>\n    <p>The WHO says masks should be made of three layers \u2013 with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cHome care is the forgotten cousin of the already second-class social care sector, both in terms of lack of attention and understanding from government,\u201d he said. </p> \n<p>About 97% of the UK\u2019s home care is provided by independent providers. These providers make more than 1m visits a day to vulnerable people in their homes. But there is no centralised record of the numbers who rely on their support and very limited oversight of their financial stability.</p> \n<p>Raina Summerson, the chief executive of Agincare, one of the largest care groups in England, said: \u201cAll home care providers will do everything they can to keep care going. But we are already working on extremely tight margins and, with a lack of funding and sky-high costs of PPE, there will be providers who go bust.</p> \n<p>\u201cOvernight, local authorities will have the responsibility of picking up care for bankrupt providers but will not have resources to do so. It could well mean people left without care and, in the worst-case scenarios, falling through the cracks and dying alone at home.\u201d</p> \n<p>Self-isolation and staff sickness means that home care providers are also having to rely on expensive agency staff during the crisis. At the same time, many have had clients cancelling their contracts because they are scared of infection.</p> \n<p>Gill Heppell, the founder of the Nottingham-based home care provider PerCurra, said the cost of PPE was exorbitant while supply was short.</p> \n<p>\u201cMasks now cost \u00a311.95 each \u2013 and you have to buy 1,000. I am never going to need 1,000, and I hope I won\u2019t need them at all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe usually buy two five-litre tubs of hand sanitiser for \u00a330. One tub now costs \u00a3100.

  "<p>We\u2019ve seen it a bunch of times: a second-contract quarterback who due to their own averageness or organizational incompetence is dumped from one team then experiences a Renaissance with another.</p> <p>Our latest example: Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill was let go by the Dolphins after years of bang average interspersed with brief flashes of brilliance \u2013 most notably a season that was cut short by a knee injury when Tannehill looked like he had finally pieced it all together.</p> <p>The Dolphins bailed. Tannehill was shipped to Tennessee. He rode the bench for a little while then took the lead role when Marcus Mariota was benched for his own stretch of mundane play. Then, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/09/ryan-tannehill-titans-ravens-nfl-playoffs-quarterback\">liftoff</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/brian-allen-coronavirus-los-angeles-rams\">LA Rams\u2019 Brian Allen becomes first NFL player to reveal positive Covid-19 test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tannehill exploded into, legitimately, one of the five best quarterbacks in the league. That sounds like hyperbole, but it\u2019s a fact. By the metrics, Tannehill finished fifth or better in each of the following categories: DVOA, completion percentage under pressure, completion percentage to targets in tight coverage, completion percentage from a clean pocket, completion percentage on third downs.</p> <p>You might be able to bluff one of the metrics, but not <em>five. </em>Most importantly, he ranked second in the league in big-time throws v turnover worthy throws, the single best measure we currently have of a quarterback as a \u201cpassing playmaker\u201d. He trailed only Russell Wilson and was comfortably ahead of Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes.</p> <p>And the eye test was no different. Take the nameplate of his back and you would be conceived you were watching a perennial All-Pro: throws to all levels; consistently nailing the so-called bucket throw, dropping a pass over the top of a linebacker and in front of a rotating safety; throwing on the run; running; setting and resetting protections; taking command of the whole offense; making, big, BIG time throws on third downs, the one that decide a game or not.</p> <p>Tannehill was reborn. And while it\u2019s tempting to scoff at the Titans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/15/ryan-tannehill-tennessee-titans-tom-brady-free-agency-nfl\">putting out a massive contract</a> to keep him around for the foreseeable future, what else were they supposed to do? Move on after witnessing that?</p> <p>Tannehill will likely regress back to his mean: an above-average starter who needs a good deal of help around but who can move and create on third downs, create off-script, and has a cannon of an arm. But there\u2019s a chance, albeit a slight one, that something has clicked. That his second act is sustainable, if only for another season.</p> <p>So, who\u2019s next? Across the league young veterans have switched teams, looking for a chance, any chance to land that sweet gig; that moment in time when an offensive guru meets a gifted offensive line, a pair of decent receivers and a complimentary running back. When perhaps a starter goes down and it\u2019s your time.</p> <p>The two most fascinating possibilities: Marcus Mariota and Cam Newton.</p> <p>Newton, a former No 1 overall pick and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/06/cam-newton-named-nfl-mvp-and-offensive-player-of-the-year\">2015 MVP</a> is still searching for a team after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/cam-newton-trade-carolina-panthers-football-nfl-instagram\">release</a> from the Panthers.</p> <p>Ordinarily, that would be bonkers. Whether you think Newton is on the downside of career or not, he remains a starting-caliber quarterback in a league that\u2019s lacking them. But Newton\u2019s checkered injury record makes any potential signing an impossibility right now.</p> <p>Any team who would be willing to commit big money to the 30-year-old \u2013 and Newton will likely command big money, even if only on a one-year deal \u2013 will want to work Newton out to make sure he still has the same oomph in his legs and zip on his fastball, not to mention have their own medical experts take a look at his files. Until the current global pandemic subsides, that\u2019s going to be a near-impossibility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6102662c1c2163765a164a467d906df3fb6de589\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6102662c1c2163765a164a467d906df3fb6de589/0_0_4794_3195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Mariota\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus Mariota warms up before last year\u2019s AFC championship game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Riedel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the peak of his powers, Newton was a singular force: A blend of size, speed and arm strength the quarterback position has never seen. He was a linebacker in the backfield, but one with just enough touch to shred defenses down the field. He helped take the Panthers to a Super Bowl in a funky offense that was built around his own quirks: his willingness to bang between the tackles and his penchant to mistime some of dropbacks, leading the team to take a whole bunch of timing routes out of the system. It worked! Newton was pretty much unstoppable. But he\u2019s regressed since then. Injuries have taken over and his accuracy, which has always fluctuated based on his footwork, has become wince-inducing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/13/christian-mccaffrey-contract-carolina-panthers-nfl-football\">McCaffrey signs $64m deal to become highest-paid running back in NFL history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But think how wild that above paragraph is. How odd it is to write about the past being the peak of Newton\u2019s powers. <em>Right now</em> should be his peak. He\u2019s 30, still blessed with all the physical gifts he\u2019s always possessed but also with all the experience and savvy of a veteran. This is when he should be staking his claim as one of the league\u2019s five most important players on a consistent basis, serving as the linchpin of perennial Super Bowl contender, not sitting out as a street free agent trying to prove he still has <em>it.</em></p> <p>The spot that makes the most sense for a Newton comeback is in Los Angeles with the Chargers. Right now, LA lists Tyrod Taylor as its starter, with head coach Anthony Lynn saying he\u2019s \u201ctheir guy\u201d. The only issue, we\u2019ve seen systems built around Taylor before in Buffalo (with Lynn) and Cleveland. Neither started or ended particularly well.</p> <p>Taylor is a fine backup, but he\u2019s a couple of ticks below Newton on the quarterback index. If the Chargers want to move away from the dropback passing system they ran with Philip Rivers and commit to the spread option, why do that with a smaller, leaner version or Newton rather than the real deal? Taylor might be a <em>little </em>bit more accurate as a passer. But it\u2019s a nominal difference, and he\u2019s also far less aggressive. Rolling with Taylor is an admission that a team is happy to be average-to-bad.</p> <p>Newton, at least, improves that risk profile to good-to-bad \u2013 that\u2019s a gamble worth taking. Add to that, with Rivers leaving the Charges could use a little bit of star power, particularly as they get set to move into a new stadium. There are few higher-wattage stars in the league than Newton.</p> <p>One other option: The Rams. Sean McVay\u2019s team is in cap hell and have been flogging assets. And you could make a decent argument, based on scheme-fit and accuracy without pressure, that you\u2019d rather have Jared Goff than Newton. But I\u2019d trust in McVay to adapt his system, and I\u2019d sooner take the quarterback who is the same when pressured and when not, rather than the guy who\u2019s accuracy and decision-making craters when there\u2019s pressure in his face.</p> <p>Would Newton be open to a one-year, cheap deal to work alongside McVay and make a potential Super Bowl run? The idea is fairly tantalizing.</p> <p>But Mariota to the Vegas Raiders remains the most likely breakout/rebirth spot.</p> <p>Mariota was lethal in college in an offense that weaponized his north-south speed and lightning-quick release. He was smart, played within himself, got the ball out on time, and was all about maximizing efficiency, both with his arm and legs. He\u2019s a timing player, not an oft-script creator. Planting him in a system that says <em>control the game on first and second down then win it for us on third down</em> was never his style; thrust into that position he crumbled.</p> <p>\u201cWe got to rebuild him a little bit to get his confidence back,\u201d Las Vegas general manager Mike Mayock said this week. By that, Mayock meant to restore him to his Oregon days. \u201cI mean, he went through \u2018Gruden\u2019s (QB) Camp\u2019 on television. I had him as the top quarterback in that draft. He knows that both of us believed in him coming out and still believe in him.\u201d</p> <p>In Jon Gruden, Mariota finds a coach who sees his skills as a virtue, not a shortcoming. Is he a game-breaker? No. Can he efficiently take a team down the field, play within structure, make sure the team gets from a bad play into a good one, follow instructions, make throws on time and in rhythm, and lead a team to eight or nine wins, giving them a playoff shot? Sure.</p> <p>Mariota will have to beat out Derek Carr, who is due for his own second act any year now. Carr has been solid if unspectacular since Gruden returned to the Raiders, happy to take on the coach\u2019s touchdown-or-checkdown mantra. But the fit remains iffy. Mariota\u2019s arrival, as well as a brief flirtation with Tom Brady, tells you all you need to know about how Mayock and Gruden view Carr\u2019s future with the team.</p> <p>We love a redemption arc, that\u2019s just human nature. Tannehill was last year\u2019s feel-good story. Newton and Mariota have a chance to take the crown whenever football returns..</p>",

Direct debits bounce from my bank account like an orgy on a trampoline. Every time I go to the supermarket, which is not as often as it should be, I prepare my \u201cbemused and slightly irate\u201d face in the event of my card being declined. When the card isn\u2019t declined, I conceal my teary relief behind a mask of nonchalance. After All This is over, I\u2019ll have a credit score worse than Venezuela\u2019s.</p> <p>As much as I am grateful for the revival of the lost art of the telephone call, the renewed connection with old friends, the opportunity to make amends and put past enmities behind me, and the discovery of my heretofore unexplored talent to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/28/20-best-egg-recipes-part-1-simon-hopkinson-elizabeth-david-omelette-tortilla\">cook eggs</a> eight ways, I nevertheless find myself sceptical of the cost-benefit analysis.

I left a career in journalism \u2013 or perhaps it left me, it\u2019s hard to say \u2013 to become a scriptwriter. It was going OK: after three years as a storyliner on Coronation Street and Emmerdale, I got my first script commission in 2017. Since then, I\u2019ve been beavering away on various projects, and scraping a living. But that was the deal. I knew that from the get-go. I accepted that, at least for a while, I\u2019d have a lemonade lifestyle on a lemonade wage.</p> <p>I was almost, nearly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/08/just-about-managing-austerity-brexit-public-spending-cuts\">just about managing</a> \u2013 not least because there was hope. Hope that a show I\u2019ve written \u2013 about the teenage children of the super-rich, ironically enough \u2013 might get a green light. Hope that other ideas might get put into development somewhere. Hope that I might get into a writers\u2019 room on someone else\u2019s show. Hope that a play I\u2019ve written might catch the eye of a theatre. Now though, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-support-loophole-uk-film-tv-staff-without-pay-mps\">TV production</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-prompts-more-cultural-institutions-to-shut-doors\">theatre</a> are in short supply. Hope is in short supply. They say that it\u2019s the hope that kills you in the end. I\u2019d say that despair is also pretty lethal. Just when you\u2019re making ends meet, someone moves the ends.</p> <p>These are not unfamiliar circumstances for me. I grew up in the 1980s in a single-parent household with very little money. One of my most vivid childhood memories is of my mum having to choose what to buy with what was left of her family allowance (as it was then). A pint of milk or a loaf of bread? My feelings now are similar to my feelings then when I knew that my friends were much better off than we were.

  "<h2><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></h2> \n<p>It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p> \n<h2><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></h2> \n<p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p> \n<p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>A high temperature \u2013 you feel hot to touch on your chest or back.</p></li> \n <li><p>A new continuous cough \u2013 this means you have started coughing repeatedly.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bbdedea8-3745-42f9-a4fe-eb53a8598b4f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1zHDqywPrnc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a temperature or a cough?</strong></h2> \n<p>No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should <strong>stay at home for at least 7 days</strong>.

Over 4,500 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. The US has had more than 34,500 fatalities, Italy more than 22,000 and Spain has seen more than 19,500. The US has more confirmed cases than any other country \u2013 over 676,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p> \n<p>More than <strong>543,500 people are recorded as having recovered</strong> from coronavirus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"da6e7b30-c83b-43bf-8d5e-772e3e686b5a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/suTKhpuZPww?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?</strong></h2> \n<p>We don\u2019t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won\u2019t know until more data comes in, but estimates of the mortality rate have ranged from well below 1% in the young to over 3% among those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6815659/\">400,000 deaths</a> each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.</p> \n<p>Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population \u2013 elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems \u2013 to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important.</p> \n<h2><strong>Have there been other coronaviruses?</strong></h2> \n<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

  "<p>Let us deal with the most immediate and valid concern when presented with a new series entitled Home (Apple+ TV) that promises an in-depth look at the different and architecturally interesting ways various people of vision have chosen to build and live in theirs. Namely: is it <a href=\"https://www.granddesigns.tv/\">Grand Designs</a> with knobs on?</p> <p>The answer, I am very happy to tell you, is no. Or at least, just a tiny, tiny bit, just occasionally. A forgivable amount, I would say, and my tolerance threshold is low. People do, every now and then, say things such as \u201cLife itself should colonise the space\u201d, but the saving grace of Home is that a) there is no Kevin McCloud and b) unlike most of the genre, it looks outward rather than in.</p> <p>Instead of simply marvelling at Sequoia and Theodolite\u2019s bravery in building a six-storey poured-concrete and wickerwork habitational constructivation on a sand dune, it uses each individual home as a jumping off point for an examination of wider movements, issues and possibilities. This has the happy further advantage of fitting in rather than jarring with current \u2013 surely unanticipated by the makers \u2013 lockdown conditions. We are all at home trying to look outwards.</p> <p>Anupama Kundoo\u2019s home \u2013 the Listening House in Auroville, India \u2013 for example, is built using materials from within a 20km radius of the building. It is constructed using traditional skills as a repudiation of the western style and techniques that dominated the country for centuries under British rule, and a restoration of local industry and the status of craftsmen who have kept 4,000-year-old pre-colonial arts alive down the generations. It\u2019s a house very much embedded in the natural world around it \u2013 walls are perforated to let in light and air, plants cover a sweeping verandah and the handmade brick construction makes the whole thing look as if it has grown straight out of the earth.</p> <p>In Sweden, Anders Solvarm has given the back-to-nature idea the twist needed in a more intemperate climate by building his house within a giant greenhouse, creating a self-sustaining patch of Mediterranean greenery in the middle of snowy Scandinavia. His human terrarium \u2013 or <em>naturhus</em> \u2013 is at the forefront of a movement that seeks to minimise our ecological impact at every turn. Our own greenhouses, complete with vegetable plots, self-contained greywater systems or minimal heating requirements to minimise the global greenhouse effect, are a satisfying solution to consider.</p> <p>Theaster Gates is the son of a roofer who grew up on the west side of Chicago and \u2013 as a bright boy \u2013 was transported to school on the north side and watched through the bus windows every day as the landscape changed and improved with every mile further from home he got. He grew up to be an artist with a degree in urban planning. He has spent decades acquiring and transforming abandoned buildings near his adult south side Chicago home into community gathering places, endeavours and museums of local and wider black experience, to make the place feel like home in a wider sense to a growing number of citizens.</p> <p>\u201cI built things with what I had,\u201d he says. And now he has, in effect, a town of his own, scattered across another, but connected by his aesthetic and his urge to revivify a neglected place and its people. \u201cWhen you walk past an abandoned building,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s hard not to feel heavy.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the most purely fascinating on its own terms is architect Gary Chang\u2019s 344 sq ft apartment in Hong Kong. He calls it the Domestic Transformer and is using it as a laboratory in which, and with which, to solve his overcrowded city\u2019sproblem of housing provision. Simply put, Chang lives in one room that he can transform into any other at will. Walls slide and reconfigure the space \u2013 a bench becomes a desk becomes a kitchen counter becomes a dining table. A cupboard opens to become a kitchen; everything else slides away to let down a Murphy bed, or to let the apartment become a home cinema or the bathroom or a walk-in closet \u2026</p> <p>It\u2019s completely astonishing, like a real-life Tardis but with an entirely tranquil doctor at its heart, in absolute control of everything and quite possibly set to change the world more than any time lord ever dreamed.</p> <p>So many different conceptions of home \u2013 what it can be when uncoupled from convention, how wide it can go philosophically, how much it can contract when practicality requires \u2013 make this a series that asks even greater questions about what of those things we once imagined immutable we can choose to accept or reject. It\u2019s a grand design indeed.</p>",

Like Theofelus, she didn\u2019t rise through party political ranks but rather was appointed for the skills she could bring to the portfolio. This is especially unusual in southern Africa, where the credentials of the older liberation war heroes, born of struggle, often weigh more heavily than educational qualifications.</p> <p>The same was true for Vera Daves da Sousa, 35, who became Angola\u2019s finance minister last year.

For example, last year Ronald Lamola, 35 and a lawyer by training, was appointed justice minister. He rose to prominence a decade ago as part of the youth league of the governing African National Congress (ANC), where he was a close ally of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/10/julius-malema-south-africa-anc\">Julius Malema</a>, one of the most prominent young African politicians in recent times. They went their separate ways after Malema was expelled and formed his own party.</p> <p>In the past month, Lamola has been part of a team consisting of mostly older ministers regulating South Africa\u2019s tight coronavirus lockdown. In an unprecedented move by the president, another young colleague, communications minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, was this week ordered to take leave for breaking these rules after she was pictured on social media having lunch at a friend\u2019s house.

Ntsube, aged 20 at the time, was joined by at least four former student activists who made names for themselves a couple of years earlier in the #FeesMustFall protest movement.</p> <p>Across the border in Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe clung to power until the age of 93, former Olympian swimmer Kirsty Coventry, then 35, was appointed minister of youth, sport, arts and recreation in 2018 by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. In the same year, Jessie Majome, from the opposition MDC Alliance, became the youngest parliamentarian aged 25.</p> <p>Mugabe was also known for appointing young ministers, such as the firebrand youth leader Saviour Kasukuwere, who became deputy minister of youth development and employment creation in 2005 at the age of 35.</p> <p>But having young leaders in government isn\u2019t always good news. Instead of advancing youth interests, the appointment of young people as ministers in Zimbabwe \u201chas been done over the years expediently and selectively\u201d, says Harare-based Ibbo Mandaza, director of the Sapes Trust thinktank.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly done half-heartedly, because the older generation doesn\u2019t want to give up power,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also done as a way of co-opting and buying off the opposition.\u201d</p> <p>Mandaza says Coventry was appointed to woo white Zimbabweans. \u201cThere has not been a pattern of a systematic attempt for generational change in the region.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad1a87f40cfab1be5c37bda85f12eba59f4307a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad1a87f40cfab1be5c37bda85f12eba59f4307a1/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zimbabwe\u2019s sports minister, Kirsty Coventry follows January\u2019s Test match between Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka at Harare Sports Club\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zimbabwe\u2019s sports minister, Kirsty Coventry, left, follows January\u2019s Test match between Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka at Harare Sports Club.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some heads of state have made young appointments to compete favourably with the opposition.

  "<h2>Top story: Chinese economy shrinks 6.8%</h2> \n<p>Friday is here and I\u2019m Warren Murray, ready to lead you through what\u2019s on offer in terms of news.</p> \n<p>Wuhan\u2019s prevention and control taskforce has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-economy-shrinks-record-wuhan-covid-19-death-toll-rises-50-percent\">revised the city\u2019s death toll upwards by 50%</a> from 2,579 to 3,869. The updated figure comes after weeks of scepticism about the reported toll. Meanwhile in the last few hours the business world has begun absorbing the news that the Chinese economy shrank 6.8% in the first three months of 2020. The first such contraction on record for China comes after months of paralysis from the coronavirus lockdown.</p> \n<p>Britain\u2019s biggest companies handed out almost half a trillion pounds in dividends and share buybacks in the years before the coronavirus crisis, according to a report calling for tough conditions on any taxpayer-funded bailouts. Burgeoning dividend payouts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/400bn-paid-in-dividends-by-uk-companies-before-coronavirus-crisis\">left companies weak going into the Covid-19 crash</a>, as well as fuelling inequality, says the Common Wealth thinktank. It says the government needs to take an equity stake in firms receiving financial support, while job security guarantees should be made, and ministers could also impose bans on dividends and share buybacks, insist on maximum pay caps for top executives, and get assurances that companies will pay their taxes fairly.</p> \n<p>After attempting to lord it over state governors, Donald Trump has unveiled guidelines for reopening the economy that ultimately defer to them on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trump-coronavirus-reopening-us-economy-guidelines-governors\">when and how restrictions should be eased within their borders</a>. The first phase allows for work but only essential travel; the second would allow for gatherings of 50 people and non-essential travel; the third allows for schools and organised youth activities to open up as well as large venues under \u201cphysical distancing protocols\u201d and bars on the basis of reduced occupancy. David Smith writes that the guidelines are supposedly science-based but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trumps-science-based-reopening-strategy-is-still-full-of-unanswered-questions\">fail to set out critical elements</a> like a national testing strategy \u2013 something that has proven vital in other countries.</p> \n<p>Dominic Raab has warned the British public that lockdown measures could last into June and any relaxation now would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-lockdown-to-continue-for-at-least-three-weeks-raab-confirms\">\u201csubstantially increase the number of deaths\u201d</a>. He set out plans for a minimum three-week extension to prevent a deadly \u201csecond peak\u201d of infections but also pointed to Boris Johnson\u2019s remark, on 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to turn the tide of the virus. \u201cThat, broadly, is the outline,\u201d Raab said.

Her deputy, John Barilaro, has continued to back the league\u2019s reactivation plans, but the support has not been shared by the premiers of neighbouring states, nor by some of the country\u2019s chief medical advisors.</p> <p>But on Friday morning, Berejiklian backed away and when asked whether her government had approved league\u2019s return on ABC radio, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/nrl-forge-ahead-with-resumption-plan-despite-no-approval-from-nsw-government\">she responded with </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/nrl-forge-ahead-with-resumption-plan-despite-no-approval-from-nsw-government\">a decisive \u201cno\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Despite the premier\u2019s reluctance, Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys remains adamant plans for the NRL will move ahead. V\u2019landys is riding on the strength of the \u201cwritten permission\u201d of NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller combined with a promise by the NRL to stay committed to the health and safety of players and the community at large.</p> <p>The NRL now finds itself in an awkward stand-off amid wavering levels of government support and cannot rely on the usual obligation of major broadcasters. The code has been embroiled in a myriad of issues over the past few days; none of them have moved the sport closer to finding a solution.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s scathing broadside from Channel Nine \u2013 one of the game\u2019s major broadcast partner \u2013 fuelled speculation the station was not committed to a resuscitation of the 2020 season. In reality for the NRL, it was like one of Apollo\u2019s astronauts being left behind in space without a lifeline.</p> <p>V\u2019landys has now been charged with sweetening the apparent oversight of the game\u2019s broadcasters not being invited to the NRL table and striking a deal where a revised competition can be televised viably, in an environment where the appetite of advertisers has drastically waned.</p> <p>The message from V\u2019landys is set: 28 May is a target date. What is not clear, is how the NRL plans to execute the game\u2019s revival in the next six weeks.</p> <p>It is evident that is reliant on the continued deceleration of Covid-19 cases. Opponents cite the bold ambition of V\u2019landys and his innovation committee as arrogant and flying in the face of expert medical advice. How can one justify hundreds of adults breaking social distancing rules each weekend to smother each other in tackles while the rest of the country is told to remain a metre and a half away from everyone, including close friends and family? Who do the NRL think they are?</p> <p>The innovation committee recently unveiled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/nrl-island-recipe-for-ruin-or-a-world-leading-game-changer\">the wild notion of an NRL island</a> or forced self-isolation hub as a way to adhere to health regulations and to guarantee the safety of players and the community. As the level of infection in Australia has subsided, so too has the scope and creativity of the NRL\u2019s solution.</p> <p>The preferred option is to host the competition between ANZ Stadium and Penrith, with Sydney-based teams allowed to live day-to-day within their own homes. With Victoria and Queensland rolling out tighter measures to control the virus, players from the Brisbane Broncos, North Queensland Cowboys and Gold Coast Titans as well as Melbourne Storm would need to relocate to NSW unless the restrictions are lifted in the coming weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/15/tables-turn-with-nrls-viability-no-longer-threatened-by-broadcaster-backlash\">Tables turn with NRL's viability no longer threatened by broadcaster backlash | Nick Tedeschi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then there is the issue of the New Zealand-based Warriors. Despite a possible return touted as early as this weekend, the Warriors remain in limbo \u2013 uncertain of what international quarantine requirements will be imposed by countries; unsure of where their new home will be; doubtful that they will be granted permission to train when condemned to a 14-day self-isolation period after touching down in Sydney.</p> <p>While headlines are swirling around hypothetical plots, the NRL needs to urgently chart its plan and firm its course. It needs to rapidly unify its major stakeholders and create equality between the teams. It needs to harvest the support of its sponsors. And it needs to gain the green light of government.</p> <p>Meanwhile, its rival, the AFL, is due to announce plans for a restart at the end of April. The somewhat sleeping giant has made no waves at the peak of the crisis and might just surpass the NRL; not through ingenuity or innovation, but simply by taking a path of less resistance in a climate of uncertainty. </p>",

  "<p>The past few months have been a hectic experience for all of us.

How do we go from lockdown to life as usual?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/15/pros-and-cons-what-are-the-exit-strategies-for-australias-coronavirus-crisis\">Pros and cons: what are the exit strategies for Australia's coronavirus crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which brings us to herd immunity.</p> <p>As the end of our Covid-19 lockdown has come into distant sight, <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/health-and-education/the-next-stage-must-be-to-let-the-virus-spread-20200414-p54jme\">many people</a> have started arguing that the best way to end this social distancing purgatory is to let the virus <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/if-a-grandparent-chooses-a-loving-embrace-that-may-kill-them-who-are-we-to-stop-them-20200414-p54jmy.html\">run free</a>, or at least partially free. They talk about something called herd immunity to bolster this idea, as if it was an easy way out rather than something horrifying that we want to avoid at all costs.</p> <p>Why is it so bad? Let me explain.</p> <p>Herd immunity is a simple epidemiological concept that describes the state where enough people are immune to a disease that it stops spreading in the population. Basically, if 80 people out of 100 can\u2019t get the disease, then the 20 people who can get it will be protected because they are never actually exposed. Any outbreaks of the infection would quickly die out in this scenario.</p> <p>All of this sounds rosy, but the problem with herd immunity is that it really hinges on vaccination. Without a vaccine, the only way to become immune to a disease is to get it and live through, which makes the strategy a whole lot more fatal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we pursue herd immunity, the best-case scenario has between 43,000 and 100,000 people in Australia dying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To see how much more fatal, let\u2019s look at the numbers. Our initial estimates put the herd immunity threshold for Covid-19 \u2013 the proportion of people who need to be immune for the disease to stop spreading \u2013 at 60-70% of the population. So 60-70% of people need to be infected with Covid-19 for herd immunity to come into play at a minimum, although new data from the CDC indicates the number <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article?deliveryName=USCDC_333-DM25287\">may be as high as 85%</a>. And it\u2019s important to note that you can\u2019t really pick and choose these people, because unless you reach that threshold in every part of the country you\u2019ll still see disease outbreaks. The idea that we can only infect young people is simply incorrect, firstly because that\u2019s not how society functions, but also because it\u2019ll create clusters of low immunity where the disease can still spread.</p> <p>In Australia, that would mean roughly 15-17 million coronavirus infections. Now, we also have a very good idea of the death rate from this disease \u2013 while the case-fatality rate is quite high, the true infection-fatality rate given a health system that is not overwhelmed <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/\">is likely</a> to be around <a href=\"http://eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.12.2000256\">0.3-0.6%</a>. In other words, including all the asymptomatic cases (people who get the disease but never experience symptoms), around three to six out of every thousand infected will die. Multiplying those numbers, we can see that, if we pursue herd immunity, the best-case scenario has between 43,000 and 100,000 people in Australia dying.</p> <p>That\u2019s really quite a lot.</p> <p>But remember, that\u2019s if the health system is not overwhelmed. As many have pointed out, letting the virus run free comes with costs, one of which is that hospitals simply cannot treat everyone who is sick at the same time. For example, Sweden, which initially chose a laissez-faire attitude towards Covid-19, is now reportedly <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus-lockdown-doctor-death-certificates-latest-a9462796.html\">refusing ICU beds</a> in some hospitals to people over the age of 80 or even those under 80 with comorbid conditions due to the impossibility of caring for everyone. If we take a more pessimistic view of the fatality rate, where our hospital system is struggling, we could see as many as 250,000 people dead before we reached the herd immunity threshold of 60-70%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/those-talking-about-a-fast-end-to-social-distancing-should-consider-the-cost-paid-in-human-lives\">Those talking about a fast end to social distancing should consider the cost paid in human lives | Matt Beard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And this is just deaths. We still do not know what the long-term complications of Covid-19 are, but it\u2019s fair to assume that there will be some. There\u2019s also a huge cost to having a large proportion of your population very sick at the same time, from the difficulties of providing essential services to the nightmare of entire families falling sick simultaneously.</p> <p>The simple fact is that herd immunity, without a vaccine, is not an easy way forward. Even if we do eventually reach that magical 60-70% threshold, it will have come at a staggering cost. Given the nature of the disease, the deaths and illness will be most focused on older and disadvantaged people, which is particularly worrying for anyone who cares about those over the age of 60.</p> <p>Ultimately, what we do next will be more a political than a scientific decision, and <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-16/national-cabinet-scott-morrison-coronavirus-restrictions/12153632\">Scott Morrison confirmed</a> on Thursday that herd immunity wasn\u2019t an approach Australia was following. But it\u2019s worth remembering that every way forward comes with a cost. To some, herd immunity may still sound idyllic, but it requires us to sacrifice the vulnerable on the altar of the economy in truly vast numbers.
