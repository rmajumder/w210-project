  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global cases stand at nearly 215,000</h2> <p>According to Johns Hopkins University figures, 8,732 people have died, while 214,894 have been confirmed as having contracted the virus. The institution believes 83,313 people have recovered.</p> <h2><strong>Pandemic \u2018like a nuclear explosion\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-live-news-updates-outbreak-us-states-uk-australia-europe-eu-self-isolation-lockdown-latest-update?page=with:block-5e72a0608f085c6327bc29db#block-5e72a0608f085c6327bc29db\">said the initial impact would be huge</a>, but that the fallout would be long-lasting and transformative. Welby also said the UK government must not make the mistake of focusing its efforts to mitigate the outbreak\u2019s economic effects on the UK\u2019s big cities at the expense of smaller communities.</p> <h2>UK to double military response force</h2> <p>The British army <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-live-news-updates-outbreak-us-states-uk-australia-europe-eu-self-isolation-lockdown-latest-update?page=with:block-5e72a4798f085e564ad86c27#block-5e72a4798f085e564ad86c27\">will significantly increase</a> the number of personnel available to help deal with the outbreak. The Ministry of Defence said an extra 10,000 personnel would be added to the 10,000 already available to form a support force.</p> <h2><strong>Pakistan and Costa Rica announce</strong><strong> first deaths</strong></h2> <p>Two announcements in quick succession <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-live-news-updates-outbreak-us-states-uk-australia-europe-eu-self-isolation-lockdown-latest-update?page=with:block-5e726be08f085c6327bc284b#block-5e726be08f085c6327bc284b\">came from Pakistan</a>, where official figures count 260 infections.

At about the same time, Mario Diaz-Balart<strong> </strong>\u2013 a Republican congressman representing Florida \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-live-news-updates-outbreak-us-states-uk-australia-europe-eu-self-isolation-lockdown-latest-update?page=with:block-5e72ab9c8f085e564ad86c50#block-5e72ab9c8f085e564ad86c50\">revealed he had tested positive</a>. \u201cI\u2019m feeling much better. However, it\u2019s important that everyone take this seriously,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Tasmania cuts itself off from rest of Australia</h2> <p>The Australian island state <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-live-news-updates-outbreak-us-states-uk-australia-europe-eu-self-isolation-lockdown-latest-update?page=with:block-5e72a9618f088d75755960fd#block-5e72a9618f088d75755960fd\">decided to shut its border with the rest of the country</a> in a bid to stop the spread of the virus within its community.</p> <h2>UK orders school closures as more deaths announced</h2> <p>The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-live-news-updates-outbreak-us-states-uk-australia-europe-eu-self-isolation-lockdown-latest-update?page=with:block-5e725a9a8f085c6327bc277b#block-5e725a9a8f085c6327bc277b\">told the Commons that schools would not reopen after Friday</a> for most pupils, but said the most vulnerable children and those of key workers, such as NHS staff, would still be able to go in.</p> <p>The news came after it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-live-news-updates-outbreak-us-states-uk-australia-europe-eu-self-isolation-lockdown-latest-update?page=with:block-5e724d908f085c6327bc26c1#block-5e724d908f085c6327bc26c1\">emerged the death toll in the country had surged</a> to 104 as it was confirmed 32 more people had died in England. NHS England said the patients were aged between 59 and 94 and all had underlying health conditions.</p> <h2>Italian death toll in largest one-day increase</h2> <p>A further 475 people died \u2013<strong> </strong>the most in a single day since the outbreak began, according to the latest figures from the civil protection agency.

The country has confirmed 27 cases and it is suspected that at least 200 more people have the disease.</p>",
  "<p>What a time to be recommending a comedy called Feel Good. But I am. Wholeheartedly and without reservation. It\u2019s a glorious, shining jewel in the middle of what I think we can safely call the greatest global shitstorm since the second world war (Brexit almost begins to look like village pensioners riven with dissent over the prize for best onions at the summer show.).</p> <p>Canadian standup <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/15/mae-martin-comedian-addict-television-channel-4-feel-good-lisa-kudrow\">Mae Martin</a>\u2019s six-part <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/feel-good\">semi-autobiographical series for </a><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/feel-good\">Channel 4</a> (she writes and stars) centres around the relationship between Mae the character and her new girlfriend, George (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/29/charlotte-ritchie-funniest-things\">Charlotte Ritchie</a>). It captures the early days of a romance beautifully, when lust obscures detail and difference, and everything is precisely as thrilling as it is anxiety-making. \u201cShe\u2019s like a dangerous Mary Poppins,\u201d Mae says admiringly of her quintessentially English beloved. \u201cAnd I\u2019m Bart Simpson.\u201d</p> <p>The idiotic banter between fledgling partners is refined, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/15/mae-martin-edinburgh-fringe-dope-people-refer-to-me-as-innocent-disingenuous\">via Martin\u2019s immaculate writing</a> and delivery so clean and fleet that you can actually feel it doing you good, to a hilarious point. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you have a mug with \u2018I Heart Guernsey\u2019 on it,\u201d says Mae during the couple\u2019s first trip to Ikea. \u201cIs it true? DO you heart Guernsey? What even is a Guernsey? It\u2019s making me question everything.\u201d</p> <p>By the end of the first episode, Feel Good has shifted focus slightly, to concentrate on what happens when reality begins to reassert itself. Their particular reality includes George not having dated a woman before and being reluctant to come out or introduce Mae to her friends and family, and Mae being a recovering addict who retains all the impulses that lead her into dangerous situations, encourage bad choices and strain relationships. \u201cI knew she was an addict,\u201d says George\u2019s depressed flatmate, Phil. \u201cHer legs were always moving and her eyes are spooky.\u201d Martin looks like an angel adulterated with duckling, but Phil is right in a larger sense \u2013 the restless energy beneath means you daren\u2019t take your eyes off her for a second.</p> <p>Feel Good moves so quickly and lightly that it seems impossible it could also be managing to construct characters and burrow into psyches as deeply and empathically as it does. While also, I must emphasise, remaining as funny as any comedy dedicated to that end. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/15/lisa-kudrow-on-the-comeback-satire\">Lisa Kudrow</a> as Mae\u2019s appalling mother is emblematic of all Feel Good\u2019s strengths, periodically popping up on Skype (\u201cDon\u2019t look at me! I\u2019m 3,000 years old!\u201d) to deliver \u2013 inadvertently, if you\u2019re generously inclined \u2013 the latest quota of maternal blows to her child\u2019s psyche. She blames Mae\u2019s addiction issues on the fact that she was four weeks premature. \u201cYou were in an incubator. It\u2019s why we\u2019re not close.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not close?\u201d replies Mae, duckling suddenly to the fore, innocence bruised, and viewers cackling.</p> <p>As the series goes on, it takes in not just the peaks and troughs of romantic relationships, as George and Mae unpack their considerable baggage, but also the impact of toxic family influence (George\u2019s mother, embittered by but still in emotional thrall to her ex-husband, casts her own pall and is played with the magnificence you would expect by Pippa Haywood) and probes the nature of various forms of friendship. Mae is a passionate attachment seeker, whose pulsing need rather than rational decision-making habitually leads her into disaster. Her chosen sponsor, Maggie (Sophie Thompson, in a part that makes glorious use of her effortless eccentricity), is fun but not nearly aware enough of her own issues to be of help to anyone, let alone another, younger addict. Maggie\u2019s backstory, as it emerges, adds another perspective on the mother-daughter relationship and poses more questions about how we love, negotiate with and protect ourselves from each other</p> <p>George, by contrast, has a vast array of friends. Or at least, as she comes gradually to realise, a lot of people with whom she spends a lot of time. Whether they mean anything to her, or she to them, is another point of scrutiny for the show. What is any friend worth if you don\u2019t feel you can introduce your loved one to them?</p> <p>Feel Good should make you feel good. It\u2019s not only an immaculately written and paced piece of work and a properly funny comedy, it has also created a delicately and intricately constructed, deeply humane world where people make mistakes but are not damned, and have flaws that are not fatal, and \u2013 despite all the obstacles \u2013 connect across and despite their divides. It is good for almost everything that ails us.</p>",
  "<p>The Ministry of Defence is to double the size of the military\u2019s civil contingency unit to create a 20,000-strong Covid support force, the defence secretary has announced.</p> \n<p>An additional 10,000 troops will be added to the 10,000 routinely held at higher readiness in case of a civil emergency, and reservists could also be called up, Ben Wallace said on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>There are fears about the ability of the police and NHS, which are both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/uk-government-coronavirus-plans-strip-fire-and-police-to-essentials-covid-19\">already at full stretch</a>, to deal with the scale of the crisis.

  "<p>Devastating tornadoes ripped through central parts of Tennessee this month leaving at least 25 people dead and a trail of destruction to homes and businesses. The storms were the strongest to hit the region in almost a decade, with recorded wind speeds as high as 165mph. Trees were knocked down and power supplies disrupted.

It\u2019s not <strong><em>just </em></strong>because the dollar is in massive demand. </p> <p>He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sterling has completed one of its steepest declines in memory by hitting its weakest level since 1985, excluding if you will the brief dive of the Oct 2016 \u2018flash crash\u2019. </p> <p>This is the worst sustained period of sterling selling that I can recall, and it points to a severe dollar liquidity crunch that central banks have yet to get a grip on. There is a synchronised rush for dollars that has caught most companies, governments and traders on the hop. Dollar funding issues have been far more serious than estimated prior to this crisis.<br></p> <p>However sterling is also sharply weaker against the euro in recent days, with EURGBP above 0.92, so whilst the main reason for the pound\u2019s decline, there are clearly other factors at work. The UK government\u2019s massive fiscal package undoubtedly means more borrowing for the UK economy - how do we pay for all this? And in a rather bizarre turn of events - if you have been schooled in the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis a few years back - the euro has developed certain safe haven characteristics. Sterling is, on the other hand, a bit of a proxy for risk.<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6d9a6f877ef1ce814607886fb201720f53ac5e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6d9a6f877ef1ce814607886fb201720f53ac5e7/0_0_580_342/500.jpg\" alt=\"The pound vs the US dollar this year\" width=\"500\" height=\"295\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pound vs the US dollar this year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e720dd28f085c6327bc2310\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T12:04:18.508Z\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A growing number of European carmakers are downing tools, my colleague Rob Davies reports:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BMW and Toyota have joined a rapidly lengthening list of carmakers shutting down European operations, affecting UK plants in Oxfordshire and Derbyshire, as the coronavirus brings the automotive industry grinding to a virtual halt.</p> <p>More than 10,000 car workers have been laid off across the industry as Nissan, the Mercedes-Benz parent, Daimler, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat and Peugeot have already announced suspensions of their European output.

The irrefutable fact is that output \u2013 real national income \u2013 is falling, and thus the country as a whole will be worse off.</p> <p>The basic problem to be tackled is how to manage the distribution of that fall, and in particular how to protect poorer groups. Manipulating total demand, such as by printing money, will cause inflation and could make things much worse for those groups. (Amartya Sen, in his 1981 book Poverty and Famines, argues that such a policy caused famine in India in the 1940s.) Using income tax to redistribute real incomes is a possibility. In addition, ensuring the supply of basic essentials, especially food, should be a priority. For example, guaranteeing farmers higher prices, well in advance, should stimulate supply (creating money to do that is OK, so long as output is increased as a result).</p> <p>The entire economic situation is unprecedented, though it is a little like that of the 1970s and early 80s, when supply was also hit. In contrast, the 1930s and post-2007 were characterised by a fall in demand, and Keynesian policy was appropriate.<br><strong>John Levi</strong><br><em>Retired academic economist, Abingdon, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott suggests that universal basic income is unlikely to be implemented due to big changes needed in the tax and benefits system. However, these are not normal times, and we need to act to support those who are self-employed, laid off and in the gig economy, and all others who are having financial difficulties due to coronavirus. It seems to be a fairly simple way of making sure everyone has an income, can be done quickly if the will is there, and avoids much of the confusion of subsidies, mortgage and rent holidays and other measures that he mentions.<br><strong>Terry Quinn</strong><br><em>Preston</em></p> <p>\u2022 When I first became an advocate for unconditional universal basic incomes (UBIs) almost 50 years ago, I little imagined the circumstances in which they would become widely canvassed for this country.

He eloquently describes how reconnecting with the natural world can help us at least recuperate and find solace in a way that our urban environments cannot. However, as Richard Mabey says in the article, it is not a panacea and nature itself is going through its own crisis; no amount of walking through silent woodlands and desertified fields will provide the sought-after cure.</p> <p>For those of us who have loved and immersed themselves in the countryside over many decades and written about it, our closeness to it can only add to our stress and worry. When I return to the lanes, hedgerows and woods I loved as a boy, where I found birds\u2019 nests every 50 yards or so, watched field mice clambering with acrobatic agility up the stems of swaying wheat and heard the mournful piping of curlews and redshank from the marshy fields, today there is only an eerie stillness and scarcely a fluttering wingbeat over the monotone greenery.</p> <p>When, in 2000, I wrote and illustrated my book Wings Over the Valley: A Birdwatcher\u2019s Wales Diary, about the joys of birdwatching and the countryside, communicating that exhilaration gave me renewed strength and optimism, but those feelings have been shattered in the face of the continued destruction of our countryside.<br><strong>John Green</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s good to read that highway authorities and the construction industry are taking the greening of our roadsides seriously (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/14/on-the-verge-a-quiet-roadside-revolution-is-boosting-wildflowers-aoe\" title=\"\">Flower power: the route map to a roadside revolution</a>, 14 March), but we also need to get to grips with the huge increase in paved-over front gardens.</p> <p>We may need to find a place to park cars, but the case for having a green space around our homes is very persuasive. Not only do plants and trees help keep our homes cool in summer and warm in winter, but every blade of grass also absorbs carbon dioxide and emits oxygen, thus playing a part in stopping climate change. Green spaces in residential areas are an essential stopping-off point for butterflies, birds and bees.</p> <p>The Royal Horticultural Society reports that almost a third of front gardens are now paved over. The RHS Greening Great Britain campaign gives lots of hints to people who could be encouraged to leave space for flowers, shrubs or trees.</p> <p>If, like me, you\u2019d like to congratulate those who have a green front garden, visit Healthy Life Essex at <a href=\"https://healthylifeessex.co.uk/2019/07/whats-happening-to-front-gardens/\" title=\"\">https://bit.ly/2WeFH6L</a>, where you will find a downloadable thank-you card to pop through the letterbox.<br><strong>Eileen Peck</strong><br><em>Benfleet, Essex</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

  "<p>The Treasury and the Bank of England have promised fresh measures to blunt the impact of the Covid-19 virus on the economy, after currency traders delivered a brutal verdict on the global response to the crisis so far.</p> \n<p>Sterling tumbled to its weakest level against the US dollar in more than three decades. A flight of speculative money into the haven of the dollar led sterling to crash through $1.20 against the US currency.</p> \n<p>Andrew Bailey, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/20/andrew-bailey-appointed-head-of-bank-of-england\">new governor</a> of the Bank of England, warned Britain faced an economic emergency caused by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\"> Covid-19</a> and further measures would be needed to prevent widespread disruption turning into destruction.</p> \n<p>On another day of frenzy on the global financial markets, shares on Wall Street were down by 10% on news that Ford and General Motors were halting production until at least the end of the month. The pound ended trading in London at about $1.1750, a level not seen since 1985, other than during the quickly reversed \u201cflash crash\u201d of 2016.</p> \n<p>Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said he was alive to the urgency of finding new ways to support jobs and incomes, amid criticism from MPs on the Treasury select committee that not nearly enough had been done to deal with the expected sharp rise in unemployment and squeeze on living standards.</p> \n<p>Global equity markets suffered further hefty losses as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>The International Labour Organization said the initial impact of Covid-19 would be to add almost 25 million to global dole queues.</p></li> \n <li><p>Steve Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, was forced to deny telling the Senate that US unemployment could rise from under 4% to 20%.</p></li> \n <li><p>Oil prices fell 8% with the cost of Brent crude hitting its lowest level since the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p></li> \n <li><p>The euro rose against the dollar and the pound after the European Central Bank announced a \u20ac750bn (\u00a3706bn) asset-purchase programme.</p></li> \n <li><p>The Dow Jones industrial average \u2013 a key gauge of share prices in the US \u2013 fell below its level on the day of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017 and has now dropped 10,000 points in a month.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Sunak said the government was looking to change the law to enable ministers to bail out large companies.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere may well be an argument for the taxpayer, through the state, to step in and provide some short-term liquidity or other financing support to a private business,\u201d he told MPs.</p> \n<p>The chancellor\u2019s comments came amid concerns that a prolonged crisis could spell disaster for the steel and automotive industries.</p> \n<p>Honda, BMW and Toyota became the latest carmakers to close European plants, leaving Jaguar Land Rover as the last major car company still making vehicles in the UK.</p> \n<p>Work at plants that make more than 1m of the UK\u2019s annual output of 1.5m cars halted, with more than 20,000 staff sent home temporarily.</p> \n<p>The trade body UK Steel said: \u201cIn the absence of further major government interventions, a prolonged shutdown of the UK economy will quickly become terminal for the steel industry, leaving tens of thousands of workers without a job to support their families.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bailey sought to curb the global stock market rout by telling those who were making money by short-selling company stocks to \u201cjust stop\u201d.</p> \n<p>In short-selling, traders borrow a company stock with a view to selling it, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price and pocket the difference.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnybody who says, \u2018I can make a load of money by shorting\u2019, which might not be frankly in the interest of the economy or the interest of the people, just stop doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Bailey told BBC News in an interview.</p> \n<p>Bailey said in an earlier press conference that events had moved on rapidly in the week since the Bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-bank-of-england-makes-emergency-interest-rate-cut\">cut interest rates</a> and eased capital requirements on banks as part of a coordinated stimulus with Sunak\u2019s budget.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose were big steps we and the government took a week ago.

Many people are suffering, not just from ill health but also from the economic impact as well as the effects of social distancing and isolation.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there is much that government can and is doing, there is also a strong desire of the public to help others and there are local grassroots organisations that can provide vital support to people who need it.

And today he said that schools in England were closing, for most pupils, for the foreseeable future.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that schools in England would close for most pupils from Friday.</strong> And he refused to say how long the closures could last. (Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said schools in Scotland might not reopen before the summer holidays.) He said there would be exceptions for the children of \u201ccritical workers\u201d and for vulnerable children, but he gave very little detail of who will qualify. He also said that pupils who missed out on this summer\u2019s GCSEs and A levels (also cancelled) would get the qualifications they needed for university, but he was not able to say how this would happen. Here is his opening statement on this.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can announce today and Gavin Williamson making statement now in House of Commons that after schools shut their gates from Friday afternoon, they will remain closed for most pupils \u2013 for the vast majority of pupils- until further notice. I will explain what I mean by the vast majority of pupils.</p> \n   <p>The objective is to slow the spread of the virus and we judge it is the right moment to do that.</p> \n   <p>But of course, as I\u2019ve always said, we also need to keep the NHS going and to treat the number of rising cases. So we need health workers who are also parents to continue to go to work. And we need other critical workers with children to keep doing their jobs too \u2013 from police officers who are keeping us safe to the supermarket delivery drivers, social care workers who look after the elderly and who are so vital. We will be setting out more details shortly about who we mean in these groups.</p> \n   <p>So we therefore need schools to make provision for the children of these key workers who would otherwise be forced to stay home. And they will also need to look after the most vulnerable children.</p> \n   <p>This will mean there will of course be are far fewer children in schools and that will help us to slow the spread of the disease. And these measures are crucial to make sure the critical parts of the economy keep functioning and public services keep functioning.</p> \n   <p>So we are simultaneously asking nurseries and private schools to do the same, and we are providing financial support where it is needed. We are making provisions to supply meals and vouchers for children eligible for free school meals. And where some schools are already doing this, I want to make it clear we will reimburse the cost. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson refused to rule out introducing tighter self-isolation rules for London</strong>. There have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8c98d1c-6926-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">reports claiming a virtual lock-down in the capital is planned for the weekend.</a>Johnson did nothing to play down these suggestions, and instead he repeatedly stressed his willingness to go \u201cfurther and faster\u201d. In response to one question on this, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve always said that we are going to do the right measures at the right time.</p> \n   <p>Actually I think a lot of people are taking a real heroic effort to comply with the advice we\u2019ve given but as I\u2019ve said tonight, and in the past few days, we keep everything under continuous review and we will not hesitate in bringing forward further and faster measures where we think that is necessary.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He implied that people ignoring the government advice given on Monday to limit social contact were putting lives at risk.</strong> He declined an invitation to call these people immoral. But, in response to the question, he used probably his strongest language to date on this theme. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course people must make their own decisions, I\u2019m a believer as I say in freedom. </p> \n   <p>But let\u2019s be absolutely in no doubt that these are very, very important choices that we are now making in our daily lives and the more closely and the more strictly, more ruthlessly, we can enforce upon ourselves, our families the advice we are getting, then the better we will be able to protect our NHS, the fewer deaths we will have and the less suffering there will be in the UK population. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he had \u201cno intention\u201d of changing the law that rules out an extension of the Brexit transition. </strong>(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e725dda8f085c6327bc279b#block-5e725dda8f085c6327bc279b\"> 5.47pm.) </a>That is not the same as saying an extension will never happen, and his language will not dispel the widespread suspicions that an extension will now be inevitable.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He hinted that the government is planning bail-outs for struggling companies.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e725d268f088d7575595e99#block-5e725d268f088d7575595e99\"> 5.42pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"001b6fe86ac874f20cc292009a667699928178aa\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001b6fe86ac874f20cc292009a667699928178aa/0_22_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson gestures during a news conference regarding the coronavirus, in Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson gestures during a news conference regarding the coronavirus, in Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eddie Mulholland/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7267018f085c6327bc2821\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T18:23:50.698Z\">6.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The government will introduce emergency legislation to ban evictions for three months to help protect renters, Sky News reports.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBreak/status/1240339227646328833\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick says the Government will introduce emergency legislation to suspend new evictions from social or private rented accommodation \"during this national emergency\" amid the COVID-19 outbreak</p>\u2014 Sky News Breaking (@SkyNewsBreak) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNewsBreak/status/1240339227646328833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7261318f088d7575595edc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richardadams\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T18:01:06.318Z\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Education secretary <strong>Gavin Williamson</strong> told the Commons: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>After schools shut their gates on Friday afternoon they will remain closed until further notice this will be for all children, except to those of key workers and where children who are most vulnerable.</p> \n   <p>The scientific advice shows that the settings are safe for this small number of children to continue attending.

On Wednesday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, told parliament: \u201cWe will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Shelter said that it has been contacted by one renter who works at an NHS hospital who said their landlord wanted to evict them and the other tenants in the property, some of whom also work at the hospital, because he fears contracting the virus from them. The landlord reportedly added that unless a cure in found in the next few weeks, they will have to leave.</p> \n  <p>Another renter was illegally evicted while on holiday in <strong>Italy</strong> without notice after the landlord said they were worried they would catch the virus. The tenant offered to self-isolate for 14 days elsewhere before returning to the property, but the landlord still refused, Shelter said. The cases emerged from the charity\u2019s online help service and could not be verified by the Guardian.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Tens of thousands of renters face being turfed out of their home in the next six months if the government fails to act quickly,\u201d said Polly Neate, chief executive at Shelter. \u201cWe need a wholesale and complete halt to all evictions while the coronavirus crisis unfolds. The government has stepped to in to support mortgagees and it must now act decisively to help renters survive the current storm. It must legislate immediately to halt all eviction proceedings during this period of social disruption.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Renters\u2019 organisation Generation Rent said almost two-thirds of renters have no savings, at least 2 million live in houses of multiple occupation putting them at higher risk of contracting the virus, and there are 1.1m self-employed heads of households who rent their homes, who are at a high risk of losing work as a result of coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>Caitlin Wilkinson, policy manager at the campaign group, said: <br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We know that many landlords will take action to evict tenants, leaving them homeless in the midst of a pandemic.

The tone was always going to serious and sombre given the nature of the crisis facing the country. (Every single question was about coronavirus, by my count.) But the effect of holding it in a near-empty chamber also made a difference because there was no cheering or barracking. Boris Johnson had no noise cushion to help him through. It meant that what he said mattered more.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was pressed repeatedly, especially by Jeremy Corbyn, by Ian Blackford and most effectively of all by Chris Byrant, on what he was doing to help workers who will lose out from coronavirus and he was on slightly shaky ground. Ministers insist they will announce a package of employment support measures very soon, and Johnson repeatedly insisted that people should not lose out for doing the right thing (ie, for staying at home, even if they feel well) and he repeatedly said that he was willing to do whatever it took. To some extent, that still sounded more like a slogan than a strategy.</p> \n  <p>But PMQs should also been an opportunity for the prime minister to listen, as well as to communicate, and one would imagine than Johnson would have left the chamber more persuaded than ever about the need for some mass government intervention to protect workers. If Felicity Buchan, a Kensington Tory with a background in banking, is saying that the government does not need to worry about borrowing any more (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee#block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee\">12.29pm</a>), then it is hard to see what is restraining No 10.</p> \n  <p>Johnson has a proper announcement to make during the session. In response to a question from Corbyn, he confirmed that the government would legislate to protect renters from eviction during the coronavirus crisis. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can indeed confirm that we will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction, that is one thing we will do, but it is also important as we legislate that we do not simply pass on the problem, so we\u2019ll also be taking steps to protect other actors in the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also announced that coronavirus testing was being ramped up to 25,000 tests a day.

Like the CBI, it thinks the chancellor needs to go further. This is from <strong>Paul Johnson,</strong> the IFS\u2019s director.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The support through business rates holidays and payments is targeted directly at the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors many of which will be suffering a lot, especially in light of yesterday\u2019s new announcements discouraging people from patronising such businesses. This is a substantial level of support. However, it is probably not well targeted at saving jobs in those industries. It will remain as expensive to pay people and if demand is down then jobs are likely to go. Supporting employment might require a targeted package which included targeted cuts to employer national insurance contributions, a delay in increases to the national living wage, and increased support for individuals through universal credit. Government might also want to facilitate people being able to move into jobs where there is now much greater demand \u2013 delivery drivers and warehouse workers for example \u2013 in a way which allows them to return easily to their original jobs once the crisis is over.</p> \n   <p>Firms outside the leisure and hospitality sector have not been targeted with this additional direct support.

As Heather Stewart reports <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">in the Guardian\u2019s overnight splash, </a>Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, yesterday announced a \u00a3350bn package of loans and grants (\u00a3330bn in loan guarantees, \u00a320bn in grants and other handouts) to help businesses struggling as the economy grinds to a halt. Judging by today\u2019s front pages, national newspaper coverage is generally positive, but this morning the CBI, the country\u2019s biggest business organisation, joined the Labour party in saying this did not go far enough.</p> \n  <p>In an interview with the Today programme <strong>Carolyn Fairbairn</strong>, the CBI director general, said Sunak had announced a \u201cserious and massive package of measures\u201d, but she said firms needed help now to allow them to keep people in work. She said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The absolute top priority right now is for businesses to be able to keep their people in jobs, in employment, and we think there needs to be more on that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Fairbairn said the CBI wanted the government to use the national insurance system to pump money into companies. Instead of paying national insurance, they would get a cheque for \u201creverse national insurance\u201d from the government. She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is about using existing systems, it\u2019s all about speed. So the thought that we have put to the chancellor is to reverse national insurance contributions - not just defer or cancel them, but actually get the flow working in the other direction.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Fairbairn said a similar system was operating in Germany.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have a very well functioning national insurance system; reverse it, to enable businesses to make that judgment about whether to keep people or not keep them. This will be a very quick measures to introduce.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>She also suggested that VAT bills should be deferred.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are some very large tax bills hitting companies in the next few weeks. We have a \u00a335bn VAT bill. This is an immediate impact; it doesn\u2019t require businesses to apply for anything. So looking at the tax bills, and seeing if they can be cancelled or deferred.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This will not come as a surprise to Sunak, who said yesterday that he would be announcing employment support measures and that he was still working on the details with employers and unions.

  "<p>The ramifications of the coronavirus outbreak are still unfolding, changing how we work, interact and, for me at least, use social media. Self-isolation means that most of us are using our phones even more than usual. It was already a great deal, with the average <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/aug/02/fifth-of-britons-feel-stressed-if-they-cant-access-internet-ofcom-report\" title=\"\">Brit checking their phone </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/aug/02/fifth-of-britons-feel-stressed-if-they-cant-access-internet-ofcom-report\" title=\"\">about every 12 minutes of the waking day</a>. A digital detox is probably more necessary than ever during this period and yet also less feasible.</p> <p>Over the past few days, overwhelmed by rolling news coverage and conspiracy theories, I\u2019ve only managed to survive online by frequenting the \u201csunny side up\u201d social media channels that are so often the subject of ridicule.</p> <p>Most of us have a certain level of scepticism for the perma-positive brigade. I\u2019ve eye-rolled at the endless captions demanding \u201cgood vibes only\u201d. I\u2019ve scrolled past the posting of a reposting of a quote on silver linings, which appear only to be visible through rose-tinted sunnies. But I must admit, eternal optimists have been a godsend during this time.</p> <p>For me, the relentless, almost aggressive optimism of many Instagrammers is an unexpected comfort when I\u2019m distinctly lacking in any of my own.</p> <p>I\u2019ve come to love twee, child-like illustrations assuring that \u201cwe\u2019ve got this\u201d or reminding that we\u2019re \u201call in this together\u201d. Accounts documenting small, medium and big acts of kindness have been heartwarming displays of human spirit. When you are feeling powerless, Twitter users offering advice on how you too can muck in can make you feel slightly less so. Just last month, we urged each other to be kinder online via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/22/caroline-flack-final-plea-be-kind-hashtag\">the hashtag campaign #BeKind</a>, created after the tragic death of Caroline Flack (which itself illustrates just how sad and strange this year has already been) to little avail. And while the usual callousness will never disappear from the internet entirely, being in this for the long haul has meant that it finally occurred to me that I don\u2019t have to give it any time. Things are already dark enough.</p> <p>Snark and cynicism are mainstays of the world wide web \u2013 even the most wholesome corners of it usually have comment sections dripping in sarcasm. But there is nothing like being in the throws of a global pandemic to put the time you spend online in perspective. Like a social media Scrooge, faced with Covid-19 instead of Christmas, I\u2019ve found the true meaning of being on Instagram. Despite our previous scoffing, it\u2019s the \u201cLive, Laugh, Lovers\u201d who will inherit the Earth.</p>",

  "<p>As multiple cities go into lockdown across the US, services such as<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/grocery-delivery-apps-see-record-downloads-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/\"> </a>Instacart, Uber Eats, Seamless and DoorDash <a href=\"https://www.fox19.com/2020/03/17/food-delivery-drivers-expecting-surge-orders-following-restaurant-shutdown/\">are expecting huge surges</a> in delivery orders. Amazon is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-delivery-jobs-hiring-drivers-2019-5\">hiring hundreds of extra workers</a> to keep up with the demand. This raises an ethical dilemma: is it morally acceptable to ask others \u2013 normally in less secure jobs with worse pay \u2013 to take on a risk that you don\u2019t want to? </p> <h2><strong>Are couriers more at risk of catching Covid-19?</strong></h2> <p><em>Dr</em><em> Thomas Tsai, infectious diseases expert: </em>The Covid-19 virus is borne by droplets transmitted through, for example, coughing and sneezing. There is a unique challenge for food delivery couriers who are potentially traveling between multiple sites: from restaurants and from house to house. Especially if they are making deliveries to families who are in quarantine because they\u2019ve tested positive for the infection. Given the number of people they see daily, the deliverers are probably among those at greatest risk of exposure, so they do need to be careful. If we can minimize unnecessary food delivery, we should.</p> <h2><strong>Are there ways to reduce the risk to both customers and couriers?</strong></h2> <p><em>Dr</em><em> Stephen Morse, epidemiologist</em>: It\u2019s impersonal, and perhaps seems extreme, but a food delivery could be left in front of the door (and a tip left similarly for the delivery person), much as we do with other packages, so there\u2019s no need for face-to-face contact. There may be transmission through inanimate objects, which we can try to minimize with good hand hygiene. </p> <p>If the no-contact approach makes for too impersonal an interaction, keeping some distance (3-6ft, arm\u2019s length if both delivery person and recipient extend their arms?) is an alternative to consider. Delivery people should be washing their hands or using a suitable hand sanitizer after making deliveries. Along with healthcare and law enforcement/fire personnel, that may be a good group for more intensive testing.</p> <h2><strong>Is coronavirus transmissible via food or food containers?</strong></h2> <p><em>Tsai: </em>The early evidence suggests that the virus is inactivated by heat. So I think cooked foods minimize the risk of any transmission from the food itself. </p> <p>I don\u2019t have any data to be able to say yes or no regarding food containers. But again, I think it\u2019s a good idea until we get more information to still maintain some vigilance. So it\u2019s not a bad idea to wash your hands before you look through containers and potentially to wipe down some of the exterior surfaces. That\u2019s erring on the side of caution. But I think in this time of uncertainty, it\u2019s the prudent thing to do.</p> <h2><strong>Is it ethical to order food online?</strong></h2> <p><em>Carissa V\u00e9liz, ethicist: </em>Society always relies on a minority of people to carry out risky or unpleasant jobs that not everyone is willing to do. To be ethical, ideally, those people should be paid more than others who have more comfortable jobs. </p> <p>Try to do your best. If you order, treat couriers kindly and convey your ethical concerns to companies. Ask if workers\u2019 jobs are being made as safe as possible, and whether they can take sick leave. If you boycott, make sure companies know why you\u2019re doing it, otherwise it won\u2019t have the desired effect.</p> <p>And suppose you order from a family business where they are careful towards their workers and so on, then it\u2019s not clear to me that that it\u2019s unethical at all. On the contrary, one concern is that small businesses will go under during this time, and that will be terrible for the economy as a whole and for families too. So we have to balance it.</p> <p><em>Morse</em>: I think the real ethical questions are in the personnel policies. These delivery people do not get any paid sick leave and in fact, may not have any income if they\u2019re not working. If they\u2019re sick, or test positive, can they stay home until they\u2019re recovered and no longer infectious?</p> <h2><strong>What do couriers want people who are ordering in to know?</strong></h2> <p><em>Lauren Casey, gig workers organizer: </em>In general, consumers aren\u2019t aware that many, if not most, of the fees they are paying don\u2019t actually make it back to the worker, when they interact with the gig economy. So be careful making any assumptions about what fee the worker is being paid.</p> <p>These workers need good compensation especially because they don\u2019t have access or good access to benefits like paid time off or unemployment insurance. So it doesn\u2019t automatically make you bad if you order in.</p> <p><em>Wilfred Chan, courier: </em>Whether or not you order won\u2019t change the calculus for workers who have no choice but to do it either way. So the best you can do is be considerate. Here\u2019s how:</p> <ol> <li><p>Tip \u2013 that makes a huge difference. In New York, $2 is really the bare minimum, $5 is OK, but in this situation I really think $10-$15 would be fair considering the danger of every single trip.</p></li> <li><p>Social distancing \u2013 delivery apps now provide the option to ask for a no-contact drop-off. Whether you use an app or call over the phone, make sure the courier can drop it off in the lobby or outside the door and that will minimize the risk to both of you.</p></li> <li><p>Be considerate \u2013 If there are delays or mistakes in the order, please just forgive the delivery worker, they are under a lot of pressure right now. Please don\u2019t give them a one-star rating that could jeopardize their employment. </p></li> </ol> <p><em>Contributors: Lauren Casey, Gig Workers Rising, organizer; Wilfred Chan, courier; </em><em>Stephen S</em><em> Morse, </em><em>professor of </em><em>epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University; Thomas Tsai, </em><em>assistant </em><em>professor at Harvard T</em><em>H</em><em> Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard Global Health Institute</em><em>, surgeon at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital; Carissa V\u00e9liz, </em><em>practical ethicist, University of Oxford.</em></p>",

  "<p>The Lummi nation, a sovereign Native American tribe in the Pacific north-west, will soon open a pioneering field hospital to treat coronavirus patients, as part of a wave of strong public health measures which have gone further than many governments.</p> <p>Tribal leaders have been preparing for Covid-19 since the virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, with medical staff beefing up emergency plans, reorganizing services and gathering medical supplies, including test kits and personal protective equipment.</p> <p>The Lummi reservation is located in Whatcom county \u2013 115 miles north of Seattle, Washington, where the first US Covid-19 case was confirmed in January, followed by the first death in February.</p> <p>So far, the tribe has reported three Covid-19 cases, but expect numbers to rise as the pandemic progresses.</p> <p>\u201cWe quickly recognised the need to make sacrifices for the greater good, in order to protect our people and the wider community,\u201d said Dr Dakotah Lane, medical director of the tribal health service, who is in strict self-quarantine after coming into contact with a Covid-19 patient.</p> <p>As the Trump administration stalled, the tribe swiftly introduced mitigation and prevention measures such as social distancing, drive-through testing, telemedicine clinics, and a home delivery service for the elderly.</p> <p>The tribal council declared a state of emergency on 3 March \u2013 10 days before Donald Trump did the same in the US \u2013 and approved $1m to prepare and respond for the evolving pandemic, which includes setting up the hospital.</p> <p>A community fitness centre, located next to the tribe\u2019s health clinic, has been repurposed into a makeshift hospital, with beds, protective gear and other essential equipment in place. It will open once the pharmacy is fully stocked. The 20-bed hospital will treat less critical inpatients, in order to free up intensive care units in nearby facilities, and prioritize Native Americans from any tribe.</p> <p>\u201cOur unique approach has piqued a lot of state and federal interest, we\u2019re offering them a different model which shows that tribes are part of the solution in recovery efforts,\u201d said the tribal chairman, Lawrence Solomon. \u201cNo private organization is going to try what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p> <p>The tribe\u2019s proactive response to the evolving global pandemic has been possible thanks to vast improvements to the quality and capacity of its community healthcare system over the past decade.</p> <p>Like an increasing number of tribes, the Lummi nation has opted for \u201cself-determination\u201d which enables greater financial flexibility and clinical autonomy \u2013 as opposed to depending on the federally controlled Indian Health Service (IHS) which has suffered decades of severe underfunding.</p> <p>As a result, the Lummi health services raises substantial revenue by treating patients on Medicaid and Medicare \u2013 the third party billing program created by President Obama in 2010. This extra cash has allowed them to invest in infrastructure and build capacity: the tribe now has eight doctors compared with just three in 2013, including three physicians with public health expertise.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html\">CDC model</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html\">ing suggests that anywhere between 2.4 million and 21 million people i</a>n the US could require hospitalization during the course of the pandemic, potentially overwhelming the hospital system which has only 925,000 beds nationwide.</p> <p>The Lummi want to help. Dr Lane said: \u201cThe Lummi believe in controlling our own destiny. We don\u2019t count on help reaching us, but the hospital is something we can do to help the community.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Neil Ferguson, the man with the modelling evidence that underpins the government\u2019s coronavirus strategy, believes he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/top-uk-covid-19-expert-neil-ferguson-self-isolates-after-developing-symptoms\">contracted the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/top-uk-covid-19-expert-neil-ferguson-self-isolates-after-developing-symptoms\">bug himself</a>.</p> <p>Two days after attending the prime minister\u2019s announcement calling for Britain to voluntarily self-isolate, where he stood next to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, Ferguson has the cough and fever symptomatic of Covid-19.</p> <p>\u201cSigh. Developed a slight dry but persistent cough yesterday and self-isolated even though I felt fine. Then developed high fever at 4am today. There is a lot of Covid-19 in Westminster,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.</p> <p>Ferguson is a mathematician and an epidemiologist whose work on the spread of Covid-19 is informing policy in not only the UK but also France, the US and other countries as well. The centre he founded with colleagues at Imperial College, the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, collaborates with the World Health Organization.</p> <p>The massive shift in the UK response from essentially letting the virus spread through the population to the wholescale stay-at-home policy now in place resulted from Ferguson\u2019s work, supported by other modellers especially at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. </p> <p>Ferguson has taken a lead, advising ministers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/26/coronavirus-could-infect-100000-globally-experts-warn\">explaining his predictions</a> in newspapers and on TV and radio, because he is that valuable thing, a good scientist who is also a good communicator.</p> <p>Mathematical modelling is only as good as the data fed into the computers. It was new information on the high rate of patients needing critical care in Italy and on the limited ability of the NHS to respond to the pandemic that caused Ferguson and colleagues to recommend a switch from what they called scenario 1 \u2013 mitigation \u2013 to scenario 2 \u2013 suppression of the virus, including the drastic measures that have emptied the pubs, closed theatres and may yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/17/shutting-schools-would-reduce-coronavirus-transmission-expert\">shut all schools</a>.</p> <p>He is a workaholic, according to his colleague Christl Donnelly, a professor of statistical epidemiology based at Oxford University most of the time, as well as at Imperial. \u201cHe works harder than anyone I have ever met,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is simultaneously attending very large numbers of meetings while running the group from an organisational point of view and doing programming himself. Any one of those things could take somebody their full time.</p> <p>\u201cOne of his friends said he should slow down \u2013 this is a marathon not a sprint. He said he is going to do the marathon at sprint speed. It is not just work ethic \u2013 it is also energy. He seems to be able to keep going. He must sleep a bit, but I think not much.\u201d</p> <p>Donnelly met Ferguson when they were both working for Prof Roy Anderson\u2019s epidemiology group at Oxford University. Their first project together was modelling the BSE epidemic in cattle in 1996 and then the variant CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) outbreak in humans. </p> <p>They came up with an estimate that was incredibly broad for the likely number of human deaths \u2013 between 50 and 50,000 \u2013 but that was at a time when some were predicting 2 million people would be infected. There were calls for the sort of NHS resources now going into Covid-19 to be directed towards vCJD. Ferguson and Donnelly\u2019s modelling helped defuse that. In the end the UK had about 170 cases.</p> <p>Next came foot and mouth, then Sars, then pandemic influenza. With every disease outbreak, governments have turned to the modellers. While Donnelly, with her statistical training, could have had a quiet life as a researcher in the pharmaceutical industry discovering new drugs, she is instead watching the predictions she and Ferguson have made hit the headlines on the TV news. She says both of them were attracted to \u201chigh-impact\u201d projects.</p> <p>Ferguson may have the symptoms of Covid-19 but he is still working. At 9am he joined an online meeting with his colleagues as usual. The stakes are too high for somebody with his dedication and central role in the crisis to stay in bed. </p>",

PCR amplifies the genetic material so that you can easily detect it.\u201d</p> <h2>Is this testing method unique to Covid-19?</h2> <p>Lewin says the ingredients for testing for Covid-19 are generic, but an element of the test known as the primer \u2013 or hook \u2013 that\u2019s used to match the genetic material with the virus that causes Covid-19 is unique.</p> <p>Blood tests are also being carried out, that can detect if a person has previously been exposed to the virus.

However, on digitally \u201cremoving\u201d the low-density rock around the fossil using computer software, the team found something special.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as I did that, this incredible skull \u2013 one of the most incredible fossil bird skulls in the world \u2013 stared straight out at us, and we could not believe our eyes,\u201d said Field, noting that the lack of teeth and other features of the skull quickly suggested it was from an early modern bird.</p> <p>The team say<em> </em>the bird would have weighed about 400g, about half the size or less of a mallard duck. \u201cIt is the same size as a green-winged teal, which is one of the smallest ducks in the entire world,\u201d said Field. \u201cWe think it would have had a face that looked a little bit like a modern chicken, and the back of the skull looked a little bit more like a living duck,\u201d he said.

  "<p>The concept of insurance is marvellous. Individuals or corporations pay to spread risk across a large community, creating a greater degree of financial security and peace of mind, regardless of what challenges might end up materialising.</p> <p>In many cases it\u2019s worked flawlessly for centuries. Businesses burned to the ground can often emerge from the ashes in a matter of months. Disability and sickness mustn\u2019t spell certain bankruptcy. In the 18th century, the wives and children of deceased members of the Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office were guaranteed cash, thanks to what\u2019s believed to be one of the earliest examples of life insurance as we know it.</p> <p>The insured should be able to rely on an uncompromising safety net in the toughest of times, and yet - as we\u2019re enduring precisely such a time - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> is adding debilitating insult to unprecedented injury by exposing the shortcomings of the insurance sector: the system we\u2019re using is not fit for the modern world, and the cost of these deficiencies could well be cataclysmic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It wasn\u2019t always like this. In years gone by some insurers were more forgiving when it came to paying out when disease struck</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In theory everything looked quite all right. The vast majority of companies across the UK and beyond tend to have business interruption insurance that pays when they can\u2019t operate. A similar type of insurance, known as contingent business interruption insurance, comes into play when a critical supplier to an insured organisation can\u2019t function. If you\u2019re a company that makes smartphones in the US, but the Chinese factory supplying your microchips suddenly floods, you\u2019re likely to be protected. A French luxury goods company whose Indian fabric manufacturer has been wiped out by a storm? Same thing.</p> <p>The problem is that in the vast majority of cases, these policies cite \u201cdirect physical loss or damage\u201d as a requirement to be triggered. Quarantines and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-france-on-war-footing-as-europe-locks-down-macron\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-france-on-war-footing-as-europe-locks-down-macron\">travel bans</a> might make it impossible for a business to keep its doors open, but they don\u2019t constitute obvious physical damage. So as far as the insurer\u2019s concerned, it\u2019s not their problem.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always like this. In years gone by some insurers were more forgiving when it came to the prospect of paying out when disease struck, mostly because at that point major global disease was little more than a theoretical prospect. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\">Sars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola</a> provided a lesson in what was actually economically viable - how far insurers can be stretched - and suddenly it became pretty clear that the parameters would have to shift.</p> <p>The world has become much more interconnected. Supply chains are deeply complex and travel far easier. Bugs can be spread from one side of the planet to the other in a matter of hours while infecting hundreds en route. Taking on the risk of having to foot the bill of an uncontrollable pandemic has simply become unpalatable for anyone, particularly if no one can actually say for certain what the true extent of the impact might look like. It would be like asking an insurer to sign a blank cheque.</p> <p>In the best case scenario, businesses are aware of this and have made alternate provisions, even if these might be painfully pricey. In the worst case though, they\u2019re blind to the risk altogether. For smaller companies unable to hire a team of experts, understanding the nuances and caveats of what might look like a pro forma policy is an unenviable task. Ten years ago no one was stress-testing for coronavirus.</p> <p>So we need education. Businesses can\u2019t afford to be caught out as is happening now. They need to be able to scan the horizon and know what could be lingering up ahead: what provisions are in place and what risk truly means.</p> <p>Perhaps even more urgently, though, politicians need to understand the domino effects of an inadequate insurance sector. On Monday, Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">advised the public</a> against going to pubs, restaurants and bars.

But his response to Covid-19 is laughably inadequate | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Association of British Insurers was quick to point out that, even if the government were to force closures, the \u201cvast majority of firms won\u2019t have purchased cover that will enable them to claim on their insurance to compensate for their business being closed by the coronavirus\u201d. But it nonetheless admitted that some, typically larger, firms \u201cmight have purchased an extension to their cover for closure due to any infectious disease\u201d. Surely if the government can relatively easily provide a swift lifeline to even a tiny number of large businesses \u2013 businesses that provide jobs and jobs that support families - then that\u2019s a step worth taking.</p> <p>The hospitality sector is the UK\u2019s third largest in terms of employment. It accounts for about 9% of this country\u2019s jobs. According to the sector\u2019s trade body, its economic contribution is greater than that of the automotive, pharma and aeronautics sectors combined. An awful lot is at stake here - perhaps even more than our politicians truly realise. If the support isn\u2019t provided, we\u2019ll face certain disaster and a bitter hangover for years to come.</p> <p>It\u2019s human nature not to entertain the grimmest of ideas. We don\u2019t like to think about the worst case scenario because it\u2019s uncomfortable. But perhaps the lesson we\u2019re learning here is that we have to confront the inconvenient to protect ourselves.</p> <p>On Tuesday the government said it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">guarantee \u00a3330bn of loans</a> to businesses struggling in the face of coronavirus. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, also announced tax breaks in an effort to avert a full-blown recession. That\u2019s to be applauded, but the shortcoming of the insurance sector is just one example of why we need a structural and sweeping rethink of the way in which the government supports business.

  "<p>The world is in a critical state. The Covid-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading across countries, with a scale and severity not seen since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">devastating Spanish flu in 1918</a>. Unless coordinated global action is taken to contain it, the contagion will soon become an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/17/markets-covid-19-ftse-government-rescue-packages-airlines-pubs-compass-airbus-business-live\">economic and financial one</a> too.</p> <p>The magnitude of the crisis requires governments to step in. And they are. States are injecting stimulus into the economy while desperately trying to slow the spread of the disease, to protect vulnerable populations, and to help create <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/when-will-a-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\">new therapies and vaccines</a>. The scale and intensity of these interventions reminiscent of a military conflict \u2013 this is a war against the spread of the virus and economic collapse.</p> <p>And yet there is a problem. The intervention needed requires a very different framing from the one that governments have chosen. Since the 1980s, governments have been told to take a back seat and let business steer and create wealth, intervening only for the purpose of fixing problems when they arise. The result is that governments are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-senior-nhs-consultant-speaks-out\">not always properly prepared</a> and equipped to deal with crises such as Covid-19 or the climate emergency. By assuming that governments have to wait until the occurrence of a huge systemic shock before they resolve to take action, insufficient preparations are made along the way.</p> <p>In the process, critical institutions providing public services and public goods more widely \u2013 such as the NHS in the UK, where there have been <a href=\"https://www.bma.org.uk/news/media-centre/press-releases/2019/september/spending-review-another-missed-opportunity-for-health-funding-says-bma\" title=\"\">cuts to public health</a> totalling \u00a31bn since 2015 \u2013 are left weakened.</p> <p>The prominent role of business in public life has also led to a loss of confidence in what the government can achieve alone \u2013 leading in turn to the many <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-cost.html\">problematic public-private partnerships</a>, which prioritise the interests of business over the public good. For example, it has been well documented that public-private partnerships in research and development often favour \u201cblockbusters\u201d at the expense of less commercially appealing medicines that are hugely important to public health, including <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/who-berates-lack-innovation-when-it-comes-to-antibiotic-pipeline\">antibiotics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/contributors/pharma-vaccines.html\" title=\"\">vaccines</a> for a number of diseases with outbreak potential.</p> <p>On top of this, there is a lack of a safety net and protection for working people in societies with rising inequality, especially for those working in the gig economy with no social protection.</p> <p>But we now have an opportunity to use this crisis as a way to understand how to do capitalism differently. This requires a rethink of what governments are for: rather than simply fixing market failures when they arise, they should move towards actively shaping and creating markets that deliver sustainable and inclusive growth. They should also ensure that partnerships with business involving government funds are driven by public interest, not profit.</p> <p>First of all, governments must invest in, and in some cases create, institutions that help to prevent crises, and make us more capable to handle them when they arise. The UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/rishi-sunak-coronavirus-budget-speech\">emergency budget</a> of \u00a312bn for the NHS is a welcome move. But equally important is a focus on long-term investment to strengthen health systems, reversing the trends of recent years.</p> <p>Second, governments need to better coordinate research and development activities, steering them towards public health goals. Discovery of vaccines will necessitate international coordination on a herculean scale, exemplified by the extraordinary work of the <a href=\"https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-launches-new-call-for-proposals-to-develop-vaccines-against-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/\">Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations</a> (CEPI).</p> <p>But national governments also have a huge responsibility in shaping the markets by steering innovation to solve public goals, in the same way that has been done by ambitious public organisations such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) in the US, which funded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf\">what became the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf\"> internet</a> when it was solving the problem of getting satellites to communicate. A similar initiative in healthcare would make sure that public funding is geared to solving major health problems.</p> <p>Third, governments need to structure public-private partnerships to make sure both citizens and the economy benefit. Health is a sector that globally receives billions from the public purse: in the US, the National Institute of Health (NIH) invests $40bn a year. Since the 2002 Sars outbreak, the NIH <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/article/blind-spot/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=0a4b146b-3346-496c-8ff3-f294d3028bc9\">has spent $700m</a> on coronavirus research and development. The large public funding going into health innovation means governments should <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m769\" title=\"\">govern</a> the process to ensure prices are fair, patents are not abused, medicine supply is safeguarded and profits are reinvested back into innovation, rather than siphoned out to shareholders.</p> <p>And that if emergency supplies are needed \u2013 such as medicines, hospital beds, masks or ventilators \u2013 the same companies benefiting from public subsidies in good times must not speculate and overcharge in bad times. Universal and affordable access is essential not just at national level, but at international level. This is especially crucial for pandemics: there is no place for nationalistic thinking, like Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/trump-offers-large-sums-for-exclusive-access-to-coronavirus-vaccine\" title=\"\">attempt</a> to acquire an exclusive US licence for the coronavirus vaccine.</p> <p>Fourth, it is time to finally learn the hard lessons of the 2008 global financial crisis. As companies, from airlines to retail, come asking for bailouts and other types of assistance, it is important to resist simply handing out money. Conditions can be attached to make sure that bailouts are structured in ways that transform the sectors they\u2019re saving so that they become part of a new economy \u2013 one that is focused on the <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/sites/public-purpose/files/iipp-pb-04-the-green-new-deal-17-12-2018_0.pdf\" title=\"\">green new deal strategy</a> of lowering carbon emissions while also investing in workers, and making sure they can adapt to new technologies. It must be done now, while government has the upper hand.</p> <p>Covid-19 is a major event that exposes the lack of preparedness and resilience of the increasingly globalised and interconnected economy, and it certainly won\u2019t be the last. But we can use this moment to bring a stakeholder approach to the centre of capitalism. Let\u2019s not let this crisis go to waste.</p> <p>\u2022 Mariana Mazzucato is professor of economics at University College London and author of The Value of Everything</p>",

And now it appears Tom Brady will spend the final years of his professional career <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/tom-brady-tampa-bay-bucs-nfl-free-agency\">playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>.</p> <p>I repeat: Tom Brady, he of six Super Bowls, New England Patriots fame, is departing the most successful team in modern NFL history and is all but certain to move his operation to Tampa, Florida, in order to join a team with the NFL\u2019s third-worst record over the past decade. The Patriots went 125-35 between 2010 and 2019, winning three Super Bowls: The Buccaneers: 59-101, with zero playoff appearances.</p> <p>Brady leaving the Patriots to join the Bucs is as much about lifestyle as anything else. Tampa\u2019s coach, Bruce Arians, is famed for his laidback, there\u2019s-more-to-life-than-football style. He drinks beers in the parking lots with the players and their families after games. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bruce-arians-fire-bucs-coaches-missing-kids-events-2019-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\">He threatens to fire coaches</a> if they miss a dance recital or ballgame or a family member\u2019s birthday. \u201cThose years don\u2019t come back,\u201d Arians famously said.</p> <p>Arians certainly does not reflect the ruthless, win at all costs Patriot Way. For Brady, a man soon-to-be in his mid-40s, the family stuff starts to matter a whole lot more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/new-england-patriots-tom-brady-leaves-nfl-football-boston\">Hated by Them, loved by Us. With Tom Brady's exit the Patriots dynasty is over</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are football reasons for the switch, too. The Bucs have one of the best two-man receiving tandems in the sport: Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. There is also a chance Antonio Brown joins the group. He and Brady have remained in close contact, and Brown worked under Arians back in his Pittsburgh days. And you can chuck into that mix tight end OJ Howard, who is as physically gifted as any at his position in the sport, though he fell victim to Arians\u2019 scheme \u2013 which almost vehemently opposes the use of tight-ends as pass-catchers \u2013 in the coach\u2019s first season in Tampa.</p> <p>The Bucs were impressive on both sides of the ball last season, despite Jameis Winston tossing 30 interceptions. In fact, it\u2019s likely that Brady surveyed the landscape and sought out the best possible defense rather than offense when making his decision. The Bucs defense <a href=\"https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/team-defense/2019\">finished fifth in DVOA</a> last season. The other two Brady suitors? The Raiders, 31st; the Chargers, 21st.</p> <p>The fit between coach and quarterback remains iffy. Arians is known as a fun-n-gun coach, someone who wants his quarterbacks to make long throws. When his offenses have been at their best \u2013 first in Pittsburgh and then in Arizona \u2013 it\u2019s been when he\u2019s had a strong-armed quarterback who could throw the ball deep down the field outside the numbers, often supplemented with a sound running game.</p> <p>That\u2019s not Brady. He is a rhythm player: hit the back foot, get the ball out. Everything he does is about precision and timing. In New England, Brady was also the master of pre-snap manipulation. He controlled everything and the Patriots ran everything: two-back sets, spread-sets, motions, shifts, fullbacks, h-backs. The Patriots align players anywhere and everywhere. Players\u2019 roles shift on a week-to-week, concept-to-concept basis. Wide receivers become ball-carriers, and they shift between inside and perimeter positions. Running backs are used as a deep threat in the passing game. It was a complex, all-encompassing system.</p> <p>And it all flowed through Brady. He digested each morsel of information and made sure the team used the best play possible against whichever look a defense presented. Indeed, the Patriots system was always at its best when Brady was able to jump into the no-huddle, marshaling things alone at the line of scrimmage.</p> <p>None of that fits the Arians philosophy. The coach is more rigid, more reliant on a core set of plays, with far less pre-snap motion, which typically helps a quarterback identify what a defense is trying to do. Over the past decade, Brady\u2019s Patriots have hovered around the 20% motion mark. The Bucs under Arians: 6%.</p> <p>Adjustments flow both ways. Will Arians let Brady bring the New England blueprint with him? Will Brady welcome a shift away from a system that puts so much focus on his decision-making and timing rather than letting him just go out there and rip it?</p> <p>Remember: Brady will be 43 by the time the new season starts. His arm remains as strong as it\u2019s been since the early 2010s, but, barring a wild 2007 run, throwing the ball vertically has never been his biggest strength. Will Arians be happy running a system reliant on precise, underneath routes? If it works, you would think so.</p> <p>But it remains an essential question the pair must figure out together. Taking deep dropbacks would be a recipe for disaster. Tampa Bay\u2019s offensive-line ranks anywhere from solid to good by most metrics. They finished 22<sup>nd</sup> in adjusted sack rate and 16<sup>th</sup> in pressure rate. But even those numbers were slightly inflated by Winston\u2019s, umm, ability to go off-script, break a play, and avoid sacks.</p> <p>Tampa\u2019s group has talent, most notably inside. But they\u2019re a group built for an Arians offense, not a Brady one. They maul people in the run-game then set deep in the passing game.</p> <p>The shift to Brady couldn\u2019t be more radical. Brady isn\u2019t utterly immobile, but he\u2019s not exactly mobile either. He\u2019s a pocket shuffler. Others bob and weave like a boxer, keeping a play alive until they scamper away or find an open teammate. Brady likes to adjust the radar of a pass-rusher by a fraction. At high speed, it feels like a world of difference. They can see still him. It looks like he\u2019s in the same spot, but for some reason, he\u2019s now out of range. It is exceptionally effective, but only to a point. Brady has noticeably become gun-shy in the past two seasons, chucking the ball into the dirt or throwing it away in order to avoid big hits. There were times last season where he was inching closer to the fossil most quarterbacks become at the very end.</p> <p>But Brady is still good. That\u2019s important to note. Is he the Brady of old? No. But he still ranks as a league-average starter, one with a rolodex of football information stored in his brain. Wriggle his way into the post-season, and with the weapons, he has on the perimeter and a frisky Bucs defense, he would have a shot. That, along with a new challenge and a less pressurized environment, was probably what he was looking for.</p> <p>None of his other options were great. In Jon Gruden and the Las Vegas Raiders, he would have found a better schematic fit and someone who shares his football psychopathy. It wouldn\u2019t have been all that much fun, though. The Los Angeles Chargers, meanwhile, are a rotating morass of mediocrity and the little brother in a city that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/07/away-fans-nfl-los-angeles-rams-chargers-home-crowds\">yet to prove it has an appetite for professional football</a>. In Tampa, Brady has found the best of some not-great situations. Arians is smart enough to step back or push, depending on what is needed.</p> <p>This move was about ego and joy. About respect. About credit, and how we, as a collective, apportion it between Brady and Belichick. Now, they will both go it alone, albeit at the back-end of their careers. Maybe Brady won\u2019t win a Lombardi, but as a steady hand on a team with a bunch of young talent, he will surely have some fun.</p>",

  "<p>The development geographer Sylvia Chant, who has died aged 60 of pancreatic cancer, challenged the idea that households headed by women were automatically more likely to live in poverty than those headed by men.</p> <p>When she began her research in the 1980s, much other research and policymaking portrayed households headed by women in the developing world as poverty-ridden. Sylvia argued that it was not necessarily poverty in itself that disadvantaged women in cities of the global south, but rather their multiple household responsibilities and obligations in relation to men.</p> <p>Her fieldwork in Mexico, Costa Rica, the Philippines and the Gambia showed that measuring the incidence of poverty through measuring the number of households headed by women was inaccurate.</p> <p>In her books <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9780230378049\" title=\"\">Women-headed Households</a> (1997) and <a href=\"https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/gbp/gender-generation-and-poverty-9781843769927.html\" title=\"\">Gender, Generation and Poverty</a> (2007) she demonstrated that such households were more numerous than is usually assumed, but also could provide women with autonomy and freedom. She recounted numerous stories of how women who headed households and their daughters were much more likely to go out to work as they were free from the control of husbands and fathers who often forbade women from entering the labour market.</p> <p>Even though these women were able to make their own decisions, she also highlighted the dangerous tendency for them to take on multiple responsibilities inside and outside the home, balancing domestic and paid work.</p> <p>Sylvia really engaged with the women \u2013 and to a lesser extent, men \u2013 whom she interviewed and kept in touch with many of them years after her first encounters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"396a4d08801520b5ba0033ad6d5f4277b2459f67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/396a4d08801520b5ba0033ad6d5f4277b2459f67/0_0_968_1219/794.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvia Chant at the Dropping of the Knife campaign in Wassu, the Gambia, in 2013\" width=\"794\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvia Chant at the Dropping of the Knife campaign in Wassu, the Gambia, in 2013</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keen to work with other researchers, she co-authored and edited 11 of her 18 books, including four that we wrote together, of which the most recent was <a href=\"https://www.environmentandurbanization.org/cities-slums-and-gender-global-south-towards-feminised-urban-future\" title=\"\">Cities, Slums and Gender in the Global South</a> (2016).

For example, she co-authored the UN-Habitat report <a href=\"http://www.zaragoza.es/contenidos/medioambiente/onu/994-eng.pdf\" title=\"\">State of Women in Cities 2012-13</a>, arguing for acknowledgment that cities everywhere had large numbers of female-headed households and that gender issues must be taken into account in urban planning if cities are to prosper in the future.</p> <p>Her work with the <a href=\"http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/57870/\" title=\"\">Gambia Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children</a> contributed to the country\u2019s final outlawing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/female-genital-mutilation\" title=\"\">female genital mutilation</a> in 2015.</p> <p>Born in Dundee, Sylvia was the daughter of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jun/16/stuart-chant-obituary\">Stuart Chant</a>, a microbiologist, and his wife, June (nee McCartney), a legal secretary. She grew up in London and attended Lady Margaret school in Parsons Green and, for the sixth form, Kingston College. She gained a geography degree (1981) at <a href=\"https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">King\u2019s College, Cambridge</a>, where she developed her feminist approach to her life and work.</p> <p>This led to her PhD at University College London in 1984, supervised by Peter Ward and <a href=\"https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/people/emeritus/alan-gilbert\" title=\"\">Alan Gilbert</a>, studying <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272929299_Family_Formation_and_Female_Roles_in_Queretaro_Mexico\" title=\"\">the role of women in the construction of housing in Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico</a>. This was among the first studies that recognised women as key actors in self-build housing in poor urban communities in countries of the global south.</p> <p>Following a postdoctoral position at UCL, and a year at the University of Liverpool, in 1988 Sylvia moved to the LSE. She worked in its department of geography and the environment and in conjunction with its gender institute (now department) for the rest of her career.</p> <p>Her first book, Women in the Third World (1989, with <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/dasa/brydon-lynne.aspx\" title=\"\">Lynne Brydon</a>), argued for the importance of analysing women\u2019s roles in rural and urban areas of the global south, drawing on voices and interpretations from the grassroots rather than crude statistical analyses. <a href=\"https://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/book/10.3362/9780855987916\" title=\"\">Mainstreaming Men into Gender and Development</a> (2000, with <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/gutmann\" title=\"\">Matthew Gutmann</a>) argued for the importance of including men in gender and development debates and projects, suggesting that genuine feminist transformation would not be possible without such engagements, while ensuring that women were not re-excluded.</p> <p>Sylvia\u2019s research also shed light on countries such as Costa Rica and the Gambia, where limited research on gender issues had previously been undertaken. In Costa Rica, she worked in the province of Guanacaste, traditionally associated with cattle ranching and tourism, to show that women\u2019s lives in small towns were dominated by short-term out-migration of men to work in seasonal agriculture and that it was women who were the bastions of households and communities.</p> <p>In the Gambia, in contrast to much research that focuses on sex tourism, she worked not only on FGM but also on gender and youth and how school enrolments alone did little to ensure that young women were able to develop personal freedom and decent employment in later life; this would only be possible with educational policies that integrated gender equity into curriculum development.</p> <p>After a first marriage that ended in divorce, in 2002 Sylvia married Chris Mogridge; he survives her, along with her mother, June, and two sisters, Adrienne and Yvonne.</p> <p>\u2022 Sylvia Hamilton Chant, development geographer, born 24 December 1958; died 18 December 2019</p>",
  "<p>Pandemics don\u2019t just affect our health \u2013 they rip through our economies, too. For many people affected by the coronavirus, including those who don\u2019t fall sick, economic survival will be a primary concern. When businesses close and workers no longer get paid, the bills for unpaid rents, mortgages and consumer loans quickly accumulate. Cities have already shut down swaths of their transport services, shops, cafes and cinemas. Mass lay-offs are on the horizon. Unemployment insurance will cover some, at least for a time. But self-employed and temporary workers, and households that live pay-cheque to pay-cheque, don\u2019t have such buffers.</p> <p>If you have some savings and only a little debt, the situation is tricky enough. But since the debt-fuelled financial crisis in 2008, household debt has grown. In the UK, total household debt stood at \u00a31.28 trillion for the period from April 2016 to March 2018 according to the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddebtingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018\">Office of National Statistics</a> (ONS).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/governments-crisis-coronavirus-business\">This crisis calls for massive government intervention: here's how to do it | Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>UK households now owe a record average of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/07/average-uk-household-debt-now-stands-at-record-15400\">\u00a315,385 to credit card companies, banks and other lenders</a>.<strong> </strong>Significantly, the UK\u2019s total household debt was three times larger than the total wealth held by <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddebtingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018\">its </a><em><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddebtingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018\">lowest</a></em><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddebtingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018\"> wealth decile</a>. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html\">US Federal Reserve</a> reports that household debt had reached a new high by the end of 2019: aggregate household debt stands at $14.15 trillion, $1.5 trillion higher in nominal terms than in 2008.</p> <p>The 2008 crisis should have been a reminder that debt is not a substitute for income. Likewise, ensuring households can afford the basics of everyday life by broadening access to loans and credit cards is no replacement for effective social policy. But instead of heeding these lessons, governments focused on fixing the financial sector, bailing out the banks to ensure they would lend again.</p> <p>Low interest rates made it seem as if the debt that households and firms accumulated would be manageable. Yet according to the ONS, households in the UK that rented rather than owned their property or had an unemployed primary earner were already <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddebtingreatbritain/april2016tomarch2018\">experiencing debt problems</a> prior to the 2008 crisis. To make matters worse, the management of excessive debt was <a href=\"http://private-law-theory.org/?p=18546\">privatised after the crash;</a> <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/debt-solutions/individual-voluntary-arrangements/\">Individual Voluntary Arrangements </a>(IVAs) replaced personal bankruptcy, often at great expense to borrowers.</p> <p>As a result, we are now watching two overlapping crises unfold: the coronavirus pandemic, and the economic threat it poses to our debt-fuelled economy. We urgently need debt relief \u2013 especially for households at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum. Most interventions that governments have taken so far have targeted<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\"> financial markets and businesses</a>. Unless governments also implement measures aimed at indebted households and renters, such measures are unlikely to prevent a meltdown driven by rapidly falling demand for goods and services.</p> <p>The economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez have called for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/governments-crisis-coronavirus-business\">social insurance scheme</a> to tackle the economic shock wrought by coronavirus. This would broaden the government\u2019s role, making it not just a lender but a buyer of last resort. The scheme would compensate for the demand that has evaporated from the economy. With the airline industry, for example, if demand for flights drops by 80%, the government would buy 80% of plane tickets. Small and medium-size businesses, which are the least insulated against economic shocks, are most likely to benefit from this intervention. Still, on its own, this wouldn\u2019t alleviate the stress of many deeply indebted households.</p> <p>As the crisis deepens, policy makers will inevitably focus on trying to rescue the financial institutions that are central to our economic system from collapse. This is how most crises unfold. Households are usually treated as peripheral to the system. The failure of many households does not put the system at risk, and can therefore be treated as an afterthought. Crises begin at the periphery, in the absence of wealth cushions or other safety valves, and eventually ripple back towards the centre. Early interventions to stabilise the periphery can therefore help mitigate stress at the centre of the system. Even more importantly, such measures help instil trust and legitimacy in government interventions aimed at stabilising financial institutions.</p> <p>Debt relief programmes have a long history. In the US, for example, debt moratoria were fairly common in the 19th century. An agricultural economy that relied heavily on debt was highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks, such as the collapse of global commodity markets. Many state legislatures temporarily suspended debt enforcement, or mandated government powers over foreclosures and asset sales. More recently, India implemented a debt relief programme in the midst of the 2008 crisis to support the agricultural sector, where a rising tide of suicides signalled the deep distress of many farmers. <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/701902?mobileUi=0&amp;\">Empirical studies</a> have shown that these interventions significantly lowered the rate of subsequent default among indebted households.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/boris-johnson-covid-19-response\">Johnson says this is war. But his response to Covid-19 is laughably inadequate | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be sure, it is not easy to tailor debt relief to only truly distressed households. There will always be free riders who will take advantage of debt relief packages without needing to do so. But this shouldn\u2019t prevent governments from intervening now. There is no better example of an exogenous shock than coronavirus. The overriding concern today shouldn\u2019t be moral hazards, but massive default rates that will leave millions of people destitute.</p> <p>To treat the economic fallout of coronavirus, governments should directly assume the debt of high-risk households. Trying to incentivise financial intermediaries to modify the terms of existing loans, as the US government did with the Home Affordable Modification Program after the 2008 crisis, will be too slow to meet the current challenge.</p> <p>It\u2019s often said that the public health of the majority is determined by the most vulnerable in society. The same logic applies to a healthy political and economic system: its stability depends on how it treats its weakest members. Hedging our bets on an economic system that has neglected these truths and instead prioritised wealth creation at the top has put us all at risk. There is still a small window to rectify these past wrongs, by urgently granting debt relief to the households worst affected by coronavirus.</p> <p>\u2022 Katharina Pistor is the author of <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178974/the-code-of-capital\">Code of Capital: How the Law Creates Wealth and Inequality</a><br><br></p>",

  "<p>As anyone in the midst of a divorce, or indeed a comedian on a sunny day during the Edinburgh fringe knows: THE SHOW MUST GO ON, in spite of a lack of willing audience. During these times of social distancing, how do you make funny when nobody is watching? It is a question entertainers across the world are now being forced to consider.</p> <p>As one of the aforementioned two groups of people I can probably teach you a thing or two. Not divorced that is, although depending on how long this quarantine thing lasts I guess you never know. If I\u2019m being honest, it would most likely be him who broke it off, after weeks of being confined with a comedian who has no measurable performance feedback and who after week one resorted to streaking through the flat naked screaming: \u201cLOOK AT ME\u201d! Could you really blame him?</p> <p>But in these troubling times, the real victims are, of course, the chatshow hosts, late-night monologists and quizmasters who are facing rows of empty seats. Won\u2019t someone think of them for once? TV shows are continuing to be recorded for the time being, but most have taken the decision to go ahead without live studio audiences, so here are some tips for audience-free success.</p> <h2>Make eye contact</h2> <p>Make do with what you have. One year at the fringe, I performed my show Dictators to an audience of two. In this situation I find the best option is to divide and conquer. So I performed 30 minutes of my material making direct eye contact with the woman. Then the other half doing the same at the man, but more flirtily. Now any quiz show host can deploy this tactic, just perform directly at the contestants at full volume and performance level. If they don\u2019t laugh at that pun about Gaddafi then shout: \u201cWHY DID YOU COME HERE IF YOU DIDN\u2019T WANT TO LAUGH, DARREN\u2019 like I did.</p> <h2>Picture the audience naked</h2> <p>First you have to imagine them, of course. This is quite fun and it can take up to an hour to really fill those seats up, depending on how big your Edinburgh venue is \u2026 sorry i mean TV studio. You can do some of the work in your dressing room or between hand washes before you get to the set. Have fun with it: who is going to be in your audience tonight? Your local shopkeeper, your ex, that neighbour you try to flirt with or Jeff Goldblum. Once you\u2019ve got them all seated within your mind palace then go ahead and individually disrobe them. What do you mean that sounds creepy? This is a very useful exercise that will distract you from the echo your words will make as they rattle around an empty room and ping off plastic chairs like faulty fireworks. Oh damp squib.</p> <h2>Use puppets</h2> <p>Before the recording, spend some time on something crafty like sticking goggly eyes on a sock. Then stick the sock on your hand and every time you land a zinger (late night) or a dad joke (quiz show) it\u2019s go time. Tip your sock hand back and let it guffaw. Maybe you could even do a little chat with the sock, back and forth. You could script this, of course:</p> <p><strong>Host: </strong>Have you ever noticed that Corona is also a beer? Like don\u2019t bring the wrong one to the party.</p> <p><strong>Sock</strong>: Ah ha ha ha! Hilarious, I haven\u2019t heard it, DO MORE!</p> <p><strong>Host:</strong> Well, Boris thinks it hostile, ugly and needs to be isolated! And that\u2019s just Farage \u2026</p> <p><strong>Sock:</strong> Boom! You are killing it!</p> <p><strong>Host: </strong>What the virus? Oh wow! Ok over to Ian Hislop\u2019s team.</p> <h2>Don\u2019t apologise for the lack of laughter</h2> <p>Instead cry one solitary tear at the end of every joke. You are allowed to be a sad clown, like Pierrot. Go with where the mood takes you. If they don\u2019t like it then that is their fault. Every great artist is misunderstood</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jul/20/james-cordens-a-stateside-smash-so-why-cant-the-uk-do-late-night\">James Corden's a Stateside smash, so why can\u2019t the UK do late night?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Comfort in comedy</h2> <p>Remember that breathing some levity into this very scary time is actually a privilege. That, at a time like this, art and entertainment comes into its own. What a gift to be able to provide a distraction even if fleeting. Can you make someone laugh at a time they really needed it? You can be the person that helps them get through this. So imagine everyone at home excited to watch this when it airs on TV or whichever streaming service it lands on. That every joke you say is a lifeline to people on a lonely island. Also for yourself: imagine that we will get through this. We will persevere and there will be more of a sense of togetherness than we have ever seen in our lifetime.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Tiff Stevenson is still running her new material comedy night Old Rope every Monday via Instagram live, @tiffstevensoncomic</em></p>",

Nothing is materialising quick enough; [financial support] doesn\u2019t seem to be filtering down. The situation is really dire. For small businesses this is going to be catastrophic. We will get through this but what the industry looks like at the end is impossible to say.\u201d</p> <p>Her call for immediate action has been echoed across the sector. Following the news of the stimulus package, Abta said measures such as government-backed loans should be made available immediately to travel businesses, with clear guidelines on how businesses can access them.</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s promise that the government would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d came just hours after warnings that the global tourism sector was fighting for survival. In an open letter published on 17 March, the World Travel and Tourism Council said: \u201cThe travel and tourism sector is uniquely exposed, and we estimate 50 million jobs globally are at risk. It is calling for immediate financial assistance to protect the incomes of millions of people who work in travel and tourism; unlimited, interest-free loans for travel companies; and all taxes and other dues to be waived for the next 12 months.\u201d Without these interventions, the WTTC said, economies around the world faced \u201can existential threat.\u201d</p> <p>Signed by WTTC president Gloria Guevara, the letter \u201cimplores\u201d governments to take drastic action to protect the sector, which is responsible for creating one in five new jobs.</p>",

  "<p>Nicholas Stern, one of the most prominent global experts on the climate crisis, has urged Boris Johnson to resist calls to postpone vital UN climate talks this year, despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/02/vital-cop26-climate-talks-could-be-derailed-by-coronavirus\">coronavirus</a> outbreak.</p> <p>Ministers and officials have privately discussed the possibility of postponing the Cop26 talks scheduled for Glasgow this November, but no decision has yet been taken. Travel bans and the shutdown imposed in many countries because of the virus have resulted in cancelled meetings and officials working remotely.</p> <p>Lord Stern believes any move to postpone the talks would put paid to any hope of making real progress. \u201cAt the moment we must just get on with the preparation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is such an urgent challenge and there is so much to do, and so much valuable work that is being done, that we can\u2019t afford to lose the momentum.\u201d</p> <p>At Cop26 \u2013 the 26th conference of the parties \u2013 countries are supposed to come up with more stringent plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions, because current plans under the Paris agreement are inadequate. The UK was hoping to bring many countries to the table <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/saving-the-planet-uk-role-vital-if-cop-26-climate-talks-to-succeed\">with pledges to hit net zero carbon by 2050</a>, a target that the UK has already enshrined in law.</p> <p>Stern said work had become more difficult because of the virus, but not impossible. Postponing the summit now would effectively put the brakes on at a time when acceleration is needed, he said, and if needs be then a postponement could be discussed after the summer, depending on the situation then.</p> <p>Stern is backed by other former high-ranking diplomats. Yvo de Boer, a former chief of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), who led talks in Copenhagen in 2009 that ended in acrimony, said it was vital to keep working towards a November Cop26. \u201cIf it is going to be cancelled, that should only be done at the last possible minute \u2013 in October,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\ufeffOne former high-ranking official who helped put together the Paris agreement said: \u201cCancelling now might look like the UK was grasping too soon for a way out of an important meeting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89ffbc03a5b6a575d35aefa320a1aaff97813470\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89ffbc03a5b6a575d35aefa320a1aaff97813470/0_202_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicholas Stern\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicholas Stern: \u2018We can\u2019t afford to lose the momentum.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Nicholson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some NGOs and developing country experts also view talk of postponement as counterproductive. Mohamed Adow, the director of <a href=\"https://powershiftafrica.org/\">Power Shift Africa</a> and a close observer of the talks for many years, said: \u201cWe would rather not see it cancelled until we know more about the spread of the virus. Cancelling it immediately might mean action on climate change gets ignored this year and people on the frontlines in poorer countries can\u2019t afford that.\u201d</p> <p>Janine Felson, the deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: \u201cWe cannot afford to lose any momentum. We should all focus our energies on ensuring that we can support each other through this trying time and continue to push for ambition.\u201d</p> <p>But some experts contacted by the Guardian believe postponing the talks would provide more time for diplomacy. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, has written to Alok Sharma, the business secretary and president of Cop26, urging him to delay.</p> <p>He said: \u201cPostponement is very different to cancellation. It would be the same president, the same venue, the same two countries co-hosting, so all you are doing is having a slight delay. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/07/mary-robinson-attacks-unhelpful-uk-over-cop-26-climate-talks\">The UK got off to a slow start</a> [in launching its strategy for hosting Cop26] so postponement would give more time for the work that is needed.\u201d </p> <p>One key issue is that the US presidential election is due to take place a week before Cop26 begins. Donald Trump is strongly opposed to the Paris agreement and his withdrawal from it will take effect the day after the election. A new president, if there is one, could be more amenable to climate action but would not take office until January, so a postponement could allow the US to participate.</p> <p>Paul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute in the US, said: \u201cOne distinct advantage of delay until spring 2021 is the growing prospect that US voters will turn Trump\u2019s climate nihilism out of office in favour of Joe Biden\u2019s robust climate ambition, infusing global negotiations with far greater importance and momentum.\u201d</p> <p>Some pre-Cop meetings are already in doubt. The UNFCCC has cancelled all meetings for the next month but a decision will have to be taken soon on an intermediate meeting set for Bonn in June. Italy is due to co-host Cop26 with the UK but its plans have been thrown into disarray by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The UK government has said there are no plans for a change. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe continue to work towards hosting the event in Glasgow in November, which is eight months away. Given this is an evolving situation we are keeping the situation under careful review.\u201d</p> <p>The UNFCCC also said there was no immediate move to postpone the talks. Any decision would have to be taken by the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/bureau-of-the-cop-cmp-and-cma\">Cop Bureau</a>, made up of elected representatives from various countries, and would also involve the Chilean government, which technically will preside over the process until the UK officially takes on the presidency in November. </p>",

  "<p>On 24 January, Chinese doctors and scientists reported the first description of a new disease caused by a novel coronavirus. They described how a strange series of cases of pneumonia had presented in December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and the capital of Hubei province. At that time, 800 cases of the new disease had been confirmed. The virus had already been exported to Thailand, Japan and South Korea.</p> <p>Most of the 41 people described in this first report, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext\">published</a> in the Lancet, presented with non-specific symptoms of fever and cough. More than half had difficulties in breathing. But most worryingly of all, a third of these patients had such a severe illness that they had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Most developed a critical complication of their viral pneumonia \u2013 acute respiratory distress syndrome. Half died.</p> <p> The Chinese scientists pulled no punches. \u201cThe number of deaths is rising quickly,\u201d they wrote. The provision of personal protective equipment for health workers was strongly recommended. Testing for the virus should be done immediately a diagnosis was suspected. They concluded that the mortality rate was high. And they urged careful surveillance of this new virus in view of its \u201cpandemic potential\u201d.</p> <p>That was in January. Why did it take the UK government eight weeks to recognise the seriousness of what we now call Covid-19?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/britain-faces-economic-emergency-warns-new-bank-of-england-governor-andrew-bailey-covid-19\">Britain faces economic emergency, warns new Bank of England governor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2003, Chinese officials were heavily criticised for keeping the dangers of a new viral disease, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/02/qanda.society\">severe </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/02/qanda.society\"> acute </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/02/qanda.society\"> respiratory </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/02/qanda.society\"> syndrome</a> (Sars), secret. By 2020, a new generation of Chinese scientists had learned their lesson. Under immense pressure, as the epidemic exploded around them, they took time to write up their findings in a foreign language and seek publication in a medical journal thousands of miles away. Their rapid and rigorous work was an urgent warning to the world. We owe those scientists enormous thanks.</p> <p>But medical and scientific advisers to the UK government ignored their warnings. For unknown reasons they waited. And watched.</p> <p>The scientists advising ministers seemed to believe that this new virus could be treated much like influenza. Graham Medley, one of the government\u2019s expert scientific advisers, was disarmingly explicit. In an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p086hjgc\">interview on Newsnight</a> last week, he explained the UK\u2019s approach: to allow a controlled epidemic of large numbers of people, which would generate \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">herd immunity</a>\u201d. Our scientists recommended \u201ca situation where the majority of the population are immune to the infection. And the only way of developing that, in the absence of a vaccine, is for the majority of the population to become infected.\u201d</p> <p>Medley suggested that, \u201cideally\u201d, we might need<strong> </strong>\u201ca nice big epidemic\u201d among the less vulnerable. \u201cWhat we are going to have to try and do,\u201d he said, was to \u201cmanage this acquisition of herd immunity and minimise the exposure of people who are vulnerable.\u201d Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">suggested</a> that the target was to infect 60% of the UK\u2019s population.</p> <p>After weeks of inaction, the government announced a sudden U-turn on Monday, declaring that new modelling by scientists at Imperial College had convinced them to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/new-data-new-policy-why-uks-coronavirus-strategy-has-changed\">change their initial plans</a>. Many journalists, led by the BBC, reported that \u201cthe science had changed\u201d and so the government had responded accordingly. But this interpretation of events is wrong. The science has been the same since January. What changed is that government advisers at last understood what had really taken place in China.</p> <p>Indeed, it<strong> </strong>didn\u2019t need this week\u2019s predictions by Imperial College scientists to estimate the impact of the government\u2019s complacent approach. Any numerate school student could make the calculation. With a mortality of 1% among 60% of a population of some 66 million people, the UK could expect almost 400,000 deaths. The huge wave of critically ill patients that would result from this strategy would quickly overwhelm the NHS.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s best scientists have known since that first report from China that Covid-19 was a lethal illness. Yet they did too little, too late.</p> <p>The virus quickly made its way to Europe. Italy was the first European country to suffer huge human losses. On 12 March, two Italian researchers, Andrea Remuzzi and Giuseppe Remuzzi, set out the lessons of their tragic experience. Italy\u2019s health service simply <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/this-is-like-a-war-view-from-italys-coronavirus-frontline\">could not cope</a>. They did not have the capacity of intensive care beds to deal with the scale of infection and its consequences. They predicted that by mid-April their health system would be overwhelmed. The mortality of patients with severe infection was high. A fifth of health workers were becoming infected, and some were dying.</p> <p>They described the situation in Italy as an unmanageable catastrophe. They wrote: \u201cThese considerations might also apply to other European countries that could have similar numbers of patients infected and similar needs regarding intensive care admissions.\u201d And yet the UK continued with its strategy of encouraging the epidemic and the goal of herd immunity.</p> <p>Something has gone badly wrong in the way the UK has handled Covid-19. I know Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, and Patrick Vallance. I have the utmost respect for both. They have had the services of some of the most talented researchers in the world to draw on. But somehow there was a collective failure among politicians and perhaps even government experts to recognise the signals that Chinese and Italian scientists were sending. We had the opportunity and the time to learn from the experience of other countries. For reasons that are not entirely clear, the UK missed those signals. We missed those opportunities.</p> <p>In due time,<strong> </strong>there must be a reckoning. I sat with the director general of the World Health Organization, Dr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/11/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-18-months-says-who\">Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</a>, in Geneva in February. He was in despair. Tedros had been criticised for not calling a public health emergency of international concern sooner. But when he did and when he asked for the modest sum of $675m to help the WHO combat the growing global pandemic his pleas were ignored.</p> <p>The UK is now taking the right actions to defeat this new epidemic. But we have lost valuable time. There will be deaths that were preventable. The system failed. I don\u2019t know why. But, when we have suppressed this epidemic, when life returns to some semblance of normality, difficult questions will have to be asked and answered. Because we can\u2019t afford to fail again. We may not have a second chance.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Horton is a doctor and edits the Lancet<br></p>",
  "<p>While the government often seems to show callous indifference to Britain\u2019s rough sleepers, on Tuesday it was announced that a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/3-2-million-emergency-support-for-rough-sleepers-during-coronavirus-outbreak\">pot of money </a>would be provided to help our homeless people avoid coronavirus.</p> <p>It is good the government has acted \u2013 but now for the bad news: rather than a policy or strategy, this feels little more than a contemptuous wad of cash chucked into the collective begging bowl of Britain\u2019s most vulnerable people.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there is a simple solution staring the government in the face \u2013 pass emergency legislation to commandeer some of Britain\u2019s now near-empty hotels and house homeless people in them.</p> <p>A grand total of \u00a33.2m is to be distributed to Britain\u2019s councils to do as they see fit with rough sleepers. To call it a pittance is insulting to pittances. Official government figures suggested there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/18/rough-sleeping-figures-cannot-be-trusted-says-statistics-chief\">4,677 people</a> sleeping rough in 2018 (the most recent figures). This is thought to be a huge underestimate. Last month it was revealed that council data showed almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/26/uks-official-rough-sleeping-numbers-far-lower-than-reality\">25,000 people</a> slept rough in 2019. So if we go by official figures this would amount to \u00a3684 to take each rough sleeper off the streets and keep them safe. Take the more disturbing estimate of 25,000 homeless people and you\u2019re down to \u00a3128 per head. Keeping homeless people safe is an expensive business, and this isn\u2019t the best of times.</p> <p>So despite the comforting words from the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, that he is providing money for society\u2019s most vulnerable to self-isolate, the reality is it looks as if the government is prepared to let thousands of rough sleepers die under bridges, in shop doors and outside train stations. Perhaps the only time the prime minister will truly address the problem is when it becomes a threat to his leadership \u2013 that is, when the public get physically and morally repulsed by walking over dead bodies. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps the only time the prime minister will truly address the problem is when the public get physically and morally repulsed by walking over dead bodies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most homeless people on the street have hugely compromised immune systems \u2013 a result of sleeping rough itself and, all too often, drug and alcohol addiction \u2013 and therefore are at a heightened risk of contracting coronavirus. In the most recent figures from the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsofhomelesspeopleinenglandandwales/2018\">Office of National Statistics</a> the mean average age of death for rough sleepers was 45 for males, 43 for females, and two in five deaths of homeless people was related to drug poisoning. The total estimated number of rough sleeper deaths was 726, a 22% year-on-year rise. It doesn\u2019t bear thinking what these figures will look like for 2020 if the government doesn\u2019t act now.</p> <p>Last week the campaigning group <a href=\"https://museumofhomelessness.org/#\">Museum of Homelessness</a>, alongside a coalition of homelessness organisations, called on the government to house our rough sleepers in hotels. But clearly the government\u2019s \u00a33.2m offer wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near enough to do this \u2013 the Museum of Homelessness <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MuseumofHomelessness/posts/1070980529922469?__xts__[0]=68.ARAidLhvDhZNlZSHjWcfEg6J9x7YFVHPpqChvWQaY7r49fxis_mPIYmRHP0vu_EfulJRlSO1GWNulI-AkqlmRPjcG0HrBh1CkyTLl7ed6PublSRiQbPjUiY5qGwqhUYtdhAd95QJqrAWnkzLO2363RYW9a7Isytt5JzuNBLdtPm_U6zDhqw2L9xatx84sX0zSLE8XFt6kZvrYjXtZwayLT_T6msf2SQ2jV3kIw1SXGx_DNzA-QLuMewdmlypIHNonPIeA6gW1VwXtj2n-Rn1N95C48q4JJ2HoQN45GteovL1s12AvEhkPb2uz0j4OzZ21f0bktf7NrVK2q4n1MCCGg&amp;__tn__=-R\">stated</a> that the government\u2019s \u00a3500m hardship fund for local authorities, and more if necessary, \u201cshould be used to block-book hotel rooms with a bathroom so people can isolate\u201d.</p> <p>It may sounds like a pipe dream, but it isn\u2019t \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t be. This solution makes sound economic sense for a prime minister desperate to keep the economy churning. Not only would it save lives if homeless people self-isolated in hotels, it would boost the economy and keep some people desperate for work in employment. What makes government intervention even more urgent is that the country\u2019s winter night shelters are due to close in the first week of April. Hotel bedrooms would provide a relatively safe environment for medics to treat people with coronavirus, for addiction and mental health agencies to provide support, and for the public to drop off donations.</p> <p>It won\u2019t work perfectly for all homeless people (some may refuse to go indoors and some may refuse to isolate because of the need to feed addictions) but it would work for many.</p> <p>Are there enough hotel bedrooms? You bet there are. In 2016 there were an estimated <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/613883/number-of-hotel-bedrooms-uk/\">874,300 bedrooms</a> in hotels and similar accommodation in the UK. So to accommodate the larger council estimate of the UK\u2019s rough sleepers would take up 2.9% of the nation\u2019s hotel bedrooms (while the official estimate would account for 0.5% of the rooms).</p> <p>Meanwhile the public is asking what it can do to help homeless people in the pandemic. The rules are pretty much the same as ever \u2013 be kind, chat to homeless people, ask if they want food/drink, give money if you fancy, act responsibly, and don\u2019t take risks for their sake and yours (sitting on filthy pavements with people, which we might do in normal times, is obviously unhygienic.) Donate useful things to individuals and charities. Many charities are running low on toilet roll, long-life milk and hand-sanitiser. So if you have bought few extra bottles, cartons or rolls, salve your conscience by donating some to those in need.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-exposed-extent-uk-social-crisis\">Coronavirus has exposed the extent of the UK's social crisis | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But our individual acts are small fry.

She has made herself regularly available to the media, and quickly established daily public press conferences fronted by New Zealand\u2019s director-general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield. The duo has presented a reliable, measured and authoritative face for New Zealand\u2019s Covid-19 response.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/new-zealand-police-to-carry-out-spot-checks-to-ensure-tourists-self-isolate-amid-covid-19\">New Zealand police to carry out spot checks to ensure tourists self-isolate amid Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her trademark \u201cpolitics of kindness\u201d has also been at the forefront of her approach. On Tuesday, in her speech to parliament she pushed the message that the country needed to \u201clook after one another\u201d and \u201ccare for the most vulnerable\u201d. And she ended it by saying: \u201cMy final message is this to New Zealanders: be strong but be kind \u2013 we will be OK.\u201d</p> <p>In this current crisis, though, reassurance and kindness are not enough. The New Zealand public are worried, and rightly so. This interconnected age gives us a window on other parts of a world that are being infected before us. The plight of other nations is available to us in real time, along with what we fervently hope is not a terrifying glimpse into the future.</p> <p>For weeks now, the government has been accused of being slow off the mark on measures such as screening and testing, not learning lessons from overseas, and not seizing the advantage our relative isolation affords. Ardern has been batting away calls for more radical action to prevent the crisis escalating.</p> <p>At the weekend, Ardern showed she is capable of matching kindness with steely resolve, announcing New Zealand would \u201cgo early and go hard\u201d, with immediate border controls requiring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/new-zealand-tells-arrivals-to-self-isolate-for-two-weeks-including-citizens\">all entrants to the country to self-isolate for 14 days</a> on arrival. The announcement was met with shock by some, but relief by many. The choice not to implement a harder ban, was probably influenced by the cries of overreaction that greeted Donald Trump\u2019s hard US closure to European nations days earlier. Of course, many other countries have since implemented hard travel bans, and this approach is no longer considered extreme.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it was not an easy decision to make for a country reliant on tourism \u2013 putting \u201cpeople before business\u201d will come at a huge economic cost.</p> <p>Having all but torpedoed New Zealand into a recession \u2013 albeit to save people\u2019s lives \u2013 the onus then fell on the government to do something else radical. That response came yesterday in finance minister Grant Robertson\u2019s emergency economic package, which contained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/new-zealand-launches-massive-spending-package-to-combat-covid-19\">NZ$12.1bn of new spending</a>, or about 4% of GDP, overshadowing packages made in other countries to date.</p> <p>The boldness of this package has been widely endorsed and the finance minister, until now seen as a fiscal conservative, was able to position himself on Tuesday as something more radical and visionary. He spoke angrily of previous governments who had implemented \u201cneoliberal\u201d austerity, and cited his own influence as the original social democratic reformers of the first Labour government in the 1930s.</p> <p>The National party opposition is, for the time being, floundering, unable to navigate the new environment.</p> <p>The government has received plaudits for taking what they paint as a bold, decisive and preventative approach. Their \u201cgo hard, and go early\u201d slogan will resonate with a public keen for strong leadership. But, of course, what seems bold today might well be seen as insufficient next week, given the escalating global situation.</p> <p>Politically, so much will depend on the spread of Covid-19 in New Zealand. Should New Zealand suffer the awful fate of so many countries, then the government will be accused of doing too little, too late. If we can stem the tide of infection then Ardern will certainly be able to take much of the credit. With a general election scheduled for later this year, a lot will depend on whether the government really has gone hard and gone early.</p> <p>However, ultimately it\u2019s the economy that is more likely to determine the government\u2019s re-election chances. New Zealand voters tend to blame incumbent politicians for recessions \u2013 whether they deserve it or not.</p> <p>Most notably, in the 1930s, the first Labour government took over from United-Reform during the Great Depression. But also in the late 1980s, the share market crash helped finish off the Lange Labour government, just as the 1997 Asian financial crisis did in the Shipley National-led government, and then the Clark government was disadvantaged by the 2008 global financial crisis.</p> <p>If unemployment ends up hitting 10 or 20%, no one will remember how quickly Ardern implemented a travel ban, or how well she communicated during the coronavirus crisis. No matter how good her crisis management is in March, if the economy collapses, we could easily be looking at Prime Minister Simon Bridges in September.</p> <p>As with everything in this crisis, ultimately only time will tell.</p>",
  "<p>It is certainly an ominous title for a movie about a convicted pyromaniac being released from prison and allowed home to live with his mother.

He returns to live with his elderly mother, Benedicta (played by Benedicta S\u00e1nchez, also a non-professional), in Galicia in north-west Spain, and help her on her tiny smallholding with three cows.</p> <p>Amador is presumably out on licence and he tells his mother there will be \u201ccheckups\u201d on him, but these never happen. There are evidently no scheduled therapy or counselling appointments to prevent Amador reverting to his bad old ways and not so much as a leaflet to take home.</p> <p>It is a jolt to see Amador lighting his cigarette \u2013 and later some local guys jeer at him, asking: \u201cGot a light?\u201d There is a tiny moment between Amador and local vet Elena (Elena Mar Fern\u00e1ndez), who knows nothing of his past. But their budding relationship sours when the locals put her in the picture and then a new fire springs up, leaving Amador\u2019s guilt ambiguous.</p> <p>So what is the reason for Amador\u2019s pyromania? Could it be his alienation from his community, landscape and emotions? Or is he an easy scapegoat for a problem with other culprits connected to global warming? These ideas drift across the screen.

  "<p>An investigation into the causes of the Windrush scandal has been completed and presented to the UK home secretary, who plans to make it public on Thursday. </p> <p>The investigation is expected to be very critical of Home Office staff and successive government ministers, and is likely to focus on the \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policy introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary, and the role of institutionalised racial discrimination.</p> <p>The Windrush Lessons Learned review was commissioned by Sajid Javid as home secretary weeks after the scandal came to public attention following a series of articles in the Guardian in April 2018.</p> <p>Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary, has been working on the report for about 20 months. She had been expected to submit it in the autumn but its completion was delayed by a process known as Maxwellisation, which allows for any individuals criticised in an official report to respond before its publication.</p> <p>The scandal arose after the Home Office wrongly designated thousands of legal UK residents as being in the country illegally. Some were mistakenly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/14/scale-misery-devastating-inside-story-reporting-windrush-scandal\">deported</a> to countries they had left as children about 50 years earlier, and others were wrongly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/its-inhumane-the-windrush-victims-who-have-lost-jobs-homes-and-loved-ones\">detained</a> in immigration removal centres.

The NHS and other public services are just weeks from breaking point, while the economy teeters on the brink of severe recession. To illuminate the grim path ahead some economists hold aloft the examples of Lehman Brothers in 2008 or 9/11, yet the next few months stand to be more devastating. A contagion on hospital wards and high streets, rather than on bank balance sheets, it is devastating everywhere from Beijing to Belfast at almost the same time. Our economies are all sinking together \u2013 fast.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In speed and scale, this has all the makings of a depression \u2013 unless governments go big and fast. That is not what Sunak is doing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which raises the question: why go into deadly conflict armed only with a peashooter? For all their martial language, that is what Johnson and chancellor Rishi Sunak are offering the British people. The economy-boosting package they have trumpeted this week is in reality <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/17/chancellors-330bn-coronavirus-package-is-big-but-not-big-enough\">too puny a tool</a>, aimed at the wrong target. While other governments of every political hue attack their many-headed enemy with a range of formidable weapons, ours charges ahead with just one, merely promising that reinforcements will arrive at some unspecified date. Just as in dealing with the pandemic itself, we are lagging far behind our European neighbours.</p> <p>That is not how it has been treated by many newspapers. The front pages this morning hail Dishy Rishi and his \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1240044721000644610?s=20\">kiss of life</a>\u201d, yet only last Wednesday those same publications swooned over his definitive corona-budget. A few days later, neither the measures nor their rapturous reception look quite so well-judged. At the time, I wrote on these pages that the emergency package \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/johnsonism-first-budget-hype-spending\">simply does not look large enough</a>\u201d. So it has proved.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s team are masters of the three-word slogan. Take Back Control; Get Brexit Done, and today: Whatever It Takes. All are grand-sounding promises that never quite come good because they simplify too far.</p> <p>The essence of our economic problem is easily summed up: to contain this disease, the economy must grind to a halt. Whether for entertainment or for business, over the next few months people can no longer gather together. The restaurant that did a roaring trade in February must now by Whitehall edict be shut down. However sound the business, no firm can keep going in such circumstances, which is why shops and museums across the country are already pulling down their shutters. Airlines and hotels everywhere face bankruptcy, while millions of employees around the world could lose their jobs.</p> <p>In speed and scale, this has all the makings of a depression \u2013 unless governments go big and fast. That is not what Sunak is doing. Last week, he extended sick pay for those struck down by the virus, when already the economic problem has metastasised to healthy workers getting laid off from becalmed businesses. He talked yesterday of a mortgage holiday \u2013 which big lenders are already offering \u2013 while saying nothing about renters. For firms he is putting up \u00a3330bn of loans and grants. Loans help to spread the burden of outgoings, which is why we take them to buy houses and cars, but for your local cafe owner who has just seen her revenues vanish, for God knows how long, they are utterly inadequate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9143d217c9beb39fa01d20adaaa8abe0308900fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9143d217c9beb39fa01d20adaaa8abe0308900fe/0_117_6107_3667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Closed shops in a market in Cardiff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Closed shops in a market in Cardiff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The government\u2019s supporters promise all will come in good time, but global pandemics do not work to the timetables of newbie chancellors. Meanwhile, Italy has suspended mortgages and rents, France has suspended utility bills and rent for small businesses and Denmark has agreed to pay as much as 75% of the wages of some private-sector employees rather than see them laid off. In each case, the rationale is the same: to lose a home, a company, a job does lasting damage to individuals, households, an entire economy. Better in this squall to tide people over than to let them drown.<br><br>These governments are following the same dictum as our Treasury officials, introducing \u201ctimely, targeted and temporary\u201d measures. But as Johnson\u2019s former economic adviser Gerard Lyons observes, they have added another T: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrGerardLyons/status/1239905382744707072?s=20\">titanic</a>. As in exceptional scale, not sinking ships. While no socialist, he calls on the British government to follow suit.</p> <p>A real bailout for the economy must have two main principles. First, it should put money in people\u2019s pockets right now, targeting the poorest. Successive prime ministers from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair to David Cameron have made our welfare system as punitive and mean as possible, supposedly to drive people into work. In this crisis we need it to serve an entirely opposite purpose: to encourage workers to stay at home. The last thing you want is a care worker shrugging off her cough and temperature because she needs to put food on the family\u2019s table.<br><br>That means raising sick pay alongside universal credit and other benefits, and lifting conditions and sanctions. If schools are to close, child benefit should rise and the nasty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/31/government-urged-to-scrap-nasty-two-child-limit-on-benefits\">two-child limit</a> must be scrapped. All essential costs to keep a roof over one\u2019s head or one\u2019s business going should be suspended, which includes tax collection. The UK should follow the Nordic countries in being prepared to subsidise wages. Whatever money the government has promised the NHS, our hospitals clearly don\u2019t have enough resources right now, which is why A&amp;E doctors are wearing paper masks. Local authorities are having to respond to this crisis after years of being stripped of money by the Conservatives: that must be reversed. Given the likely hit to our GDP, the government cannot spend enough right now, especially with interest rates at zero. If Johnson is serious about leading a \u201cwartime government\u201d he should remember that during the second world war the UK ran a budget deficit of 20% of national income every year for five years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/national-emergencies-britain-government-health-covid-19-1940s-and-50s\">When it comes to national emergencies, Britain has a tradition of cold calculation | David Edgerton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just over 10 years ago, the banking crisis was resolved with vast amounts of public cash. The public was repaid for its support by seeing its social contract with the state and with employers ripped up. We got lower pay, fewer rights and the slashing of our public realm. That cannot happen again. This crisis has revealed the flaws in our political-economic system: insecure work, a cruel welfare system, businesses that expect the public to keep them afloat while doing little for the public good (look in the mirror, Richard Branson), and a government that will only drop its laissez-faire laconicism when confronted with the prospect of hundreds of thousands of deaths.</p> <p>And this is where we get to the second principle for saving the economy. Any bailout for airlines, say, can\u2019t involve taxpayers handing billions to Branson and others; there must be public stakes for public financial support. More widely, there needs to be a new contract with businesses that recognises they are social institutions reliant on society, and compelling them to play their proper role in it, from pay to how they run their supply chains.</p> <p>Wars often serve as the catalyst for such change. Income tax was a short-term measure to beat Napoleon. When coalition minister Ernest Bevin launched his crusade for full employment in the Commons, he recalled visiting a port with Winston Churchill before soldiers set sail for the D-Day landings in Normandy. One soldier asked: \u201cErnie, when we have done this job for you, are we going back to the dole?\u201d Bevin told MPs that he and Churchill answered almost as one: \u201cNo, you are not.\u201d</p> <p>This time we are asking frontline staff in hospitals and schools and town halls to risk illness and worse on our behalf. This follows years of their pay being held down and their institutions being cut to the bone, and after decades of seeing top earners march off with outsize returns. The least we can do is promise there will be no return to those days.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p>",

He predicted the US government would ultimately spend $2tn \u201cto prevent deaths, job losses and to avoid an economic catastrophe\u201d and called for every American household to receive monthly payments of $2,000 during the crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur country and our world are facing an unprecedented series of crises,\u201d he said in remarks that made no reference to the election.</p> \n<p>More than 6,300 Americans have tested positive for the virus, despite limited testing, with 108 deaths <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">as of Tuesday evening</a>. The message from officials is that the outbreak will worsen dramatically.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Trump advised Americans not to gather in groups of more than 10, further restricting guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommended that no gatherings with 50 people or more be held for the next eight weeks.</p> \n<p>Against that backdrop, Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of Ohio, announced on Monday afternoon that he would seek to postpone the election until 2 June. Hours later an Ohio county judge rejected the request, saying it would set a \u201cterrible\u201d precedent.</p> \n<p>DeWine instructed the state\u2019s director of health to declare a public health emergency. He argued that holding the election would place voters and poll workers in potential danger.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe should not force people to make this choice, a choice between their health and their constitutional rights and their duties as American citizens,\u201d DeWine said at a press conference, adding: \u201cI think when we look back on this, we are going to be glad we did this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, assailed the move for causing \u201cmore chaos and confusion\u201d and sought to discourage other states from following suit.</p> \n<p>But it may be too late. Louisiana and Georgia were the first states to announce they would delay their primaries in response to the outbreak. Kentucky joined Ohio on Monday, choosing to delay its primary from 19 May to 23 June. And on Tuesday, Maryland became the fifth state to postpone its presidential primary election, moving it from 28 April to 2 June.</p> \n<p>Officials in Florida, Arizona and Illinois took additional precautions to ensure the safety of voters and poll workers, including sanitizing voting machines and offering curbside voting.

As the novel progresses, its surface calmness and simplicity are increasingly at odds with a mounting and devastating sense of loss as the novel evolves into a meditation on life\u2019s compromises and squandered opportunities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"826473c0694c3908a8a4198fd05982eb450822a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/826473c0694c3908a8a4198fd05982eb450822a3/0_112_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keira Knightley in the 2010 film of Never Let Me Go.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A meditation on life\u2019s compromises ...

Girls as young as 11 are told here that they must \u201clive constantly in the spiritual presence of death\u201d, so they \u201cmortify\u201d themselves by putting salt on their pudding instead of sugar, and affixing burrs to the inside of their uniforms. Even when Nanda\u2019s behaviour is exemplary, she is still admonished for lacking \u201cnormal, healthy, natural naughtiness\u201d. It\u2019s a booby-trapped environment of Exemptions and Permissions, where you can burn in hell for ever just for eating a found sweet on your way to communion.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1928/oct/12/classics\">Decline and Fall by Evelyn Waugh</a><br></strong>Sent down from Scone College, Oxford for indecent behaviour after his trousers are stolen by a drunken member of the Bollinger Club, Paul Pennyfeather is exiled to teach at a purgatorial boarding school in Wales. On sports day, the hurdles have been burned for firewood and are replaced by five-foot-high spiked railings, and the starting pistol is Philbrick the butler\u2019s service revolver, which ends up being discharged into the heel of Lady Circumference\u2019s son, Lord Tangent. Among its many delights is the novel\u2019s acknowledgement of the fact that teachers at boarding school often seem as perplexed as the pupils as to how they came to be in such a place.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview19\">Old School by Tobias Wolff</a><br></strong>The novel opens in November 1960 after John F Kennedy has beaten Richard Nixon to the US presidency. The boys at the elite school where this novel is set all favour JFK, partly because \u201che had his clothes under control\u201d and \u201chis wife was a fox\u201d \u2013 but mainly because he \u201cread and wrote books\u201d. The highlight of every term is a visit from a Great Writer, and in our unnamed protagonist\u2019s final year, the visiting writers are Robert Frost, Ayn Rand and Ernest Hemingway, the last of whom will judge a creative writing competition. This sends the pupils into a competitive frenzy and tests the school\u2019s hardwired codes of honour to breaking point.</p> <p><strong>6. The Ruined Boys by Roy Fuller<br></strong>Gerald Bracher arrives at boarding school from South Africa after his parents\u2019 divorce. He is desperate to conform and awash with guilt at his own perceived role in their split, attaching himself worshipfully to the headmaster as a replacement father figure. The novel chronicles Gerald\u2019s transformation from eager admirer to rebellious cynic as the school\u2019s (and, by extension, society\u2019s) shortcomings become apparent. The novel is insightful and funny about boarding-school philosophy, as in the scene where Gerald is nervous about the fact that a boxing match is to be held and declares his fear that people might be murdered. \u201cPossibly,\u201d replies his interlocutor. \u201cBut they\u2019ll be murdered in a fair way.\u201d</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/06/skippy-dies-paul-murray\">Skippy Dies by Paul Murray</a><br></strong>The title isn\u2019t a spoiler: Daniel \u201cSkippy\u201d Juster expires within the first few pages of this novel, in the middle of a doughnut-eating race against his friend Ruprecht Van Doren. Skippy\u2019s final act is to burst a doughnut in his fist and paint the words TELL LORI on the floor in jam. This is the jumping-off point for a riotous and digressive tale, both comic and tragic, that relates the experiences of Ruprecht and Skippy at Dublin\u2019s Seabrook College for Boys.</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/11/fiction.features\">Prep by Curtis Sittenfeld</a><br></strong>At 14, Lee Fiora becomes fascinated with boarding schools while researching the subject at her local public library. She falls for the handsome boys in the prospectuses she sends away for and ends up, to the mystification of her parents, on a scholarship to the prestigious Ault school in Massachusetts. The environment here is as preppy as it gets \u2013 the characters have names such as Cross Sugarman and Gates Medkowski \u2013 but the stew of adolescent fears and desires the novel depicts is universal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c45a25293d6639fe904ce716783c22bb9474cf4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c45a25293d6639fe904ce716783c22bb9474cf4b/0_478_1522_912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 1954 illustration from Molesworth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The curse of St Custard\u2019s ... a 1954 illustration from Molesworth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ronald Searle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>9. The Compleet Molesworth by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle<br></strong>I\u2019m not breaking my own rule because the four books collected here are absolutely written for adults, however much they may also appeal to children. They document the exploits and philosophy of Nigel Molesworth, \u201cthe curse of St Custards\u201d, his \u201cgrate frend\u201d Peason, the \u201cuterly wet\u201d Fotherington-Tomas and a host of other perfectly observed pupils and masters. Many of the jokes can be enjoyed by people of any age, but, for adult readers, the books also read as a cutting social satire of 1950s England.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/08/george-orwell-such-such-schooldays\">Such, Such Were </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/08/george-orwell-such-such-schooldays\">the Joys by George Orwell</a><br></strong>Strictly speaking, this is an essay rather than a book, but it is published as a standalone pamphlet and its gimlet-eyed Orwellian concision make it worth more than many longer tomes on the subject.

  "<p>The coronavirus outbreak has hit British fishers with a \u201cvery severe shock\u201d as demand from export markets and the domestic restaurant trade has dried up.</p> \n<p>The UK exports about 70% of its catch to Europe and Asia but imports most of what British consumers eat. Fishing leaders said catches of normally expensive seafood such as Dover sole and lobster may now end up in fishmongers at bargain prices.</p> \n<p>The crews running the 2,500 boats that fish in inshore waters are self-employed, making them especially vulnerable, and they support five times as many jobs onshore. While no one wants the shutdown to continue, scientists said a pause in fishing could result in a recovery of marine life numbers.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt may be a temporary crisis but it is a very severe shock,\u201d said Barrie Deas, chief executive of the <a href=\"https://nffo.org.uk/news/impact-of-coronavirus-on-fishing.html\">National Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Organisations</a>. He said China has become a big market for UK crab in recent years. \u201cSome parts of the fleet have become very dependent on that, and that was the first to go, with a very dramatic fall in demand.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have these prime species that tend to go across to the continent, like Dover sole, lobster and crab, high value species that also go to the [UK] restaurant trade,\u201d he said. \u201cFor [British] people who find Dover sole too expensive at the fishmonger, this would be a good time to try it. There will be bargains. I\u2019m not saying the scale of it would be a substitute for what is exported, but we are looking for silver linings here.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

It is fixed on five key groups: cod, haddock, salmon, prawns and tuna.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have all these other things, like cuttlefish, whelks, monkfish and megrim sole, all excellent seafood, that we may well eat when we are on holiday in Spain or Portugal, but we don\u2019t seem to want to eat it here,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this will be the switch.\u201d</p> \n<p>Beukers-Stewart said a reduction in fishing could help populations to increase. \u201cIn an extreme scenario, which I do not wish on the fishing industry, we could see some dramatic reductions in fishing activity and as a result, recovery of stocks,\u201d he said, noting that dramatic recoveries were seen after the second world war.

  "<p>Oprah Winfrey has responded to false rumours that circulated online on Tuesday accusing her of sex trafficking and alleging that her Florida home had been raided by police.</p> <p>A number of tweets made false claims, thought to have similar origins to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/30/qanon-4chan-rightwing-conspiracy-theory-explained-trump\">rightwing conspiracy QA</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/30/qanon-4chan-rightwing-conspiracy-theory-explained-trump\">non</a>.

  "<p>More than anything else, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.</p> <p>As with 2015\u2019s masterful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/01/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review-a-challenging-and-beautiful-journey\">Ori and the Blind Forest</a>, Will of the Wisps falls into the Metroidvania subgenre of multidirectional scrolling platformers, and its impressive aesthetics are matched by a gripping storyline, bewitching characters and a fully immersive environment in which every nook and cranny pulses with life. This time around Ori, the translucent white guardian spirit, is tasked with navigating through and beyond the dense Nibel forest to a new world shrouded in darkness.</p> <p>Ori begins with zero skills and must learn new abilities to unlock unreachable areas \u2013 a requirement that involves travelling back and forth through each level as you figure out exactly what you need and where to find it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fd664bc90dd1231035229bfb2d9a05fbd190217\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fd664bc90dd1231035229bfb2d9a05fbd190217/140_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ori and the Will of the Wisps by Moon Studios.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bewitching ... Ori and the Will of the Wisps by Moon Studios.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The detailed maps are useful but, at several points, you are likely to find yourself hopelessly disorientated and unsure of which path to take next. This is all part of the adventure though, especially as Nibel forest is such a lovely place to get lost in. Although the game is a 2D side-scroller, it frequently reminded me of the open-world adventure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/30/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-game-design-open-world-player-explore\">Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. As Ori glides effortlessly through the sky on a feather or bounces between mossy hilltops, there\u2019s a similar affection for the natural world and the endless exploration opportunities therein.</p> <p>Skill-building is also a key part of the game; players must learn to time jumps accurately and climb at precise angles. It can take multiple attempts before you hit your stride, but these aspects merely add to the fun and your sense of engagement within the world, not least because Ori just looks so damn graceful whenever he takes flight.</p> <p>Despite the similarities to its predecessor, there are some crucial differences. Developer Moon Studios has ditched the sequential upgrade system used in Blind Forest for a process in which Ori collects glowing health and energy shards to aid him in his mission. The game also has a more traditional autosave function.</p> <p>Combat now plays a much bigger role, allowing for a more expansive range of weapons and special moves \u2013 although fighting the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while. Many players will relish the challenge of memorising an enemy\u2019s attack pattern in order to bring them down, but I sometimes found myself impatient to quickly move past these frequent scuffles so I could test out my skills on more formidable foes. Still, the controls are intuitive and you are able to combine techniques to develop your own fighting styles.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2reK8k8nwBc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2reK8k8nwBc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2reK8k8nwBc\">Watch a trailer for Ori and the Will of the Wisps</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Although the storyline is melancholy at times, it never feels maudlin. The sweet characters perk up the darker moments and have a surprising amount of depth. For example, the tiny owl Ku has a memorable back story, which sets them up to be a charming and versatile playable character in parts of the story.</p> <p>Peppered with devious puzzles, Ori and the Will of the Wisp is an irresistible challenge. There is extraordinary attention to detail \u2013 the entire world feels alive with excitement and danger. I struggled to put down the controller as I progressed deeper into the game, unable and unwilling to let anything stand in the way of Ori realising his true destiny.

Since then, the group has seen a record number of engagement on its platforms, it says, with 380 members from every continent on the planet except Antarctica working together to develop coronavirus tools.</p> \n<p>Members of the group communicate primarily through a public Slack messaging channel and a weekly international video and phone call.</p> \n<p>The ultimate goal of the JOGL challenge <a href=\"https://app.jogl.io/project/118\">was initially</a> to develop an open source (publicly shared) methodology to safely test for the virus \u201cusing tools as common as possible\u201d. But other projects have also emerged from the forum, including tracking the spread of the virus using open source software and finding more accessible ways to make masks and open source ventilators, the devices that help sick patients breathe, particularly important as the disease comes with severe respiratory effects.</p> \n<p>Sophie Liu, a high school student in Washington and a JOGL member, is working on making lab testing for coronavirus more accessible.</p> \n<p>Liu got into the online biology movement when, as a 15-year-old in 10th grade she had trouble finding any labs who would hire a teen, and joined the coronavirus project in early March.</p> \n<p>The tests she has developed are in early stages, she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis project means a lot to me because the virus is spreading in Washington, and I have been skipping out on a lot of school \u2013 I am extremely behind on coursework and exams\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to hang out with my friends or attend social gatherings.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--supporting\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/thrashers/2020/03/coronavirus-newsletter/embed\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Members of JOGL hope to create viable solutions to potentially be distributed to NGOs after being reviewed by JOGL\u2019s biosafety advisory board, composed of international biosecurity and safety experts, said Kat Holo, another Washington high school student involved in the group.</p> \n<p>She has been involved the community biology space for more than three years and said the group has never had such a large amount of engagement from such a large volume of scientists.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen such a big response since this pandemic has affected everyone\u2019s lives in one way or another, no matter where they live or who they are,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a common consensus and belief in the power of the community and the common desire to help the international community in such a time of need.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In some of the most dangerously overcrowded Greek refugee camps, it has become a race against time to raise awareness about Covid-19 and ensure an outbreak does not spread among an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/child-killed-in-lesbos-refugee-camp-fire\">already vulnerable population</a>.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/17/moria-is-a-hell-new-arrivals-describe-life-in-a-greek-refugee-camp\">infamous Moria camp</a> on the island of Lesbos close to 20,000 people live in a space designed for just under 3,000.</p> <p>There is is already limited access to running water in the camp, and toilets and showers regularly block due to overuse. The first case of Covid-19 was confirmed on the island last week when a Greek woman from the town of Plomari tested positive. So far this the only confirmed case on the island.</p> <p>There is an increasing sense of urgency in Moria about hygiene and handwashing. In the absence of support from the Greek authorities, residents are taking matters into their own hands.</p> <p>\u201cThe conditions were out of control and so we knew that we needed to do something by ourselves,\u201d said Deen Mohammad Alizadah, 30, originally from Afghanistan.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/18/ngos-raise-alarm-as-coronavirus-strips-support-from-eu-refugees\">NGOs raise alarm as coronavirus strips support from EU refugees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alizadah is one of the residents who have come together to create an awareness team. \u201cThe only thing that can control the virus here is the management of people and making them aware,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The members of the team are a snapshot of the diverse population of Moria, heralding from countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and the Congo region, each dispensing advice to their own communities. The team has already swelled to 50 people, with more joining by the day. Megaphones are being distributed to help spread the word about the importance of hygiene and washing.</p> <p>Due to high demand, face masks are currently in short supply in pharmacies in the local town of Mytilene, and since there is no current mass distribution of masks to the camp, industrious Moria residents have come up with their own solution. </p> <p>In a small building around a kilometre from Moria, a group of four Afghan women have volunteered their time to sew face masks for the camp\u2019s population. Stand By Me Lesvos, a Greek NGO, realised that they could make use of the sewing machines from a previous project. </p> <p>\u201cIt was set up within six hours on Friday,\u201d said Mixalis Avialotis from Stand By Me Lesvos. \u201cOne of the Afghan women used to be a tailor in Kabul and said she\u2019d have no problem managing the operation.\u201d </p> <p>The women are working at a rapid rate and in their first day made approximately 500 masks, which are fashioned from cotton fabric bought from local shops. The masks are then packaged into plastic wrappers purchased from the local Lidl supermarket and boxed to be brought to the camp. The masks, which will be given out for free, will initially only be distributed to camp residents who start to feel unwell or exhibit symptoms of the virus, such as a cough.</p> <p>Once worn, the masks will then be boiled and sterilised so that, if necessary, they can be reused.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9749e779934de9a20d0241a5e1357f7a6e53e4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9749e779934de9a20d0241a5e1357f7a6e53e4c/0_0_960_1280/750.jpg\" alt=\"Posters made by children in the overcrowded Vathy refugee camp on Samos.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters made by children in the Vathy refugee camp on Samos are part of an effort to combat overcrowded and unhygienic conditions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Still I Rise NGO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Avialotis estimates that they have now made around 1,500 masks and said that social distancing and other Covid-19-mitigating measures have also been implemented inside the factory.\u201c</p> <p>On the island of Samos where the refugee camp hosts nearly 7,500 people in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/13/greek-refugee-camp-for-640-people-found-housing-3745-eu\">space designed for 648</a>, conditions are similarly cramped. Huddled on a hill above the town of Samos, the island\u2019s capital, washing facilities are scarce. Around 400 of the thousands of people living here are unaccompanied minors, some of whom have already have skin conditions such as chronic scabies due to poor sanitary conditions.</p> <p>Guilia Cicoli, co-founder of Still I Rise NGO, which runs a youth centre for children living in Vathy camp, told the Guardian that they had spent a lot of time speaking to the children about Covid-19. The children have also produced posters about hand washing and hygiene in class.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us are Italians so we took it very seriously and started awareness raising before Greece even had any confirmed cases,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore we had to close last week we had already replaced handshakes with elbow or feet bumps.\u201d</p> <p>Movement on the Ground, a Dutch NGO, started taping dispensers of hand sanitiser to olive trees in Samos last week to encourage residents to regularly wash their hands in the dusty and dirty conditions.</p> <p>The impending threat of the virus has pushed some camp residents from Moria to seek refuge on the mainland. The Guardian knows of a number of them, some with sick family members, who decided that they could not wait for a UNHCR-organised ferry to the mainland and made their own way Athens last week after the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Lesbos.</p> <p>This decision has left them without access to accommodation and any state provision. Yet for the families, leaving the camps seems like the safer option as many see a Covid-19 outbreak there as inevitable.</p>",
  "<p>Vietnam\u2019s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, has asked the country\u2019s agriculture ministry to draft a directive to stop illegal trading and consumption of wildlife over fears it spreads disease.</p> <p>The directive, seen as a victory for animal rights organisations, will lead to a clamping down on street-side markets dotted across the country, increase prosecutions of online traders and ideally put pressure on thousands of farms with known links to illegal wildlife trading.</p> <p>Vitenam\u2019s move to ban the wildlife trade follows similar moves by the Chinese government, after the new coronavirus pandemic appeared to have emerged from a wet market in Wuhan.</p> <p>Both illegal and \u201clegal\u201d wildlife trading <a href=\"https://env4wildlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WCB-2019-No.2-Nov-18-2019.pdf\">flourishes in Vietnam</a>, where the trade has grown into a billion-dollar industry. There are thousands of markets around the country, many of which include stalls selling animals for food or as pets. Anyone walking around some of the street-side stalls of the Mekong delta can see fish tanks stuffed with sea turtles or skinned-alive frogs.</p> <p>There is also a thriving online trade in animals. Many sellers advertise on Facebook, uploading photos of leopard cats caught in mesh nets, dead pangolins stored in a freezer, slaughtered macaque monkeys, frozen tiger cubs, butchered bats or even freshly barbecued wildlife. They are bought as status symbols, pets, food, or to be used in traditional medicines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f432efb33cc794b7693f5ee45edaa25958a0015f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f432efb33cc794b7693f5ee45edaa25958a0015f/0_0_3264_2230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pangolins smuggled from Laos and found in a bus in Vietnam\u2019s Ha Tinh province.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pangolins smuggled from Laos and found in a bus in Vietnam\u2019s Ha Tinh province.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the largest issue in terms of Vietnam\u2019s wildlife trade is the nation\u2019s \u201clegal\u201d commercial farms, where you can see maltreated civets in metal cages or an array of rare reptiles. Across Vietnam, bears are still trapped in tiny cages on bear bile farms, while Nghe An province in central Vietnam is known for tiger farms.</p> <p>\u201cOpportunistic farmers can legally acquire licences for a plethora of species. Some of these species are incredibly difficult to raise in captivity while others are not economically viable to raise and sell profitably, but it has not been a common practice to involve third parties in the process of licensing farms, so the authorities are issuing permits to trade native species that can only be sourced from the wild,\u201d Douglas Hendrie, director of enforcement for local environment NGO <a href=\"https://env4wildlife.org/\">Education for Nature Vietnam</a> (ENV) told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cAdditionally, in some cases farmers can get away with trading completely protected species which are not even allowed to be farmed due to authorities lacking education on species protection.

In this case, the owner was caught in possession of more than 10 species protected by law \u2013 a criminal offence punishable by up to 15 years in prison. It is this diversity of species \u2013 as seen in Wuhan\u2019s wet market \u2013 that can lead to the spread of disease.</p> <p>According to Hendrie, online trading has grown in appeal as sellers can hide their identity while reaching more buyers. Entire Facebook pages are dedicated to ivory, rhino horns and bear claws or posting photos of animals being caught or slaughtered. Last year ENV recorded more than 2,400 advertisements in violation of wildlife protection laws on Facebook, YouTube, Zalo and other online platforms, along with more than 600 people caught illegally possessing wildlife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f714c26cabddd56c126f218c097bcc1c3737135c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f714c26cabddd56c126f218c097bcc1c3737135c/0_175_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There is a thriving online trade in animals such as macaque monkeys (pictured), tiger cubs, bats or even freshly barbecued wildlife.

Yet campaigners say the illegal trade continues to flourish thanks to poor enforcement. Convicted criminals can face imprisonment or a fine of more than $600 (\u00a3500).</p> <p>Hanoi-based wildlife NGO Pan Nature recently sent a letter to the prime minister\u2019s office \u2013 signed by 14 other environmental NGOs including WWF, Animals Asia, ENV and Traffic \u2013 calling on authorities to close markets and other locations where illegal wildlife is on sale.

  "<p>Beijing has defended its decision to expel journalists from three major US publications, saying it was responding to \u201cunreasonable oppression\u201d of Chinese journalists in the US, as a diplomatic row escalates between the two countries.</p> <p>Speaking at a regular press briefing, the foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing had been \u201ccompelled\u201d to take countermeasures after Washington imposed restrictions on staff at Chinese state media outlets in the US.</p> <p>\u201cWe urge the US to take off its ideological prejudice, abandon cold war mentality,\u201d Geng said. \u201cChina is not one to start trouble, but it will not blink if trouble comes. We urge the US side to immediately stop suppressing Chinese media, otherwise the US side will lose even more.\u201d</p> <p>At least 13 journalists will be expelled in what is an unprecedented retaliation against foreign media working in the country. An announcement made just after midnight said all US journalists working for the New York Times, Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal whose credentials were up for renewal this year would have 10 days to turn in their press cards, a measure that effectively bans them from reporting in the country.</p> <p>China has said it is responding to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/18/us-chinese-media-propaganda-state-department\">US move last month</a> to classify Chinese state media organisations as foreign missions and tighten controls on them. China\u2019s foreign ministry said such \u201cunwarranted restrictions\u201d had made work difficult for reporters and subject to \u201cpolitically motivated oppression\u201d.</p> <p>Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-run tabloid Global Times, on Wednesday warned of more retaliation. \u201cIf the two sides go after each other\u2019s journalists, American media will suffer more,\u201d he wrote on Weibo, pointing out there are 29 US outlets with operations in China, compared with 19 Chinese outlets in the US. \u201cWhether the two sides fight in terms of numbers of people or the number of media outlets, it is the US that will suffer more.\u201d</p> <p>The expulsions come as the US and China attempt to shift blame over the coronavirus outbreak that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/first-covid-19-case-happened-in-november-china-government-records-show-report\">emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December</a>. As China struggles to return to normal in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, which killed more than 3,000 people in mainland China, it has pushed the idea that the virus may have originated in the US. Donald Trump has continued to call Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d.</p> <p>Analysts said the expulsion of foreign correspondents, many of whom have exposed issues such as re-education camps in Xinjiang or authorities\u2019 mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, is indicative of an emboldened Beijing. Last month China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/19/china-bars-wall-street-journal-reporters-over-derogatory-column\">expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis is more about China feeling like it has the capacity to do what it\u2019s always wanted to do, which is to limit critical reporting within China,\u201d said Natasha Kassam, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and a former Australian diplomat.</p> <p>\u201cIn one move China can demonstrate its strength to domestic audiences and stir up existing nationalism. It can demonstrate to the US it is happy to race to the bottom in decoupling. It can have a chilling effect on the journalists that remain,\u201d she said<strong>.</strong></p> <p>According to a statement from the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of China (FCCC), more journalists may be affected, depending on how broadly China enforces the ban. \u201cJournalists illuminate the world we live in. China, through this action, is dimming itself,\u201d it said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cBy expelling journalists and keeping others in a state of visa uncertainty, China is overtly using its powers in an attempt to influence overseas news coverage, by punishing those who publish information authorities see as unfavourable and wish to keep quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the New York Times, said China had made a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d and urged the two governments to resolve the dispute quickly. \u201cWe strongly condemn the decision of the Chinese authorities to expel American journalists, an action that is especially irresponsible at a time when the world needs the free and open flow of credible information about the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Matt Murray, the Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief, called it an \u201cunprecedented attack on freedom of the press\u201d at a time of crisis. \u201cTrusted news reporting from and about China has never been more important. We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world. Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged.\u201d</p> <p>The Washington Post\u2019s executive editor, Marty Baron, said: \u201cWe unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel US reporters. The Chinese government\u2019s decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to Covid-19 is essential. Severely limiting the flow of that information, which China now seeks to do, only aggravates the situation.\u201d</p> <p>The New York Times newspaper\u2019s board said in an editorial that China\u2019s crackdown was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/china-journalists-coronavirus.html\">an unfortunate echo of the cold war</a>, and it couldn\u2019t come at a worse time.

  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic is exposing some ugly truths about the world we live in and, as we head in to what now looks certain to be a global recession, another one is coming in to focus: the Federal Reserve can\u2019t save us.</p> <p>At 2.30pm on Wednesday the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, was due to hold his latest press conference. Like a lot of events, that meeting is now canceled. Powell pre-empted it by announcing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-near-zero-prop-up-us-economy-coronavirus\">unprecedented second cut</a> to interest rates on Sunday and unveiled plans to pump $700bn into the financial system.</p> <p>For many it was deja vu all over again. After the last financial crisis the Fed rode in with very similar plans and it worked, sort of. If anyone thought that the Fed could pull it off again this time, the reaction on Monday morning swiftly put paid to that. Stock markets went into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/markets-face-more-turmoil-as-fears-for-global-economy-grow-coronavirus\">free</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/markets-face-more-turmoil-as-fears-for-global-economy-grow-coronavirus\">fall.</a></p> <p>The US has enjoyed 11 years of growth and yet interest rates have hovered close to zero since the last recession. Even when the going was good the Trump administration vigorously fought any rate rises (keen to pump up the stock markets at any cost) and Trump himself has threatened to sack Powell, who is supposed to be independent of political interference.</p> <p>The Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate, used to set rates for everything from mortgages and car loans to savings and credit card rates, is 0% to 0.25% after the second rate cut. Powell has said he is not keen on negative rates \u2013 an Alice-in-Wonderland development that has one Danish bank actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/13/danish-bank-launches-worlds-first-negative-interest-rate-mortgage\">paying borrowers</a> to take money off their hands \u2013 but it is hard to see what other tools he has.</p> <p>Yes, the Fed can pump more money into the financial system, as it did last time, but this isn\u2019t a financial crisis \u2013 at least not yet. Consumers, who make up 70% of the US economy, may get even cheaper loans but for now they have nowhere to spend it and consumer confidence is dwindling as fast as the nation\u2019s toilet paper supplies. The situation will only worsen when and if people start to lose their jobs.</p> <p>This is a crisis that will take congressional intervention to overcome. And that, frankly, is terrifying.</p> <p>It is not hard to find fault with the Fed. Full employment is one of its mandates but it is largely uninterested in what sort of jobs are created. Its mandate is to maintain the status quo, not challenge it. Now, with the Fed sidelined, we will swap a calm, independent, voice for the bellicose buffoonery of the White House and a president who has made no bones about playing favorites with the crony business leaders he wheels out at every opportunity to chorus their approval.</p> <p>The Trump administration is talking bailouts already for the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/us-airline-industry-seeks-50-billion-bailout-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\"> airlines</a>, hotels and others. What he can pass remains to be seen. Trump has no friends on the other side of the House and slim chance of making any. Even if he can get something approved, how effective will it be? The omens are ominous.</p> <p>If you want to imagine what a Trump bailout will look like, look no further than his 2017 tax cuts.</p> <p>\u201cThe rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,\u201d Trump promised as he pushed through the $1.7tn cuts that the, then booming, US economy neither needed and which the future could <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2018/11/29/461579/rising-deficits-falling-revenues/\">ill afford</a>.</p> <p>The tax cuts were sold on a lie. \u201cOur focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America. The plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipe-fitters, the people that like me best,\u201d promised Trump.</p> <p>In fact, more than 60% of the tax savings went to the most wealthy 20%, according to the non-partisan <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/full\">Tax Policy Center</a>. Quite a number of them were <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/taxes/trumps-tax-cuts/republicans-profit-congress/\">in Congress.</a></p> <p>Companies including AT&amp;T, General Motors and Wells Fargo all promised to invest in new jobs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/at-and-t-layoffs-jobs-slashed-trump-tax-cuts\">Instead </a>they bought back their own shares and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/15/job-losses-trump-tax-cut-at-t-general-motors-wells-fargo\"> laid people off.</a></p> <p>Sure, the tax cuts helped boost the 401k retirement savings plans most Americans now rely on in lieu of a pension. But the rises in share price disproportionately benefit the economic elite. The wealthiest 10% of Americans own 84% of all stocks and the top 1% of households own nearly 38% of all stock, according to <a href=\"http://www.marineconomicconsulting.com/w20733.pdf\">research by the New York University economist Edward Wolff</a>.</p> <p>The tax cuts were such a dud that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/15/donald-trump-tax-cuts-unpopular-1273469\">even Republican voters</a> don\u2019t like them. Bailouts for big business as the average American struggles with the Covid-19 crisis on top of healthcare costs, student debts and persistent low wages could be political suicide for Trump. Nevertheless he will have to do something \u2013 we can\u2019t rely on the Fed any more.</p>",

And the agreement is retrospective, which means that for my friend Jan, who was laid off from his job at a hotel in Copenhagen last week, there is every chance he\u2019ll be able to go back to work.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s important to point out that <a href=\"https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/03/denmarks-answer-to-the-coronavirus-recession\">there are holes</a> in the Danish agreement, which if transposed directly to the UK would leave millions of workers unprovided for. The self-employed, owner-managers and many on casual contracts will not be covered by the Danish government\u2019s scheme. Although they make up a relatively small proportion of the working population here, these groups, which include many of the bike couriers still whisking through the streets of Copenhagen as I write, may well suffer as a result some of the starkest economic consequences of the pandemic.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/we-are-at-war-coronavirus-pandemic\">We are at war with coronavirus.

The Jenga tower of debt on which the global economy rests may at least retain its foundations, as the means that sustain everyday life are bought, sold and rented.

  "<p>Europe has become the global centre of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/13/who-director-general-europe-centre-coronavirus-pandemic-video\">World Health Organization</a>. In France, where I am writing from, President Macron has put the country in a \u201chealth war\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/french-urged-to-vote-in-local-elections-amid-coronavirus-lockdown\">lockdown</a>. Cafes, restaurants, theatres, public parks are closed and all non-essential activities have stopped. In living memory there\u2019s never been anything like this: under Nazi occupation, as we know, Paris culture and nightlife kept functioning rather well. Covid-19 is upon us now, and many of our continent\u2019s large cities feel like they\u2019re fast sliding into one of those dystopian movie scripts with empty streets, face masks, surgical gloves and self-isolation the new normal.</p> <p>With hospital emergency units bracing themselves for much worse yet to come, it feels almost irrelevant to dwell on what this moment says about our place in the world as Europeans, or which feelings we are able to muster \u2013 or not \u2013 for one another and for others overseas. Postwar Europe\u2019s institutional set-up was meant to epitomise international cooperation and solidarity, and to set a form of global example in the process. Will any of that survive now as countries start to wall themselves in? And what can we citizens do about it?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Postwar Europe\u2019s institutional set-up was meant to epitomise international solidarity. Will any of that survive now?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After Donald Trump signalled last week that the US wanted to de facto seal itself off from Europe, I remembered an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-first-doesnt-mean-america-alone-1496187426\">oped by two of his senior team members</a> published in 2017. \u201cThe world is not a \u2018global community\u2019, but an arena where nations ... compete for advantage,\u201d they\u2019d written. With Covid-19, that \u201carena\u201d is put into even sharper focus. And nationalist reflexes are hardly a Trumpian monopoly these days. (Reports that Trump offered a German biopharmaceutical company a fat sum of money to secure a vaccine exclusively for the US only added to a general go-it-alone picture.)</p> <p><br>There isn\u2019t much official coordination or sticking-together on display in Europe itself. National governments, including Germany\u2019s, have sealed their national borders to neighbouring states or are increasing controls. The rationale for much of this can be mind-boggling. Borders don\u2019t stop the virus. Some of what\u2019s at work is that rightwing populist credos have in recent years infected entire swaths of our continent\u2019s politics. For them, there is only one single measure of collective self-identification and solidarity: the ethno-national level. Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to take an example, lost no time holding \u201cforeigners\u201d responsible for the pandemic.</p> <p>As events spiralled and with the death count mounting, I wondered about empathy and solidarity: what triggers them? What does a pandemic crisis say about our capacity for such feelings and modes of action? And could grassroots, citizens\u2019 initiatives possibly course-correct some of the egoism of states?</p> <p><br>In his book Ordinary Virtues, <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/the-ordinary-virtues-review-words-of-wisdom-from-michael-ignatieff-1.3348520\">Michael Ignatieff quotes</a> a speech Eleanor Roosevelt gave at the United Nations in 1958. She was speaking about human rights conventions, but the gist of her text can apply to the notion of human solidarity at large. \u201cWhere, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home \u2013 so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person ... Without concerted citizen action \u2026 we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world.\u201d</p> <p>Being the global centre of the pandemic means we in Europe hold a specific responsibility in the way we react to this situation, and in how we behave also towards others beyond our shores. Perhaps it helps to think a bit about how we approached the climate crisis as a collective cause for mobilisation (think of the Paris climate agreement). Why couldn\u2019t we now clearly identify Covid-19 as another danger that needs to be addressed collectively \u2013 and take up the task as citizens to make that message loud and clear? However different, both these perils have this in common: they transcend all national boundaries and they threaten lives. The \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem\u201d logic of nationalists and populists becomes absurd in the face of these phenomena.</p> <p><br>So here\u2019s a question. While governments scramble, is it too early to think of launching a Europe-wide citizens\u2019 online campaign for solidarity in the age of the coronavirus? Could people create a movement that says, let\u2019s help each other as much as we can, and in ways that cut across the national divides many of our governments are resorting to?</p> <p>Videos of Italians in lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/italians-sing-patriotic-songs-from-their-balconies-during-coronavirus-lockdown\">singing from their balconies</a> to keep their spirits up have been admirable. Could some of that gusto spread and morph into a Europe-wide flurry of videos chanting our empathy and willingness to show solidarity with one another? Wherever we may live and whatever language we may speak, sending that kind of message across our \u201cCorona-centre\u201d continent would hold special meaning, surely not just for ourselves now, but for others also, and perhaps for the future as well.</p> <p>To be sure, for the moment we are stunned by the shock of what\u2019s unfolding and bewildered by what is yet heading our way. Also, still too many people seem confused or in a form of denial as to the exact extent of what we\u2019re facing. Until just days ago, some people in Paris thought best to keep partying, or to attend crowded public protests. Likewise in Ireland, videos of people celebrating in packed bars last weekend have caused outrage.</p> <p>Trust in institutions and resistance to fake news are being put to the test. Pessimists will say our European capacity to come together and show generosity, or even elementary openness to others, has already been entirely blunted by the crises of the past decade (our numbness to Syria\u2019s killing fields is, to me, the greatest case in point). We are no doubt now in severe, introspective, fear-and-fragmentation European mode.</p> <p>But for those who still believe we can be a community of a kind, and that our continental space (or the world beyond) should not be turned into an \u201carena\u201d, now is the time to ask ourselves how we will want to look back at this phase of our collective history. How will we want future generations to look back at us, and what kind of message do we want to send to the rest of the world? And please note, with every mention of Europe I include the UK. We are one continent, and the virus is among us all. Discord or \u201csocial distancing\u201d among nation-states makes no sense in the face of an invisible enemy in our midst which makes no distinction about its victims.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/europe-populists-coronavirus-salvini\">Europe's populists will try to exploit coronavirus. We can stop them | Catherine Fieschi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And look around: ordinary virtues aren\u2019t absent at all. Gestures of empathy and solidarity are multiplying at a local level \u2013 medical students volunteering to help hospitals, or neighbours helping the elderly get food. Why not invent something symbolically similar at a wider, transnational level, and by making use of digital tools? Politicians have done little of this. But citizens can show the way.</p> <p>Artists, creators, start-ups, activists, anyone or any network that\u2019s part of the fabric that binds us together in beautiful, meaningful ways under ordinary circumstances, could take a stand for cross-border solidarity in these extraordinary circumstances. Scientists and medics are of course sharing and coming together. Why not extend that to other parts of our societies? It\u2019s obvious that our only chance to somehow mitigate this catastrophe is to act together, or at least to act in ways that are closely attentive to others, not blind or negligent towards them.<br></p> <p>Many of us are now hunkering down at home, and it\u2019s all but natural that we focus on immediate day-to-day needs, the health of loved ones, saving our work or our livelihoods, in our entirely up-ended lives. But if our claims to human empathy have any meaning at all, then now is a good time to think of building up a pan-European chorus of voices for solidarity. Sure, it won\u2019t in itself bring us any closer to a vaccine, nor immunise us against the virus, but it could help immunise us against something else \u2013 the nasty undercurrents of nationalism that are lurking under the surface. As we Europeans stand at the epicentre of it all, it\u2019s up to us to make solidarity viral. <br></p> <p>\u2022 Natalie Nougayrede is a Guardian columnist<br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Everything seems normal until, suddenly, it isn\u2019t. The global crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak has transformed life as we know it and will continue to do so. With hundreds of thousands of deaths likely and countries across the world in lockdown, the impact of coronavirus is as upsetting to consider as it mind-boggling to grasp.</p> <p>In this week\u2019s special edition of the magazine, we first look at the science of the virus.

Then, Graham Readfearn looks at what the virus does to our bodies, while health editor Sarah Boseley and science correspondent Hannah Devlin lay out the facts we know so far about the virus.</p> <p>After that, we consider the global response beginning with Simon Tisdall\u2019s analysis of how world leaders \u2013 autocrats and democrats alike \u2013 have been caught in the headlights. Then, David Smith, our man in Washington, looks at how Donald Trump has been found more wanting than most.

  "<p>Cannabis may be legal in Vancouver but visitors looking to score are likely to run into a seemingly counterintuitive suggestion: try the black market.</p> <p>Recreational marijuana was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/17/cannabis-becomes-legal-in-canada-marijuana\">legalised across Canada</a> in October 2018. And yet on Reddit, the specialist forum website used by millions every day, many of Vancouver\u2019s cannabis connoisseurs still swear by their underground supply.</p> <p>This is one of the major issues facing North America\u2019s marijuana companies, which experts say are in the midst of a dotcom-style market crash.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/17/on-a-high-canada-celebrates-cannabis-being-legalised\">On a high: Canada celebrates cannabis being legalised</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Canada and 11 US states have legalised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/17/on-a-high-canada-celebrates-cannabis-being-legalised\">recreational use of the drug</a>, and a little over a year ago companies that cultivate and sell cannabis were seen by investors as one of the hottest tickets in town. Now billions of dollars have been wiped off the market values of the industry\u2019s largest companies.</p> <p>The North American Marijuana Index, which tracks listed firms in the sector, has plummeted about 80% in the last year and is at its lowest value since 2016, before much legalisation had taken place.</p> <p>The market capitalisation of Canopy Growth, the biggest firm in the sector by value, has fallen from $24bn in April last year to just over $6bn now, according to <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/WEED.TO/market_cap\">figures</a> from the financial data firm Y Charts.</p> <p>Around $2bn of that loss has come in the last week. Coronavirus fears, which have dragged down stocks across the globe, have not helped. But a large part of Canopy\u2019s latest share price drop came after the firm was forced to admit that it was struggling in Canada.</p> <p>The company announced last Wednesday that it would be closing two cultivation greenhouses in British Columbia \u2013 the western Canadian province where Vancouver is found \u2013 leading to 500 job losses. Canopy, which will be focusing on more cost-effective outdoor cultivation, also cancelled plans for a third greenhouse in Ontario.</p> <p>Bosses blamed the cutbacks on Canada\u2019s recreational market, which they said had \u201cdeveloped slower than anticipated\u201d.</p> <p>The consensus on Vancouver\u2019s cannabis-focused Reddit feeds is that the legal market is struggling to attract buyers because its product is more expensive but lower in quality than the black market alternative.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s pot is too expensive. The government doesn\u2019t show you a picture of what you\u2019re buying before you buy it, so you cannot be informed as a consumer. The government weed has been full of bugs, mouldy or too dry in some cases, and often takes too long to get there,\u201d one user said.</p> <p>\u201cThe legal stuff is garbage,\u201d said another Reddit user. A third said: \u201cFriends don\u2019t let friends smoke government weed.\u201d</p> <p>The sentiment is not confined to the realms of Reddit. Canadian government survey results released last month found that <a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/82-003-x/2020002/article/00002-eng.htm\">40%</a> of the country\u2019s marijuana consumers admit to having obtained the drug illegally since legalisation.</p> <p>Omar Yar Khan, national cannabis sector lead at the consultancy firm Hill &amp; Knowlton, says legal sales have fallen short of expectations for a number of reasons. Legal prices \u2013 driven up by taxes \u2013 have been a factor in helping keep the black market \u201cas rampant as ever\u201d, he says.</p> <p>But Khan, who advises several cannabis companies on public affairs, also believes firms have suffered in Canada at the hands of regulations that restrict their ability to develop brands.</p> <p>There are strict rules around advertising for cannabis companies. Khan said: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to draw loyal consumers away from the illicit market to a legal market when there is very little brand identity amongst the consumer groups.\u201d</p> <p>Companies have also been held back in their efforts to open stores, often by local authorities that are against cannabis being sold in their areas.</p> <p>\u201cThere just aren\u2019t enough legal licensed points of sale across the country,\u201d Khan said. \u201cI think in Ontario now we\u2019re up to about 30. But there are over a thousand beverage alcohol points of sale. So if it\u2019s not convenient for consumers to access the product through the legal system, why would they ever leave the legacy illicit market?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/28/malawi-legalises-cannabis-amid-hopes-of-fresh-economic-growth\">Malawi legalises cannabis amid hopes of fresh economic growth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anthony Dutton, a co-founder and former chief executive of Cannex \u2013 a US-focused marijuana firm that is listed in Canada and was recently renamed 4Front following a takeover \u2013 believes share prices in the sector have been driven down by certain firms overpromising to investors. He believes some of these companies are likely to collapse or be taken over by stronger rivals in the future.</p> <p>Dutton, who remains a shareholder in 4Front and still advises the firm, likens the current woes of listed cannabis companies to the dotcom crash of the early 2000s.</p> <p>\u201cThe market got ahead of itself, started to drink its own Kool-Aid, and it was a classic example of any bubble,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what we\u2019re seeing now, thankfully, is a lot of the companies that probably should never have been financed \u2013 and probably should never have gone public in the first place \u2013 are slowly withering on the vine and they\u2019ll just disappear.</p> <p>\u201cNow there will be a consolidation around half a dozen strong operating companies, including 4Front, and those will be the companies that will take it into the next cycle.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt\u2019s just like in the dotcom boom. Oracle, Microsoft and other big companies were all around then, and they were profitable. And when the little companies began to fail, Microsoft and Oracle and the others picked up the ones they wanted, and the others they just let die.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Sabet, the head of Smart Approaches to Marijuana \u2013 a campaign group that opposes lifting laws on the drug \u2013 says the legalisation of cannabis has been a \u201cboon\u201d to the black market in many areas because it means consumers are less concerned about trying the product.</p> <p>Sabet, who has advised White House administrations on drug policy, also believes cannabis companies have misled their investors and politicians about the societal and financial benefits of legalisation.</p> <p>\u201cThe cannabis business has been oversold to investors as a sure thing to get a great return,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there was a big hype over cannabis that has ended up being a reputation it could never live up to.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Canadian writer Michael Christie is a former professional skateboarder whose debut novel, <em>If I Fall, If I Die</em>, was a semi-autobiographical story of an 11-year-old boy caring for a severely agoraphobic mother. Christie\u2019s off-kilter style presented a peculiarly Canadian perspective on the vast, empty landscape: \u201cMy mother claimed that because nature was always trying to kill Canadians it made them different from other people.\u201d</p> <p>The follow-up, <em>Greenwood</em>, is a dense yet exhilarating eco-parable that spans a period from the great depression to a bleak prediction of the very near future. But at its heart lies that same Canadian paranoia about the natural world. Harris Greenwood is a lumberman raised during the leanest years of the 1930s, who has made a healthy fortune hacking down swaths of British Columbian forest. His rationale is that even the mighty sequoia are merely \u201cweeds on poles\u201d; and that clearing them is a necessary, pre-emptive form of self-defence. \u201cYou think trees are sacred, that they love you. That they grow for your enjoyment. But those who really know trees know they\u2019re also ruthless. They\u2019ve been fighting a war for sunlight and sustenance since before we existed.\u201d</p> <p>Over the generations the Greenwood lumber empire has diminished as catastrophically as the forests it plundered. The decline begins with Harris\u2019s ill-advised deal to supply railway sleepers to Japan shortly before the outbreak of the second world war. Later his estranged adopted daughter Willow gains posthumous revenge by handing her entire inheritance to a chaotic hippie collective in the 70s. Her son Liam is left to scrape a living as an artisan carpenter, crafting increasingly scarce reclaimed wood into boardroom tables. But the opening chapters of the novel are set in 2038, and feature Liam\u2019s daughter Jacinda Greenwood (known as Jake); a graduate dendrologist with a mountain of student debt living in a world almost entirely devoid of trees.</p> <p>Christie posits a world attempting to recover from an ecological catastrophe known as the Great Withering, during which rising temperatures unleashed a virulent new strain of fungus that destroys trees. The lack of a forest canopy causes soils to dry up, creating \u201ckiller dust clouds as fine as all-purpose flour\u201d. The world is left swarming with desperate climate refugees, many suffering from \u201crib-retch\u201d; a lethal, hacking cough that \u201csnaps ribs like kindling\u201d.</p> <p>In the new world order, the Canadian prime minster emerges as the most powerful woman on earth, with the vast and, in places, still-green country functioning as \u201ca global panic room for the world\u2019s elite\u201d. Jake finds herself working as a vastly over-qualified tour guide at a Pacific island re-branded as the \u201cGreenwood Arboreal Cathedral\u201d: an exclusive resort where the super-rich take therapeutic breaks in one of the world\u2019s last surviving old-growth forests. \u201cThey come to be reminded that the earth\u2019s once-thundering green heart has not flatlined, that it isn\u2019t too late and all is not lost. They come here to the Greenwood Arboreal Cathedral to ingest this outrageous lie, and it\u2019s Jake Greenwood\u2019s job as Forest Guide to spoon-feed it to them.\u201d</p> <p>The speculative episodes contain the most arresting and bleakly realised passages of the book, but they form merely the outer perimeter of a layered narrative constructed like the growth rings of a giant redwood. The scale of Christie\u2019s ambition becomes apparent when the novel goes head-to-head with the greatest dust-bowl narrative ever told. The allusions to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/14/grapes-of-wrath-75-years-old-more-relevant-than-ever\" title=\"\"><em>The</em> <em>Grapes of Wrath</em> </a>are far from hidden \u2013 Liam Greenwood observes the hipster clientele of a Brooklyn cafe \u201cin their old-time canvas aprons, linen work shirts and perfectly distressed boots like they\u2019ve stepped out of the pages of a Steinbeck novel\u201d. But the sections set in the 30s resound with authentically Steinbeckian cadences, albeit slightly modified in vocabulary: \u201cSmothering dusters scoured the lead paint from the barn and house, leaving great swaths of pinewood as white as a farmer\u2019s bared ass.\u201d</p> <p>Every generation produces prophets convinced that the age we are living in will be the last. Yet who in the present climate can confidently dismiss as fiction Christie\u2019s depiction of \u201cthe quaint period before the Withering when people still believed that well-intended, measured engagement could avert catastrophe\u201d? Perhaps the most prescient sections of the book are those that depict the dawn of climate activism in the 70s. Jake\u2019s feckless grandmother Willow is among the original tribe of earth-warriors; yet saving trees is to her as much a self-conscious pose as cultivating underarm hair and a lentil diet. \u201cWhy is it, she wonders casually, that we expect our children to be the ones to halt deforestation and to rescue the planet tomorrow when we are the ones overseeing its destruction today?\u201d</p> <p>Christie\u2019s book predicts a horribly plausible ecological Armageddon; and though it may not be the first to suggest that the opportunity to avert catastrophe has already passed, its great summation could well be the old Chinese proverb that Willow is fond of quoting: \u201cThe best time to plant a tree is always 20 years ago. And the second-best time is always now.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Greenwood is published by Scribe (RRP \u00a316.99).

  "<p>Naima Said stands back and studies her handiwork. \u201cNot quite,\u201d the self-taught beauty therapist mumbles, her forehead furrowed in frustration. Then she delicately dabs her client\u2019s eyelid with a squishy makeup sponge. She\u2019s not finished yet.</p> <p>Several years ago Said, 31, used YouTube videos to train herself in everything from dying hair to pedicures. Now she runs the Beauty Corner \u2013 a small but perfectly formed parlour in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast. Every weekday at 8am, she lays out her equipment and waits for women to walk through the door. Like Said, those who seek out her services are addicted to heroin, or in recovery.</p> <p>Housed in the Reachout Centre Trust, a Kenyan organisation that helps Mombasa residents to fight drug addiction, the parlour opened last year with the aim of attracting more female users to its services, which include HIV testing, counselling, methadone treatment and cervical cancer screening.</p> <p>Said was a heroin user for 10 years. After her father ran out of money to pay for private school, she was at a loose end, she says. Aged 17, she started smoking marijuana with her friends. By 21, she was a \u201cfull=blown\u201d heroin addict.</p> <p>\u201cI was half-dead, half-alive,\u201d she says. \u201cI started selling sex to pay for my next hit.

Since 2010, however, heroin use has increased faster across the continent than anywhere else in the world, according to the 2017 <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/wdr2017/field/Booklet_3_Plantbased_drugs.pdf\">report</a> of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).</p> <p> There are two reasons. First, despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/09/how-the-heroin-trade-explains-the-us-uk-failure-in-afghanistan\">billions of pounds</a> spent by the US and its allies to curb the production of opium poppies in Afghanistan, the amount grown has seen an \u201calmost continuous rise\u201d, says Simone Haysom of the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime (GIATO).</p> <p>In 2017, opium cultivation reached a record high (jumping <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/11/636182-afghanistan-opium-production-jumps-87-cent-record-level-un-survey\">87%</a> in one year). It has since fallen by 20% but Afghanistan still produces 82% of the world\u2019s heroin.</p> <p>Second, Africa has become an attractive drug transit route. Historically, most of the heroin trafficked to the west from Afghanistan came overland via the \u201cBalkan route\u201d. But after conflict and increased security made this path trickier to navigate, according to a <a href=\"https://enact-africa.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/2018-07-02-tackling-heroin-trafficking-policy-brief.pdf\">report</a> by the GIATO, smugglers took to the seas.</p> <p>Since 2010 the \u201csouthern route\u201d \u2013 also known as the \u201csmack track\u201d \u2013 has grown in popularity; heroin is trafficked from Afghanistan via the Indian Ocean into east and South Africa. From there it makes its way to Europe, Asia and North America. As more heroin has washed into east Africa, more people have become hooked.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of the drug just moving through the region, the region itself is now a destination,\u201d says Haysom.</p> <p>In 2017, the UNODC <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/wdr2017/field/Booklet_3_Plantbased_drugs.pdf\"> said</a> heroin addiction appeared to be on the rise in Kenya, particularly along the coast. As east Africa\u2019s largest port, Mombasa has borne the brunt of this increase, but usage has spread to other areas, including Nairobi and Kiambu county. Data is patchy, but it is estimated that between<a href=\"http://www.aidsinfoonline.org/kpatlas/document/KEN/KEN_2012_PSE_Report_FSW_MSM_PWID.pdf\"> 18,000</a> and <a href=\"https://enact-africa.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/2018-07-02-tackling-heroin-trafficking-policy-brief.pdf\">55,000</a> Kenyans use heroin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aea02ebfb246e54c8e71aed5a9428a62d665ca50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aea02ebfb246e54c8e71aed5a9428a62d665ca50/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heroin users prepare their fix  in Lamu, Kenya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heroin users prepare their fix in Lamu, Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Goran Toma\u0161evi\u0107/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While help is available at more than 50 registered treatment and rehabilitation centres across the country, rehabilitation is rarely free. Women are falling through the cracks.</p> <p>\u201cFemale drug users have very specific needs,\u201d says Faiza Hamid, Reachout\u2019s programme manager, \u201cand their needs aren\u2019t being met.\u201d</p> <p>A key problem is stigma: <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/women-using-heroin-in-kenya-why-its-important-to-intervene-early-in-life-122470\">many</a> participate in sex work to fund their drug habit (a single heroin dose costs between 150-200 Kenyan shillings, roughly \u00a31.50) and this prevents them from accessing treatment. Concerns about childcare, hard-to-reach treatment centres and <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr2015/World_Drug_Report_2015.pdf\">relationship issues</a> \u2013 the women often live with a partner with their own substance problem \u2013 also stop many coming forward for help.</p> <p>If women do seek out treatment, they are likely to drop out faster, and experience higher risks of <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr2015/World_Drug_Report_2015.pdf\">HIV infection</a>. Women constitute the minority of users, but experts say that the numbers on female drug use are underreported and likely to be much higher.</p> <p>At the same time, there is a clear lack of services tailored to women\u2019s needs and the majority of rehabilitation centres are aimed at men. While research on female drug addicts in Kenya is limited, <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr2015/World_Drug_Report_2015.pdf\">studies</a> have indicated that women enrolled in gender-specific treatment programmes have better outcomes and improvement than those who are not, according to the UNODC.</p> <p>That is where the Beauty Corner comes in. \u201cI talk to these girls,\u201d says Said, Reachout\u2019s first female methadone patient, who was chosen by the clinic\u2019s director to manage the parlour after attending counselling sessions.

The aim was to get women through the door and to make them feel special \u2013 even for a short while \u2013 before bringing up other, more difficult issues.</p> <p>It seems to be working. In under a year, 453 women have come to the parlour, and there has been a \u201cbig uptake\u201d of women using the clinical services, says Hamid. Cervical cancer screenings, for example, have risen by 34%. Said now sees on average 15 women every day.</p> <p>As the parlour fills up, a sticky midday heat settles in. Three women sit side-by-side, chatting quietly. One of them is 34-year-old Elizabeth Yieko, her hair a tangle of brightly coloured rollers.

  "<p>Cancer specialists are preparing to use cargo plane pilots instead of couriers to deliver life-saving stem cells to patients in need as global travel bans and border closings have created a \u201clogistical nightmare\u201d for the delivery of bone marrow and organ donations.</p> <p>DKMS, an international bone marrow donor center based in Germany, which helps thousands of patients who need bone marrow and stem cell transplants find donors every year, said it has been scrambling to help at least 113 patients who are awaiting their stem cell transplants in the next two weeks. Dozens more are scheduled for transplants in the next 30 days.</p> <p>In many cases, the patients have already begun a grueling treatment of high-dose chemotherapy and radiation to prepare for their transplants, and will need stem cells from donors to arrive on time.</p> <p>The process of delivering the stem cells has been severely complicated by global travel bans, border closings and quarantine rules that force couriers into isolation for 14 days after they have returned from a high-risk area.</p> <p>DKMS scored a major victory last weekend when its US partner, the National Marrow Donor Program, helped secure a travel waiver from the Centers for Disease Control that will allow couriers who are non-US citizens and non-residents to travel to the US to deliver stem cells collected from European donors.</p> <p>But the group is still beset by other logistical issues and concerns, including questions about whether future planned donations will be hampered by flight cancellations and staffing issues in hospitals overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>Closed borders within Europe are also creating havoc, with DKMS pointing to one difficult recent case in which stem cells were collected from a donor in Poland, brought to Frankfurt, Germany, and then sent to the US. Travel bans in India and Israel are also a big problem.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the problems we have right now is that there are less and less couriers and normal passenger flights will be reduced in the days and weeks,\u201d said Elke Neujahr, the global chief executive of DKMS, who said the group is trying to recruit new couriers. \u201cWe think we will run out of regular commercial flights soon.\u201d</p> <p>One possible solution \u2013 which Neujahr said will probably be necessary beginning two weeks from now \u2013 will be for cargo plane pilots to personally carry the stem cells on their flights so that they can be delivered to medical professionals at airports, and then brought to hospitals.</p> <p>Asked if she believed cargo pilots will be willing to help, since stem cells must be carried in-person, Neujahr said: \u201cI think they will do it, because if they know they can save a life, their willingness will be very, very high.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-map-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The problems facing DKMS and similar organizations show how the pandemic is affecting every aspect of medical care, including for the most vulnerable cancer patients.</p> <p>While many hospitals are delaying non-emergency treatments and surgeries in the face of the pandemic, the aggressive nature of many blood cancers means that transplants cannot be delayed.</p> <p>Marcel van den Brink, head of the hematological malignancies division at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and international chairman of DKMS, described several big challenges he faced last weekend, from tracking the movements of staff who have come into contact with patients who are positive for Covid-19, to planning for a possible drastic reduction in available doctors and other staff due to illness, which could require pulling doctors from other services to help treat Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that cancer care is going to be compromised and Sophie\u2019s Choice-like choices will have to be made.

  "<p>Goths are perhaps the most maligned of all subcultures.

In reality, goths are a collective of people bound by a shared love of fashion, music and art.</p> <p>Goth emerged out of the punk scene in the north of England in the 1980s. Its adherents are immediately recognisable by their black clothing and jewellery, their passion for artists such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus, Nick Cave and the Sisters of Mercy, and their fondness for imagery and lyrics referencing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2019/mar/19/why-goths-will-always-defend-their-right-to-shock\">macabre, darkness and death</a>. And the eyeliner, of course.</p> <p>Years of unfavourable press attention have bound goths together more tightly than other subcultures. \u201cThe scene has been partly defined by how it\u2019s been viewed negatively,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/paul-hodkinson\" title=\"\">Dr Paul Hodkinson</a>, a sociologist at the University of Surrey and an expert in goth culture. \u201cThat negative attention can give its participants an extra commitment to the scene, and strengthens their identity in the face of a perceived mainstream society that misunderstands or mistreats them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Unlike other subcultures, says Hodkinson, goth culture tends to be close-knit as a result of this shared experience of victimisation.

There was a girl \u2013 she was interesting and cool and she dragged me to a goth club. Nothing ever happened with her, but the goth thing stuck.</p> <p>I was living in Wolverhampton at the time, and there wasn\u2019t much goth stuff going on. I heard about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2017/oct/30/whitby-goth-weekend-in-pictures\">the first</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2017/oct/30/whitby-goth-weekend-in-pictures\"> Whitby Goth festival</a>, in 1994, through forums on the internet. There were 212 of us there. It completely exploded my mind.</p> <p>My dress sense has varied a lot over the years. I\u2019m not as young as I once was. I don\u2019t have a full mohican any more \u2013 I got rid of it around 2000, when I started going thin on top. Since then, I\u2019ve developed a love of hats. I\u2019ve got a massive wardrobe. I wouldn\u2019t call it a wardrobe \u2013 it\u2019s probably about three rooms.</p> <p>I always make a big effort on Halloween. One year, I was a white wolf. I had lace-up white boots, a white gothic jacket and a wolf head. I crept up behind my friend and growled at her. She ended up having a panic attack. I guess that outfit was a little too successful.</p> <p>Being goth is not something I\u2019m going to grow out of. I\u2019ve got masses of friends from the alternative scene. There\u2019s this misconception that all goths are miserable. Yes, there\u2019s a sense of macabre, but there\u2019s an amazing camaraderie and sense of community.</p> <p>I think because of my size, I get less abuse than other goths. I\u2019m quite good at de-escalating hostile situations. I can normally sort things out without fighting. There\u2019s always the odd drive-by shouting, but you get used to that. A few years ago, I was in Camden, north London, with a girlfriend \u2014 we were all dressed up to go to a ball. People in the street started whistling The Addams Family theme tune. But we were quite proud of it. At one of the earliest Whitbys, a few idiots came up from Scarborough and decided they would try and intimidate us by blaring 80s music from a Vauxhall Corsa. But the police moved them on pretty fast.</p> <p>Lots of goths tend to avoid customer-facing roles, because they get asked to tone down their outfits by their bosses. I\u2019ve only been asked to do that once, when I was working for a traffic company years ago. I had grabbed a T-shirt out of a drawer without looking at it and it had quite an offensive slogan on it, so that was fair enough. It\u2019s not such an issue for me, because I quite like wearing suits. I look good in them \u2013 as long as they are tailored.</p> <p>I have a theory that lots of goths were bullied growing up. Society turned its back on us, so we all went off and did our own thing. The clothes and the makeup are just a way to differentiate who is worth getting to know. Some people look at the clothes and are put off. But the people who take the time to look beneath it are the ones worth getting to know.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ff73c9fa0c08210b047ed96efd8ae4337636053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ff73c9fa0c08210b047ed96efd8ae4337636053/0_232_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cinzia Bacilieri.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cinzia Bacilieri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Cinzia Bacilieri </strong><br><strong>Lecturer </strong><strong>at the University of York</strong></h2> <p>I have been a goth since I was 13. It\u2019s just my taste \u2013 I\u2019m drawn to darkness. Growing up in Italy, I was really into music and art. I loved Caravaggio, because he was so dark. I discovered the band Paradise Lost when I was 18 \u2013 they were the first band I heard that blended metal with goth. For me, that was the perfect mix. I read an interview with them where they talked about being from Yorkshire, and I thought: where is Yorkshire? When I moved to York, it was bizarre, knowing I was in the place where goth metal was basically invented.</p> <p>I dress goth every day. I haven\u2019t worn colour since I was 14. Normally, I wear pale foundation, black eyeliner and blue, black or dark red lipstick. I can\u2019t see myself ever wearing colour. I briefly worked as a theatre steward in Cambridge when I was younger. The uniform was yellow \u2013 it wasn\u2019t like it was burning my skin or anything, but now that I don\u2019t have to wear a uniform, I only ever wear black. I think if I ever went into work wearing coloured clothes, my colleagues would have a heart attack! We joke that I should wear a floral dress on Halloween.</p> <p>My house is entirely black and white. I have too many skulls to count. I\u2019m really proud of the downstairs toilet \u2013 I call it my little catacomb. It\u2019s painted black, even the ceiling, and I have a customised loo-roll holder in the shape of a coffin. I\u2019m currently waiting for a customised four-poster bed with a built-in spiderweb to arrive.</p> <p>I\u2019m more into goth music than the aesthetic. I don\u2019t like how the goth scene is split in two. There are the people who are there because they love the music, and then the people who just like to go to Whitby and dress up. Why would you pretend to be goth just for a day? It makes a mockery of goth culture.</p> <p>People assume that you\u2019re depressed if you\u2019re a goth, but it\u2019s just the way I am. I think it\u2019s a positive thing to think about death. You think about the end to remind yourself to make the most of life each day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4bd2c51d81e0dfbe6b6b3e2bf3fee9e8973d9dc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bd2c51d81e0dfbe6b6b3e2bf3fee9e8973d9dc4/0_0_2654_4000/664.jpg\" alt=\"Joel Heyes.\" width=\"664\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joel Heyes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Quarmby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Joel Heyes </strong><br><strong>42, civil servant from Leeds</strong></h2> <p>I have been a goth, on and off, for 20 years.

It helped that I grew up in West Yorkshire, which is where lots of goth culture was based. Growing up in a small town, people weren\u2019t used to alternative subcultures; they were quite vocal about it. You had to be careful about how you would present yourself in public, to avoid getting into trouble.</p> <p>I can still remember my first proper goth night out. It was a club called the Phono, this old-school alternative goth club in Leeds. I\u2019d go there all the time. It was so exciting. It was this world of dreadlocks, big hair, PVC and Dr Martens.</p> <p>For a long time, the goth scene was in decline, but things are probably as good now as they have ever been. I run a festival called Goth City and in addition to that there are maybe a dozen goth festivals in the UK, and 100 gigging goth bands.</p> <p>If I\u2019ve got meetings at work, I wear a suit. Otherwise, I wear black jeans, a black blazer, pointed boots and a black frock coat. I always find myself returning to that hammy Victorian style \u2013 I like the tailcoat and white shirt and big hair aesthetic. David Vanian of the Damned is probably my biggest style influence. And if I\u2019m going out, I like to make my long black hair as big as possible with hairspray.</p> <p>I would like to be able to express myself as I want more often. Work isn\u2019t such an issue \u2013 you can rock a strong goth look and still be extremely smart. I think goths tend to look more professional than non-goths. But it\u2019s harder to find the time and spaces to dress goth as you get older. It becomes less practical, as you are in goth spaces less often. That said, I definitely don\u2019t ever go out in tracksuits or blue jeans. I do own a single pair of jeans. I wear them maybe once a year, in summer.</p> <p>There can be a bit of street heckling that goes on. It\u2019s never particularly intelligent: people will shout \u201cDracula\u201d, or whatever horror movie they can think of. It\u2019s only ever if I find myself in a town centre on a Friday or Saturday night, when people have been drinking. That\u2019s when you want to be careful. But I would never go out in that environment anyway, because you\u2019re looking for conflict. I tend to avoid town centres on a weekend. I don\u2019t want to attract attention. It\u2019s not really an issue for me \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want to go out there anyway. Nothing brings me into town.</p> <p>I see myself as an old-school goth. Not in an elitist way, but more in the sense of being true to the original counter-culture tradition of goth, as it came out of Leeds. We have an agenda that is liberal and progressive and an affinity to a darker, romantic view of the world. We\u2019re not all unhappy. There are a lot of extremely chipper goths out there. The idea that all goths are morbid and depressed definitely isn\u2019t the case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbf89a02ab286cd2d88276e010713cc313b92935\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbf89a02ab286cd2d88276e010713cc313b92935/0_480_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Mel Butler.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mel Butler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Mel Butler </strong><br><strong>47, a sales assistant from Teesside</strong></h2> <p>I got into goth music when I was 13. When you\u2019re a teenager, you feel like you need your own identity. Post-punk alternative goth music appealed to me, so I went from there. My father absolutely hated it. He couldn\u2019t understand why I was dressed all in black. The more he disliked it, the more I rebelled.</p> <p>Between 13 and 16, I couldn\u2019t go to pubs or nightclubs and meet other goths, so I stayed in my bedroom and listened to goth music and read Melody Maker and NME. When I left my bedroom, I would wear black leggings, pointy boots, a Sisters of Mercy T-shirt and have my hair all black and crimped. I did get a lot of stick for how I looked \u2013 I was the only goth in my sleepy market town.</p> <p>As soon as I turned 18, I moved to Leeds because that was the epicentre of goth culture. It was great: amazing nightlife, really nice people. But the scene died overnight in 93, 94. I\u2019d go down to the Phono nightclub and it had completely changed. All the people I knew there had stopped going. They all moved on with their lives. But I thought: \u201cI\u2019m not ready to grow out of this.\u201d So it developed into more of a lifestyle than a phase. There isn\u2019t another Mel who isn\u2019t a goth.</p> <p>My house is all goth: black flock wallpaper, black settees, black gloss furniture, baroque-style ornaments. I never get bored of wearing black. It\u2019s a godsend, because you never have to separate your clothes when you\u2019re wearing them. I married a goth. We had the wedding in a castle, and I wore a purple corset, with a big flouncy skirt to go with it, and purple and black hair extensions.</p> <p>Any time something bad happens, like a shooting spree, people say: \u201cHe was dressed in a trench coat and listening to Marilyn Manson.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t define goth. It goes a lot deeper.</p>",
  "<p>A decision about whether Missouri\u2019s last abortion clinic can remain open is \u201cimminent\u201d, advocates involved in the case have said.</p> <p>Last summer Republican state officials refused to relicense the state\u2019s last clinic, a Planned Parenthood in St Louis. If it shuts, Missouri will be the first state in the US to have no abortion clinic since abortion was legalized in 1973 in the Roe v Wade supreme court decision.</p> <p>Advocates have argued that the state\u2019s decision not to relicense the clinic is a political move to end abortion in a state long hostile to reproductive rights. The same year the clinic\u2019s license was denied, the state passed a restrictive eight-week abortion ban.</p> <p>Efforts to close the clinic in Missouri come in the context of a nationwide effort to restrict abortion. Last year, state lawmakers across the south and midwest passed \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d, which restrict abortion at six weeks.</p> <p>A judge\u2019s ruling on the Missouri case is expected soon as Monday was the last day for attorneys representing the state and Planned Parenthood to file legal briefs.</p> <p>Already, state statistics have shown women are leaving Missouri to obtain abortions. \u201cAbortion access is so difficult in Missouri that the majority of people choose to cross state lines instead of accessing care in their home state,\u201d said Yamelsie Rodr\u00edguez, CEO of the St Louis Planned Parenthood clinic.</p> <p>Only three women obtained abortions at the St Louis clinic in February, according to state data records <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/12/814768754/as-missouri-clinic-awaits-its-legal-fate-abortions-in-state-have-virtually-halte\">analyzed by NPR</a>. That is down from 174 the year before. More than 300 Missouri women crossed state lines into Illinois to obtain abortions. Rodr\u00edguez cited 72-hour waiting periods for an abortion, state-mandated counseling and, at one point, medically unnecessary pelvic exams as driving women to other states.</p> <p>In addition, court hearings revealed state officials had tracked women\u2019s menstrual cycles in an effort to find incomplete abortions at the clinic, and that the abortion clinic is the state\u2019s only outpatient facility inspected annually and that inspectors did not find an unsafe environment. State officials have claimed they revoked the license for alleged safety violations.</p> <p>Even more extreme measures have been introduced, though not passed, in other statehouses across the US. A group of Ohio lawmakers introduced a bill to make \u201cabortion murder\u201d a crime and requiring doctor to try to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/29/ohio-extreme-abortion-bill-reimplant-ectopic-pregnancy\">\u201creimplant\u201d ectopic pregnancies</a>, an impossible feat. One Missouri lawmaker introduced a bill to try to give due process rights to fetuses, and to then have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/06/missouri-abortion-police-bill-mike-moon\">local law enforcement</a> to stop women from having abortions.</p> <p>The case also comes in the context of the most high-profile reproductive rights case to come before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/us-supreme-court-abortion-case-louisiana-arguments\">supreme court</a> in decades. The court heard oral arguments this month on whether Louisiana could legally restrict abortion access. If upheld, the case could have severe nationwide implications.</p> <p>\u201cNo one should be forced out of their home state just to access healthcare,\u201d said Planned Parenthood\u2019s CEO, Alexis McGill Johnson, about statistics showing more women were seeking abortions in Illinois. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Missouri could soon be the reality for many more states and millions of other people. It is no coincidence that just over a week ago, we were rallying in front of the supreme court \u2013 the right to control your body, life, and future is on the line.\u201d</p>",

She said she is becoming increasingly worried as volunteers cancel.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had a lot of cancellations and that really scares me. You know, these people we are helping are just as scared as people in the UK are but they have no sanitation, they can\u2019t wash their hands, they can\u2019t shower. I\u2019m really scared and frightened for them.\u201d</p> <p>Care4Calais estimates there are around 1,000 people living outside in Calais and a further 2,000 across Dunkirk and the coastal area. She fears an outbreak would be devastating for an already vulnerable population.</p> <p>\u201cWe are incredibly worried about it, there are a lot of people whose health is not good and they are living outside. These people are suffering already from underlying lung issues, from exposure, tiredness, cold and they are obviously not able to self-isolate.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really frightened, we need the big aid organisations here; [M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res] and the Red Cross have been in France in the past, we need them back. \u201d</p> <p>Juliette Delapace, project manager for Catholic charity Caritas in northern France, was running a day centre in Calais, which has been forced to close in recent days.</p> <p>\u201cNow we have had to close the hundreds of people we give somewhere warm and safe to stay for a few hours really have nobody to help them and nowhere to go,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore, it was politically expedient for the state to deny help to this community because they knew NGOs would fill the gap, but now we cannot do this because we need to protect our volunteers and staff and limit the potential spread among people who are very vulnerable and have poor health.\u201d</p> <p>Delapace said it would be impossible for migrants and refugees in northern France to effectively self-isolate if they started feeling ill as they had nowhere to live and no way of getting food.</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t even call the emergency services because to do that you need to be able to charge your phone and the only place they could do that was the day centres and services that have now been shut.\u201d</p> <p>Concerns over staff passing on the virus to vulnerable migrants is also an issue in Greece, where the International Rescue Committee (IRC) are already taking precautionary steps.</p> <p>Dimitra Kalogeropoulou, IRC country director in Greece, told the Guardian: \u201cIt is is a grave concern for us that we don\u2019t expose the people we work with to the virus.

Many are located in the camps of Tuzla, Bihac and Velika Kladusa, on the Croatian border, where they live in cramped conditions in abandoned buildings or disused train stations. The heavy snowfall in December and January has made conditions intolerable \u2013 all camp residents are living without electricity, heat or drinking water.</p> <p>Bosnia\u2019s autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation declared a state of disaster on Monday, which will enable it to introduce emergency measures to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus, the region\u2019s prime minister Fadil Novalic said. Bosnia has reported 24 cases of Covid-19 so far, 20 of them in the country\u2019s other autonomous region, the Serb Republic.</p> <p>Doctors say that if the virus spreads among migrants here, there is no capacity to contain it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have room to put place them under quarantine,\u2019\u2019 said Semra Okanovi\u0107, a doctor in Velika Kladu\u0161a, a town near the Croatian border. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough tests for our population, and we don\u2019t have any for migrants. And really we don\u2019t know if some of them have been infected or not.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Dr Dominik Zenner, senior regional migration health adviser at the International Organisation for Migration, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cIt is very concerning that there are thousands of people across Europe who are extremely vulnerable to this epidemic, not only in refugee camps but spread out across the whole continent. .</p> <p>\u201cThe risk of these people being further stigmatised and pushed even further to the margins is increasing. If there is one thing that Covid-19 has shown us is that we\u2019re all in this together.

  "<h2>Top story: Queen and Philip batten down in Windsor</h2> \n<p>Hello \u2013 Warren Murray, keeping you close to the news in this time of social distancing.</p> \n<p>Travellers across the world are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-travellers-race-home-amid-worldwide-border-closures-and-flight-warnings\">scrambling to find flights home</a> as the number of coronavirus cases nears 200,000 globally, prompting governments to urge citizens to return and some nations to announce the imminent closure of airports and borders. The Australian government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/coalitions-second-multibillion-dollar-coronavirus-stimulus-expected-to-target-businesses-and-low-income-earners\">has advised citizens to return home</a> as soon as possible by commercial means, warning that overseas travel is becoming \u201cmore complex and difficult\u201d. Canada, New Zealand, Indonesia and the UAE have issued similar blanket advice. In the UK, the foreign office is warning against all but essential travel to many countries. It is withdrawing some staff from its embassy in Myanmar and has told British citizens to leave the country if able to do so due to \u201cpotential pressures on medical facilities\u201d and the risk of flights shutting down. Here is our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">latest at-a-glance roundup of the global situation</a>.</p> \n<p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced a \u00a3350bn package of loans and grants to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/17/rishi-sunak-pledges-350bn-to-tackle-coronavirus-impact\">help Britain cope</a> with the lockdown of large parts of the economy. Every business in the retail, leisure and hospitality sector will have a year-long holiday from business rates with smaller companies eligible for a cash grant of up to \u00a325,000. The chancellor also announced cash grants of \u00a310,000 for the UK\u2019s 700,000 smallest companies and a three-month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/17/uk-banks-set-out-details-of-covid-19-mortgage-holidays\">moratorium on mortgage payments</a> for home owners having difficulty because of the virus. Sunak said measures would be announced in coming days to help those renting. The Guardian\u2019s financial editor, Nils Pratley, writes that in terms of the scale of the intervention \u201cthe UK has never seen anything like it\u201d but to avert mass layoffs the government may need to go further and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/17/chancellors-330bn-coronavirus-package-is-big-but-not-big-enough\">underwrite British companies\u2019 payroll costs</a> as some other countries are doing. Keir Starmer, one of the Labour leadership finalists, writes that as well as those renting, areas like the social care sector need more money, as do local authorities and public services, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/the-chancellors-stimulus-package-doesnt-go-nearly-far-enough\">but they received none</a>: \u201cThe extra fiscal stimulus announced by the chancellor is overdue, but we have to be honest that it is does not go far enough.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Queen is to decamp early to Windsor Castle before Easter, while cancelling her traditional garden parties and postponing investitures.

In terms of everyday practicalities for the rest of us: Sainsbury\u2019s is closing its cafes and meat, fish and pizza service counters so staff can work on providing the essentials. It says supplies are still flowing in but shoppers will be restricted to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/four-items-per-shopper-restrictions-at-uk-supermarkets-as-demand-soars\">maximum of three items of any grocery product</a> and two packets of popular items such as toilet paper, soap and UHT milk.

But it remains a globally important ecosystem due to its role in carbon sequestration, water management and habitat provision to a wide range of species including capybara, armadillos, toucans and capuchins.</p> <p>Tapirs were eradicated in Rio de Janeiro state in 2014, and biologists say their return is more than symbolic.</p> <p>Growing to 2.5 metres in length and weighing more than 300kg, they are the largest terrestrial mammals in Brazil and play an important role in the dispersal of large seeds that can provide the pillars of the canopy. They also prune branches and leaves.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/onearth/how-do-you-regrow-rainforest-send-tapirs\">study</a> last year indicated tapirs could make reforestation quicker and cheaper because they tend to graze in degraded areas and their dung is packed with tree seeds.</p> <p>\u201cThe birth of a tapir in nature indicates the formation of a population in the state,\u201d Galliez said. \u201cThis is essential to restoring the proper functioning of this ecosystem.</p> <p>There are other encouraging signs.

The lowland tapir is classified as a vulnerable animal, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.</p> <p>Galliez said the return of a tapir population in Rio de Janeiro could be a turning point, but only if there was further support from donors to support conservation and reintroduction programmes, and from the authorities to curb poaching and deforestation.

  "<p>Mayibout 2 is not a healthy place.

The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, <a href=\"https://ensia.com/voices/if-our-planet-had-a-say-heres-where-future-roads-would-go/\">road building through remote places</a>, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, she says.</p> <p>The resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she says, is now \u201ca hidden cost of human economic development. There are just so many more of us, in every environment. We are going into largely undisturbed places and being exposed more and more.

Destroy landscapes, and the species you are left with are the ones humans get the diseases from.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are countless pathogens out there continuing to evolve which at some point could pose a threat to humans,\u201d says Eric Fevre, chair of veterinary infectious diseases at the University of Liverpool\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.liv.ac.uk/infection-and-global-health/\">Institute of Infection and Global Health</a>. \u201cThe risk [of pathogens jumping from animals to humans] has always been there.\u201d</p> <p>The difference between now and a few decades ago, Fevre says, is that diseases are likely to spring up in both urban and natural environments. \u201cWe have created densely packed populations where alongside us are bats and rodents and birds, pets and other living things. That creates intense interaction and opportunities for things to move from species to species,\u201d he says.<br></p> <h2><strong>Tip of the iceberg</strong></h2> <p>\u201cPathogens do not respect species boundaries,\u201d says disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie, an associate professor in Emory University\u2019s <a href=\"http://envs.emory.edu/home/index.html\"> department of </a><a href=\"http://envs.emory.edu/home/index.html\"> environmental </a><a href=\"http://envs.emory.edu/home/index.html\"> sciences</a>, who studies how shrinking natural habitats and changing behaviour add to the risk of diseases spilling over from animals to humans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"792b34357582632dc1d898ebd5ea4f3008eca057\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/792b34357582632dc1d898ebd5ea4f3008eca057/0_0_3129_2693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Gillespie with primatologist Jane Goodall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"861\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie with primatologist Jane Goodall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Thomas Gillespie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI am not at all surprised about the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d he says. \u201cThe majority of pathogens are still to be discovered. We are at the very tip of the iceberg.\u201d</p> <p>Humans, says Gillespie, are creating the conditions for the spread of diseases by reducing the natural barriers between host animals \u2013 in which the virus is naturally circulating \u2013 and themselves. \u201cWe fully expect the arrival of pandemic influenza; we can expect large-scale human mortalities; we can expect other pathogens with other impacts. A disease like Ebola is not easily spread. But something with a mortality rate of Ebola spread by something like measles would be catastrophic,\u201d Gillespie says.</p> <p>Wildlife everywhere is being put under more stress, he says. \u201cMajor landscape changes are causing animals to lose habitats, which means species become crowded together and also come into greater contact with humans. Species that survive change are now moving and mixing with different animals and with humans.\u201d</p> <p>Gillespie sees this in the US, where suburbs fragment forests and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/19/lyme-disease-pentagon-tick-bite-climate-crisis\">raise the risk of humans contracting Lyme disease</a>. \u201cAltering the ecosystem affects the complex cycle of the Lyme pathogen.

He and others are developing the emerging discipline of planetary health, which looks at the links between human and ecosystem health.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s misapprehension among scientists and the public that natural ecosystems are the source of threats to ourselves. It\u2019s a mistake. Nature poses threats, it is true, but it\u2019s human activities that do the real damage. The health risks in a natural environment can be made much worse when we interfere with it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Ostfeld points to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/diseases/direct.html\">rats</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/index.html\">bats</a>, which are strongly linked with the direct and indirect spread of zoonotic diseases. \u201cRodents and some bats thrive when we disrupt natural habitats. They are the most likely to promote transmissions [of pathogens]. The more we disturb the forests and habitats the more danger we are in,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Felicia Keesing, professor of biology at Bard College, New York, studies how environmental changes influence the probability that humans will be exposed to infectious diseases. \u201cWhen we erode biodiversity, we see a proliferation of the species most likely to transmit <em>new</em> diseases to us, but there\u2019s also good evidence that those same species are the best hosts for <em>existing</em> diseases,\u201d she wrote in an email to Ensia, the nonprofit media outlet that reports on our changing planet.</p> <h2><strong>The market connection</strong></h2> <p>Disease ecologists argue that viruses and other pathogens are also likely to move from animals to humans in the many informal markets that have sprung up to provide fresh meat to fast-growing urban populations around the world. Here, animals are slaughtered, cut up and sold on the spot.</p> <p>The \u201cwet market\u201d (one that sells fresh produce and meat) in Wuhan, thought by the Chinese government to be the starting point of the current Covid-19 pandemic, was known to sell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/24/calls-for-global-ban-wild-animal-markets-amid-coronavirus-outbreak\">numerous wild animals</a>, including live wolf pups, salamanders, crocodiles, scorpions, rats, squirrels, foxes, civets and turtles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7924ef86a71e43dd45752f7fa40fa9296b49a674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7924ef86a71e43dd45752f7fa40fa9296b49a674/0_0_4134_2751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dead pangolins seized in North Sumatra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dead pangolins seized by authorities in North Sumatra.

But bans on live animals being sold in urban areas or informal markets are not the answer, say some scientists.</p> <p>\u201cThe wet market in Lagos is notorious. It\u2019s like a nuclear bomb waiting to happen. But it\u2019s not fair to demonise places which do not have fridges. These traditional markets provide much of the food for Africa and Asia,\u201d says Jones.</p> <p>\u201cThese markets are essential sources of food for hundreds of millions of poor people, and getting rid of them is impossible,\u201d says Delia Grace, a senior epidemiologist and veterinarian with the International Livestock Research Institute, which is based in Nairobi, Kenya.

But \u2026 evidence shows the link between informal markets and disease <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247819866124\">is not always so clear cut</a>.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Changing behaviour</strong></h2> <p>So what, if anything, can we do about all of this?</p> <p>Jones says that change must come from both rich and poor societies. Demand for wood, minerals and resources from the global north leads to the degraded landscapes and ecological disruption that drives disease, she says. \u201cWe must think about global biosecurity, find the weak points and bolster the provision of health care in developing countries. Otherwise we can expect more of the same,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>\u201cThe risks are greater now. They were always present and have been there for generations. It is our interactions with that risk which must be changed,\u201d says Brian Bird, a research virologist at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine One Health Institute, where he leads Ebola-related surveillance activities in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in an era now of chronic emergency,\u201d Bird says. \u201cDiseases are more likely to travel further and faster than before, which means we must be faster in our responses. It needs investments, change in human behaviour, and it means we must listen to people at community levels.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f9e56c9f23da7cc5b01497fd7cc87838b5374b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f9e56c9f23da7cc5b01497fd7cc87838b5374b1/0_331_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poster in Beijing promoting wildlife as friends instead of food\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster in Beijing promoting wildlife as friends instead of food, after a crackdown on wild animal markets following the coronavirus outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Wong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Getting the message about pathogens and disease to hunters, loggers, market traders and consumers is key, Bird says. \u201cThese spillovers start with one or two people.

The prime minister accurately and soberly projected the fight Australia and the world is currently in.</p> <p>Morrison did a noticeably better job than he has done in recent times of mapping the future. While unfurling a substantial shopping list of immediate actions, he also projected over the horizon. Projecting over the horizon is important, because it provides the architecture for what might need to happen tomorrow, or next week, or next month.</p> <p>Morrison had to deliver a tough message. He told Australians life had changed, and life will go on being different for at least six months.</p> <p>Implicit in this was a homily about personal responsibility (which we can summarise as don\u2019t be selfish dickheads, stop the damn hoarding). Also implicit was the need to adjust our collective expectations.</p> <p>In our 24/7 society where the consumer is king, we are used to convenience. We are used to rapid fixes. We are used to having a lot of what we want, when we want it.</p> <p>But there is no rapid, consumer-first fix for a pandemic when there is no effective anti-viral treatment and no vaccine.</p> <p>That was Wednesday\u2019s message. Dig in people, we will be here, with this risk and this terrible uncertainty, for a while.</p> <p>Late last week, Morrison clearly struggled to process a universe where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/13/can-coronavirus-be-the-crisis-to-shake-us-out-of-our-alternate-reality\">he couldn\u2019t follow his habit of going to the opening NRL game of the season</a>, but by Wednesday, he was in a quantifiably different place \u2013 and he cast himself in the role of bringing the country with him to the altered place \u2013 the place where no one is going to the football for quite some time, and where not going to the football is the least of anyone\u2019s problems.</p> <p>Morrison predicted this altered place was of at least six months duration, when he likely meant a year, or perhaps two. But six months is the bridge to get to the year, or two.</p> <p>As well as the measurable prime ministerial journey from Friday to Wednesday, another thing was notable about Wednesday\u2019s performance.</p> <p>Morrison is the most ruthlessly political prime minister I\u2019ve seen, certainly since John Howard. He is highly attuned to reverberations in the community, so the prime minister is acutely aware that the hottest political issue at the moment \u2013 apart from please don\u2019t be a dickhead in the supermarket \u2013 is school closures, or more pertinently, the lack of them.</p> <p>Right at the moment, Morrison knows he is pushing against a tide of worried parents, irritated teachers, and a flotilla of well-intentioned and doubtless, skilled, medical professionals airing competing views about whether schools should be open or shut. He knows that persisting with keeping schools open, at least for now, is pushing against the grain \u2013 and he\u2019s doing it anyway.</p> <p>Doubtless this will be viewed in some quarters as typical Morrison obduracy. I\u2019m sure many people will feel this is entirely analogous to the prime minister\u2019s deep reluctance to acknowledge the seriousness of the summer bushfire catastrophe, because doing that would open a politically inconvenient debate about climate change.</p> <p>But at close range, this really doesn\u2019t look, or feel, like obduracy. Morrison is being transparent about why he\u2019s not closing schools, at least not at this point. \u201cThe health advice is that schools should remain open. That is the health advice,\u201d the prime minister said Wednesday.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By laying out the arguments, the pros and the cons, the prime minister is telling voters the truth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Implicit in this pointed attribution is Morrison telling onlookers: I am not being politically expedient, I know you are all worried, but I\u2019m keeping schools open for now, because when it comes to managing this pandemic, I have turned to the experts, and I intend to be guided by evidence.</p> <p>This statement would be entirely unremarkable for some holders of public office. But it is significant for Morrison, because he is a politician guided heavily by instinct.</p> <p>This is a mantra against type.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if this new evidence-first rule will last, and I have no idea whether it will be more universally applied, but from my vantage point, this is what is guiding current decisions.</p> <p>Another point to note. Experts and evidence first is a genuinely difficult yardstick to apply to yourself and your government in the specific circumstances of a pandemic, when there will be a range of valid views among clinicians and public health specialists.</p> <p>For people like me who like facts, this strategy may feel like a shield and sword, and a decisive blow against the pervasive feelpinion and misinformation that crackles around us, like static, corroding comprehension and sense.</p> <p>But politically, it can be fraught, particularly in a low trust, pick-a-box, environment. The rebuttal to evidence-first is obvious: which evidence, which expert, is guiding these decisions? Is it someone I trust, or is it someone a prime minister (I fundamentally don\u2019t trust) nominates?</p> <p>Perhaps, in the circumstances, I\u2019ll trust another expert, and declare Morrison a complete idiot. Seriously folks. This is where inveterate, belligerent, culture warring ultimately leads us: to a permanent present where nobody is believed, and the opposite is also true.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-diaries-everyone-is-frightened-and-its-getting-weird-now\">Coronavirus diaries: everyone is frightened and it's getting weird now | First Dog on the Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A couple more observations about Wednesday. Morrison took the time to explain the rationale for his decision making, and he didn\u2019t project the resentful disposition he can project at times. He explained, at length, without looking like this was an unnatural imposition on an important person.</p> <p>By explaining the rationale for the decision making (which again is behaviour against type, because Morrison is, by instinct, a \u201cshut up and eat your peas\u201d sort) \u2013 the prime minister is also showing his methods to the public, which really needs to happen to build confidence in the messaging.</p> <p>By laying out the arguments, the pros and the cons, the prime minister is telling voters the truth. He\u2019s telling people there are no perfect choices, not in this situation, there are just on-balance calculations.</p> <p>Another action against type can be noted. Morrison is not a herd animal. He\u2019s a solo act. And yet when it comes to this issue, he\u2019s lining up a whole national apparatus to buttress his decision-making and messaging.</p> <p>He\u2019s pulled the premiers and their medical advisers in close. He\u2019s trying to create a collegiate structure that can present coherently to the public.</p> <p>It\u2019s genuinely interesting. But before we declare this behaviour some fundamental epiphany or awakening, it is obvious this last element is a strategy of necessity. By pulling in the arms of government, and creating a collegiate apparatus that speaks with a single voice wherever possible, he\u2019s limiting the scope for blame shifting across the jurisdictions.</p>",

It has to end. Bernie Sanders must drop out and clear the mess. The Trump presidency, and its lies and incompetence, must end. We can barely take another minute.

The results from today\u2019s election would never be considered legitimate under normal circumstances with poll locations closing with no notification, poll workers not showing up for fear of their lives, and other locations being consolidated which all but ensures that voters in those locations will be gathered in groups larger than the 50 maximum limit suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> <p>But here we are, with a party that is so desperate to put the progressive movement down that it would risk the lives of their voters to go to the polls during a national emergency. There will be a rush to \u201cvalidate\u201d this election, but any reasonable observer engaging in good faith would confess that not postponing the primaries or, at a minimum, extending the primaries and allowing the voter to continue voting by mail constitutes voter suppression.</p> <ul> <li><p>Benjamin Dixon is the host of the Benjamin Dixon podcast</p></li> </ul> <h2>Jessa Crispin: \u2018Welcome to voting in time of social distancing\u2019</h2> <p>All day, there were reports of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/madeleinedupre/status/1239898696227094528\">primary</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachel_joyy/status/1239963191972511746\">voting</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sebaasilv/status/1239983086668046337\">mishaps</a>. Polling places were not open, workers and volunteers did not show up, and there did not seem to be safety precautions in place in several locations to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Talking heads were saying how important it was to continue the primary process, but meanwhile, newspapers and politicians implored the citizenry to <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/gov-pritzker-reiterates-plea-for-people-to-stay-home-due-to-coronavirus/2237275/\">STAY HOME</a>. Kind of getting some mixed messages here, guys. I don\u2019t know if Chicago should have forced everyone who showed up to the St Patrick\u2019s Day pub crawls to man the polls, but probably we should have had some sort of Plan B procedure for voting during a national state of emergency.</p> <p>So basically, why are we doing this? And why are we pretending the results today are real and full?</p> <p>But even before the pandemic, we saw terrible voting conditions for months. States like Texas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/texas-polling-sites-closures-voting\">closed hundreds of polling stations</a>, making voters wait for hours in line. We saw <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/03/08/large-texas-county-seeks-super-tuesday-recount-after-discovery-of-uncounted-ballots_partner/\">ballots go uncounted</a>. And that\u2019s bad enough without talking about mass disenfranchisement and the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/12/20/790319853/are-states-purging-or-cleaning-voter-registration-rolls\">purging of voter registration rolls</a>.</p> <p>As I watched CNN for the primary results, I saw more outrage about roller-bladers in San Francisco breaking the call for social distancing \u2013 I really thought Jake Tapper might break down weeping when a kid walking around what should have been empty streets gave a thumbs up to the camera \u2013 than I saw about the difficulties people have had voting today. Then Biden gave some victory speech with all the vim and vigor of a man shuffling to the refrigerator in the middle of the night to see if there\u2019s any pudding left, and I really felt, you know, the healing of the nation or whatever.</p> <p>I\u2019m worried Sanders supporters will use these voting difficulties only to question the legitimacy of the results. What it should do instead is invigorate the left vote to organize around massive voting reform.

Indeed, the Delaware Democrat captured the votes of white people without college degrees, a prize that eluded Clinton and a bloc Donald Trump calls his own. A global pandemic and a market crash will sorely test the president\u2019s hold.</p> <p>As for Sanders, his quest has morphed into the quixotic, an exercise in rule or ruin, or all of the above.

While Biden performed well in Illinois, turnout was down on 2016, probably due to coronavirus fears. The postponement of the</p> <p>Ohio primary means we have been denied another opportunity to assess Biden\u2019s strength in the Midwest.</p> <p>Extensive early voting and vote-by-mail options allowed turnout in Florida to actually rise on 2016, which seems to bode well for Democratic enthusiasm in the general election \u2013 especially if we assume that turnout would have been even higher without coronavirus fears.</p> <p>Had the Democratic primary still been competitive going into Tuesday\u2019s contests, serious questions could be raised about the impact of the virus on the results \u2013 and given that the answers to these questions rest on such intangibles as why turnout was down, they would be very difficult to answer.</p> <p>It is vital that the integrity and legitimacy of the November election be maintained even if the coronavirus pandemic is ongoing. Extensive preparations should be made, starting now, to ensure that alternatives to in-person voting exist.

On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.\u201d</p> <p>Well the American people had that opportunity and they chose Joe Biden. If this is what winning the ideological debate looks like, Sanders should seriously consider debating another topic.</p> <p>The only topic the American people want to debate is the coronavirus pandemic and the severe recession that looks like the certain outcome of this quasi-national quarantine. Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/mnuchin-warns-virus-could-yield-20percent-jobless-rate-without-action/2020/03/17/2c8ece2e-68a3-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html\">told</a> Republican senators on Tuesday that unemployment could hit 20% if they didn\u2019t push through a huge economic stimulus as soon as possible.</p> <p>To put that into context, unemployment peaked at 10% after the financial collapse of 2008. It hit 24.9% in the Great Depression in 1933.</p> <p>Just one week ago, Bernie Sanders pledged to fight on, at a time when he was losing the delegate count by around 100 attendees of the Democratic convention. Judging from the projected vote counts on Tuesday, that delegate deficit just tripled.</p> <p>There is no reason for Sanders to stay in this race, no matter how fervent his fans and no matter how passionately he wants to advocate for his policies. He has spent the last four years advocating for those policies, pushing the Democratic party towards his ideas to remarkable effect.</p> <p>Back in the 2008 election and Barack Obama\u2019s first term, it was unthinkable to propose a public healthcare option: the defeat of Clinton\u2019s healthcare proposals was still too raw, more than a decade after they had failed. Today all the Democratic contenders proposed a public option, and Joe Biden\u2019s healthcare policies are far to the left of Obama\u2019s.</p> <p>Mission accomplished? <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/bernie-sanders-biden-2020.html\">Apparently</a> not. Bernie\u2019s advisers say Biden hasn\u2019t done enough to unify the party, or generate voter enthusiasm.</p> <p>This is not a position supported by the primary results. Biden has won in the south and the north; the east coast and the north-west. When you win Florida by more than 60% of the vote, you\u2019ve pretty much unified the party. When you drive record turnout in the middle of a pandemic \u2013 which is frankly a reckless situation from a public health perspective \u2013 then you have reasonably generated voter enthusiasm.</p> <p>By any measure, Biden can feel confident in turning towards the general election and, more importantly, beyond that: to the historic challenge of pulling this country, and the rest of the world, out of a pandemic and global recession. It\u2019s unlikely that he will agree to another debate with Sanders.</p> <p>The pandemic is only accelerating the process that was first set in train by South Carolina\u2019s Democrats. State by state, poll by poll, Democrats \u2013 and voters in general \u2013 are saying that Biden is best placed to handle a crisis, and to unify the country. Those are not small issues at a time of multiple, historic challenges.</p> <p>Biden himself addressed the nation via live stream from his Delaware home, standing at a podium in front of two American flags. If it was indeed Biden\u2019s home, he has a strange taste in interior styling.</p> <p>Most of what Biden said was not a victory speech but the words of someone trying to reassure and rally a country being shaken to its core. \u201cTackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war,\u201d Biden explained. \u201cYes, this is a moment where we need our leaders to lead. But it\u2019s also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact what happens.\u201d</p> <p>He praised the public officials who allowed the voting to take place while supposedly protecting public health. And he praised Bernie\u2019s young voters for their enthusiasm and commitment, urging them to rally together with his campaign. \u201cI hear you,\u201d he told them. \u201cI know what\u2019s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and then to unify the nation.\u201d</p> <p>He may not actually know what those young Sanders voters want \u2013 or he may not be prepared to adopt their agenda in full. But he was prepared to strike a patriotic note of national unity. \u201cThis is a moment for each of us to see and believe the best in every one of us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cTo believe in one another.\u201d</p> <p>There will surely come a time for another, younger Sanders-like leader to press for a political revolution that overhauls America\u2019s economy and social safety net. If this recession plays out like the last one, voters of all kinds will be hungrier than ever for radical change in four years\u2019 time.</p> <p>That leader may already be well-known to American voters: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will have just turned 35 \u2013 the constitutional minimum age of a president \u2013 by the time of the next presidential election. Bernie\u2019s ideas will live on long after his presidential campaign ends, which it should do within days, if he is serious about wanting the Democrats to defeat Donald Trump.</p>",
  "<p>Most people agree we should do all we can to help those who \u2013 through no fault of their own \u2013 contract Covid-19. The government is, rightly, about to spend billions of dollars on health services to help those who need it. No one expects people to get through coronavirus on their own.</p> <p>But when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who are about to lose their jobs because of Covid-19, our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/thousands-of-australian-doctors-call-on-government-to-ramp-up-coronavirus-response\">public policy response</a> is not nearly so generous.</p> <p>The median full-time wage in Australia is <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/ProductsbyCatalogue/27641437D6780D1FCA2568A9001393DF?OpenDocument\">$68,000 a year</a>.

And the more people that enter the ranks of the unemployed, the longer the average bout of unemployment will last.</p> <p>2. \u201cIf Newstart would be \u2018too generous\u2019, people would have no incentive to look for work.\u201d <br><br>Again, leaving aside the fact there was never any strong evidence that a lack of effort or searching (as opposed to a shortage of jobs) was the cause of unemployment, surely, no one believes that an airline worker who gets stood down from their $80,000 per year job needs any more incentive to return to work than their employer allowing them to.</p> <p>But just as there\u2019s no reason to lay blame on people who need intensive care because they\u2019ve contracted Covid-19, there is absolutely no reason to blame the retail workers, tourism workers or teachers who are likely to find themselves without an income in the coming weeks. And it\u2019s hard to imagine why we wouldn\u2019t help them.</p> <p>Another argument for not helping the unemployed is that individuals should have prepared themselves for a \u201crainy day\u201d. This argument was put most gratuitously by the federal attorney general, Christian Porter, who suggested casual workers \u2013 <a href=\"https://cdn.aigroup.com.au/Economic_Indicators/Research_Notes/2018/Ai_Group_casual_work_June_2018.pdf\">around 40% </a><a href=\"https://cdn.aigroup.com.au/Economic_Indicators/Research_Notes/2018/Ai_Group_casual_work_June_2018.pdf\"> of whom are below 25 years old</a> \u2013 should have \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/christian-porter-doesnt-understand-insecure-work-can-be-scarier-than-coronavirus\">already made provisions</a>\u201d for an event like being told they can\u2019t work for 14 days because of a global health pandemic.

And while far from generous, the age pension is a full 54% higher than Newstart, at <a href=\"https://www.superguide.com.au/accessing-superannuation/age-pension-rates\">$430.30 per week</a>. If we boosted the income of those on Newstart by the $10,000 difference between their payment and the age pension, the cost over 12 months would only be around $7.3bn.</p> <p>But of course we shouldn\u2019t stop with the unemployed. For the course of this crisis we should boost the weekly incomes of all beneficiaries, all of whom are among the lower state income earners, and all of whom will struggle with less casual work and the higher costs for staples.</p> <p>The government has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/what-australian-governments-coronavirus-stimulus-package-means-for-you-explainer\">announced its first $17.6b</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/what-australian-governments-coronavirus-stimulus-package-means-for-you-explainer\">n stimulus package</a> and is reportedly working on its second. There might even be a third and fourth round of stimulus, as the length of this pandemic makes itself apparent. Given the obvious needs of those with the least work and on the lowest incomes, and given the government\u2019s need to pump money into the economy, there is literally no argument against boosting Newstart payments other than \u201cthey don\u2019t deserve it\u201d.</p> <p>But no one \u201cdeserves\u201d to get Covid-19. And no one deserves to lose their job or stay stuck in unemployment because of Covid-19 either.</p> <p>Australia is one of the richest countries in the world. While we have high levels of household debt we have very low levels of public debt. State and federal governments will likely borrow more than $100bn over the course of this health crisis. That\u2019s a very good thing.</p> <p>Decades of political sloganeering have convinced large sections of the media, and of the population, that government borrowing is wasteful, a burden on future generations, or both. But \u2013 as all of the media and all of the population are about to learn \u2013 almost no economists or politicians actually believe that.</p> <p>Allegedly there are no atheists in a foxhole, and history tells us that everyone becomes a Keynesian when they are tasked with avoiding a recession.</p> <p>Just as borrowing money to buy a house or get a uni degree makes sense because the future benefits are greater than the interest costs, borrowing money to avoid a recession and save tens of thousands of jobs can set Australia up for decades. It\u2019s a pity it takes a pandemic to drive such honesty into our public debate, but we should take advantage of the honesty nonetheless.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/18/australian-airline-industry-to-receive-715m-rescue-package\">Australian airline industry to receive $715m rescue package</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether it\u2019s pumping tens of billions of dollars into the economy via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/28/australia-global-economic-crisis\">Kevin Rudd\u2019s $950 cheques to nearly everyone</a> or through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/six-million-low-income-earners-to-receive-750-cash-under-coalitions-coronavirus-stimulus\">Scott Morrison\u2019s $750 cheques to the unemployed and age pensioners</a>, boosting benefits is a highly effective way to keep money going through cash registers, and in turn, keep people in their jobs.

I totally understand that. Aged care facilities will have the discretion to put in very strict arrangements to enable people to visit their loved ones if that is the situation that that resident finds themselves in.\u201d</p> \n<p>Amid concern about the potential of the virus to take hold in vulnerable remote Indigenous communities, Morrison said a list of proscribed areas that would limit visitation was also being prepared by the states.</p> \n<p>Anzac Day events and ceremonies will also be cancelled due to the higher proportion of older Australians who attend such events.</p> \n<p>Ruling out a short-term lockdown of the country, which Murphy claimed would \u201cachieve nothing\u201d, Morrison warned that the measures being taken by the government would likely be in place for at least half a year.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are looking at a situation of at least six months for how we deal with this,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt could be much longer than that.

The agreement allows EU countries to band together to use their combined purchasing power to get a good deal on vaccines and other medical supplies.</p> \n  <p>The EU executive is organising joint procurement of protective clothing for medics, including masks, as well as ventilators. The commission spokesperson said \u201ca very big majority of member states [were] interested\u201d in taking part in the joint procurement on ventilators. The British government has not revealed whether it intends to take part in any of the procurement schemes.</p> \n  <p>On Monday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/vauxhall-owner-psa-car-shuts-european-plants-amid-coronavirus-fears\">urged British industry to step forward and build 20,000 ventilators \u201cat speed\u201d</a>. The NHS has 5,900 ventilators, but might need more than three times as many in the worst-case scenario for the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>The UK will be expected to apply EU-wide restrictions on the export of medical goods outside the bloc, passed in emergency legislation on Sunday. For a period of six weeks, EU countries and the UK will have to seek approval to export critical medical supplies outside the bloc.</p> \n  <p>Later on Tuesday, EU leaders are expected to adopt a 30-day travel ban on non-EU citizens entering the union, but the commission has said restrictions will not apply to the UK. There are exemptions for residents, diplomats, healthcare workers and researchers, and people delivering goods.</p> \n  <p>The UK and <strong>Ireland</strong>, neither in the EU\u2019s Schengen passport-free travel zone, are being \u201cencouraged\u201d to enforce the travel ban.</p> \n  <p> A UK spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK can choose whether to opt in to this proposal if it is agreed.

Our first priority is non-negotiable: to save lives,\u201d he told Greeks in a televised speech from his Maximos office. \u201cThat is why, much earlier than other European countries, we enforced measures that are unprecedented in peacetime. And we are continuing in that direction.\u201d </p> \n  <p>So far, Greek health authorities have announced 387 confirmed cases of coronavirus, revealing this afternoon that a fifth person had fallen victim to Covid-19. There were 35 new cases in the last 24 hours, the health ministry spokesman and infectious disease expert professor Sotiris Tsiodras told reporters. Of the total number, 11 were in intensive care, he said. </p> \n  <p>Fearing the fate of Italy, the centre-right government has threatened to be merciless with those who flout tough restrictions that as of Wednesday will also include all shops being closed across Greece, with the exception of supermarkets.

Trials of the drug, which are necessarily thorough, including checking its efficacy and potential side effects, mean that even if approved, it is not likely to be available until next spring.</p> \n  <p>It spent the first 15 minutes, though, attempting to quash the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/trump-offers-large-sums-for-exclusive-access-to-coronavirus-vaccine\">reports</a> in recent days according to which the company had been approached by the US government with an offer to exclusively buy up the vaccine it is working on, for one billion dollars. </p> \n  <p>First, to those rumours, the companies managers said they were just that. They categorically denied there was any truth in them, explaining that company bosses had been invited at extremely short notice to visit the White House last week, and speak to US government officials, along with representatives of other international companies working on coronavirus vaccines. This is despite the fact that the German interior minister, foreign minister, even the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the owner of CureVac, Dietmar Hopp, had commented on the reports as if they had been true, saying that \u201cGermany is not for sale\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis technology (to make the vaccine) can be applicable for anyone and there have not been requests for us to do it exclusively for the US,\u201d CureVac\u2019s deputy CEO Franz-Werner Haas told journalists. \u201cWe did not talk to Maas (the foreign minister) or Seehofer (the interior minister) so we cannot comment on that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>CureVac is a 20 year old company which develops therapies based on the molecule messenger RNA (mRNA) and has specialised in developing vaccines for infectious diseases as well as on drugs to treat cancer. Mariola Fotin-Mletczek, PhD, chief technology officer, explained the vaccine technology she is currently working on. \u201cNature has very good mechanisms for fighting against pathogens - viruses and bacteria - and with our technology we mimic nature\u2019s approach,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way we formulate this messenger molecule means it mimics this virus situation. </p> \n  <p>This means that we induce the immune response which is very similar to the natural immune response. With our approach, messenger RNA encodes one specific protein from the virus, the critical one, which is sufficient to mobilise the immune system. We do this in such a way that we use this natural mechanism which really helps to induce and to produce huge amounts of potent anti-bodies which neutralise the virus. </p> \n  <p>And that is exactly what we saw in the trial with our latest vaccine based on exactly the same technology. Also here we see that two doses of one microgram are sufficient to mobilise the immune system in the right way and to induce production of protective antibodies above the defined threshold, which means protection.\u201dShe said that laboratory trials on the vaccine would start in April and clinical trials would begin in the early summer.</p> \n  <p>The company has received an 80 million Euro grant from the European Commission in the last few days, which will enable it to \u201caccelerate the upscaling of a manufacturing unit which would produce the vaccine which is already being built,\u201d according to Florian von der M\u00fclbe, chief production officer and co-founder of CureVac. </p> \n  <p>This means once it got the go-ahead, the company could potentially produce high quantities of the drug so that it could be made available worldwide. The production facilities could be replicated easily elsewhere, increasing the efficiency and speed with which it could be made available, he added.</p> \n  <p>Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, the main public health body in Germany, said earlier today, the concept was based on tumour therapy, with the vaccine \u201creacting to the protein in the virus and receiving an answer from it\u201d. It is a technology already used to fight cancers, he said. \u201cIf it works, it would be amazing,\u201d he said, calling the technology \u201cfast, cheap and efficient\u201d. But based on current information, and he would not expect a vaccine to be ready until next spring.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e70ee018f085e564ad85d05\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/benquinn\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T15:39:53.572Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-france-on-war-footing-as-europe-locks-down-macron\">\u2022 The EU is set to endorse the strictest travel ban in its history as France joined Italy and Spain in full lockdown and Donald Trump told Americans to change their behaviour, acknowledging for the first time that beating the coronavirus could take months.</a><br>EU leaders are expected on Tuesday to suspend all travel into the passport-free Schengen zone by non-EU nationals for at least 30 days in a bid to instil uniformity across the bloc after some member states, including Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, unilaterally began imposing border checks.<br></p> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">\u2022 Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d, escalating a deepening US-China diplomatic spat over the outbreak.</a></strong><br>After giving an address on Monday warning of a possible recession, the US president posted on Twitter: \u201cThe United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus.

Sorry to say that I, today, have tested positive for COVID19, Corona virus. My familiy and I are self-isolating at home for as long as it takes. We are in good health - I only have mild symptoms of a cold. There are people at higher risk for who this virus might be a devastating diagnosis, so I urge all of you to be extremely careful; wash your hands, keep 1,5 meters distance from others, go in quarantine; just do everything you can to stop the virus from spreading. Together we can fight this virus and avert a crisis at our hospitals. Please take care of each other, keep your distance, and stay healthy! Please visit your country&amp;#39;s Center for Disease Control&amp;#39;s website, and follow the regulations for staying safe and protecting not just yourselves, but our entire community, and especially those at risk like the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. @grymolvaerhivju #fightcorona #solidarity #takecare #folkehelseinstituttet Thanks to @panoramaagency</a></p> <p style=&quot;

The question is: How? </p> \n  <p>Here is a summary of the latest developments:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The head of the World Health Organizaion, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, implored governments to test more suspected cases, </strong>warning that they cannot fight the pandemic blindfolded.<strong> </strong>In a strongly-worded attack on governments which have neglected or held back testing, he said: \u201cWe have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing, which is the backbone of the response.\u201d<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The White House recommended isolation.</strong> US President Donald Trump told Americans to avoid any gatherings of more than 10 people over the next 15 days and advising all states with evidence of community transmission to close down bars, restaurants, gyms and other facilities.</li> \n   <li><strong>The death toll in Italy from Covid-19 increased to 2,158, with the announcement of another 349 victims in Europe\u2019s worst his country.</strong> Spain confirmed 9,191 cases and 309 deaths, making it the second hardest-hit country in Europe after Italy.</li> \n   <li><strong>The death toll in the UK increased to 55 people, including the first death in Wales</strong>. The latest victims included a 56-year-old, believed to be the youngest in the UK so far.</li> \n   <li><strong>Britons were told to avoid pubs, bars and restaurants and to self-isolate if anyone in their family fell ill.</strong> The new government advice, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others\">something of a U-turn</a>, came during the prime minister\u2019s first daily press conference. Boris Johnson unveiled a series of stringent new restrictions, including a 14-day isolation for all households with symptoms, a warning against \u201cnon-essential\u201d contact, and an end to all mass gatherings. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>The G7 nations stressed the importance of international cooperation.</strong> A statement released by Downing Street sought to highlight the significance of national governments not looking solely to their own interests \u2013 acknowledging that coronavirus is a global pandemic.</li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Germany closed places of worship, bars, restaurants, museums and cinemas. </strong>Announcing the plan, Chancellor Angela Merkel said: \u201cThe more individuals stick to these rules, the quicker we will get through this phase.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>The actor Idris Elba has become the latest celebrity to contract the virus</strong>.

  "<p>The number of young people being treated for mental illness in non-specialist hospital wards has risen for a second year in a row in Scotland, official records show.</p> <p>In 2018-19, patients under the age of 18 admitted to non-specialist hospital wards, nearly all of which were adult wards, rose to 118. These admissions involved 101 young people and was an increase on the previous year\u2019s figures of 103 admissions involving 90 young people.</p> <p>The report, published on Wednesday by the Mental Welfare Commission, said the Scottish government needs to do more to prevent young people suffering from mental health difficulties being treated in adult wards, as these wards differ in staff training and the environment is not designed to care for young people.</p> <p>The admissions of young people with mental illness to unspecialised largely adult wards peaked between 2013-14 and 2014-15 when admissions above 200 were recorded each year. The lowest numbers were recorded in 2016-17, when there were 71 admissions involving 66 young people, but figures have steadily increased since.</p> <p>The Mental Welfare Commission is once again calling on the Scottish government to prioritise providing intensive psychiatric care unit (IPCU) facilities for young people. Currently, there are no such facilities in Scotland.</p> <p>The findings show that children in care made up 21% of all the young people admitted to non-specialist wards. This is a higher percentage than in 2014-15, when looked after children made up 13%.</p> <p>The report notes that young people are being admitted to adult wards because of a shortage of specialist beds, a lack of provision for highly specialised care for young people with learning disability; young people who have offended due to mental health difficulties; and young people who require intensive psychiatric care provided on specialised units.</p> <p>While the majority of admissions of young people to non-specialist wards wereof short duration, 38% remained on those wards for over a week.</p> <p>The commission also recommended that health boards review the adequacy of provision and clearer protocols in the interim for young people who require forensic or learning disability inpatient facilities as these are not yet available in Scotland.</p> <p>The commission welcomed figures showing that in 91% of admissions in non-specialist wards, the young person had specialist senior medical input.</p> <p>Dr Arun Chopra, executive director at the Mental Welfare Commission, said: \u201cWhilst it was reassuring to see that the vast majority of young people had specialist senior medical input on admission, adult wards differ in staff training and ward environment to those designed to care for young people.</p> <p>\u201cAdult intensive psychiatric care units (IPCUs) in particular can often be unsuitable environments for adolescents. They are specialised units for adults who are very unwell and present with high risk to themselves or others.</p> <p>A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u201cAlthough there has been a slight increase in admissions compared with last year, the numbers of young people being admitted to non-specialist IPUs has reduced. The rate of admissions has remained relatively consistent over the last few years, and is significantly lower than the rate of admissions in 2014-15.</p> <p>\u201cWe will conduct an independently-led review of IPCU provision for under-18s and a Clinical Director of CAMHS has been appointed to lead this. The review will last approximately five months, and we expect it to conclude in Autumn of this year.\u201d</p> <p>The Scottish government will publish a protocol for admissions of young people to adult wards in the coming months.</p> <p><br></p>"
