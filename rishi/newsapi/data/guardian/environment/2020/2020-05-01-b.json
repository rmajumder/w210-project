That has led to international criticism and wounded national pride, writes Gina Gustavsson, an academic at Uppsala University. She asks: has Sweden\u2019s coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists?</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">mortality rate</a> is among the 10 highest in the world, at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/\">240 per million</a> population and steadily rising, and many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">nursing homes</a> in Stockholm are now affected.</p> \n   <p>The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country\u2019s chief epidemiologist, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-swedish-epidemiologist-anders-tegnell-the-target-of-praise-criticism/\">Anders Tegnell</a>, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion.</p> \n   <p>But beneath the surface, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden\">Sweden</a> is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of \u201cthe bent twig\u201d, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/may/01/sweden-coronavirus-strategy-nationalists-britain\">Has Sweden's coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists? | Gina Gustavsson</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:32:30.633Z\">at 1.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eac0f1a8f0806a479811466\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:05:00.045Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thousands of Indian students unable to leave the <strong>UK</strong> because of the coronavirus lockdown are relying on food donations from charities because they can no longer afford to eat, <strong>Anna Fazackerly</strong> reports for the Guardian.</p> \n  <p>Student groups representing the students, from across Britain, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities.

The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says most restrictions will remain until 18 May to \u201cweaken the virus further so it doesn\u2019t make a comeback\u201d.</p> <h2>UK death toll rises to at least 27,510</h2> <p>The UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/01/coronavirus-live-news-uk-is-past-the-peak-as-trump-claims-evidence-virus-started-in-wuhan-lab?page=with:block-5eac4b008f082b32fdd6ba44#block-5eac4b008f082b32fdd6ba44\">reports 739 more deaths</a>, bringing the total death toll in the country to 27,510. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says 177,454 people have tested positive: an increase of 6,201 since Thursday\u2019s update. Of those, 15,111 patients are in hospital, Hancock says.</p> <h2>India extends lockdown</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/01/coronavirus-live-news-uk-is-past-the-peak-as-trump-claims-evidence-virus-started-in-wuhan-lab?page=with:block-5eac46358f0806a479811800#block-5eac46358f0806a479811800\">The country extends its lockdown</a> \u2013 the world\u2019s broadest by population \u2013 for two more weeks, but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases. The home ministry says that in view of \u201csignificant gains in the Covid-19 situation\u201d, there will be \u201cconsiderable relaxations\u201d in areas with few or no cases.</p> <h2>South Africa begins to ease lockdown</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/01/coronavirus-live-news-uk-is-past-the-peak-as-trump-claims-evidence-virus-started-in-wuhan-lab?page=with:block-5eac49eb8f0806a47981182c#block-5eac49eb8f0806a47981182c\">Some industries are allowed to reopen after five weeks of restrictions</a> in Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation, which was already struggling with low growth and high debts when the lockdown began on 27 March.</p> <p>Its easing comes after the ratings agency S&amp;P downgraded the country\u2019s credit rating to junk on Wednesday.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s fourth White House press secretary delivered a 30-minute briefing on Friday, ending a more than year-long hiatus for the once-daily occasions.</p> <p>It was effectively a public debut for Kayleigh McEnany, whose immediate predecessor, Stephanie Grisham, never delivered a briefing in nine months in the role.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">Joe Biden denies sexual assault allegation from former staffer Tara Reade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, Trump has turned daily coronavirus task force briefings into multi-hour back-and-forths with the press. Taking the lectern for the first time, McEnany stressed that she would be speaking on behalf of the president and the highest-ranking officials in his administration.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m around the president almost the entire day,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just with him before I left to come out and speak with you guys.</p> <p>\u201cI think my staff can attest to the fact that they have a very hard time finding me because I\u2019m normally with the president in the Oval Office. So I\u2019m consistently with him, absorbing his thinking, and it\u2019s my mission to bring you the mindset of the president, deliver those facts so this president gets fair and accurate reporting and the American people get fair and accurate information.\u201d</p> <p>McEnany was less outwardly combative than Trump. She did not accuse White House reporters of being or peddling \u201cfake news\u201d. Nor did she say any outlet had terrible ratings.</p> <p>Still, she repeated Trump\u2019s main arguments. Regarding<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/us-gives-g7-countries-a-list-of-reforms-it-wants-who-to-undertake\"> the World Health Organization and its role in battling the coronavirus outbreak</a>, for example, she said: \u201cThe WHO appears to clearly have a China bias.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, you look at this timeline and it\u2019s really damning for the WHO when you consider the fact that on 31 December you had Taiwanese officials warning about human-to-human transmission, the WHO did not make that public.</p> <p>\u201cOn 9 January, the WHO repeated China\u2019s claim that the virus does not transmit readily between people, that was quite apparently false. On 14 January, the WHO again repeated China\u2019s talking points about no human-to-human transmission.\u201d</p> <p>Under fire for his own administration\u2019s response to Covid-19, which as of Friday afternoon had infected more than 1 million Americans and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">killed more than 63,000</a>, Trump has accused the WHO of slow-walking moves that could have prevented global spread. Earlier in April, he announced that his administration would halt funding to the organization, pending a review.</p> <p>McEnany\u2019s first briefing also landed on the day that Trump\u2019s all-but-certain general election opponent, the former vice-president Joe Biden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">publicly responded to an allegation of sexual assault</a> by a former Senate staffer.</p> <p>McEnany was asked about comments made by the president in an interview with a conservative radio host, that the allegation against Biden by Tara Reade was more credible than those made against the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford or against Trump by numerous women.</p> <p>McEnany framed the accusations as old news that had been cleared up by Trump\u2019s victory in the 2016 election.</p> <p>\u201cHe has always told the truth on these issues,\u201d she claimed. \u201cHe\u2019s denied them immediately and you\u2019re bringing up issues \u2026 from four years ago that were asked and answered and the American people had their say in the matter when they elected President Trump as president of the United States.</p> <p>\u201cLeave it to the media to really take an issue about the former vice-president [Biden] and turn it on the president and bring up accusations from four years ago that were asked and answered in the form of the vote of the American people.\u201d</p> <p>McEnany also discussed Michael Flynn, the first of Trump\u2019s four national security advisers who resigned after a brief spell in the role and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/donald-trump-full-pardon-michael-flynn\">has indicated a potential pardon for Flynn</a>, who has not yet been sentenced.</p> <p>On the subject of recently unsealed investigative documents, McEnany was asked why she called the FBI investigation of Flynn a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d, given his guilty plea. Reporters, she answered, should more aggressively cover how the FBI handled the investigation.</p> <p>Again, the press secretary \u2013 who earlier promised \u201cnever\u201d to lie to reporters \u2013 sounded some of the same notes, in a the same tone, as Trump.</p> <p>\u201cDo you not consider it a miscarriage of justice when you have the FBI writing \u2018We want to get someone to lie?\u2019\u201d McEnany said. \u201cThe answer\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 and I encourage the media to cover it, because I\u2019ve watched a lot of your networks I\u2019ve read a lot of your papers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a whole lot of scant information about Michael Flynn, when there was a whole lot of speculation about Russia, Russia, Russia, culminating in $40m of taxpayer money being lost, and the complete and total exoneration of President Trump.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/trump-michigan-protesters-gretchen-whitmer\">Michigan: Trump says Whitmer should 'make a deal' with protesters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most observers do not consider the special counsel Robert Mueller to have exonerated Trump in his investigation of Russian election interference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/28/crime-in-progress-glenn-simpson-peter-fritsch-review\">and links between Trump and Moscow</a>. Indeed, though he did not establish a criminal conspiracy or recommend charges of obstruction of justice, Mueller said he was not clearing the president. Trump and his allies have regularly claimed exoneration regardless.</p> <p>It is unclear how often McEnany will appear in the White House briefing room. Trump press secretaries had their appearances scaled back after the president decided they were doing an inadequate job.</p> <p>\u201cAs to the timing of the briefings, we do plan to do them,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cI will announce the timing of that forthcoming but we do plan to continue these.\u201d</p> <p>Her first appearance had lasted about half an hour, well short of Trump\u2019s marathon sessions.</p>",
  "<p>The owners of Virgin Media and O2 are in talks to create a new TV and mobile power player to challenge BT and Sky in the UK.</p> <p>Billionaire John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media and a 10% stake in ITV, is understood to be in talks with Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica to combine their UK assets in a joint venture.</p> <p>The talks will raise speculation about whether Liberty may be open to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/31/liberty-global-itv-stake-takeover-virgin-media\">including ITV in</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/31/liberty-global-itv-stake-takeover-virgin-media\"> the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/31/liberty-global-itv-stake-takeover-virgin-media\">deal,</a> as the share price of the broadcaster of shows including Coronation Street and Love Island has hit a 10-year low amid the fall in ad revenues due to the coronavirus.</p> <p>In 2006, Virgin Media\u2019s then owner Sir Richard Branson saw the benefits of a takeover of ITV, but Sky took a stake in the free-to-air broadcaster to thwart the move. Malone\u2019s Liberty Global is ITV\u2019s largest shareholder, making him the kingmaker in any potential deal for the broadcaster.</p> <p>A deal between Virgin Media and O2 would bring together the mobile operator\u2019s 34m customers, the largest network in the UK, with the cable operator\u2019s 5.3m broadband, pay-TV and mobile users.</p> <p>O2 has been a target for a potential takeover since 2015 when a \u00a310.25bn bid by rival Three UK, which is owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/11/three-takeover-of-o2-blocked-by-european-commission-on-competition-concerns\">blocked by the European Commission on competition grounds.</a></p> <p>Telefonica subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/o2s-possible-ipo-depends-weakening-state-uk-economy\">explored a potential \u00a310bn spin-off of the business</a> on the London stock market to reduce debt.

As a result the company has about \u00a35.6bn in cash to deploy for potential investments. Liberty Global and Vodafone have previously held talks about a tie-up in the UK, similar to the current talks between Virgin Media and O2, but they did not progress to a deal.</p> <p>However, the two companies struck a joint venture deal in the Netherlands in 2016, combining cable and mobile networks, and a revival of talks in the UK cannot be ruled out now a potential deal with O2 has been made public.</p> <p>Last year, Vodafone and Virgin Media signed a deal in the UK to use each other\u2019s networks, which was viewed as a renewing of closer ties that could kick on to potential talks of a wider deal.</p> <p>Liberty Global, Virgin Media, O2 and Telefonica declined to comment.</p> <p><br><br></p>",

This week, it was reported that almost 70 people had died at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/coronavirus-massachusetts-veterans-outbreak-holyoke-soldiers-home\" title=\"\">single veterans\u2019 nursing home</a> in Massachusetts. New York is struggling to bury its dead.</p> <p>This is what the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, describes as \u201ca great success story\u201d. This is the context in which the administration is letting its physical distancing guidelines lapse, instead advising much less stringent measures.</p> <p>Mr Kushner suggests that by July the country could be \u201creally rocking again\u201d. But Americans will suffer from Mr Trump\u2019s keenness to get back to business, as if the pre-coronavirus state of affairs were still possible. Medical experts have already warned about the risks of another surge in cases. The question is whether states, cities, institutions and individuals can again mitigate the harm he is wreaking upon his country. Some may; others are leading his charge: in Georgia, such essential services as tattoo parlours and bowling alleys are once again plying their trade. Texas is allowing shops, cinemas, shopping malls and restaurants to reopen, albeit with restrictions on capacity. Without significant testing and tracing, it is evident where such decisions will lead.</p> <p>The best that can be said for Mr Trump\u2019s election-driven wishful thinking is that it is less immediately dangerous than his recent public musings that people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\" title=\"\">might have injections of disinfectant</a> as a cure. Each week of the pandemic has brought new shame upon the president: he failed to equip his country and its health workers, to advocate physical distancing when it was desperately needed, or even to look like he was seriously concerned about the outbreak and its victims, preferring instead to boast about the ratings for his briefings.</p> <p>While leaders around the world enjoyed a surge in support as the pandemic took hold \u2013 the rally-around-the-flag effect \u2013 Mr Trump\u2019s appalling performance has finally taken a toll on his popularity. He had counted on a strong economy to see him back into office in November. But with more than 30 million US workers filing unemployment claims in the last six weeks \u2013 and economists suggesting that the real level of job losses could be far worse \u2013 his confidence has been shaken.</p> <p>This week it was reported that he had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/politics/trump-campaign-reelection-polls.html\" title=\"\">lashed out at his own campaign</a> after polls showed him trailing Joe Biden in crucial states and with older voters. With the Democrat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/joe-biden-sexual-assault-claim-democrats\" title=\"\">facing a sexual assault claim</a> and running a virtual campaign while Mr Trump commands daily airtime, it is clear that the president is doing the damage himself. He is seeking to shift the blame for the pandemic to the World Health Organization (having ignored its repeated warnings) and to China. On Thursday he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim\" title=\"\">contradicted his own</a> director of national intelligence by claiming that he had seen evidence that the virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory; Trump officials have reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/politics/trump-administration-intelligence-coronavirus-china.html\" title=\"\">leaned on the agencies</a> to find evidence to back the theory.</p> <p>This conduct too is unpleasantly familiar. His contempt for the truth; his determination to evade responsibility while holding the most powerful job in the world; his ignorance, his narcissism and the threat he poses to his country \u2013 all have become still more painfully evident through this crisis, but were clear before. Yet he has so far defied the laws of political gravity. Americans have paid dearly for Mr Trump\u2019s complacency, recklessness, irrationality and incompetence. But are they at last ready to make him pay?</p>",
  "<p>At the beginning of the week, I chatted to Lea, my darling mother-in-law in Wellington, New Zealand. A first-time online grocery buyer, she had ordered three carrots \u2013 but then 3kg of them arrived at her door. We were throwing up ideas about what to do with them.</p> <p>Our solutions: quick vinegar brine pickle, carrot kraut, roasted carrots confit, carrot juice \u2013 it\u2019s safe to say she\u2019ll be good for beta-carotene for a while.</p> <p>Lea is not alone. Once you have stepped off the baking train \u2013 because really how many more cakes, loaves of sourdough and crumpets can you eat before your blood sugar levels decide to stay permanently spiked \u2013 you might find yourself ordering mystery produce boxes for the fun of it.</p> <p>Full disclosure: I am also a purveyor of one such mystery box. Our Boon Luck Farm in Byron has been growing organic heirloom produce for some of Australia\u2019s well known restaurants. Those restaurants have temporarily closed, so they\u2019re no longer ordering what we specifically grow for them.</p> <p>I\u2019m in the same boat as every primary producer whose main business is restaurants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/27/ive-never-seen-it-like-this-why-vegetables-are-so-expensive-in-australia-at-the-moment\">'I\u2019ve never seen it like this': why vegetables are so expensive in Australia at the moment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now the world over, home cooks have direct access to previously hard to procure lobsters, prime cuts of reserved Wagyu, or tiger striped jungle peanuts. Things that are usually snapped up by chefs for their tasting menus.</p> <p>Never before has it been more fun to cook at home. The creative uses for some of the produce that I am seeing is refreshing, but some produce can be harder to use or use up, and leaves people completely stumped. </p> <p>Lots of online stores will allow you select the contents \u2013 but I urge you to support your local small-scale farmers and buy a grab-bag direct from them, as you will get the freshest seasonal produce with the proceeds going straight to the source. Besides, it\u2019s more fun that way. </p> <h2>When your box arrives \u2026</h2> <p> First, lay everything on your kitchen table or bench. Group the produce like for like: brassicas, lettuces, fruits, herbs, roots etc. Then do as chefs do: wrap them up appropriately for storage, don\u2019t wash anything unless you are ready to use it (as it will likely bruise or accelerate the decomposition of the vegetable), and do not pre-cut anything you won\u2019t use that day, as the more surface area something has, the faster it dries out. </p> <p>Wrap your herbs in a moist paper towel, and put anything with leaves into your crisper. Apples, grapes, squashes, cucumbers, leeks, fennel and anything you want crisp goes into the fridge. Pears and avocados depend on the stage of ripeness \u2013 if they\u2019re soft, put them into the fridge, otherwise leave them on the bench to ripen more.</p> <p>Citrus, bananas, pumpkins, onions, garlic and potatoes are best left out. If you want to speed up the ripening of bananas and avocados, pop them together in a paper bag \u2013 the natural ethanol released will work very well.</p> <p>Pull out pencil and paper and get planning your week\u2019s menu and larder staples. You may just find this becomes a highlight of your week, and perhaps the habit will even stick around when the restaurants start opening up again.</p> <h2>What to do when you have a whole lot of one thing?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"255fdc2a39cc69bd5af57450359d89410352349f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/255fdc2a39cc69bd5af57450359d89410352349f/0_1353_7676_4605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A whole pumpkin, sliced up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With pumpkins and sweet potatoes, once the season starts it seems to never end.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Matthews/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Fermenting: </strong>If you received a whole cabbage, unless you are a large family you won\u2019t finish it off in a week \u2013 so portion out what you can eat.

Let it sit for an hour and then drain excess liquid, put it in a sterilised glass jar and let it ferment on the kitchen bench until sour. Then refrigerate it \u2013 et voil\u00e0 sauerkraut. Date it so you know when it was made.</p> <p>The things that can be lacto fermented include but are not limited to: all manner of brassicas (bok choy, cabbage, rapini), carrots, parsnips, swedes, fennel bulbs, beetroot, celery, and even fruit like melon rinds and apples. Get inspired to include aromats like dried or fresh herbs, garlic, chillies, ginger, galangal, makrut lime leaves and even citrus peel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/23/easy-autumn-recipe-brussels-sprout-chestnut-and-bacon-soup\">Easy autumn recipe: brussels sprout, chestnut and bacon soup</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Freezing: </strong>With pumpkins and sweet potatoes, once the season starts it seems to never end. There\u2019s a reason that grocers sell things by halves, like celery, watermelons and pumpkins. If you are going to cook with a pumpkin or sweet potato, don\u2019t just cut the wedge you plan on eating tonight. Cook and process the whole lot. By processing I mean steaming or roasting. Then portion it out into 250g servings and freeze it. Having these on hand means you can defrost to instantly make a soup, curry, warm salad, frittata or even make custard to fill a pie.</p> <p>Don\u2019t be afraid to freeze things; most defrost well enough, and need only a little warming in the oven before you can use them. Once it\u2019s been reheated, use it straight away as refreezing isn\u2019t a good idea.</p> <p>Things that can steamed or roasted, then frozen, include peppers, beetroot, carrots, potatoes, swedes, parsnips, onions (best roasted) and most root vegetables. I almost always roast veg with olive oil, grey salt and whole bulbs of garlic de-cloved. The rule is always low and slow. When you come to portion everything out, separate the excess oil and garlic cloves and put them into a jar. This will create a flavoured oil to use in salad dressing, or even for finishing off meats, soups and casseroles. Mashing the roasted garlic on toast is a particular delight.</p> <h2>I have mysterious leafy greens \u2026</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b71917f2a60e467d0cf3af87af1e72f92238e049\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b71917f2a60e467d0cf3af87af1e72f92238e049/0_103_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Different types of green vegetables in a stainless colanderDark green leafy vegetables in colander\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some greens need long slow cooking, some just a quick blanch and some are best eaten raw in a salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elenathewise/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some greens need long slow cooking times, some need just a quick blanch or stir fry and some are just best left alone to eat raw in a salad.</p> <p><strong>Slow braising</strong></p> <p>Woodier greens like cavolo nero, silver beet, radish tops, the tops of any root veg, chicory, cardoons and artichokes (I know they\u2019re not leafy greens but still need to be mentioned) benefit from longer braising. This requires homemade stock or water and olive oil in a 3:1 ratio, plus salt and garlic. At the end of the long simmer, finish off with something acidic like vinegar or citrus. The time depends on the toughness of the leaves, but I find that anything needing a braise longer than 20-30 minutes isn\u2019t worth eating.</p> <p>This is a deliciously universal way of cooking vegetables that are a little woodier and benefit from being eaten on the softer side \u2013 do not be concerned if the greens turn olive or even brown. Brown food is delicious.</p> <p>Keep adjusting the liquid as you go, not allowing the greens to be swamped, and likewise not drying them out. I really like to finish off a longer braise like this with a contrast of something fresh in at the end, like freshly shelled or frozen peas and a generous fistful of chopped fresh herbs \u2013 like flat-leafed parsley.</p> <p>I love eating these greens as a side to some protein, or even a main meal with a fried egg. It also keeps very well refrigerated to snack on later, or to put on toast that you\u2019ve rubbed with the garlic confit I mentioned earlier.</p> <p><strong>Quick cooking</strong></p> <p>These techniques are for softer greens that are just too horrid to eat raw \u2013 water spinach, in fact all spinach, Asian brassicas like Chinese broccoli, choy sum, and even lettuces. By cooking them you will actually unlock more of their nutrients, especially if you add a citric element to it at the end. Either a quick stir fry with some rendered pork fat or a healthy oil like olive or macadamia and chopped garlic and a simple seasoning, or blanching and steaming, work well.</p> <p>For stir frying, let your wok or pan heat up first, add your fat and wait a minute, or use this time to chop up your garlic. If steaming or blanching, leave the water on high until it is full-on boiling then add the vegetables to cook \u2013 very minimally.</p> <p>Even once you\u2019ve turned off the heat, the vegetables will still be cooking, so bear that in mind. I tend to turn the heat off just before I think the vegetables are at point I like to eat them, because the transition time from cooking to plating will make those veggies exactly right.</p> <p><strong>Greens to keep raw</strong></p> <p>Lettuces, salad mixes, radicchio, endive, softer hearts of certain chicories, celery hearts and leaves, sorrel, edible weeds like pennywort, purslane and cranberry hibiscus are all best left cold. Don\u2019t forget that even in the raw state, when you add oils, acid and salt, you are essentially cooking it minimally. I could eat salads till the cows come home, and there are a million ways to make it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/29/easy-cheesy-a-comforting-bake-that-works-with-whatever-you-have\">Easy cheesy: a comforting bake that works with whatever you have</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All you need for inspiration is to taste what is in season and remember the tenets of flavour profiles \u2013 salty, sour, sweet, bitter and fat \u2013 when you are composing a salad. Add a little of each, tasting as you go. Don\u2019t forget that you can always add larder staples like nuts, fresh or dried fruits, cooked grains or cheeses. Layer your sour notes by using different vinegars, citrus juice and zest.</p> <p>Don\u2019t forget there are many ways to salt your food that don\u2019t even include salt, like fish sauce, anchovies, shrimp paste, Vegemite, seaweed and other sea vegetables, miso, soy sauce or even nutritional yeast. Pull out your frozen roasted vegetables and add those too. </p> <h2>And the rest of it \u2026</h2> <p>Use up odds and ends such as off-cuts and peels of carrots, daikon, parsnip, onions, garlic peel, celery and mushrooms in bone stocks (my tip is to roast the bones first for a deeper flavour). These can be portioned out and kept frozen (250mls is my preferred size). If I don\u2019t have quite enough to make a large pot, I save everything up in the freezer first until I do. Making stock can feel like a commitment \u2013 it is \u2013 but once you\u2019ve finished washing that big pot and your freezer is well stocked up with the future potential of soups, curries, ragu and the like, you will feel an immense satiety.</p> <p>Water kefir is another great way to use up bits and bobs from fruit. Feeding the grains and drinking the byproduct is a source of continual entertainment and probiotics. Water kefir grains can be bought online; I like <a href=\"https://www.thefermentary.com.au/\">the Fermentary</a>. Figuring out what to feed my water kefir grains, and the trial and error of flavour combinations, is a source of real joy for me at the moment \u2013 lemongrass is a winner, for instance.</p> <p>Cooking from a mystery box is an adventure \u2013 the best thing to do is to take a deep breath and dive right in.</p>",

What is it?': a beginners' guide to backyard birding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The sepulchre of night is peeled back as the world turns towards the light of the new day. Listening to the contributions of each member of the voluble choir spurs feelings of wonder and gratefulness to be alive on our sublime planet. The dawn chorus reconnects me to life; a sense of hope returns. It is my favourite moment of each of these strange, new days.</p> <p>Birds link sky and earth, they migrate across hemispheres, traverse the vast oceans. From Indigenous creation stories to Aristophanes to the Norwegian myths of Odin and his two ravens that report daily to him about their flights around the globe, birds were considered as messengers, connecting us to other realms. Roman auguries took this literally, interpreting bird behaviour as signs from the gods.</p> <p>In our noisy, industrial society, birdsong has largely been drowned out, all too easy to ignore. However, in the quietude of lockdown and isolation many of us have once again become attuned to their sound breaking the silence. BirdLife Australia has been inundated with people wanting to share or have identified the birds who have been visiting their garden. </p> <p>One Melbourne birdwatcher started an online movement, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/205589647381934/\">#birdthefeckathome</a> which encourages people to record birds they have seen in their backyards. Since launching at the end of March, the site has logged over 2,600 species \u2013 around a quarter of the world\u2019s birds. In the radio talkback segments I\u2019ve been doing, callers are freaking out that the birds \u201cwere going crazy\u201d but almost all the behaviours described were fairly standard for Australian birds who are a gregarious and outlandish lot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b4841594c3779bc4a1e8ec9cdd95bfc5430df850\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4841594c3779bc4a1e8ec9cdd95bfc5430df850/582_0_1993_1933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rainbow lorikeets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"970\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rainbow lorikeets captured in a small nature reserve in Sydney</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rita VP/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The difference is, confined to our homes all day, surrounded by a quiet most of us have never experienced, we are noticing for the first time the daily soap operas of the feathered characters we share our surrounds with. Even in the high-rise midst of our city centres people are noticing cockatoos, currawongs and pigeons living pretty much as they did before the virus.</p> <p>Birdsong still welcomes the dawn every morning and I find enormous comfort in that. This is why on Sunday I plan to rise early and acknowledge the joy those sounds bring as part of International Bird Chorus Day. It was started by British naturalist Chris Baines in 1984 who roped in some friends to celebrate a significant birthday by joining him to listen for the first bird calls of the day.</p> <p>At this time of year, the migrant songbirds have returned to the English countryside and fill the air with their sweet, lilting warblings. Though some, such as Adam Lindsay Gordon and his \u201csongless, bright birds\u201d or more recently \u2013 and more delightfully \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Tez9DnRlF/\">Sam Neill and his raven impersonations</a> might regard Australian birds as a raucous cacophony, the fact is that songbirds evolved in Australia and our birds, as vocally splendid as they are boldly marked, do not need the impetus of spring to belt out a squawk or two.</p> <p>On Sunday I will be listening for these comforting, yet bittersweet sounds \u2013 palpable reminders of the natural world I am cut off from, while at the same time providing me an essential connection to the world I once knew, the world to which I want to return.</p> <p><em>Sean Dooley is national Public affairs manager at BirdLife Australia</em></p>",

Now, considering whether to play professional football in the middle of a pandemic is literally a matter of life and death.</p> <p>One of football\u2019s perennial failings is to inflate its obsession into a bubble in which the great game\u2019s dramas, outcomes, personalities and controversies seal it off into an alternative world which can feel somehow as significant as everything else. Hearing Boris Johnson mention \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/boris-johnsons-post-coronavirus-speech-what-he-said-what-it-means\" title=\"\">our current success</a>\u201d in dealing with coronavirus, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, deny that allowing the virus to run through the population and achieve \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/the-guardian-view-on-herd-immunity-yes-it-was-part-of-the-plan\" title=\"\">herd immunity</a>\u201d was ever \u201cpart of their plan\u201d and the refusal by the government to admit to a single failure, they often appear to be creating a bubble of their own.</p> <p>For people not in the front line of the NHS or caring professions, and not stricken personally by the virus, lockdown can make the horror of this situation feel unreal. But 27,000 people in the UK have died, each one a tragedy and grievous blow to a family.</p> <p>Into the second week in March, Dowden and his government were still encouraging people to go to matches and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cheltenhamfestival\" title=\"\">Cheltenham</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cheltenhamfestival\" title=\"\">Festival</a>, based on scientists\u2019 advice that \u201cmass gatherings\u201d pose a low risk of virus transmission. Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College explained that with reference to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/22/liverpool-atletico-madrid-coronavirus-champions-league\" title=\"\">Liverpool v Atl\u00e9tico Madrid</a> match played on 11 March. \u201cSome people will have got infected,\u201d he said of the transmission potential of mass gatherings, \u201cand if it hadn\u2019t happened they wouldn\u2019t have been.\u201d But he went on to explain that \u201cat a population level, stopping them has a marginal impact\u201d.</p> <p>But in normal circumstances we do not think of a risk to some lives as \u201cmarginal\u201d because they are not many as a proportion of the whole population; normally everything is aimed at saving and preserving life. Most of the talk in football now is about how players and staff could be tested, somehow housed in a sterile environment, how they might ingeniously be tiptoed into empty stadiums while the rest of the population are still largely housebound. The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/30/liverpool-upset-by-mayor-call-to-stop-season-so-fans-do-not-gather-at-anfield-joe-anderson\" title=\"\">criticised by the club</a> itself for raising public health concerns about games restarting, but however in-depth the planning may be to avoid people massing outside the stadium or gathering instinctively to celebrate, he was sounding a genuine alarm about risks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/01/championship-plan-hold-play-offs-even-if-season-not-completed-promote-leeds-west-brom\">Championship makes plan to hold play-offs even if season not completed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be balanced against those lethal hazards are the benefits of trying so hard to stage matches again. As seven weeks have gone by since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/premier-league-and-football-league-suspended-until-4-april-coronavirus\" title=\"\">football suspended itself</a> on 13 March, against the advice of Dowden and his government that it was fine to carry on into that weekend, the significance of promotion, relegation and Champions League qualification has been put into perspective by the pandemic\u2019s elemental threat. Now the urge to play is articulated more as a grim job of having to get the season done to avoid difficult conversations with broadcasters, and be able to keep their money.</p> <p>After Dowden spoke up in parliament, more than one senior football executive told the Guardian this week they felt uneasy, as if the government needs some good news, some entertainment for the masses, and that lies behind their desire to get the Premier League playing \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Dowden said in parliament that this would \u201chelp release resources through the rest of the system\u201d, but the EFL is understood to be baffled by that, as no more money will go down the football pyramid now if the Premier League starts playing again.</p> <p>In France, where the number of people killed by Covid-19 is lower than in Britain, the government has banned team sports until September and, however much the odd club <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/01/amiens-vow-to-fight-ligue-1-relegation-after-injustice-of-season-resolution\">such as Lyon may grumble</a>, Ligue 1 is cancelled, and the summer is cleared of yet another complication, to try to address the virus. If that were to happen here, however much football people are missing the game and would love current realities to be different, many people could usefully calm down.</p> <p>The financial situation, of course difficult, will probably be just about manageable. If that did happen, the Premier League could concentrate on being true to the principle it has stressed throughout and did again on Friday: \u201cThe thoughts of all are with those directly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d and: \u201cThe Premier League\u2019s priority is the health and safety of players, coaches, managers, club staff, supporters and the wider community.\u201d</p>",

The Manchester City striker Sergio Ag\u00fcero said on Thursday that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/30/manchester-city-babies-sergio-aguero-believes-players-are-fearful-coronavirus\">\u201cscared\u201d to finish the campaign</a> for this reason and there are other players who share that fear.</p> <p>The Professional Footballers\u2019 Association has made it plain that the safety of the players is its overriding concern; it will not contemplate putting them in harm\u2019s way and the Guardian understands some players want the union to make a stand on their behalf. On the other hand, there are many more players who do want to continue. As on so many points, consensus is difficult to achieve.</p> <p>The Premier League issued a lengthy statement after the conference call and one line stood out. \u201cIt was agreed that the PFA, LMA, players and managers are key to this process and will be further consulted,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The PFA knows that what the government and Premier League want is fundamental and the government has said football should return as soon as it is safe to do so; this is partly for the lift that it would give to the population. The government on Friday began a set of meetings with sporting bodies to map a route towards resumptions.</p> <p>There are players and club staff members who think the resumption of the season is wishful thinking; they cannot see how the rates of infection will drop to a manageable level quickly enough but, for now, it is a waiting game until the government indicates next Thursday whether they can ease the current lockdown. The Premier League will meet again next Friday.</p> <p>Eight to 10 stadiums are being identified for use as neutral venues. Almost all are expected to be Premier League grounds and clubs would not play in their own stadium. The move follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/29/footballs-biggest-matches-should-be-played-at-neutral-grounds-police-say\" title=\"\">advice from police</a> but not all clubs support it.</p> <p>Stadiums chosen will be those granted licences by the sports grounds safety authority.

The league aims to ensure that clubs would not have to travel long distances and travel be as equally spread as possible.</p> <p>The conference call went into detail on proposed plans for a safe return to training and playing, including protocols around testing and creating a sterile environment for players and staff. Protocols are still being worked on for a return to full training and matches and there is an understanding the players\u2019 views must be considered. On Thursday Brighton\u2019s Glenn Murray described the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/30/glenn-murray-condemns-premier-league-face-mask-guidelines-as-farcical\">idea of wearing face masks in training as \u201cfarcical\u201d</a> but it is understood the detail presented was well received.</p> <p>All 20 clubs suggested they were committed to continue with the season, with the sense among some that if a restart is not possible now then it may not be later either. Those clubs that have reservations against resumption chose not to speak out. None of the issues that have so far split clubs \u2013 from the extension of contracts to concerns over player welfare \u2013 were raised.</p> <p>With no vote taken on which way to proceed, pending advice from government, the key meeting passes to next week. If the League is to stick to its preferred outcome of a return to training on 18 May and matches from 8 June, however, the window for finding a way forward is narrowing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The League said: \u201cThe clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019-20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the government\u2019s support.\u201d</p> <p>Bobby Barnes, the PFA\u2019s deputy chief executive, said earlier in the week: \u201cWe have reiterated that players are not just footballers but partners, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, who share the same health concerns as everyone else during this pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been assured of the intentions of all that there would be no resumption unless guarantees of safety could be given to the players.

However, the recent reports of growing alcohol sales and our own research showing that one million of us in Scotland are drinking more under lockdown, highlight the ongoing issue we still have with alcohol in this country. It remains to be seen what impact social distancing will have and what new challenges it will throw up. But it is unlikely that Scotland\u2019s unhealthy relationship with alcohol will be changed for the better.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Discussions are currently taking place in the Scottish government about a

appointments are running at about 70% of normal levels and the reason for that, and we think we can set them back very quickly because, of course, is they use different facilities and workforce broadly from surgery and the other resources required to respond to Covid-19.\u201d <br><br>She added: \u201cWe had just under 15,000 people booked for an appointment but that is a 62% reduction and

Cally replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case because the service has roughly an 8% conversion rate for urgent referrals. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important to state that

  "<p>The government must prioritise health funding for the most deprived regions in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, politicians and public health experts have demanded, after new data analysis revealed the devastating scale of the death toll in the poorest parts of England and Wales.</p> \n<p>In findings one expert said highlighted the fact that Covid-19 \u201cis not a leveller\u201d as politicians have repeatedly claimed, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that those living in the poorest parts of England and Wales were dying at twice the rate of those in the richest areas.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/covid_deprivation_deaths-zip/giv-3902ZG14j4bis6Cu/\" data-alt=\"interactive\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/covid_deprivation_deaths-zip/giv-3902ZG14j4bis6Cu/\">interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>With 55.1 deaths per 100,000 people in the most deprived places compared with 25.3 in the least deprived, the King\u2019s Fund health thinktank demanded the government focus new resources to reverse health inequalities as the crisis eases.</p> \n<p>The findings came as another 739 people died across the UK, bringing the total to 27,510. They echo last week\u2019s report from the Guardian that members of ethnic minority groups were particularly badly affected by the virus, with those from BAME backgrounds overrepresented in the toll by 27%.</p> \n<p>Responding to the analysis at the government\u2019s briefing on Friday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, acknowledged the issue, saying: \u201cThis is something we are worried about and looking at.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added, however, that the findings should be seen in the context of disproportionate deaths among men, older people, minorities and other subgroups. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it in the context of all of the different ways that this disease seems to have a different impact,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Critics said impact of austerity in the poorest communities was behind the new data. Steve Rotheram, the Labour mayor for the Liverpool city region argued that deprivation must be a factor in how spending is allocated to deal with costs incurred during the crisis.. Liverpool has one of the highest Covid-19 death rates outside London, with 303 deaths, amounting to 81.8 deaths per 100,000 people, and is the local authority to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/30/liverpool-local-councils-westminster-cuts-indifference-north\">suffered the biggest cuts</a> to its budget since 2010.</p> \n<p>The city region\u2019s councils are already warning of a \u00a3137m funding gap between the money they have spent dealing with coronavirus and the funds pledged to them by government, said Rotherham. He called for a change in the methodology of the Treasury\u2019s \u201cgreen book\u201d, which guides government spending, in order to prioritise the most deprived areas \u2013 rather than the per capita approach it currently takes.</p> \n<p>\u201cDeprivation should be factored into Treasury-book methodology across the board but specifically in relation to this. Local authorities were promised \u2018whatever it takes\u2019. The first allocation of fund was given on a needs basis but the second wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/deprivationmap-zip/giv-39027Jhv56MD6kQG/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/deprivationmap-zip/giv-39027Jhv56MD6kQG/\">Graphic</a> \n <figcaption> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maggi Morris, a health consultant and former head of public health in Central Lancashire, said the economic policies of Conservative-led governments of the last decade had done nothing to actually help reduce health inequalities. \u201cIn fact, they have exacerbated them,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The government must reverse benefit changes, she said, particularly cuts to housing allowance and the bedroom tax, which had forced more people to live in cramped accommodation where disease spreads more easily.</p> \n<p>The ONS data exposed the lie that Coronavirus attacks all equally, she said. \u201cIt is not a leveller.

  "<p>Strengthening environmental regulations must be a key plank of the UK\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus crisis to help prevent the spread of future pandemics, say a cross-party group of MPs \u2013 and bailouts for industries must contain strict conditions on their future environmental performance.</p> <p>The expansion of intensive farming, mining and infrastructure around the world has contributed to diseases spreading from wildlife to people, scientists say. The 26 MPs want the government to learn this lesson and encourage better agriculture, help developing countries to halt deforestation, and provide funding for poor countries to improve their health systems.</p> <p>In a letter organised by Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, they ask the chancellor to provide funding, and to recognise in his economic recovery plans that human health is dependant on that of animals, plants and the environment, and to reform the financial system to protect nature.</p> <p>Lucas said: \u201cFor too long, governments have ignored the link between the emergence of disease and climate change or biodiversity loss, failing to recognise that human health depends on the health of animals, plants and our shared environment too.

In those circumstances, Gregory said, the economy would contract by 19.6% this year, a recession three times as severe as that which followed the global financial crisis in 2008.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In addition, the expected bounceback in the economy would be delayed with the level of output still more than 6% below where it would have been in the absence of the pandemic by the end of 2022.</p> \n<p>On his return to work this week, Boris Johnson said that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-back-at-work-amid-talk-of-easing-lockdown\">too soon to ease the lockdown</a> despite signs that physical distancing had led to a fall in the number of hospital deaths and the number of new cases of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent body that provides economic forecasts for the government, has pencilled in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">a fall of 35%</a> in gross domestic product in the second quarter on the assumption that a full lockdown remains in place until the end of June.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n   Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The OBR is assuming half the restrictions will be lifted between July and September, with the rest being removed in the final three months of the year. On that basis, output would return to its pre-crisis level by the end of the year, with an annual fall in GDP between 2019 and 2020 of more than 13%.</p> \n<p>Gregory said she was assuming output had fallen by 25% from its pre-crisis peak during March and April, and would stagnate during May before starting to edge up in June. In the unlikely event of an immediate end to the lockdown, recovery would begin at the start of May but the economy would still shrink by 8.2% during 2020.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Gregory said that all the scenarios outlined in her report were simplified versions of what the reality is likely to be: \u201cThe restrictions are unlikely to be relaxed all at once and there is already evidence that even while the economy is shut down some activity is trickling back.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cThe longer the restrictions are in place, the longer it may take the economy to recover to pre-recession levels because of scarring effects.

  "<p>At university in the early 90s, friends who were studying philosophy would enthuse about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/solaris\">Solaris</a> in the same smoke-filled breath as Hegel and Sartre \u2013 neither of whom I had read. But I felt at ease with nerdiness, in a room crowded with techno music and people lying about on the floor. Vicariously I became a purist, without ever watching the 1972 film by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/andrei-tarkovsky\">Andrei Tarkovsky</a> nor reading the original novel by Stanis\u0142aw Lem. And when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/28/artsfeatures8\">Steven Soderbergh</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/28/artsfeatures8\">\u2019s slicker, shorter, altogether shinier adaptation</a>, starring George Clooney and Natasha McElhone, was released, I knowingly let it pass me by \u2013 why have Hollywood cotton when you could have Soviet silk? So it has taken me more than 25 years and the lockdown of a global pandemic to make time for Tarkovsky\u2019s film, only to find that the more you attempt to understand Solaris, the more it defies explanation.</p> <p>Generations of scientists have risked their sanity trying to make sense of its sprawling ocean, a vast living organism that appears to be sentient; none has succeeded. The doomed hero of this story is Kris Kelvin (played by Donatas Banionis), a psychologist and expert in the field of Solaristics, who is dispatched to the station that orbits the planet to evaluate whether or not the troubled mission should continue. Its dwindling crew is under siege from mysterious figures \u2013 phantasmic incarnations of their own shameful memories and fantasies that seem to have risen up from the depths of the sea. Kelvin is greeted by devastation: his colleague Dr Gibarian has killed himself, while the other cosmonauts \u2013 Snaut and Sartorius \u2013 are hiding away in their cabins. The \u201cvisitor\u201d that will drive Kelvin to the edge of madness is a simulacrum of his lost love, Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk), who killed herself long ago. He awakes in a dream to find her sitting before him \u2013 and so the living nightmare begins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eba59584ebb368e481c6a8b90da769a1f8598363\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eba59584ebb368e481c6a8b90da769a1f8598363/0_0_5535_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A living nightmare \u2026 Solaris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"427\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A living nightmare \u2026 Solaris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Or, at least, this is where the film really gets going. Departing from the book, Tarkovsky opens on Earth. Entrancing images of the natural world \u2013 a leaf carried downstream, weeds undulating in the dark depths of a brook, thistles veiled in light mist \u2013 are set to the melancholic sound of an organ work by Bach (a musical embodiment of order, religious faith and reason) as Kelvin contemplates the garden at his family home. It is an exquisite conjuring of the universe he is preparing to leave behind, as well as a vision of lost childhood that reproduces the house the director grew up in. Tarkovsky is on home ground, then, yet uncannily so, as home, in that disturbing Wizard of Oz way, becomes somewhere yearned for, yet forever beyond reach.</p> <p>A similar meditation on nature occurs in Tarkovsky\u2019s later science fiction film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/06/andrei-tarkovsky-stalker-russia-gulags-chernobyl\">Stalker</a>, a journey through a post-apocalyptic wasteland called the \u201cZone\u201d in search of a mythical house of dreams. And perhaps it was the remnants of the industrial landscape from that film that made me imagine the characters of Solaris would be trapped between brutalist grey walls in a dystopian black-and-white vision of solitude. We do get stark white interiors when Kelvin arrives in space, but this vision of the future is not so distant from the film\u2019s present; he wears the same clothes he wore on Earth \u2013 a leather jacket and T-shirt (that bears an unfortunate passing resemblance to a string vest) \u2013 while his pyjamas really are monogrammed. Mirrors in each room reflect the cosmonaut\u2019s journey into his interior world. Objects are imbued with memories: Bruegel\u2019s The Hunters in the Snow hangs on the wood-panelled walls of the library, recalling the cold comforts of the earthly landscape he\u2019s left behind.</p> <p>But return to that moment when the narrator, Kelvin, meets Hari in the book: \u201cMy first thought was: \u2018I\u2019m glad this is one of those dreams where you know you\u2019re dreaming.\u2019 All the same, I\u2019d preferred her not to be there. I closed my eyes and began to wish this intensely, but when I opened them again she was still sitting there.\u201d What I love is the way in which the film captures this merging of dreams and the waking world. Emerging eerily out of silence, the ambient sounds of Eduard Artemyev\u2019s electronic score echo the warm glow of red sunlight that floods the room and catches soft hairs lining the contours of Hari\u2019s face.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2020/mar/30/ive-never-seen-2001-a-space-odyssey\">I've never seen\u00a0\u2026\u00a02001: A Space Odyssey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere, surreal happenings (a dwarf\u2019s darting out from Sartorious\u2019s cabin as he guards his door) or telling inconsistencies (the lack of fastener on Hari\u2019s dress) go unexplained, occurring naturally within the rhythm and pace of an elliptical chain of events. As the camera slowly pans in long takes, characters that disappear from one point of view seem to occupy an entirely different space when seen from another, creating the effect of a lucid dream in which the camera is at once observing and determining the narrative. Bondarchuk is disconcertingly blank-faced and willing as she relives the traumatic loops of obsessive love that destroyed her; Banionis convincingly carries the burden of guilt of a man whose first desperate attempt to get rid of the problem involves folding her into a rocket and launching her into space. Relating was clearly never his strong point.</p> <p>But what to make of it all? I\u2019m still none the wiser. Tarkovsky set out to expose the \u201cphoniness\u201d of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey with this interrogation of the human condition and the result is a strange kind of psychological horror. The vividly coloured and intricately textured forms of Lem\u2019s majestically rendered ocean \u2013 so profoundly unsettling in the novel \u2013 are almost an afterthought here. Soderbergh\u2019s sea at least gives off a nice CGI shimmer in a telling that ticks off Lem\u2019s underlying philosophical queries with impressive efficiency. (Questions of faith, the existence of God and the limitations of human understanding are raised and dealt with in the exchanges of a 30-second dinner party conversation.) But, in the absence of CGI, and a musical score that tells you how to feel, Tarkovsky\u2019s dreamworld draws you in; you don\u2019t need an ocean to sense a world at sea.</p>",

In terms of an individual refusing to take advantage of the vast wherewithal on offer, I can\u2019t think of a more horrifying example of anyone thinking they can do a better job themselves. Not even Celine Dion\u2019s fashion sense. Johnson\u2019s refusal to get himself a (prose) stylist means the nation now is going to have to board these verbal funiculars at 5pm daily, and hope they cling to the traction cable tightly enough to deposit us at the \u2026 but no. Sorry, I can\u2019t do this. Maybe next week.</p> <p>For now, let\u2019s play out with the prime minister\u2019s assertion that being on course for one of the worst death tolls in the world means we\u2019ve \u201cavoid[ed] the tragedy that engulfed other parts of the world\u201d. What can you say? Other than: thank you. Thank you for the opportunity.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian journalist</p>",

  "<p>Scientists working for the US military have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease, the Guardian has learned.</p> \n<p>In what could be a significant breakthrough, project coordinators hope the blood-based test will be able to detect the virus\u2019s presence as early as 24 hours after infection \u2013 before people show symptoms and several days before a carrier is considered capable of spreading it to other people. That is also around four days before current tests can detect the virus.</p> \n<p>The test has emerged from a project set up by the US military\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) aimed at rapid diagnosis of germ or chemical warfare poisoning. It was hurriedly repurposed when the pandemic broke out and the new test is expected to be put forward for emergency use approval (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within a week.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe concept fills a diagnostic gap worldwide,\u201d the head of Darpa\u2019s biological technologies office, Dr Brad Ringeisen, told the Guardian, since it should also fill in testing gaps at later stages of the infection. If given FDA approval, he said, it had the potential to be \u201cabsolutely a gamechanger\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While pre-infectious detection would improve the efficiency of test-and-trace programmes as governments worldwide relax lockdowns, Darpa cautioned that it must wait until after FDA approval is given and the test can be put into practise for evidence of exactly how early it can pick up the virus.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe goal of research is to develop and validate an early host blood response diagnostic test for Covid,\u201d Prof Stuart Sealfon, who leads the research team at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, said in an email.</p> \n<p>He said the testing approach, which looks at the body\u2019s response as it fights Covid-19, should produce earlier results than current nose-swab tests that hunt for the virus itself. \u201cBecause the immune response to infection develops immediately after infection, a Covid signature is expected to provide more sensitive Covid infection diagnosis earlier,\u201d he told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>The research behind the development of the tests will eventually be made public, with the collaborating teams from medical schools at Mount Sinai, Duke University and Princeton expected to publish online, allowing scientists around the world to trial similar methods.</p> \n<p>If EUA is granted, the test should start being rolled out in the US in the second half of May. Approval is not guaranteed, but Darpa scientists are enthusiastic about the potential impact as governments loosen lockdowns amid worries about controlling potential second-wave outbreaks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe are all extremely excited. We want to roll this test out as quickly as we can, but at the same time share with others who might want to implement in their own countries,\u201d said Dr Eric Van Gieson, who set up Darpa\u2019s epigenetic characterization and observation (Echo) programme last year to diagnose biological warfare victims, and has redirected it to focus on Covid-19. Epigenetics looks at a set of controls on genes that can respond to the environment.</p> \n<p>Hope that the test might pick up carriers before they become infectious is based on previous research into other viruses, though Sealfon said this remained \u201cunknown\u201d for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have evidence that diagnosis happens in the first 24 hours for influenza and an adenovirus,\u201d Van Gieson said. \u201cWe are still in the midst of proving that with Covid-19. That said, we should know very soon after EUA.\u201d He sees potential for the US to carry out up to a million tests a day, starting with 100,000 daily in May.</p> \n<p>The test would up the possibility of isolating pre-infectious cases and closing down transmission chains. It could also dramatically reduce quarantine periods for people exposed to Covid-19 spreaders, allowing them to go back to work within days. \u201cIt could have exceptional demand,\u201d said Chris Linthwaite, the chief executive of Fluidigm, a California life-sciences technology company that is part of the project, who believes frequent testing can help manage workforces as they return to offices, warehouses and factories.</p> \n<p>The UK government announced plans two weeks ago to restart a contact-tracing programme that was abandoned early in the outbreak. Britain\u2019s stated target was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/uk-will-miss-100000-coronavirus-tests-target-minister-admits\">100,000 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/uk-will-miss-100000-coronavirus-tests-target-minister-admits\"> tests a day</a> by the end of April. France announced on Tuesday that it would test 700,000 people a week, including those without symptoms.</p> \n<p>Other countries such as South Korea, Australia and New Zealand already have efficient tracing systems, but they would be boosted if carriers could be detected early.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Darpa experts also see potential to improve protocols for protecting health care workers and others in high-risk jobs, as well as those in relatively self-contained or isolated communities such as care homes and prisons or onboard ships.</p> \n<p>The test uses the same polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines used for checking nasal swabs from people suspected of having the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple tweak,\u201d said Van Gieson. \u201cThe infrastructure is already there.\u201d </p> \n<p>Limitations on use are similar to those already faced by countries such as Britain and depend on PCR capacity, stocks of chemical reagents and logistics. Results can take an hour, or longer if samples must be sent away to laboratories.</p> \n<p>Like the viral test, the new blood test hunts for a type of molecule called RNA. In this case it is messenger RNA (mRNA). \u201cTarget mRNA is part of the immune response to viral infection,\u201d Sealfon said. \u201cmRNA expression levels really do adjust due to the presence of Covid-19. Understanding the immune response is key to fighting Covid-19.\u201d</p> \n<p>Covid-19 is thought to incubate for about five days, at which stage people are assumed to become infectious. That is also when the virus can be detected by current nose swab tests. \u201cThey do the job, they just don\u2019t tell you someone is sick until maybe four days after this [new test],\u201d said Van Gieson.</p> \n<p>The research shows accuracy levels above 95%. \u201cThis is something that will need to be constantly monitored as it will inevitably change up or down,\u201d Van Gieson said.</p> \n<p>Blood samples are harder to collect than nose swabs, but may be more reliable. Swab testing can be difficult because it requires taking a sample from deep inside the nose.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt can throw up a lot of false negatives,\u201d said Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University, adding that recent studies showing low reliability were probably due to poor swab sampling. \u201cI\u2019ve been very concerned by pictures on the television of drive-in testing. Something you could measure reliably in blood could be a good thing.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Like all researchers contacted by the Guardian, however, he was unwilling to comment further until the Mount Sinai-led team published its research. Most were concerned about potential problems with accuracy and practicality. Blood collection is a potential limitation, since drive-in centres are not usually equipped to do this. One millilitre of blood \u2013 a fifth of a teaspoon \u2013 is needed.</p> \n<p>The research team is expected to publish the mRNA sequence, allowing others to create the so-called \u201cprimer\u201d required. A similar approach was taken when the genetic sequence of the virus itself was released by China in January, allowing tests to be developed rapidly in South Korea and elsewhere.</p>",
  "<h2>HUMANITY AND LAWYERS</h2> \n<p>Hurray! The football season is back! Six hundred years after the last match, everyone\u2019s favourite sport has returned in the style we have come to know and follow with ill relish. And it\u2019s all thanks to the French government, whose decision to ban team japes until September has kicked off the biggest hoohah <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/15/world-cup-stunning-moments-france-implode\">since 2010</a>, when <em>Les Bleus</em> decided it was simply impossible to envisage playing the World Cup so long as their manager spoke in a brusque tone.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/01/amiens-vow-to-fight-ligue-1-relegation-after-injustice-of-season-resolution\">Amiens vow to fight Ligue 1 relegation after 'injustice' of season resolution</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Following their government\u2019s decree, the French league declared the season over and then confirmed the standings after 28 matches (27 in some cases) as the final table. That sealed a fairytale title triumph for the Embassy of Qatar, and Big Cup qualifications for Marseille and Rennes. But it also condemned Lyon to missing out on European competition for the first time in 24 years, and the club\u2019s overlord, Jean-Michel Aulas, says that\u2019s a bowl of sick he won\u2019t swallow. \u201cThis is robbing us of an opportunity that is very significant, of high value,\u201d he howled before vowing to deploy a crack squad of lawyers in an eat-this-mofos formation. \u201cWe are going to claim damages worth several dozen million euros,\u201d stormed Aulas, scratching his nails down a chalkboard. \u201cNo\u00ebl Le Gra\u00ebt has to face the consequences as president of the FFF. His management here was poor. There were poorly thought-out decisions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Aulas had proposed alternative ways of determining the final standings, including play-offs whenever, and pointed out that Lyon have a habit of finishing seasons strongly. A similar claim was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/01/amiens-vow-to-fight-ligue-1-relegation-after-injustice-of-season-resolution\">made by the president of Amiens</a>, who have been consigned to relegation. \u201cSince our non-league days our success has always been built on our finishes to the season,\u201d declared Bernard Joannin, the head of a club who had hope of survival despite being on a 13-match winless run. \u201cI will go to the end to uphold our rights because I am a warrior. There were still 30 points up for grabs and we were just four below N\u00eemes!

  "<p>As of 30 April, Vietnam has a <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/viet-nam/\">coronavirus death count of zero</a> and only 270 cases. While the mortality numbers climb into the hundreds of thousands across the world, Vietnam has <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/vietnam-has-reported-no-coronavirus-deaths-how-136646\">managed to contain the outbreak</a> of coronavirus through timeliness, aggressive infection control, mass mobilisation of its population and an unprecedented level of openness.</p> <p>Out of the key factors that contributed to Vietnam\u2019s successful coronavirus response, timeliness was the first. Vietnam acted early and did not hesitate to alert its citizens. On <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2020/jan/28/coronavirus-first-death-in-beijing-as-us-issues-new-china-travel-warning-live-updates\">28 January</a>, when the country recorded only two cases, the government announced that it was planning for a scenario in which thousands of people could contract the virus.</p> <p>In the following weeks, Vietnam continuously <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Vietnam\">imposed restrictions</a> and issued policies ahead of and sometimes against the WHO\u2019s recommendations, such as a series of international travel bans and the compulsory wearing of face masks. In late January, the WHO was <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/updated-who-advice-for-international-traffic-in-relation-to-the-outbreak-of-the-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-24-jan\">advising against</a> international traffic restrictions \u2013 and to this day, it still stands by the recommendation that face masks are not necessary for the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51205344\">general public</a>.</p> <p>Due to limited treatment infrastructures, the Vietnamese government has focused on mass testing and aggressive contact tracing \u2013 a tactic it had employed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\">to fight </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\">Sars</a> 17 years ago. Only this time on a larger scale. As of 30 April, Vietnam had conducted <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/vietnam-poised-export-covid-19-test-kits\">261,004 tests</a> and put tens of thousands of people in isolation.</p> <p>Testing and contact tracing is based on a four-level principle announced by the health ministry: confirmed Covid-19 patients and their direct contacts (level 1: isolation and treatment in hospitals); close contacts with level 1 (level 2: quarantine facilities); close contacts with level 2 (level 3: self-quarantine at home); and lockdown of the neighbourhood/village/town where the patient lives (level 4).</p> <p>Adhering to this principle has meant <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vietnam-fight-insi/after-aggressive-mass-testing-vietnam-says-it-contains-coronavirus-outbreak-idUSKBN22B34H\">testing a massive number of suspected cases</a> for every new patient. So far, Vietnam has tested nearly <a href=\"https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/xklpykkaqpg/index.html\">800 people</a> for each new confirmed case, the highest ratio in the world, according to Reuters data. Vietnam was able to make its own test kits and has even <a href=\"https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/who-approves-made-in-vietnam-covid-19-test-kit-4090402.html\">exported the kits</a> to Europe and the US.</p> <p>In real life, this scale of testing is easier said than done. Vietnam has gone to great lengths to locate the virus, even utilising methods that could have been controversial in countries with stricter privacy rights. It publishes a detailed travel history of every new patient on social media and in local newspapers in order to seek people who have been in close contact with them. To increase vigilance, the government has also released a mobile app for people to alert the authority about suspected infections in their area. For all people entering the country, a health declaration is now compulsory, with criminal penalties for false declarations.</p> <p>Some would claim these measures are intrusive and would doubt their effectiveness if implemented elsewhere. This may be true. Vietnam is a one-party state with decades of experience in mobilising its population through wars, Sars and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/swine-flu\">swine flu</a> outbreaks.</p> <p>In the early days of the epidemic, the government framed the outbreak as a war. Doctors and nurses were referred to as \u201csoldiers\u201d, and the newly formed National Steering Committee for Covid-19 Prevention and Control was dubbed the \u201cGeneral Headquarters\u201d \u2013 a reference back to a military body in existence until 1975.</p> <p>Not only has the language of war been revived, the military has been central to tackling the outbreak. It has been in charge of coordinating the food, transport and accommodation required to quarantine thousands of people returning home to Vietnam from outbreak zones such as the UK.</p> <p>As in wartime, almost every sector, including aviation, healthcare and food production, has been mobilised and dedicated to containing the pandemic. Citizens, meanwhile, are encouraged via social media, text messages and TV broadcasts to donate to the nation\u2019s disease prevention funds.</p> <p>These messages have not been communicated in a rigid militaristic style. Instead, the government has been creative. It updates citizens via regular text messages and has teamed up with two famous pop singers to produce an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eWmKQmMoFk\">educational song about the virus</a>, commissioned artists to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj7jvskxQAY\">create </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj7jvskxQAY\">posters</a>, and used young, influential figures to broadcast positive messages to those under mandatory quarantine.</p> <p>These creative messages have resonated with many living in lockdown. Vu Dinh Thai, a 25-year-old Vietnamese graduate student in the UK, spent nearly a month in the government\u2019s quarantine camp. Despite unhygienic water and limited access to the internet, he was grateful for the safety he couldn\u2019t be assured of in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s free and they tried their best,\u201d he told me via text messages, \u201cand who would belittle their country for being poor?\u201d</p> <p>Vietnam made it clear at the beginning of the pandemic that it wanted to protect its reputation as \u201ca safe country\u201d. Yet by being open with its people, the government has achieved more than just safeguarding its image; it has rebuilt public trust. For the past few years, Vietnam has had to deal with protests over non-transparent handling of environmental disasters such as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/aug/14/vietnamese-fishermen-jobless-fish-poisoning-battle-justice\">mass fish poisoning</a> in 2016, land disputes, and most recently a controversial bill of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-security-trials/vietnam-jails-15-more-over-economic-zone-protests-idUSKBN1KL0DU\">special economic zones</a>.</p> <p>The question is whether Vietnam can retain this level of transparency in the aftermath of the crisis. Respecting and being open with the people can only benefit Vietnam.</p> <p>\u2022 Trang Bui is a Vietnamese freelance journalist based in Ho Chi Minh City</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2020.

  "<p>The government has been urged to arrange post-traumatic stress disorder support for frontline medical staff, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/23/half-of-uk-health-workers-suffering-stress-because-of-covid-19\">mental health may be at risk</a> due to the stress of working through the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>In a letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the shadow minister for mental health, Rosena Allin-Khan, said staff needed access to PTSD support and talking therapies, and that monitoring for increased suicide risk should be put in place.</p> <p>\u201cNHS and care staff are breaking down \u2013 I see it first-hand, working shifts. It is simply heartbreaking to see the toll this virus is taking on our frontline staff,\u201d she said. \u201cOur frontline NHS and care staff are doing fantastic work in extremely difficult circumstances. They risk their lives every day in order to protect us. Unless our staff are protected, they cannot continue their vital work of keeping us all safe.\u201d</p> <p>Allin-Khan wrote that staff are under increased pressure due to a fear of spreading the virus to patients and loved ones, PPE shortages and witnessing the deaths of patients. \u201cAt this time of crisis, staff mental health must be a priority now. It simply cannot be an afterthought once the acute stage of the crisis is over.\u201d </p> <p>Speaking to the health and social care select committee on Friday, Claire Murdoch, the national mental health director for NHS England, confirmed that the NHS was planning for PTSD referrals for frontline staff. \u201cWe know it\u2019s been a high-stress environment. We\u2019re planning mental health support right now,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She said ensuring hospital teams offered support through good supervision, debriefs after shifts and making sure shift patterns allowed staff to recuperate would be crucial. \u201cThe military are very good at this,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Murdoch added that trusts were investing more in occupational and mental health support for staff and that national helplines with third sector organisations, such as Samaritans, had been set up to support staff.</p> <p>Responding to MPs\u2019 questions, Murdoch also said there appeared to have been an overall drop of around 30-40% in referrals of members of the public to mental health services. But she added that there was no evidence currently for a spike in suicides or self-harm. \u201cWe absolutely have not seen that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty certain that levels of anxiety and distress will have increased for young people. Everyone\u2019s more worried. Lots of people are sleeping less.\u201d</p> <p>The committee heard further evidence that cancer services were being disrupted, with urgent two-week referrals dropping by 63% last week, which Dame Cally Palmer, the national cancer director for NHS England, said was a concern. \u201cEarly detection is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/extra-18000-cancer-patients-in-england-could-die-in-next-year-study\"> vital for survival</a>,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She added that it was crucial that screening programmes, many of which have been paused, be restarted. \u201cThere have been no national instructions on screening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to make sure that rescheduled screening take place, especially bowel cancer. Cancers are slow growing so 4-6 weeks should not affect survival but we need to get that turned back on.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

  "<p>Cities around the world are already planning for life after Covid-19, with a series of environmental initiatives being rolled out from Bogot\u00e1 to Barcelona to ensure public safety and bolster the fight against climate breakdown.</p> <p>Mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks this week to coordinate their efforts to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis as national governments begin to implement huge economic stimulus packages.</p> <p>Many cities have already announced measures, from hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in Milan and Mexico City to widening pavements and pedestrianising neighbourhoods in New York and Seattle.</p> <p>The initiatives are designed to allow people to move around urban spaces safely in a world where physical distancing will be the norm for the foreseeable future \u2013 and do so without sparking a drastic increase in air pollution.</p> <p>The mayors who took part in the newly formed economic taskforce this week believe these initial schemes point the way to more radical long-term measures that will help tackle inequality and the climate crisis.</p> <p>The mayor of Milan, who is heading the taskforce run by the <a href=\"https://www.c40.org/\">C40 group of cities</a>, said: \u201cOur immediate priority is to protect the health of our residents and overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we must also look towards how we will keep our people safe in the future. How we structure our recovery efforts will define our cities for decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>The mayors discussed measures ranging from huge retrofitting programmes to make buildings more energy efficient, to mass tree planting and investment in solar and wind power.</p> <p>The mayor of Montr\u00e9al, Val\u00e9rie Plante, who attended the video meeting, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cWe need more than ever to position our economic recovery in the context of our fight against climate change. It is also clear to me that our economic recovery must go hand in hand with our social recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Milan has introduced one of Europe\u2019s most ambitious cycling and walking schemes, with 22 miles of streets to be transformed over the summer.</p> <p>In Paris, the mayor has allocated \u20ac300m for a network of cycle lanes, many of which will follow existing metro lines, to offer an alternative to public transport.</p> <p>In Bogot\u00e1, the Colombian capital, a 75-mile network of streets usually turned over to bicycles one day a week <a href=\"https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/bogota-expands-bike-lanes-overnight-to-curb-coronavirus-spread-5127\">will now be traffic-free all week</a>, and a further 47 miles of bike lanes are being opened to reduce crowding on public transport and improve air quality.</p> <p>New York has <a href=\"https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/04/27/breaking-de-blasio-commits-to-100-miles-of-open-streets/\">unveiled plans to open up 100 miles</a> of streets for \u201csocially responsible recreation\u201d during the Covid-19 crisis, with a focus on areas with the most need, while Oakland, in California,<strong> </strong>is closing off 75 miles of its streets to passing cars and setting aside up to 10% of streets for recreation.</p> <p>Mexico City is planning 80 miles of temporary bike lanes, and Barcelona is adding <a href=\"https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20200425/48704357907/barcelona-espacio-coches-aceras-carriles-bici-desconfinamiento-coronavirus.html\">30,000 square metres to its pedestrianised networks</a> and 13 miles to the biking network.</p> <p>In the UK, the Scottish government has announced \u00a310m to create pop-up walking and cycling routes, while mayors in northern England have suggested a national programme to retrofit homes with renewable energy technology. On Thursday Manchester city council announced it would pedestrianise part of Deansgate, in the city centre. In London, boroughs including Lambeth and Hackney have announced measures to widen pavements, close roads to traffic and improve walking and cycling.</p> <p>Dr Rachel Aldred, at the University of Westminster, said the action city leaders take in the next few weeks would be critically important. \u201cThis is a really important moment. There is the potential to lock in the reduction in air pollution we have seen over the past weeks if we get this right, but as people begin to go back to work and can\u2019t or don\u2019t feel safe using public transport, there is the potential to instead lock in a huge increase in car use and pollution.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Watts, the chief executive of C40, said mayors had a lot of power to protect their citizens and shape the direction of the recovery. \u201cThere is now a hell of a lot of collaboration among very powerful politicians who do think a green economic recovery is absolutely essential,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are talking about collectively creating funds that they all put money into which would then support electric vehicles, support rollout of cycle lanes, support retrofitting of buildings \u2026 C40 cities using the hundreds of millions of dollars in their pension funds for this and getting very good long-term returns.\u201d</p> <p>Watts said although many of these initial measures had been billed as short term, he expected them to endure. \u201cThis is how cities are going to function for the next two years, and probably that will transition \u2013 if we have a green economic recovery \u2013 into permanence.\u201d</p> <p>Daisy Narayanan, the director of urbanism at Sustrans, agreed that the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis could be \u201ca catalyst for long-lasting change in the way we live and travel, especially in towns and cities. What Covid-19 has also done is to highlight the crossovers between the quality of our places, public health, economy, transport, education, air quality and social justice.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks scientists have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/21/preliminary-study-links-air-pollution-to-coronavirus-deaths-in-england\">tentatively linked</a> air pollution to Covid-19 mortality rates and even the spread of the virus. Narayanan added: \u201cAction needs to be taken now which will help people move around without the congestion, pollution and ill-health that comes with car use now and after lockdown is lifted.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Seven things city leaders can do to drive a green, fair recovery from Covid-19</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Remove through motor traffic from residential streets and extend pavements near shops, schools and parks to make walking safe and enjoyable for transport and exercise.</p></li> <li><p>Introduce safe access routes on foot, bike and scooter from homes to parks and green spaces and introduce automatic pedestrian lights at crossings so people do not have to push buttons and risk infection.</p></li> <li><p>Establish safe cycle routes to and from work for key workers, especially hospital staff, by closing roads and carriageways where necessary so people have a safe alternative to private cars and public transport.</p></li> <li><p>Create safe walking and cycling routes to and from schools, and close down streets around schools to motor vehicles at drop-off and pickup times.</p></li> <li><p>Use libraries, schools and sports stadiums to distribute nutritious, sustainably produced food to communities that need it most, and scale up food waste collection and treatment, including distributing household composting kits and guidance.</p></li> <li><p>Retrofit all public buildings, many of which are empty now, drastically improving energy efficiency and creating thousands of green jobs.</p></li> <li><p>Work with other cities to invest the billions tied up in city funds and pensions in climate solutions to drive green job creation and create a more resilient and sustainable economy.</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>It\u2019s difficult to imagine that Britain was, until very recently, regarded as a leader in preparing for pandemics. Countries such as Singapore once looked to the UK for lessons in how to prepare for and respond to outbreaks. Now, it\u2019s the other way around. With its number of coronavirus cases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\">exceeding 170,000</a>, and deaths set to climb above 40,000, the UK appears to be playing catch-up with the rest of the world.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s failure to shatter the coronavirus curve couldn\u2019t be further out of step with its past reputation as a leader in this area. The UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130105191920/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_088702\">global health strategy</a>, launched under New Labour in 2008, was a game-changer in the field of global health. The strategy identified how, in an interconnected world, an infectious outbreak in another country was a direct threat to the UK. By building health capacity elsewhere in the world, the government recognised that it could protect its own borders from infectious outbreaks \u2013 reflecting the Blairite logic that interventions abroad would bolster security at home.</p> <p>Over the past two decades, the<strong> </strong>UK has been a trailblazer in funding global health. It\u2019s one of the only countries to have <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn03714/\">0.7% of GDP earmarked</a> for overseas development assistance. Public Health England has a global team advising countries across the globe in building capacity to respond to disease, while the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres-projects-groups/uk-phrst\">public health rapid support team</a> is frequently deployed around the world to support countries\u2019 response efforts to emerging pathogens. During the Ebola crisis in 2014, for example, the government deployed PHE <a href=\"https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/03/feature-phes-ebola-response-the-people-behind-the-scenes/\">epidemiologists</a> to work with Sierra Leone\u2019s health ministry, while the Ministry of Defence sent troops to build treatment centres and NHS staff <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/volunteer-ebola-j-cummings/\">volunteered</a> as healthcare workers. Meanwhile DfID supported clinical trials of <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/ebola-vaccine-shows-promising-results\">vaccines</a>, in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2016/final_trial_results_ebola_high_protection.html\">UK universities</a>.</p> <p>Of course, the UK\u2019s interests in this field were never just about health. Its 2008 strategy was criticised at the time <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680218/\">for self-interest</a> \u2013 pursuing health policies abroad primarily as a means of protecting the UK from infection,<strong> </strong>and as a trade opportunity to commodify NHS expertise on the international market. In the febrile political climate that followed 9/11, the threat of an attack \u2013 whether in the form of a virus or a terrorist group \u2013 loomed large in governments\u2019 imaginations. The UK government saw policies to combat infectious diseases as an extension of this security mindset \u2013 in turn shaping how politicians came to view pandemics.</p> <p>This fear of existential risks forged the UK\u2019s global health strategy, but it also helps explain why we found ourselves on the back foot when coronavirus hit. By the time Covid-19 arrived, the memory of such dangers taking place at home had faded; outbreaks seemed like things that happened elsewhere in the world. The last major outbreaks to affect the UK were BSE in the early 1990s and the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in 2001. While these both posed significantly less of a risk to human mortality than Covid-19, they contributed to widespread disruptions and substantial economic losses for farmers. By the time the last foot-and-mouth case had been recorded, in Cumbria, more than <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35581830\">six million cattle, pigs and sheep</a> had been slaughtered. Yet in the years that followed these crises, successive governments became complacent \u2013 believing they could get away without funding preparedness, as outbreaks were unlikely to happen within their election cycle, if at all.</p> <p>This complacency was amplified by austerity policies. The NHS has endured the most <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/articles/does-nhs-need-more-money\">prolonged funding squeeze</a> in its history, which has meant that surge capacity in PPE, ventilators and ICU beds was not purchased, even when Operation Cygnus identified these areas as shortcomings in 2016. Meanwhile the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/ending-the-blame-game\">cuts to</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/ending-the-blame-game\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/ending-the-blame-game\">investment</a> in public health areas such as <a href=\"https://archive.bma.org.uk/collective-voice/policy-and-research/public-and-population-health/public-health-budgets\">smoking, alcohol and obesity</a> have contributed to a rise in entirely preventable chronic conditions, which are now proving significant risk factors for coronavirus.</p> <p>One of the few existential dilemmas the UK has faced over the last decade is Brexit. Somewhat paradoxically, in prioritising Brexit, government ministers dealt another blow to the UK\u2019s preparedness for a threat whose consequences would be deadly.<strong> </strong>Training for key workers to manage a pandemic was stalled<strong> </strong>to make space for <a href=\"https://archive.is/20200418182037/https:/www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\">contingency plans around no-deal Brexit</a>, while the UK missed opportunities for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\">EU-level purchasing</a> of PPE, and parliamentary enquiries into preparedness for infectious disease were delayed and <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/inquiries/parliament-2017/biosecurity-human-health-inquiry-17-19/\">eventually halted</a> due to the 2019 election.</p> <p>Early in the pandemic, the UK made the significant \u2013 and potentially fatal \u2013 decision to ignore the advice of the WHO, an institution for which the UK is still a top <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/uk-to-continue-funding-who-saying-global-unity-essential-to-beat-covid-19\">government funder</a>, which recommended a strategy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/who-urges-countries-to-track-and-trace-every-covid-19-case\">testing, isolating and contact tracing</a>. This early move now seems like a grave mistake. Jenny Harries, England\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/england-coronavirus-testing-has-not-risen-fast-enough-science-chief\">stated that the UK</a> didn\u2019t need to follow WHO advice \u2013 \u201cThe clue with the WHO is in its title \u2013 it\u2019s a World Health Organization, and it is addressing all countries across the world,\u201d she said at the time.</p> <p>But the assumption that WHO guidelines didn\u2019t apply to us exposed a remarkable hubris in the UK government\u2019s approach to coronavirus. We were no better prepared than the rest of the world. Indeed, we were worse prepared than countries that once looked to us for lessons. On matters of pandemic preparedness, why would any government seek the UK\u2019s advice again?</p> <p>\u2022 Clare Wenham is assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Apart from the multiple kindnesses of friends and new-found neighbours, it\u2019s hard to find a silver lining to the current situation, but one positive is having time to learn stuff you don\u2019t know. In wine terms, that could be a country, a region or a grape variety, particularly one you may have failed to get to grips with in the past, and the immediate one that pops to my mind is riesling.</p> <p>Now, before you say you wine writers are <em>always</em> banging on about riesling, that\u2019s true, but I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call it the greatest white wine grape in the world (for me, that\u2019s chardonnay). It is, however, massively intriguing in the way it reflects the place where it\u2019s made, its wildly varying levels of sweetness (no, it\u2019s not all sweet) and its ability to age, which may mean that that elderly bottle you stumbled across at the back of the cupboard is, in fact, OK. Riesling also has the advantage of going brilliantly with spicy food and being relatively low in alcohol, which makes it perfect for this time of year.</p> <p>Part of the problem, of course, is that riesling is inextricably associated with Germany, so has to deal with the historic baggage between our two nations, though that\u2019s mercifully dying out, and not before time. It\u2019s also fair to say that the German wines exported here in the 60s and 70s \u2013 not always riesling, but often mistaken for it \u2013 were woefully poor. Add to that a bewildering labelling system (how can <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tlese\">sp\u00e4tlese</a> be both a dry <em>and</em> a sweet wine?), as well as tortuously complicated names and labels, and you can see why the stuff fell so out of favour. But German rieslings have changed: these days, they\u2019re drier, higher in alcohol (many Mosel wines are now 11% or 11.5%, rather than 8-9%) and, in many cases, snappily packaged, as you can see from the Shhh\u2026 It\u2019s Riesling in the panel below. And, hooray, sealed with a screw-cap rather than a cork.</p> <p>You also find great riesling in Alsace, Austria and in the new world in Australia, New Zealand and North America\u2019s Washington State. The most rewarding ones, as usual, are to be found in independents such as <a href=\"http://www.thewineryuk.com/home/\">The Winery</a>, or online retailers such as <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/\">The Wine Society</a>, which has just started delivering again, though at time of writing only by the unsplit case. These supermarket rieslings should at least give you a taste for it, however.

  "<p>Six weeks after first feeling unwell, Jenny* is still recovering from what she believes was Covid-19. </p> \n<p>On 17 March she, like many others, began preparing for an expected lockdown in the UK, stocking up on supermarket essentials. She was feeling a little flushed \u2013 something she put down to a reemergence of cold-like symptoms from a few weeks before.</p> \n<p>Then the other symptoms began, including a runny nose, sneezing and phlegm. \u201cAt that time, everybody was saying that runny noses and sneezing were not symptoms of coronavirus so I still didn\u2019t think I had it,\u201d the 33-year-old said. \u201cThen I started coughing.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the days marched on, other symptoms developed, including chest pains, shortness of breath and marks like dappled bruising on the feet \u2013 something <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/15/bruises-feet-sign-coronavirus-12557291/\">Spanish doctors have suggested</a> could be a sign of the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt really was like one thing after another,\u201d Jenny said, adding that on attempting to get back to work, typing in bed, she developed muscle pains in her wrists.</p> \n<p>Her flatmate also became ill \u2013 with symptoms including a fever and loss of taste and smell. Without testing, it is impossible to be sure, but it seemed highly probable that the cause of the illness in both flatmates was Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Jenny still feels exhausted, with days of feeling better followed by setbacks. \u201cI still don\u2019t feel better because a few days ago I started shivering, like I got a chill somehow,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>She is not alone: Fiona Lowenstein, a writer in the US, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/opinion/coronavirus-recovery.html\">co-founded a group on the social media platform Slack</a> for people who have experienced Covid-19 after it took her weeks to recover from being <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/opinion/coronavirus-young-people.html\">admitted to hospital</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/opinion/coronavirus-young-people.html\"> with the disease</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"813b8139-288d-4297-9591-f6f2be6d4d7d\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dr Andy Whittamore, a GP in Portsmouth and Asthma UK\u2019s clinical lead, says that viruses are a trigger for asthma and asthma symptoms, and therefore it is fair to assume that coronavirus will act in the same way.</p>\n    <p>Health bodies around the world are listing asthma as a condition that might be considered high risk, but so far there is no evidence to suggest that having asthma increases the infection rate from the coronavirus. There is, though, some evidence that people who have asthma and catch the coronavirus are more likely to go on to have a more severe case of Covid-19. There is yet to be any data which shows how asthma impacts on the mortality rate from the coronavirus, but doctors are advising that people with the condition try to manage their asthma symptoms as best they can in case they catch the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p>Asthma is a condition of the airways, causing inflammation. It can lead to wheezing, coughing and a tight chest, and be triggered both by internal factors in the body, like levels of hormones, and external factors, like viruses, pollution and allergens. Colds and flu are considered a major trigger.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Many report waves of symptoms over a period of weeks \u2013 from heart palpitations to headaches, shortness of breath and fatigue.</p> \n<p>In a survey of group members, 89% of the 465 respondents said they had symptoms that fluctuated in intensity and frequency; 23% had tested positive for coronavirus, taking on average just over nine days to be tested from the onset to symptoms; 28% tested negative and were, on average, tested after about 15 days; and just 3.5% were admitted to hospital, although 38% visited an emergency department.</p> \n<p>With symptoms long-lasting, some members have concerns over whether they are still infectious.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf\">A report published in February by the World Health Organization</a>, based on preliminary data, suggested in mild cases, the median recovery time from Covid-19 is about two weeks from the onset of symptoms, and about three to six weeks for severe or critical cases.</p> \n<p>But while severe Covid-19 may mean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/the-road-to-recovery-for-covid-19-patients\">a long road to recovery</a>, it seems even mild cases can, for some, involve many weeks of recuperation.</p> \n<p>Alice* is still experiencing symptoms more than 50 days after first becoming ill.

She has tested positive for Covid-19 twice and still has symptoms more than 50 days after first feeling unwell. She said the experience was a rollercoaster of symptoms and severities. </p> \n<p>\u201cMy biggest concern is that there is little visibility into the reality of what recovery truly looks like, as recovery from a medical perspective simply means that the patient \u2018did not die\u2019 and simply does not capture the lingering and painful symptoms that the Covid-19 recovery road truly entails for some or many,\u201d Nichols said, adding that some of her most alarming symptoms occurred in her third and fifth weeks of being unwell.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am concerned that employers and governments are rushing the recoveries of thousands who are still in pain and still symptomatic, without understanding that this causes both mental and physical complications for people already in a very vulnerable and unwell state of being,\u201d she said, adding that she was also concerned about the lack of support for those recovering.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> \n<p>Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said it was perhaps not surprising that some people had long recoveries. \u201cMany people often take weeks to completely recover from pneumonia,\u201d he said. \u201cIn these cases, the viral illness has typically long since subsided and thus it is unlikely the patient will be infectious.\u201d</p> \n<p>But it is unclear why some take longer than others to recover. \u201cWe know that recovery time after pneumonia is often influenced by the presence of co-morbidities and by age of the patient,\u201d said Head. \u201cAlongside that, many people will have undiagnosed co-morbidities, such as diabetes, also influencing how ill a patient becomes, and their recovery time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Slack group survey found two-thirds of respondents had a pre-existing medical condition, mainly seasonal allergies or asthma.</p> \n<p>Why there should be such variation in recovery time remains unknown, but a genetic element may play a part, said Dr James Gill, an honorary clinical lecturer at the University of Warwick and a locum GP. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/study-of-twins-reveals-genetic-effect-on-covid-19-symptoms\">Preliminary work from King\u2019s College London</a> has suggested that genetic factors could account for about half of the variation in a number of key symptoms of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Gill said he was only seeing about two to three patients a week with long-lasting symptoms, suggesting the experience is not common, although he noted that without community-level testing to know who had had the virus, it would remain unclear how common a recovery path was.</p> \n<p>But Gill said <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127710/\">data from the Sars outbreak</a> revealed that almost a third of those who had had that particular coronavirus still had a reduced tolerance to exercise many months later, despite having normal lung function. While Gill stressed that Covid-19 was a different disease, he said it could be that a similar proportion of about a fifth or a third of those with Covid-19 had lengthy recovery time .</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Although symptoms may linger, it is thought an individual is unlikely to be infectious once three days have passed with no raised temperature, but coughing should be treated with caution, Gill said.</p> \n<p>What recovery looks like is an evolving picture, he continued. \u201cWe are learning on a daily, weekly basis, things about how people are recovering from this, and we can\u2019t know about the long-term impacts until we are in the long term.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The only way to completely understand is by observation over the long term \u2013 and this includes recovery time.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Prof David Heymann</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agreed with Gill. \u201cWhenever a new virus that has come from the animal kingdom is identified in humans there is great concern about what is not known because humans do not have previous experience with this virus and the immune response it will cause,\u201d Heymann said. \u201cThe only way to completely understand is by observation over the long term \u2013 and this includes recovery time from infection.\u201d </p> \n<p>With suggestions that some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) may arise after illnesses including viral infections, Gill said concern was starting to mount.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of people wondering whether or not we are going to see an uptick in cases of chronic fatigue going forwards as a result [of Covid-19],\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that, but it is something that we are thinking may be possible.\u201d</p> \n<p>Carmine Pariante, a professor of biological psychiatry at King\u2019s College London, agreed there could be a rise in people experiencing a CFS-like syndrome. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if this is going to happen with Covid-19 because we don\u2019t have the follow-up data,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the picture unfortunately, both in terms of the biochemical picture [of the immune response] and the acute fatigue, which is very prevalent, make us think it will be possible.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gill said it was important that those who had had a coronavirus infection or suspected Covid-19, had access to physiotherapists and nutritional advice.</p> \n<p>Also helpful would be leaflets with advice on recovery, such as reminding patients to drink plenty of fluids and to do breathing exercises, said Gill, adding that some advice could be drawn from existing knowledge of other conditions.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, it is important to take time to recover, he said. \u201cIf you have had coronavirus and you have been flattened by it, you have no get-up-and-go, and you are fatigued. You need to rest, and you need to go back to work \u2013 or doing whatever you do \u2013 in a step-wise progression.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>*Some names have been changed</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ccd6bc3c-247b-428b-ab4e-349a27619759\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m5Hn0K-Npjs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

  "<p>Candidates in their dressing gowns, dogs and children running about, partners in the background watching TV, or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter \u2013 with 25 years in the recruitment sector, David Stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews. \u201cWhen people are working at home, because it\u2019s your personal space, a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it\u2019s still a formal first meeting,\u201d Stone, the founder of <a href=\"https://www.mrlcg.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">MRL Consulting Group</a>, says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you see going on in the background.\u201d</p> <p>Holding interviews remotely \u2013 whether by phone or video \u2013 isn\u2019t a new concept, particularly for companies that have built remote, international teams. Nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process, with an influx of artificial-intelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years. There are algorithms that can analyse candidates\u2019 tone of voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns during video pre-assessments, scoring them against an ideal profile for that role. Graduates have <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/ai-interviews-city-jobs-graduates-a3951296.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reportedly spent thousands of pounds</a> learning how to beat these systems.</p> <p>But for many companies, still recruiting during the global Covid-19 lockdown, moving the process online can be a daunting prospect. Stone recommends all involved \u2013 recruiter and candidate \u2013 treat a remote interview like a traditional, face-to-face meeting as much as possible. \u201cGet up, get showered, put a suit on,\u201d he says. \u201cPay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you. Make sure you\u2019ve got an hour\u2019s worth of peace and quiet.\u201d Some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person, he adds. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try and get past that.

She\u2019s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it\u2019s all online. \u201cWe can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours,\u201d she says. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think you lose anything just because you can\u2019t shake that person\u2019s hand. I ask the same questions to a candidate that I would if they were sitting right in front of me.

Do they give me confidence?\u201d</p> <p>While recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone, Wilson says it is important to see the person you\u2019re speaking to at some stage in the process. That doesn\u2019t have to be via a bespoke HR platform \u2013 video conference tools such as Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams work just as well. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to be working remotely, you also need to be reassured they have the right set-up at home,\u201d she adds. \u201cI check that they have a dedicated desk area, they have an appropriate seat, and it looks free from distraction.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1ed6b7031113c9a3e3eaeace2745dc4cc91b48a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1ed6b7031113c9a3e3eaeace2745dc4cc91b48a/0_247_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young woman teleconferencing on laptop on conference call\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recruiters may use a video interview to check that candidates have suitable workspace at home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drazen_/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand, think about getting the lighting and camera angle right, test microphones, and put phones and any push notifications on silent, says <a href=\"https://www.tranceformationstm.com/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">flexible working consultant and executive coach</a> Marilyn Devonish. \u201cWhen speaking, look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you\u2019re looking at them,\u201d she adds, rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen (Zoom has a \u201chide myself\u201d option, which can help).

  "<p>Whether it\u2019s your first job after teacher training or you\u2019re an experienced hand, evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process. But how do you do that remotely? Here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown.</p> <p><strong>Prepare for remote interviews</strong><br>Although the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges, it\u2019s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years. Independent and English language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas. The current lockdown has forced all schools across the UK to reconsider how they recruit teachers.</p> <p><strong>Be tech-ready<br></strong>On both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology, the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video. What apps will they be using? Have you used them before? If not, rehearse with a friend.</p> <p><strong>Think the process through<br></strong>It is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs. Find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process. This will give you motivation, as well as building up a network for future job opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Visit the school \u2013 virtually<br></strong>In order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with, one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school, should you be successfully appointed. Under normal circumstances it\u2019s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable. Under the current conditions, it\u2019s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site \u2013 just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job. A conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour. This is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment.</p> <p><strong>Prepare your application<br></strong>Look at the key facts listed on the job advert, and evaluate how they match up with the person specification \u2013 not the job description. Think carefully about what you can offer the school. Initial research on examination performance, pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application. It would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school. For more on this, see the <a href=\"https://www.teachertoolkit.co.uk/2018/03/25/the-5-minute-interview-plan-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">five-minute interview plan</a>. Regarding referees and references, it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a \u201cheads-up\u201d. References are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond, putting them under pressure. You don\u2019t want to put your job application in jeopardy!</p> <p><strong>Submitting your application <br></strong>Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck!<strong> </strong>Whatever you do, do not copy and paste bog-standard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence. I\u2019ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school\u2019s name, have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information (no one needs to know your astrological birth sign!). Ask a friend to proofread your application. Show the reader that you have conducted some research, posing questions and thoughts, as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role. Remember, you can discuss finer details during the interview, so keep the facts concise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e878c1d4c404b4cb10389db895182a8f2f30f50a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e878c1d4c404b4cb10389db895182a8f2f30f50a/0_132_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young woman sitting at table at home using cell phone and laptop taking notes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ask direct questions to make sure the school\u2019s right for you.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Plan your questions </strong><br>The easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview.

  "<p>If you are a teacher looking to move between schools during the coronavirus lockdown, how can you make the most of the online education experience with your new class? This is interesting new territory for many teachers. But there are thousands and thousands of teachers and pupils already learning remotely, in virtual schools \u2013 can they offer insights?</p> <p>At a virtual school, lessons are delivered in line with each person\u2019s personalised curriculum. Exactly as you would expect in a physical school space, pupils are taught how to interact with teachers, their peers and lesson content using whiteboard technology, quizzes, voice and video as well as receiving and sending assignment tasks. How should you introduce yourself to a new class, if you are meeting them online for the first time? If we consider how teachers deliver excellent classroom teaching practice in a physical space, how they prepare should not be approached any differently in an online environment.</p> <h2>Flipped learning</h2> <p>\u201cFlipped learning\u201d is a term used to describe how teachers can provide material for pupils to learn outside of the classroom. Although this is traditionally considered homework or coursework and typically completed without the teacher, increasingly this approach to enhance learning outside of the classroom has been set and completed online. During lockdown, teachers will be focusing on core curriculum content, meeting the needs of vulnerable pupils as well as enhancing student engagement, mixing between activities, types of assignments and differentiation techniques to support a range of pupils. One factor that must be considered for teachers who are working remotely, is how they can mix online teaching and learning with traditional methods that would be used in the physical classroom. A good tip for teachers working online, especially from home, is to have a simple whiteboard behind the camera and teach just as you would in a physical classroom space. Doing this over a sustained period of time will definitely present a new challenge, but it\u2019s possible with well-thought-out curriculum plans, and a simple range of equipment.</p> <h2>Blended learning</h2> <p>Blended learning, first developed in the 1960s, was a method of instruction using technology-mediated methods. With flipped learning being the norm during lockdown, what can teachers learn from other educators who are already working in blended learning environments \u2013 teachers working in virtual schools, or online tutors?</p> <p>If we look towards Barak Rosenshine\u2019s 17 recommendations for effective teaching, these can quite easily be reapplied to online teaching, delivered through (at least) video conferencing. At the start of every lesson, review the last lesson with a simple retrieval exercise. This supports long-term retention, can easily be deployed with a simple quiz or competition and is a guaranteed way to get a lesson off to a flying start.</p> <p>When presenting new material, successful teachers teach by giving a series of short presentations using many examples. Teachers should also provide guided practice by modelling various techniques. Where teachers present too much material at once, this will confuse pupils. Working online without sufficient verbal and non-verbal cues, means it will be critical for teachers to regularly check student responses.</p> <p>One way that teachers can do this is to ask a large number of questions. Feedback can be provided by giving prompts, modelling and guiding pupils as they develop independent practice and asking simple questions such as \u201cwho, where, why and how\u201d to help shape pupils\u2019 thinking. When teachers check frequently to see if all students are learning, this processes information into long-term memory, developing schematic concepts to support retention. Teaching remotely, whether using Microsoft Teams, Google Suite or other platforms, gives teachers a significant array of strategies to deploy at this interesting time.</p> <p>Finally, research recommends that teachers should try \u201cscaffold learning\u201d, helping pupils to problem-solve by thinking out loud and providing cognitive support. This can be achieved by completing the work alongside pupils; doing this online may require teachers to use \u201cbreakout spaces\u201d by waiting to provide individual feedback in live video conferencing lessons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"affba1b5e1a0f99cc5f040e4b8cef0a1709f255e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/affba1b5e1a0f99cc5f040e4b8cef0a1709f255e/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young student watching lesson online and studying from home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teachers delivering lessons from home should have a simple whiteboard behind them and teach just as they would in a physical classroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jovanmandic/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Flexibility and personalisation</h2> <p>Every student should be treated as an individual online as all teachers would in a physical space, and with teachers working remotely, they will need to learn how to use technology as well as adapt content to meet individual needs. If you are meeting your pupils for the first time, I would recommend sending them a survey, asking them to complete simple questions so that you can elicit initial information about their interests, abilities and hopes. You can then start to plan which interventions you will use in your lesson planning and delivery.</p> <p>To help support increased teacher workload, my key recommendation would be that if teachers are able to connect with the pupils online, it is important to allow students to engage in a weekly and monthly review of their learning to support long-term memory. Often this manifests itself when a pupil says: \u201cWe\u2019ve done this before!\u201d But effective teachers will remind pupils that this is a retrieval practice exercise to assist with long-term retention.</p> <h2>Safeguarding and security</h2> <p>If you are joining a virtual school, then I would assume the various safeguarding procedures are already in place. However, if you now find yourself teaching pupils online for the first time, having never met them physically, you should double-check to ensure that your new school has considered data protection, child protection, internet security and the various online safeguarding procedures for teachers and pupils.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-abcs-of-recruiting-teachers-remotely/2020/may/01/how-to-conduct-a-remote-interview-seven-tips-for-schools-hiring-teachers\">How to conduct a remote interview: seven tips for schools hiring teachers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When teaching from your own home environment, it is worth reflecting on your own safeguarding procedures. For example, if you have not yet physically reached your new school, have you received any induction, or has the designated safeguarding officer spoken with you about induction procedures? Of the students in your register, which have specific learning needs that require initial conversations with your special needs coordinator or associated form tutors? All these balances and checks would be done physically on entry to a new school; just because you are doing this remotely, doesn\u2019t mean that they should not happen.</p> <h2>Creating a supportive, online environment</h2> <p>What should teachers consider when meeting their pupils online? Many schools will assign home-learning tasks through software or an online curriculum portal, which parents can access. Other schools will have their teachers and pupils log on to a secure platform, to complete assignments, submit work and interact with the teacher through voice or text. Some schools will be offering live video lessons with pupils, teaching from the home environment or from their school classrooms.</p> <p>If we look towards countries such as South Korea and Singapore, where teachers have an almost celebrity-like online presence, it\u2019s common to find them sharing videos, teaching lessons through YouTube or having millions of viewers on Instagram.</p> <p><em>If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to <a href=\"https://recruiters.theguardian.com/coronavirus-education-offer?utm_source=odpy&amp;utm_medium=dispad&amp;utm_campaign=we_support_schools&amp;CMP_TU=jbsr&amp;CMP_BUNIT=jobs\">recruiters.theguardian.com</a> and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit <a href=\"https://jobs.theguardian.com/jobs/schools/?INTCMP=gdnwb_editorial_editorial_jobs_teachers_content_\">our jobsite</a></em></p>",

  "<p>\u2018You\u2019d better unpack.\u201d I was outside my home in Berlin in my car. I had just loaded it up and strapped the kids into their seats when my manager called. It was 11 March. The day before, I had completed a tour of Germany, performing 14 concerts in 10 days. The first news about Covid-19 was starting to seep through, but the concert halls were still open and, as a violinist and music director of the Zurich Chamber Orchestra, I had been playing for 2,000 people every night.</p> <p>At the signing sessions afterwards, the promoters had put up large signs requesting that the audience keep their distance and refrain from selfies (which they didn\u2019t). Next up, I was due to perform at a festival on the beautiful island of R\u00fcgen in the Baltic Sea. Artists were flying in from all around the world, and I had decided to take the family along. Everything was looking fine, when suddenly the bubble burst. As my manager was calling to explain, local authorities on R\u00fcgen had announced that all events were to be cancelled with immediate effect.

An hour later he was standing in my living room, taking measurements. \u201cI think we can make it work,\u201d he chirped. Next I called Wolfgang Bergmann, the head of the German section of Arte, a magnificent Franco-German television channel that lives and breathes culture as a public broadcaster. He and I had discussed many broadcasting ideas in the past. Would I be interested in a livestream? he asked. \u201cOnly if it is with top-notch sound,\u201d I replied. \u201cCan you start tomorrow?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>I told him he was mad, and he said yes, but that I was even madder. He sent over two creative directors who within hours built a set in my living room, brought in beautiful art nouveau lighting to match the existing decor, and worked out how to turn our idea into reality. At this point we were still allowed to move freely and the production company still had permission to film, so long as we all kept at least 1.5m apart.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I could never have imagined in my wildest dreams that such an eclectic bevy of artists would pass through my Berlin salon</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We set up two unmanned cameras in addition to the cameraman in the room, thereby limiting how many people were actually in the space at a given time.

With a little remote instruction I was able to move the microphones around myself. I call it DIY television.</p> <p>What I needed next was a brilliant pianist who was also an arranger and at the same time able to improvise. Christoph Israel, whom I\u2019ve known for years, fitted the bill perfectly. He had just written the music for an <a href=\"https://www.visitberlin.de/en/event/murder-orient-express\">Agatha Christie production</a>, which had also been cancelled, so he was sitting at home like everyone else, staring at the ceiling.

Many have offered to make donations to charities helping freelance musicians \u2013 I made a feature of this early on and encouraged viewers to help artists affected by the current shutdown.</p> <p>Until now, I had spent the vast majority of my time on the road in order to communicate with my audience, while using the internet to stay in touch with my family. Now the tables have turned: in these six weeks I\u2019ve been spending time at home, and in the evening, I merely pop downstairs to share my music with a global audience.</p> <p>As the shutdown continued, Arte extended the show three times. Now, as we approach 34 episodes, five \u201cbest ofs\u201d and a TV special, I\u2019ve decided, with a somewhat heavy heart, to close this lockdown chapter. It\u2019s been a privilege and a thrill. I\u2019ve not felt this artistically free in years, but for now, we need our living room back. So I guess I\u2019ll work on that beard, and take my boys to the park.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/RC-019356/hope-home/\">Hope@Home</a> streams live at 5pm BST/6pm CET on <a href=\"https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/097148-015-A/hope-home/\">Arte</a> (and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ARTEConcertDE/live_videos/\">via </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ARTEConcertDE/live_videos/\">Facebook live</a>) and is available on demand for 90 days after broadcast.

  "<p>In times of fear, rules go out of the window and the default position is often one of force. A recent doorstep tribute in a Johannesburg suburb to applaud the efforts of essential workers was dubbed an \u201cillegal gathering\u201d by police summoned to break up the event. A resident remarked that it was an eerie reminder of South Africa\u2019s past \u2013 a throwback to the times of apartheid.</p> <p>\u201cThe rules keep changing,\u201d admitted one officer when it was suggested that the response was heavy-handed. No harm was done but the incident highlights the potential shifts in power dynamics that fear brings, as well as the disconnect between good intentions and how they are implemented.</p> <p>In unprecedented times Covid-19 remains an unknown adversary, with the African continent left to second guess its trajectory. So far it has not matched the terrifying numbers in China, North America and Europe, but it is early days.</p> <p>History shows how power thrives on confusion, and trade-offs between freedoms and security. These need to be constantly recalibrated \u2013 and science and politics need to work together. Leaders of 300 African civil society organisations are among 600 globally to have penned an <a href=\"https://www.civicus.org/index.php/media-resources/news/4379-civil-society-s-call-to-states-we-are-in-this-together-don-t-violate-human-rights-while-responding-to-covid-19\">open letter</a> to heads of state urging adherence to the rule of law, warning that all responses should be evidence-based, \u201ctime-bound and proportionate\u201d.</p> <p>In many ways lockdowns echo previous state crackdowns in the wake of terror attacks on the African continent. In Kenya and Uganda, emergency measures in response to violent attacks have amplified excesses of the security services. Covid-19 would appear to be no different; there are reports of killings by security services enforcing lockdowns in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. Like the terrorist threats, will the legacy of Covid-19 shape how countries are governed?</p> <p>Although \u2013 in a rare break with tradition \u2013 Kenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta apologised for overzealous policing, now more than ever the need for tough executive oversight is clear.</p> <p>In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa has blended economic pragmatism with compassion, with a 500bn rand (\u00a322bn) rescue package to support businesses and the vulnerable. His tough lockdown measures received international praise. Yet Ramaphosa\u2019s response has arguably been soured by the revelation that <a href=\"https://www.thedefensepost.com/2020/04/22/south-africa-deploy-73000-troops-covid-19-lockdown/\">73,000</a><a href=\"https://www.thedefensepost.com/2020/04/22/south-africa-deploy-73000-troops-covid-19-lockdown/\"> South African troops</a> \u2013 virtually the entire national defence force \u2013 are to be deployed until the end of June.</p> <p>Military deployment should be a last resort, not a useful governance tool. Soldiers have been used to help build hospitals, distribute food and provide engineering assistance in countries such as the UK and Spain; in South Africa their role appears to be as enforcer. While the South African National Defence Force has a proud history of peacekeeping across the continent, its troops do not belong in the streets or crowded informal settlements. What would be their response to a rowdy food distribution for instance \u2013 restraint or firepower?</p> <p>Monitoring state excesses would traditionally be a job for the media. Journalists in South Africa have been afforded \u201cessential worker\u201d status, but in recent weeks have found themselves under fire. A camerawoman was <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/police-clash-with-joburg-residents-news24-reporter-caught-in-crossfire-20200327\">shot at</a> by police as she tried to capture footage of the lockdown. In Zimbabwe, a court earlier this month derided the police for using Covid-19 as a pretext for media harassment.</p> <p>Many African countries have demonstrated an admirable ability to leverage tech to assist in the Covid-19 response. Examples include bluetooth platforms used for contact tracing in Nigeria, WhatsApp live chats for providing health information in South Africa, and mobile money solutions for welfare payouts in Kenya and Mauritius.</p> <p>South Africa, with its long tradition of human rights struggles, has stopped short of copying South Korea\u2019s introduction of wristbands to track citizens evading lockdown. But in the northern province of Limpopo, the <a href=\"https://dronedj.com/2020/04/13/ai-tagged-drone-footage-of-south-african-lockdown-previews-future-of-technology/\">use of drones</a> by the police as a means of social control has almost gone unnoticed. Surveillance by stealth is a threat to be closely watched.</p> <p>While the assumption is that suspensions of our liberty are bonded with a sunset clause, the danger of \u201cfunction creep\u201d \u2013 where the application of a piece of technology is not as originally intended \u2013 is real. Not least in evolving democracies where oversight institutions are weak.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/01/extreme-coronavirus-lockdown-controls-raise-fears-for-worlds-poorest\">Teargas, beatings and bleach: the most extreme Covid-19 lockdown controls around the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not wishing to undermine the clear benefits of emerging tech, function creep poses a risk to citizen rights given the fetishisation of, and uncritical reliance on, technology.</p> <p>Imagine if surveillance deployed to track Covid-19 was applied to migrants, alleged terrorists or the LGBT community, branded as undesirables by Uganda? We need to have a \u201ckill switch\u201d so that such technologies are not misused after the pandemic. At the very least we need to start the conversation. It is well documented how technologies developed as defensive tools by the military continue to find broader applications \u2013 not all sinister.</p> <p>And what of the vast troves of personal data that the monitoring of Covid-19 has collected? Will this have a shelf life? While the right not to be seen is protected in tightened-up data privacy laws, a global pandemic trumps such conventions. While many concede that extreme measures are required in the face of the spectre of mass infection in the poorest parts of Africa, will privacy overrides be reversed when this pandemic has passed?</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Karen Allen is a consultant to the Institute for Security Studies and a former BBC Africa correspondent.

In Tripoli, we\u2019re all from the low socio-economic classes these days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs much as we can give is not enough,\u201d she said as small crowds waited silently outside her office for food coupons. \u201cThe needs are so great that we sometimes feel we are not doing anything.

Nobody can send money. Even if you can send, it\u2019s not easy to collect it. People are literally starving.\u201d</p> <p>Her NGO provides up to 5,000 people each day with basic sustenance, just as she has since the start of the October revolution. It was easier then, she says, as food was readily sourced, as were donations.</p> <p>But in the last month, the Lebanese currency \u2013 pegged to the US dollar since the end of the civil war 30 years ago \u2013 has collapsed. On Friday, it was trading at 4,000 lira to $1, after drifting steadily from its official rate of 1,500 lira.</p> <p>An economic package announced by the prime minister, Hassan Diab, on Thursday night fixed a new rate of 3,500 lira for the next 18 months, a move that would formalise at least a 50% price hike for nearly all goods and services, and set in stone prices that many Lebanese have no means to afford.</p> <p>Lebanon is a consumption economy that imports nearly everything and does not produce enough basic food supplies to sustain its population. The increased cost of imports has been quickly passed on. A freeze on many salaries, controls on bank withdrawals and slashed spending on social services, have also ravaged household incomes.</p> <p>The Lebanese government estimates that 75% of the population are now in need of aid, including food aid. Among refugee communities, the need for food aid rises to 90%, according to the International Rescue Committee.</p> <p>\u201cLebanon never had a productive economic model,\u201d said Albert Leteyf, a partner at one of the country\u2019s leading financial consultancies, Levantine Partners. \u201cIts exports were its people, who sent money to their families. But that was never enough to fill the gap in the trade imbalance.</p> <p>\u201cThe [dollar] peg gave the Lebanese a sense of artificial wealth.

  "<p>Chinese ventilators that ministers heralded as vital to the NHS\u2019s efforts to tackle Covid-19 were badly built, unsuitable for use in hospitals and potentially dangerous for patients, it has emerged.</p> <p>All of the devices in a consignment of 250 ventilators that arrived from China on 4 April posed such serious problems that they could not be used and were ditched.</p> <p>Doctors in NHS hospitals in the West Midlands, among which the ventilators were shared, were so concerned that they wrote to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, warning that they could kill patients.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that if used, significant patient harm, including death, is likely,\u201d they wrote in a letter, which was obtained by NBC News. \u201cWe look forward to the withdrawal and replacement of these ventilators with devices better able to provide intensive care ventilation for our patients.\u201d</p> <p>The medics warned the Department of Health and Social Care that the oxygen supply in the devices was \u201cvariable and unreliable\u201d, their build quality was \u201cbasic\u201d, the oxygen connection base was marked as \u201cnon-EU\u201d and their fabric case made them hard to clean.</p> <p>The machines were Shangrila 510 ventilators made by Beijing Aeonmed, a major manufacturer of ventilators in China. They were designed for use in ambulances not hospitals, the doctors said.</p> <p>The day they arrived, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister who is helping to co-ordinate the government\u2019s response to the pandemic, thanked China for sending them.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been buying invasive ventilators from partners abroad, including Germany and Switzerland, and today 300 new ventilators arrived from China. I\u2019d like to thank the Chinese government,\u201d he said at the government\u2019s daily news conference, in comments that were widely reported.</p> <p>However, hospitals that then received the devices could not get them to work, despite technical staff spending several days trying to do so. A senior official at one of the hospitals involved said: \u201cAll of the ventilators failed. Nothing worked. They didn\u2019t have proper oxygen centres and the tubing didn\u2019t fit. We were irate. All the hospitals tried to get them to work but we couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cAt the time we were really worried, because we feared that hospitals were going to be overwhelmed with patients with Covid-19 needing to be ventilated. Happily, as it turned out we didn\u2019t get quite as many as originally expected so we didn\u2019t need the Chinese ventilators after all, which is just as well.\u201d</p> <p>The ventilators were part of a government drive to increase the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/05/ventilator-crisis-lands-britains-manufacturers-with-greatest-test\">NHS\u2019s supply of ventilators</a> from the 8,000 it had before the virus struck, to 30,000, so that anyone needing one during the expected peak of the pandemic could have one while in intensive care.

  "<p>Last year, I accomplished a major life goal. It wasn\u2019t buying a house, learning Greek or finishing my novel. No: I \u201ccompleted\u201d Seinfeld, having spent most of the summer watching every one of the sitcom\u2019s 169 \u2013 or 180, depending on how you count it \u2013 episodes, from pilot to finale.</p> <p>The sitcom, co-created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, which chronicled the life of rising comedian Jerry and his friends George, Elaine and Kramer, ran from 1989 to 1998, and is available to stream in the UK on All 4. Last September, Netflix acquired it in a reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/04/from-louis-ck-to-jerry-seinfeld-netflixs-comedy-boom-is-about-to-go-bust\">$500m (\u00a3400m)-plus deal and it will join the streaming service\u2019s library next year</a>.</p> <p>Although 2019 wasn\u2019t anywhere near approaching the doom-laden, apocalyptic hell-storm that 2020 is shaping up to be, it was nevertheless no Sunday picnic, and thus a retreat to the relative calm of the Seinfeld era \u2013 the late 80s to mid-90s \u2013 was welcome therapy. This is perhaps why, in the midst of a global pandemic, I have returned to Seinfeld. I\u2019m now making my way through the best 25 episodes, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2015/06/every-seinfeld-episode-ranked.html\">according to this list</a>.</p> <p>There\u2019s a tendency to idealise this pre-internet era. I was born in 1987, so I was two when Seinfeld first went on the air. The 90s are now being mined by younger generations and the decade has been having a fashion moment for a while now, with many women dressing in long floral dresses that resemble Elaine\u2019s and men in Kramer\u2019s hipster patterned shirts.</p> <p>As an older millennial, I have actual memories of the 90s, and so returning to that era has a comforting familiarity to it, from the clothes to the decor to the cultural references. Being part of that \u201cbridge\u201d generation, which experienced life before and after the widespread use of the internet, Seinfeld offers a glimpse of the kind of adult life we just missed out on, where dating politics revolved around the telephone and people were always getting ready to go out to the movies.</p> <p>In reality, I know that 1990s New York was far from wholesome. And yet there is something quite gentle about an entire sitcom episode based around trying to get a parking space (these days, you\u2019d use an app for that) or a controversial loaf of rye bread. It\u2019s a common misconception that Seinfeld is \u201ca show about nothing\u201d (this, in fact, is the pitch for Jerry and George\u2019s failed TV sitcom-within-a-sitcom, a recurring meta-subplot throughout the series). Its original aim was to show the everyday events behind a comedian\u2019s material. It is this hilarious focus on the seemingly mundane aspects of everyday life that makes Seinfeld a work of comedic genius.</p> <p>This is why George\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ria37d9mInY\">answering machine theme tune</a> reduced me to tears of laughter recently. It\u2019s easy to forget that, long before teenagers were making their own TikToks, people who were supposed to be fully grown adults were devising their own ridiculous, themed answerphone recordings. It\u2019s a phenomenon that, like choosing a film at the video rental store (also a mainstay of Seinfeld), is now obsolete. In 2020, it would be much more difficult to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8KUgUqprw\">masquerade as a marine biologist</a> or to escape being broken up with by avoiding answering phone calls from your girlfriend, or to persuade your friend that the working title of War and Peace was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqS1Ty79mOE\">\u201cWar, What Is It Good For?\u201d</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Friends has the reputation of being the ultimate comedy comfort watch, but the best bits were inspired by Seinfeld</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Living in what has been termed by some as a \u201ccancel culture\u201d is also a factor in the comforting nature of Seinfeld. Larry David may have recently come out in defence of Woody Allen, but I\u2019m not about to stop watching the show. The characters are so amoral that there\u2019s a sort of freedom to how they are so unfettered in their ability to be their terribly behaved, authentic dirtbag selves without being held to such high moral standards. That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t aspects of Seinfeld that haven\u2019t dated in terms of attitudes and prejudices, but much of it has aged remarkably well. It\u2019s intelligent, too: I know of no other sitcom that would devote so much comedic attention to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0YUjOTugOc\">works of John Cheever</a>, for instance, or have a recurring joke about a fictional arthouse film (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kgpVUE9RpQ\">Rochelle, Rochelle: A young girl\u2019s strange, erotic journey from Milan to Minsk</a>.)</p> <p>Like much of 90s television, Seinfeld takes place in a world before mass-surveillance capitalism. It is notably lacking in consumerism, and by the time Friends hit TV screens, a notable shift had taken place. Friends has the reputation of being the ultimate nostalgic comedy comfort watch, but all of the best bits were taken from or inspired by Seinfeld, just with \u201cbetter looking people\u201d and added hugging and learning (memorably banned on Seinfeld).</p> <p>Whether you have retreated into Seinfeld or are streaming other 90s TV series such as This Life, Frasier, Dawson\u2019s Creek, Ally McBeal or My So-Called Life, there are worse places to be than the 1990s. Namely, the present. Not to mention the fact that Jerry\u2019s germaphobia looks a lot more rational these days. In fact, you could say that we\u2019re all Jerry now.</p>",

But by all means get close and marvel at how great they are, look at their eyelids, ear holes, forked tongue, and then leave them where you found them.\u201d Leaving out covers such as old rugs or corrugated iron in a sunny spot can encourage them into the garden, he says.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Keeffe recommends a bit of messiness in the garden to create a more holistic ecosystem: not mowing areas of lawn, leaving piles of logs and leaves, and ensuring gaps under fences to allow hedgehogs and other animals in and out.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe often have a stall at local events and I remember one lady being delighted, saying \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve been feeling guilty about the wild patch at the bottom of my garden \u2026 now I\u2019m going to call it my wildlife area.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>In normal times the ecology centre welcomes 7,000 schoolchildren a year.

Activities like building a stick den, picking up a snail \u2013 it helps them to not be scared to get their hands dirty. We try to turn their fear into fascination.\u201d</p> \n<p>An understanding of natural processes isn\u2019t always better among local adults, according to Warburton, especially in urban areas. He describes the reaction of the public when his team introduced native cattle to the Roundshaw Downs in 2012, a rare chalk grassland three miles south-east, on the site of London\u2019s first international airport in Croydon. They used castrated male Sussex cattle, which are naturally hornless and very placid. \u201cWell, you\u2019d think we\u2019d released lions. Some people were apoplectic. I had to say: \u2018This is not Jurassic Park we are creating!\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>He wonders if the current crisis might bring about a shift in people\u2019s interest in their local wildlife, including the mysterious slow worm. \u201cHopefully they might realise you don\u2019t have to go to a national park to see cool and interesting species.

  "<p>San Francisco has assembled an army of librarians, social workers, attorneys, investigators and medical students to find and warn anyone and everyone who may have been exposed to Covid-19.</p> <p>Large-scale tracing efforts have been proven to work in other countries, including South Korea and Germany, and are considered crucial to get the United States economy back on track. But tracing efforts in<strong> </strong>a nation as large and diverse as the US come with unique challenges, and California, the country\u2019s most populous state, is one of the first to start to take those challenges on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nursing-homes-california-coronavirus-outbreak-us\">'My mom's life was disposable': inside the California nursing homes unable to contain Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To set up an effective contact tracing program, California will have to increase its health department staff five or 10-fold, experts told the Guardian. The state is eventually planning to recruit 10,000 tracers, according to Gavin Newsom, the state\u2019s governor \u2013 and test up to 80,000 people each day, relying on paid health workers and volunteers. But some municipalities are ahead of their curve, and are already beginning to recruit and train tracers.</p> <p>Putting in place a system for tracing and tracking the contacts of people who have tested positive is a \u201cis an absolute essential pillar we need to build up and put in place before we even think about reopening the country\u201d, said Susie Welty, a global health expert at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), who is helping build the contact tracing program in the city.</p> <p>Despite its techie reputation, San Francisco has so far eschewed smartphone tracking and contact tracing apps in favor of old-fashioned phone calls. Experts from UCSF have recruited more than 100 city workers who cannot do their regular jobs under the current shelter-in-place rules, taught them healthcare privacy laws, and coached them on how to call Covid-19 patients, assess their needs and ask them about any recent interactions with family, friends and neighbors.</p> <p>Without revealing the infected person\u2019s identity, trackers call everyone they may have interacted with and ask them to self-quarantine for 14 days. \u201cWe know this is really stressful and onerous to the people we call,\u201d said Dr Mike Reid, an assistant professor in infectious disease at UCSF who is leading the city\u2019s contact tracing efforts.</p> <p>Tracers help connect sick or exposed people to any healthcare services they may need, offer to have the city deliver them food and medicine while they\u2019re in quarantine, and offer them a hotel room if they are unhoused or unable to isolate from family members at home. Right now, the city has the capacity to offer tests to everyone with symptoms, Reid said \u2013 but ideally, medical centers will also be able to test everyone who may have been exposed to the virus, regardless of whether they look sick.</p> <p>\u201cLook, we\u2019re just getting started here. This is early, early days,\u201d Reid said. \u201cBut the idea is we\u2019ll slowly build up our capacity to trace and test so that we\u2019re prepared for when everything opens back up.\u201d</p> <p>With stringent distancing measures in place, the job has been relatively manageable, Reid said. The average San Franciscan has only three or four contacts \u2013 and they\u2019re usually family members.

The state has a shaky record, failing to protect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/san-francisco-coronavirus-homeless-shelter\">unhoused</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/california-bail-jails-coronavirus-criminal-justice\">incarcerated</a> populations throughout the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThe systematic biases in our society leave Latino workers most vulnerable to the coronavirus,\u201d said David Hayes-Bautista, a professor of public health and medicine at UCLA. \u201cAnd these are the people who are going to be hardest to contact trace.\u201d</p> <p>Immigrant communities are justifiably worried that each time they share information about their status and location, \u201cit will come back to haunt them,\u201d Hayes-Bautista said. \u201cIt makes sense that people are scared.\u201d</p> <p>Local governments can make sure people feel safe and protected by deputizing local non-profits and indigenous and immigrant rights advocacy groups to help in the tracing efforts, he said.</p> <p>In rural Madera county, where the local officials have deputized sheriffs in plainclothes to contact trace from the very beginning of the outbreak in early March, officials have taken care to avoid asking anyone about their immigration status and reassuring residents that their health information will remain confidential, said Sara Bosse, the county\u2019s public health director. In the farming community, where more than 50% of residents identify as Hispanic or Latino, the city has also partnered with community health organizations to reach unhoused and other vulnerable populations.</p> <p>San Francisco has similarly <a href=\"https://sfmayor.org/article/san-francisco-launches-innovative-contact-tracing-program-strengthen-coronavirus-response\">publicized</a> that the contact tracing is \u201cvoluntary, confidential, and culturally and linguistically appropriate. Immigration status will have no bearing on these conversations.\u201d</p> <p>Nationally, the US still has a long way to go before contact tracing can become a reliable part of the strategy to reopen. \u201cThe existing public health system is currently capable of providing only a fraction of the contact tracing and voluntary self-isolation capacity required to meet the Covid-19 challenge,\u201d a prominent group of public health officials wrote Monday in letter to House and Senate leaders, noting that lawmakers would need to allocate an additional $46bn to tracing and isolation efforts.</p> <p>Nationally, at least 100,000 contact tracers will be needed to see after Americans who have fallen ill, or have been exposed, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Others estimate that a workforce of 180,000 to 300,000 will be required.</p> <p>Dr Joia Mukherjee, the chief medical officer at Partners in Health in Massachusetts, who is leading the nation\u2019s first statewide contact tracing effort there, said she\u2019s found that calling and educating everyone who may have been exposed to the coronavirus is especially important right now, in the US.</p> <p>Mukherjee, who has worked to fight outbreaks and pandemics around the world, pointed at anti-lockdown protests and misinformation swirling online. \u201cProven scientific fact about an infectious disease was completely shunned and mocked by the president,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we need to make sure people have the information they need to stay safe.\u201d</p>",

A young Dutch author perfectly delineates the life of a farm community in all its strange variations. </p> <p><strong>The book that changed my life<br></strong>James Joyce\u2019s <em>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>. The setting was fairly familiar but the thrall of the language and the intensity of feeling gave a whole new meaning to life and introduced me to the alchemy and mystery of creativity.</p> <p><strong>The book I wish I\u2019d written<br></strong>Any story by Anton Chekhov. The first Chekhov story I ever read was \u2018The Steppe\u2019. Books we most need come to us in a time of extremity. I read several pages of it in a cornfield in Ireland. My two sons were frisking about, my husband was silent and we had stopped to have tea from a flask, having just had a bitter parting from my family. I was on the point of leaving my husband but feared I would not have the courage or the means. Chekhov\u2019s story was that of a young boy being brought to a distant part of Russia to boarding school and though he was missing his mother, he was also observing everything around him and listening to the merchants\u2019 droll conversations. He submerged his grief in the wonders all about him. What was uncanny for me was how convincing and immediate the story felt. I still have that edition with an inscription I wrote on the flyleaf, \u201cThis story redeemed my sanity.\u201d It was dated September 1962.</p> <p><strong>The book that influenced me<br> </strong><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/aug/31/fromthearchives.ernesthemingway\">A Farewell to Arms</a></em> by Ernest Hemingway. He is a master of compression.</p> <p><strong>The book I think is most underrated<br></strong>The works of Rachel Carson.

  "<p>Ten years ago I did three months of self-isolation. I wasn\u2019t well, had had a terrible breakdown and could barely leave the house. Company was overwhelming, work impossible. So I sat and figured out a new way to live.</p> <p>The episode was excruciating, but much good came out of it. Crisis is opportunity. We learn from mistakes. Failure enables us to succeed better. All the old cliches, of course, but the reason cliches are cliches is that they are often true.</p> <p>I was able to gradually restore bits of my life and see if they were good for me. Work, yes.

As a cash-in-hand builder, he is not eligible to claim unemployment insurance, and the stimulus cheque still had not arrived.</p> <p>\u201cI always pay my bills on time, but without work, I just didn\u2019t have the money to cover everything, so I asked for an extension. They said no,\u201d Haynes said.</p> <p>Haynes, who lives with his wife and three children, managed to get the money just six days after the bill was due, but the city refused to accept the payment unless he also paid a $70 reconnection charge. He didn\u2019t have it, and the charge didn\u2019t make sense as they had not been disconnected.

  "<p>When Europeans settlers first set their eyes upon North America\u2019s Great Plains, vast seas of bison stretched as far as the horizon. But, more than a century ago, the last of the thundering herds that stampeded across the grasslands disappeared.</p> <p>But the birth of a wild bison calf has renewed hopes that rebuilding sustainable herds is now a step closer. On 22 April, a herd in Wanuskewin heritage park, an Indigenous-run conservation area in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, grew by one member \u2014 the first time a calf had been born on the territory since 1876.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35dffd9665577ea549abd3f84c94f13ca1f061dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35dffd9665577ea549abd3f84c94f13ca1f061dc/0_135_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"profile of a bison calf's head\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A close up of the new arrival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wanuskewin Heritage Park</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hailing the new arrival as \u201chistoric\u201d, Wanuskewin\u2019s chief executive said the birth was a step in the right direction. \u201cWe feel humbled and blessed for the arrival the baby bison and for the herd that\u2019s with it,\u201d said Darlene Brander.</p> <p>Brander said that after consultation with a council of elders, the decision was made to not name the calf.</p> <p>\u201cThe elders told us that because bison are the brothers and sisters of many Indigenous peoples across the land, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to give the newborn a name,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve really been making effort to get guidance from elders on this, because their knowledge is critical to maintaining our traditions.\u201d</p> <p>The fluffy orange calf is just the first step in a far more ambitious strategy to repopulate the sweeping landscapes.</p> <p>Bison numbers across the continent collapsed in the late 1800s \u2014 largely the result of overhunting by settlers, as well as disease and habitat degradation. Populations dropped from nearly 60 million to fewer than 600. Indigenous communities, which had long relied on plentiful bison populations, were left without a valuable source of food.</p> <p>\u201cOur societies revolved around the bison \u2014 every single bit of it was used and consumed,\u201d said Brander. \u201cThe near-extinction had a huge impact.\u201d</p> <p>At the turn of the century, a handful of ranchers began breeding bison with cattle to create the \u201ccattle-o\u201d hybrid, hoping they would be better suited to the cold climate.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea was a reasonable one. But it really didn\u2019t work very well,\u201d says Dr Gregg Adams, head of the bison project at the University of Saskatchewan\u2019s Western College of Veterinary Medicine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/12/how-native-american-tribes-are-bringing-back-the-bison-from-brink-of-extinction\">How Native American tribes are bringing back the bison from brink of extinction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These hybrid animals now make up the vast majority of North American bison and only two herds \u2014in Yellowstone national park in the United States and Elk Island, Alberta, Canada \u2014 are genetically pure.</p> <p>In Canada, only 1,500 wild, genetically pure bison survive\u2014 all descended from roughly 50 individuals that weren\u2019t crossbred in the 1900s.

Such efforts are still threatened by the spectre of disease, but pioneering research at the University of Saskatchewan holds promise for overcoming such challenges.</p> <p>\u201cWe can literally wash the gametes \u2014 the semen and embryo \u2014 free of diseases, cryopreserve them and then bring them out of the park and use their genetics on other conservation herds,\u201d said Adams.</p> <p>Even when a hybrid female is inseminated with purebred embryos, the result is a purebred calf. However, herds numbering in the thousands are unlikely to ever return.</p> <p>\u201cWe know now that there are too many roads, too many fences, too many borders, across the Great Plains. We\u2019re never going to have these massive wandering herds of bison again,\u201d said Adams.</p> <p>But some degree of repopulation will be possible \u2013 and will have immense benefits for the land.</p> <p>\u201cThere are numerous studies that show the impact bison recovery has for an ecosystem\u2014 all the way down to dung beetles, bird species, prairie dogs and carnivores,\u201d said Adams. \u201cBison affect the entire ecosystem from microbes to insects to mammals and humans.\u201d</p> <p>Wanuskewin \u2013 a historic bison hunting ground for numerous Indigenous groups, including the Cree, Assiniboine and Blackfoot people \u2013 received its first herd of plains bison in December as part of the repopulation effort.

Some tears shed, including my own. People just felt it in their hearts and souls,\u201d said Brander. \u201cTo hear the sound of hooves thundering across the prairies, accompanied by the drums that were part of the ceremonial protocols, it was so powerful.

Professional beekeepers bring in honey bee queens to replenish their hives every few years.</p> <p>Another way in which commercial beekeeping could be contributing to the spread of the disease is because they tend to manage large colonies, and the virus appears to be rapidly transmitted in densely populated hives.</p> <p>But Budge said it was not clear that the disease was imported via queens and it was \u201cunfair\u201d to claim the disease was caused by industrial beekeeping.</p> <p>\u201cThe bee farmers of this country tend to be quite small-scale. A standard bee farmer might have 100 to 200 colonies. In the States, they have up to 10,000. Even in Germany there will be huge-scale beekeeping going on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>According to Budge, professional beekeepers may run into problems in Britain because they are very successful at bringing bees through the winter and building up colonies in spring to take advantage of early flowers such as oilseed rape. If the weather then turns wet, these large colonies are then confined to a hive. \u201cYou can\u2019t do social distancing in a hive as easily but you can manage it by increasing the space in there,\u201d said Budge.</p> <p>The viral disease has been around for centuries \u2013 its symptoms were first described by Aristotle \u2013 but researchers are keen to discover if a new, more virulent strain is behind its global surge. In the United States, CBPV prevalence was 0.7% in 2010 but reached 16% in 2014. Prevalence doubled in Italy from 5% to 10% between 2009 and 2010. In China, prevalence has grown from 9% to 38%.</p> <p>Infected adult bees carry the virus for up to six days without showing symptoms, and may spread it to other colonies at sites where different bees forage for food.</p> <p>But honey bees typically do not forage further than 10km in Britain, and the study found significant clusters of the disease up to 40km apart. A quarter of beekeepers have multiple sites, so could be assisting the spread of the disease.</p> <p>Although the disease appears to \u201cburn out\u201d in Britain and does not recur in hotspots between seasons, it returns to the country in other locations over time. The disease has also been found in wild bumblebee and ant populations, but the direction of transmission is not clear.</p> <p>Rob Nickless, chairman of the <a href=\"https://beefarmers.co.uk/\">Bee Farmers\u2019 Association</a>, which supported the study, said: \u201cThis is the sort of research that brings practical benefits to the industry \u2013 helping bee farmers at grassroots level to improve honey bee health and increase UK honey production.\u201d</p> <p>Researchers will continue to examine the genetics of the disease to determine if there is a new strain and seek to discover whether imported queens are bringing the disease into Britain, or whether those queens are simply more susceptible to the virus that is already here.</p>",
  "<p>The Apex was nearly finished. A brand new cruise ship for the Celebrity Cruises line, it was a towering, 117,000-ton vessel with luxuries like a \u201cresort deck\u201d featuring martini-glass-shaped jacuzzis and a movable platform cantilevered off the side \u2013 known as \u201cthe Magic Carpet\u201d \u2013 to be used as an outdoor restaurant. As the builders put the finishing touches to it, the company held parties for crew and contractors, even as the rest of the world was shutting down to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Alexandra Nedeltcheva was one of the waiters. Though she avoided the parties, she served the contractors and crew at one of the ship\u2019s restaurants. She says she contracted Covid-19 before the Apex even left port.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really scary, you don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to last,\u201d says a coughing Nedeltcheva.

In the course of the Guardian\u2019s investigation, however, a portrait has begun to emerge of what is effectively a nation of floating castaways, marooned on boats from the Galapagos Islands to the port of Dubai.</p> \n<p>The first cruise ship to face Covid-19 cases, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/06/inside-the-cruise-ship-that-became-a-coronavirus-breeding-ground-diamond-princess\">Diamond Princess</a>, was quarantined at dock in Japan for two weeks starting on 3 February. But cruises kept departing until mid-March. Although most passengers have since been repatriated, Covid-19 outbreaks continue to spread among the crew stuck on the ships. Last week employees aboard the Queen Victoria, which had just pulled into Southampton, were told they would have to quarantine in their cabins for 14 days because Covid-19 cases had been confirmed aboard, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/leaked-audio-cunard-cruises-queen-victoria-has-cases-of-covid-19-2020-4?r=US&amp;IR=T\">according to a recording</a> of the captain\u2019s announcement obtained by Business Insider.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13bc6b2b35e6d8a9a38c5029b961e5b1e6e5295a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13bc6b2b35e6d8a9a38c5029b961e5b1e6e5295a/0_0_3902_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers in protective gear prepare to check passengers after they disembarked the Diamond Princess cruise ship at the Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama, Japan, 21 February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Diamond Princess was quarantined for two weeks in Japan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jiji Press/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the US the situation was so grim aboard the Oasis of the Seas, from which rescue crews have repeatedly evacuated sick workers to hospitals in Florida, that the captain made an announcement over the loudspeaker asking crew members not to video their co-workers being taken off the ship in ambulances, according to an account from an employee <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article241922051.html\">given to the Miami Herald</a>.</p> \n<p>Another member of the class-action suit against Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, is Julia Melim, a US resident who hosted the Celebrity Infinity\u2019s shopping and port-tourism show on the shipboard TV channel. Melim was one of only seven crew members allowed to leave the ship in Miami last week. The rest remain aboard. She says there was so much sickness that the ship\u2019s medical personnel cleared out the whole third floor to isolate and treat people who had symptoms.</p> \n<p>The cruise industry says cruise lines were just as blindsided by the pandemic as the rest of the world and that those on ships haven\u2019t suffered higher infection rates than those on land.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Celebrity Cruises said: \u201cWe have no higher priority than keeping our guests and crew safe, healthy, cared for and well-informed. We have at all times worked in close coordination with government and health authorities and are grateful for their guidance. We are working with all appropriate authorities to ensure the safe return home of all our crew members.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Cruise Line Industry Association says it is still assembling information on how many of its ships have been affected, but says it so far knows of 899 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board 15 ocean-going cruise ships.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis accounts for 0.06% of confirmed cases globally,\u201d said the association in a statement. \u201cIt is hard to tell how many of those confirmed cases are crew members, as we are still in the process of collecting that information as well.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2da79a3fa901f293204107e769208dd183f9a10f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2da79a3fa901f293204107e769208dd183f9a10f/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cruise ship Ruby Princess departs from Port Kembla, Australia, on 23 April 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cruise ship Ruby Princess had 900 cases of Covid-19 and is blamed for spreading the virus around Australia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Those numbers appear to grossly underestimate the problem, given that the Diamond Princess alone had more than 600 cases.

Because of the pandemic, however, the US and other ports are refusing to take all but the most dire cases.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are basically getting no healthcare,\u201d says Michael Winkleman, the attorney in Miami who filed the class-action suit. \u201cThey are locked in their rooms and told they can call an advice line for help. But when they call, no one comes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cruise lines have little recourse in seeking government help for urgent healthcare. While many of the major cruise companies, including Carnival and Royal Caribbean, are headquartered in the US, the companies are registered in low-tax countries. Carnival is technically a Panamanian company and Royal Caribbean is registered in Liberia, meaning they pay almost no US taxes.</p> \n<p>Likewise their ships are typically flagged in countries such as the Bahamas or Bermuda, which allows them to avoid strict safety standards, labour laws and environmental restrictions they might otherwise face in the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"aae21371-2edd-4aee-8af6-9a80a79d6943\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own.

As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating, we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships\u2019 operations.

That is a vicious circle because, as a gambling addict, you\u2019re out of control and reckless with your behaviour.

You can hide it quite well.\u201d</p> <p>Eight years ago Davies crashed into a car close to home because he was watching horse racing on his phone. \u201cI said: \u2018Sorry, I\u2019ve fallen asleep at the wheel, I play football, I\u2019ve had a double session today.\u2019 I looked and there was a kid sat in the car seat in the back and for the first time in my life I felt guilty about what I was doing. I thought: \u2018I\u2019m bringing other people\u2019s lives into danger.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t know how to stop, how to end this pain I was going through. I gave the driver \u00a3500 that I had stuffed away in my car \u2013 money I had won that day. I drove home and cried myself to sleep. That was a massive wake-up call.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I used to sleep in my car because I would rather put \u00a320 in a slot machine than buy petrol</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Davies began betting at 16, while earning \u00a350 a week at Reading, and sometimes walked four miles from his digs to training because he could not afford the \u00a31.20 bus fare. From there, his addiction spiralled from playing poker on the Aldershot team bus to haemorrhaging his \u00a330,000 signing-on fee at Crawley inside three weeks.</p> <p>\u201cThere were times when I used to sleep in my car after training because I couldn\u2019t afford to get home. I would rather put my last \u00a320 in a roulette machine, in the hope of turning it into a few hundred, than towards fuel to make sure I got home safe that night. Once after a game I slept at a service station and woke up in the freezing cold thinking: \u2018What has my life become?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2009 he impressed Brendan Rodgers during pre-season at Reading and was given his Championship debut aged 21. Davies was highly rated, but his addiction consumed him. \u201cI was sneaking out of training when players were doing extra and I got pulled into the manager\u2019s office and told to be more professional. I was always the last into training and the first out because I had a date every day and that was with the bookmakers; it was all I thought about.</p> <p>\u201cThe following day I got caught sneaking out of training again. When I got pulled into his office I told him I had a dentist appointment and that was the reason I had to shoot off. I knew deep down I was lying to him but I didn\u2019t want to show a sign of weakness and say: \u2018Listen, I\u2019m struggling with gambling addiction.\u2019 I never played another minute for Reading and that\u2019s one of the things I have to deal with every day now. If I think back to how I was doing, it hurts.\u201d</p> <p>Davies, who had spells at Oxford and Wycombe, now plays for Slough Town. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not so much about the money I\u2019ve lost,\u201d he says, \u201cbut probably about the career I should have had.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

  "<h2>Top story: Trump flouts intelligence with Wuhan claims</h2> \n<p>Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray with a round-up of the main headline news this Friday morning.</p> \n<p>Tensions have emerged in NHS England as it deals with how to redeploy BAME staff away from the virus frontline to safeguard their health. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">more than 2.5 times that of the white population</a>, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. It also found that deaths of people from a black Caribbean background were 1.7 times higher than for white Britons. One health official said it was \u201creally tricky \u2026 you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/30/stretched-hospitals-cannot-easily-redeploy-bame-staff-bosses-say\">have to make quite difficult decisions </a>about certain people being on the frontline [dealing with Covid patients] and not others. It\u2019s not like trusts are awash with staff they can start redeploying [to cover BAME colleagues], especially as they have already had to redeploy people to staff Covid wards.\u201d</p> \n<p>Donald Trump is accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/cia-pushes-back-at-trump-efforts-to-link-coronavirus-to-chinese-laboratories\">putting US intelligence agencies under pressure</a> to suggest the virus came from a state-run laboratory in China. The president was asked a few hours ago whether he had seen anything that gives you a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d to that effect, and replied: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d But the office of the director of national intelligence (DNI) had only just gotten through saying that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim\">intelligence community does not believe coronavirus was manmade or genetically modified</a>, though it would examine any \u201cemerging information and intelligence\u201d about whether it came from animals or a laboratory accident. A whistleblower complaint by a US scientist who was abruptly removed from heading the search for a vaccine may add to evidence that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/trump-whistleblower-coronavirus-drug-complaint-rick-bright-hydroxychloroquine-pressure\">Donald Trump is leaning on government agencies</a> to back his claims about the merits of unproven treatments.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>1 million people have recovered</strong></h2> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a> data, more than a million people have now recovered from coronavirus infection, with the total currently at 1,014,524.Infections worldwide stand at 3,256,570. More than 233,300 people have died in the pandemic so far.</p> <h2><strong>US jobless toll amounts to 18.4% of working-age population</strong></h2> <p>The White House let its two-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all US states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. Thirty million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since 21 March.</p> <h2><strong>Trump claims he has seen evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab</strong></h2> <p>When the president was asked if he has seen anything that gives you a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, US President Donald Trump replied: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d His own government experts say the virus was \u2018not manmade or genetically modified\u2019. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/cia-pushes-back-at-trump-efforts-to-link-coronavirus-to-chinese-laboratories\">US intelligence agencies have been under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs</a>. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, later said of the lab theory: \u201cWhat we have before us doesn\u2019t suggest that is a likely source\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Protestors, some armed, gather inside Michigan state capitol</strong></h2> <p>Hundreds of protesters, some armed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">gathered inside Michigan\u2019s state capitol on Thursday</a> as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governor\u2019s request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus. Some of the protesters shouted anti-government slogans, including comparing the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, to Hitler. \u201cSome of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them,\u201d the state senator Dayna Polehanki wrote on Twitter.</p> <h2><strong>Major US airlines will require passengers to cover their faces during flights</strong></h2> <p>American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines said Thursday they will soon require passengers to cover their faces during flights, following the lead of JetBlue Airways, Reuters reports.</p> <h2><strong>Boris Johnson says UK now \u2018past the peak\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Johnson promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces could safely reopen once lockdown restrictions were eased, as he claimed the UK was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/britain-is-past-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-boris-johnson\">past the peak of the coronavirus outbreak</a>. Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the death toll of the virus, taking it to a total of 26,771, the prime minister suggested the worst was over.</p> <h2><strong>British BAME Covid-19 death rate \u2018more than twice that of whites\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">more than 2.5 times that of the white population</a>, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies.</p> <h2><strong>UK food banks face record demand</strong></h2> <p>The first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown triggered an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/uk-food-banks-face-record-demand-in-coronavirus-crisis\">unprecedented rise in food bank use</a> as the economy was hit and household incomes plunged, data from hundreds of emergency food aid charities reveals.</p> <h2>Jacinda Ardern very popular after lockdown</h2> <p>An opinion poll in New Zealand has found the prime minister\u2019s a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/jacinda-ardern-and-her-government-soar-in-popularity-during-coronavirus-crisis\">pproval rating jumped to 65%</a> during the country\u2019s nearly five-week strict lockdown. It puts her in a strong position ahead of this year\u2019s general election. Her Labour party also did well, achieving a 55% approval rating.</p>",
  "<p>The last time Australia had a coherent and effective policy on China was when John Howard was prime minister. Howard emphasised the positives in what was then a much simpler trading relationship.</p> <p>Then, in Deng Xiaoping\u2019s famous words, China was hiding its capabilities and biding its time. The Peoples\u2019 Liberation Army was nowhere near the military powerhouse it is today. The Communist party\u2019s forced annexation of much of the South China Sea was two decades in the future.</p> <p>There is no going back to the Howard era. What has changed is that Xi Jinping has cemented his country\u2019s path toward becoming a more aggressive, highly nationalistic, military power.</p> <p>Xi is doing his utmost to \u201crecentralise\u201d all power in the hands of the Communist party. Leninist authoritarianism enabled by artificial intelligence and 5G connectivity is a chilling prospect and one that cannot tolerate internal dissent or external expressions of disapproval about the Party\u2019s performance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/in-a-testy-post-covid-19-world-chinese-sanctions-of-australian-goods-may-be-closer-than-ever\">In a testy post-Covid-19 world, Chinese sanctions of Australian goods may be closer than ever | Richard McGregor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All of this was in train before Covid-19, and the locomotive is of the bullet variety. The speed of China\u2019s military growth, its global cyber and intelligence infiltration, its use of financial power to buy legitimate and illegitimate influence in countries all around the world \u2013 all these factors are irrevocably changing how we must deal with Beijing.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the biggest challenge for Australian governments is how to manage the huge risk of being overly dependent on a state whose strategic trajectory fundamentally compromises our deepest national security interests. China quite explicitly wants to supplant the US as the prime manager of security in the Indo-Pacific. That undercuts our alliance relationship and defence planning.</p> <p>The Communist party, moreover, demands a style of supine fealty to their political dominance that cannot be squared with Australian democracy and values. Hence ambassador Cheng Jingye\u2019s \u201cwolf warrior\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/australia-called-gum-stuck-to-chinas-shoe-by-state-media-in-coronavirus-investigation-stoush\">intrusion in Australian politics</a> this week after Scott Morrison\u2019s call for an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/australia-defends-plan-to-investigate-china-over-covid-19-outbreak-as-row-deepens\">international investigation</a> into the origins of the virus.</p> <p>Party central has directed diplomatic missions to more actively and angrily intervene in domestic debates, denying that Covid-19 has anything to do with wet markets, Wuhan, or indeed the party.</p> <p>The ambassador\u2019s concern \u2013 that the Chinese people, whose \u201cfeelings have been hurt\u201d by Australia, will unbidden and spontaneously stop buying our wine and beef and stop studying and visiting here \u2013 is a line regularly deployed by Chinese officials and Party controlled media if countries offend Beijing\u2019s sensibilities.</p> <p>This list of \u201coffences\u201d is growing and includes any form of contact with Taiwan or Tibet\u2019s Dalai Lama; opposition to China\u2019s illegal annexation of features in the South China Sea; Australia\u2019s decision excluding Chinese companies from the 5G network; failure to support the Belt and Road initiative; mentioning the Tiananmen Square massacre; complaining about Chinese cyber espionage; mentioning human rights and Xinjiang; the anti-interference laws and clampdowns on foreign payments to Australian political parties.</p> <p>How can Australia shape a relationship with this increasingly sharp-elbowed state? For some years our politicians and officials tried to do and say nothing that would draw Beijing\u2019s attention. One very senior Canberra official recently put to me the proposition that a week where the Government didn\u2019t have to talk about China was a week in which we could sell it more coal and iron ore.</p> <p>Covid-19 has ended the \u201cdon\u2019t mention the war\u201d strategy. One senses at political levels a deepening anger at constantly being challenged to pay homage to Beijing\u2019s party line. I suggest five approaches that might produce better relations with the PRC.</p> <p>First, our politicians, officials and media should spend less time obsessing about criticism from Beijing. When embassies make sharp comments, they are performing for their head office. We can afford to let much of this go through to the keeper.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/using-the-virus-to-bash-beijing-could-trigger-a-new-cold-war\">Using the virus to bash Beijing could trigger a new cold war</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, we need to be clear in stating our own \u201ccore interests\u201d just as China does. One core interest is that China shouldn\u2019t attempt to establish a military base in the Pacific. We need to be strong with Pacific Island states on that point as well as with Beijing.</p> <p>Third, when China clearly transgresses, we should publicly call out the bad behaviour. For example, you can take it to the bank that China is right now engaged in full-on cyber spying on government agencies, politicians and businesses in Australia. We should be saying so publicly. This goes to the issue of developing trusted relations between capitals.</p> <p>Fourth, Scott Morrison should use his new national cabinet to brief state and territory leaders about what our national security and intelligence professionals understand about Chinese influencing and espionage activity. That will quickly put an end to state flirtations with Belt and Road memorandums and happy-happy sister city relationships.</p> <p>Lastly, with coal and iron ore we can be confident that we have products that China wants. They would find it painful to switch long-term suppliers. Chinese consumers also like Australia\u2019s clean green produce, notwithstanding party flimflam about hurt feelings.</p> <p>All the same we should be working as hard as we can to reduce economic dependence and diversify, diversify, diversify. Business should stop whining about how hard that is and understand that protecting the national interest is key to their own long term survival.</p> <ul> <li><p>Peter Jennings is the executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and a former deputy secretary for strategy with the defence department</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>When Captain Tom Moore set out with his walking frame at the start of April he had a modest goal: to raise \u00a31,000 for the NHS by walking up and down his garden 100 times before his 100th birthday. One of his daughters, Hannah Ingram-Moore, thought it might make a nice little story for the local media, and so on 7 April her consultancy firm, Maytrix, knocked up <a href=\"https://www.maytrixgroup.com/blog/2020/04/toms-100th-birthday-walk-for-the-nhs\">a press release</a> heralding his mission.</p> \n<p>The release included a photograph of the then 99-year-old wearing a navy blue fleece, pushing a walking frame on which was balanced a panama hat and his stick. \u201cWe are all being rightly advised to stay home, stay safe and protect our NHS, and that is exactly what local 99-year-old Tom Moore is doing,\u201d the copy began \u2013 and, with it, one of the most startlingly successful fundraising stories of our time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3a120ab7dc58c60e2abc80e5b0aa76d2dd51d1b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3a120ab7dc58c60e2abc80e5b0aa76d2dd51d1b/184_0_2482_1491/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Spitfire over the house of Capt Tom Moore on his 100th birthday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flt Lt Andy Preece in a Spitfire over the house of Capt Tom Moore on 30 April, his 100th birthday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK Ministry of Defence/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>How exactly a centenarian managed to capture a nation\u2019s heart \u2013 prompting an RAF fly-by, an upgrade in military rank and Piers Morgan pledging ten grand of his own money, not to mention an array of conspiracy theories \u2013 is a tale that proves both the ongoing power of the mainstream media and the British public\u2019s hunger for joy during a time of bleak national crisis.</p> \n<p>The global media onslaught began in Milton Keynes, where the press release caught the eye of Damien Lucas, head of news for a group of local newspapers. Within a few hours the story was <a href=\"https://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/health/bedford-man-walk-100-lengths-his-garden-nhs-his-100th-birthday-2532073\">on Bedford Today</a>, with a headline about the ambitions of a \u201cBedford man\u201d and his 100th birthday challenge, inspired by the treatment he received from the NHS after breaking his hip and for skin cancer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a029b63686cac3b73b01a97bb7cb2710be379c19\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a029b63686cac3b73b01a97bb7cb2710be379c19/0_153_5346_3207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Capt Tom Moore and his daughter Hannah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Capt Tom Moore and his daughter Hannah celebrating his 100th birthday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma Sohl/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A local ITV report followed and by 10 April, Good Friday, Captain Tom was live on BBC Breakfast. \u201cYou have lived, and you have seen some tough times in this country, can you inspire people who are watching now, just reassure them, it will be fine?\u201d asked Naga Munchetty. \u201cRemember,\u201d he said, \u201ctomorrow is a good day, tomorrow you will maybe find everything will be much better than today.\u201d</p> \n<p>A star was born.

By 20 April he had raised over \u00a320m and had recorded a duet with Michael Ball that was on its way to number one in the charts.</p> \n<p>The family began to worry about crowds outside the house. A neighbour got a number for DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles to see if he could help. Hannah, a huge DIY SOS fan, texted asking if this was <em>really</em> Nick Knowles. He suggested a Facetime call to prove his identity and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrNickKnowles/status/1252191172472254464\">soon had arranged for a fence to be put up</a> outside the family garden, according to Megan Carver, Knowles\u2019s longtime PR.</p> \n<p>Carver came on board last week to help field inquiries for free. One of her first calls was to Schillings, the notorious London libel firm, famed for its sky-high fees and celebrity clientele. \u201cIt was probably the easiest phone call I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d said Carver. \u201cI explained that Captain Tom\u2019s family needed a bit of help and Schillings immediately said, yes, and of course this will be pro bono.\u201d</p> \n<p>Schillings contacted Ipso, the press regulator, to ask journalists to stop \u201ceither leaning over the fence or placing their long-focus-lens cameras through hedges to take intrusive photographs\u201d, noting that the family had set up a Twitter account, @captaintommoore containing images that could be used for free.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5004b969-1bd0-4dd3-8068-05fe213d0195\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4tHEEIWjxds?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Then came the backlash. The family had to refute claims that they or Maytrix were profiting from the fundraising.

There is another one raging right now. Since cholera first spread across the globe, two centuries ago, it has killed about 50 million people. In the time it takes you to read this article, another five people will have died from it. It is now mostly ignored in the west, but in other parts of the world, it has never gone away.</p> <p>While I will surely be able to offer my patients in England a coronavirus vaccine in a year or two, and while western health systems will be reinforced to be more ready for a potential future outbreak, I worry that we may repeat the mistakes of cholera: conquering coronavirus everywhere except for the poorest parts of the world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>To reach my grandparents\u2019 house in Bihar, in north-east India, you have to take a car from Patna airport across one of the longest river bridges in the world, the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. This bridge takes you north over the river Ganges, past Hajipur, a city famous for its fragrant bananas, and up to Darbhanga, near the border with Nepal. When I was a child, the road was so damaged by the region\u2019s regular floods and monsoons that the journey, which would take just two hours in the UK, took seven hours, bumping over gut-lurching potholes. Today, the road is smooth and elevated, giving a spectacular view of the area\u2019s lush flood plains. They provide the perfect conditions for cultivating the fruits \u2013 mangoes, lychees and guava \u2013 that still flavour my memories of visits to my grandparents.</p> <p>The wet, semi-tropical conditions in the Ganges delta also make it a hotspot for water-borne diseases. And it is in northern India that cholera is thought to have originated several millennia ago, owing to the abundance of still water pools and Hindu ceremonies involving worshippers washing themselves in rivers. A 2,000-year-old <a href=\"https://mosaicscience.com/story/cholera-haiti/\" title=\"\">inscription</a> at a temple in Gujarat vividly describes the <a href=\"https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/cholera\" title=\"\">clinical picture</a> of patients afflicted by severe cholera: \u201cThe lips blue, the face haggard, the eyes hollow, the stomach sunk in, the limbs contracted and crumpled as if by fire.\u201d</p> <p>In the 19th century, the scientist Max von Pettenkofer believed, incorrectly, that cholera required certain soils and environmental factors unique to India, and so thought that it could not be contagious or endemic in Europe. But the persistence of cholera in this area has less to do with climate and more to do with political choices.</p> <p>Cholera is an infectious disease that turns on all the taps in your gut, so that water and salts pour out of your system, giving you copious watery diarrhoea that looks starchy, like rice water. This diarrhoea helps the infection spread between people, leaving a trail of victims so severely dehydrated that, if they don\u2019t receive treatment, they shrivel up like prunes within hours.</p> <p>For centuries, cholera only caused localised epidemics in north-east India. That was until 1817, when one of these outbreaks, originating in Bengal, spread across the world, starting the first of seven cholera pandemics. But just as Wuhan cannot be blamed for the current Covid-19 pandemic, we cannot hold this region responsible for cholera\u2019s spread, any more than North America should be blamed for the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, which <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/information_h1n1_virus_qa.htm\" title=\"\">originated</a> in industrially farmed pigs. What the spread of these diseases has in common is international trade, and the movement of animals and people that comes with it.</p> <p>Empire shaped the history of cholera, and it was the economic concerns of imperial powers that brought cholera to heel in the west. But if imperialism was crucial to providing the impetus to end cholera, it also produced a logic that divided the world and only eliminated the disease from one half.</p> <p>In his book Plagues and Peoples, the historian William Hardy McNeill describes how the British army carried cholera overland into Nepal and Afghanistan, while British navy and merchant ships carried it beyond the Indian Ocean. That is how the first pandemic spread from the Bay of Bengal to south-east Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and then to Europe by the early 1820s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9c5ea40ee067a947cf54cdc894b72a5e4949e95/0_0_2048_1344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"656\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dam infected with cholera in South Africa in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SCHALK/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1831, cholera reached the north-east of England, the region where I grew up. One of the first victims, in Sunderland, was a 12-year-old girl called <a href=\"https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/resources/view/34622/\" title=\"\">Isabella Hazard</a>. Her illness was characteristically swift: she was entirely well one evening and dead the next afternoon. She was an early victim of the first of a series of waves of the disease that caused pandemonium in 19th-century Europe. Port cities, crucial to trade, were affected particularly badly.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine the panic created by the \u201cBlue Death\u201d, as cholera was nicknamed, because at the time its cause was a total mystery. The most common theory \u2013 that the disease was associated with \u201cbad airs\u201d (or \u201cmiasmas\u201d) \u2013 inspired desperate experiments to control it. In Kingston, Jamaica, for instance, British colonial officers tried to banish the disease by firing cannons through the streets \u201cto destroy the morbific power that lurked in the dark alleys\u201d.</p> <p>So cholera went on, unabated, in wave after wave of pandemics throughout the 19th century, causing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_outbreaks_and_pandemics\" title=\"\">millions</a> of deaths, mainly in poor neighbourhoods. The working classes rioted across Europe, suspecting the disease was a conspiracy by the ruling elite, who they thought were poisoning them. In the 1830s, the revolutionary <a href=\"https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/133436/7/133436.pdf\" title=\"\">Mario Adorno</a> accused the Bourbon royal family of concocting \u201ca devilish plot bent on poisoning the people\u201d of Sicily with cholera, as part of his attempt to topple them.</p> <p>But disasters like pandemics are never just destructive \u2013 they also induce change, and often spark scientific developments and social reforms. The European imperial powers eventually started pouring resources into discovering the true cause of the disease, primarily to prevent the catastrophic economic downturns that accompanied every fresh outbreak. This investment led to three major developments that helped end cholera in the western world: reforms that improved public health, to stop populations getting the disease in the first place; the discovery of new medicines, to prevent and treat the disease; and international cooperation, to unite against a common enemy.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In 1813, Frances Snow gave birth to her first child, John, in York. She and her husband, William, who worked at the local coal yard, raised John in one of the poorest parts of the city. Like Bihar in India, the area John grew up in was regularly affected by flooding, when the River Ouse broke its banks.</p> <p>When John became a doctor, he grew sceptical of the idea that cholera was caused by \u201cmiasmas\u201d. Instead, he suspected it had something to do with water. He famously proved his theory in 1854, during an outbreak in Soho which killed 616 people. He created a <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg\" title=\"\">dot map</a> of all the cholera cases in the area and spoke to the families to understand their daily habits, meticulously doing what we would today call contact tracing. He discovered that nearly everyone who had been afflicted used the same <a href=\"https://www.immunology.org/john-snows-pump-1854\" title=\"\">water pump</a> on Broad Street. Snow had the handle of the pump removed, making it unusable, which led to a sharp decline in cholera cases in Soho. It was later found that this particular well was shallow and had been contaminated by a nearby cesspit. In one elegant experiment, Snow had unveiled the spectre of cholera, which had haunted him since his childhood: the cause was just plain old dirty water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f63a4072882a24e93c548103f07594c57fdadf08/0_512_2912_3640/800.jpg\" alt=\"A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A replica of the Soho water pump identified as the source of a cholera outbreak by John Snow in 1854.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a problem for colonial powers, because their cities and colonies were unsanitary places. Rapid industrialisation had impoverished both English and Indian rural workers, triggering mass migrations to cities for work. Provided with no public amenities, these new migrants built makeshift homes in unhygienic and polluted slums. Snow\u2019s revelations led to the creation of \u201cImprovement Trusts\u201d and a Commission for Public Health in major cities across India, and these did improve the sanitary conditions, but largely only for British expats and colonial officers. By the end of British rule, clean water was available to nearly all British citizens in India, but <a href=\"https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/india70-a-brief-colonial-history-of-sanitation-in-india-10602/\" title=\"\">only 1%</a> of Indians outside the colonial walls.</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"http://pragati.nationalinterest.in/2014/08/indias-sanitation-story/\" title=\"\">more than half</a> of Indian households have no access to any kind of formal sanitation, meaning that they must defecate in the open, and 70% of sewage is untreated when it re-enters rivers and streams. As a result, up to 30,000 people in India die from cholera every year. Those who can afford it resort to digging their own water wells, deep into the ground. Given the trouble and expense my grandparents went to do this, I know the fact that their well-water still gives me an upset stomach, forcing me to drink bottled water when I visit, brings them great shame. But it isn\u2019t their fault; there is only so much individuals can do when their government refuses to invest enough to ensure clean water for all its people.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>John Snow\u2019s discovery was the first step towards halting cholera. But as the pandemic continued to ravage Europe, effective medicines were needed to prevent and treat the disease. And those could only be developed once scientists understood how dirty water made us sick.</p> <p>In Florence, a contemporary of Snow\u2019s spent his days with his eye pressed up against the cold brass ring of a microscope that he himself had designed. Filippo Pacini was a professor of pathology and a pioneer in the kingdom of the tiny; he had a gift for the new art of microscopy and was naming previously undiscovered parts of the human body when he was only 19. He was convinced that the cause of many medical mysteries, like the ones that afflicted his sisters for most of their lives, could be found through careful observation with this powerful new tool.</p> <p>Pacini <a href=\"http://ccras.nic.in/sites/default/files/viewpdf/jimh/BIIHM_1978/32%20to%2038.pdf\" title=\"\">studied</a> the organs of four patients who had died of cholera. He pored over their intestines with his microscope, and noticed the same thing was wrong in each. The lining of their gut was highly abnormal: not pink and rubbery as it should be, but pale and coming off in floppy sheets, like soggy newspaper. When he teased apart this lining with a tiny probe, he noticed that multitudes of tadpole-like dots emerged from the tissue.</p> <p>Pacini recognised that these dots \u2013 which he called \u201c<em>vibrios</em>\u201d (commas), because of their shape \u2013 must be the cause of cholera. He was the first person to observe for certain what had been speculated for centuries: that diseases could be caused by things too small to see by the naked eye. However, the scientific community failed to appreciate the value of his research, and his findings languished, largely ignored, for another three decades.</p> <p>Pacini had discovered the \u201cgerm\u201d, but it was not until the German physician Robert Koch himself discovered the comma bacillus in Egypt in 1883 that germ theory became popularised. During the following century, further research led to two crucial targeted therapies, based on breakthroughs by scientists from the Indian subcontinent shortly after it gained independence. In 1953, <a href=\"https://peoplepill.com/people/hemendra-nath-chatterjee/\" title=\"\">Hemanda Nath Chatterjee</a> developed a simple mix of salt and sugar that could be added to water to safely replace the copious fluids lost as diarrhoea. The basic recipe is still used today.</p> <p>Six years later, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhu_Nath_De\" title=\"\">Sambhu Nath De</a> discovered that cholera released a poisonous toxin, which deserved just as much attention as the bacterium itself. Using modest equipment in a laboratory in Kolkata, he showed that the bacteria were not needed to make people sick. If they were stewed in a soupy culture, then removed \u2013 like whole spices \u2013 even just the remaining broth was enough to cause life-threatening intestinal damage and give all the symptoms of the disease.</p> <p>These discoveries transformed our understanding of cholera, and how it could be treated. They provided the basis of two new medicines: oral rehydration therapy, to replace lost salts; and a cholera vaccine, to induce an immune response against the bacteria and its toxin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebed66dc9af682e5ab50e139d51a437d6b248c63/0_94_2883_1729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nurse giving sugar solution to a child suffering from cholera in Zimbabwe in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philimon Bulawayo/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, it\u2019s easy for westerners to get their hands on the <a href=\"https://jcdr.net/articles/PDF/13376/13050_F(SHU)_PF1(KB_SL)_PN(SL).pdf\" title=\"\">most effective vaccine</a>, Dukoral. Using it simply involves adding a vial of the liquid vaccine to water, together with a sachet of a granulated buffer that protects the vaccine from stomach acid. It\u2019s no harder than adding milk and sugar to tea. Two doses will induce an antibody response that will <a href=\"https://youtu.be/e4ZVQvVDH5c\" title=\"\">protect you</a> for about five years. But Dukoral cannot be used in the areas where cholera is most prevalent, because they don\u2019t have access to clean water, so taking the medicine could actually put people at risk. Besides, it is unaffordable in those places; to earn enough to pay for two doses, the average Briton would have to work for less than an hour, while the <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-6-000-is-6-of-a-small-farmer-s-annual-income-according-to-nsso-data/story-rddMw0hk6cSbxjo7E1GyKK.html\" title=\"\">average Indian farmer</a> would have to work for three whole days.</p> <p>There are other, cheaper cholera vaccines, such as Shanchol, which is manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics in India. This has the advantage of not needing any extra water, as it is poured directly into the mouth. But it is not as effective as Dukoral, as it does not protect you against the toxin, just the bacteria. Plus, it still requires two doses given two weeks apart. That\u2019s hardly feasible for healthcare workers trying to cover vast areas of rural India.</p> <p>There are many other obstacles to cholera vaccination programmes. To be effective, they must reach enough of the population to achieve herd immunity. This requires accurate surveillance, which is impossible without a strong and centralised public health system. Like the other countries where cholera is still endemic, India lacks this infrastructure, largely owing to the long shadow of colonial extraction, post-colonial debt, and loans granted by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1990s on the condition that the government reduce its spending, which led to cuts to public health and education programmes \u2013 the very things that a society needs to haul itself out of the conditions that stoke cholera.</p> <p>So although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the cholera vaccine in areas where cholera is endemic, and despite the existence of an easy-to-use vaccine which is manufactured in their own country, my relatives in their remote village in Bihar have not had it. But if I, as a westerner, want to visit them for a week, I can easily get it in the UK.</p> <p>Oral rehydration therapy and the cholera vaccine have greatly reduced cholera\u2019s reach in subsequent decades, but it has not gone away completely. Two years after Sambu Nath De\u2019s seminal research, a new pandemic \u2013 the seventh \u2013 sprung up in Indonesia and took hold in Asia and north Africa. This pandemic is still ongoing. More than a billion people live in countries at risk of the disease which, by no coincidence, are some of the poorest countries on earth.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In the two decades after cholera first reached Europe, individual European nations, acting in isolation, tried in vain to prevent and contain it. But there was no point cleaning up port cities at great expense when you could not vouch for the sailors and cargo flowing through it. They eventually realised that a problem caused by globalisation required an international solution.</p> <p>This led to the first example of global cooperation in order to combat a disease. In 1851, the first <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30737-6/fulltext\" title=\"\">International Sanitary Conference</a>, convening the major European imperial powers, was held in Paris. Still, it took time for all those gathered to reach a consensus, and the first International Sanitary Conventions were not adopted until 1892.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315613598/chapters/10.4324/9781315613598-7\" title=\"\">Anne-Emanuelle Birn</a>, a professor at the University of Toronto School of Public Health, trade was the driving motive of these meetings, and public health just a necessary means. They proved successful: transnational interventions, such as quarantine and disease surveillance by international health bureaux, did bring down cholera deaths. These International Sanitary Conferences proved the power of international cooperation to improve health and boost the economy, and provided the blueprint for the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and later the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\" title=\"\">WHO</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest achievement of this cooperation came in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated globally. But unlike smallpox, cholera has not been eradicated \u2013 not because of some insurmountable biological hurdle, but because we have thrown our weight behind schemes that focus solely on cholera, rather than trying to end the poverty that makes such diseases likely. There are still about <a href=\"https://www.who.int/cholera/the-forgotten-pandemic/en/\" title=\"\">3 million cases</a> and 100,000 deaths from cholera every year, all entirely preventable. Based on recent estimates, from 1 January to 25 March of this year, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455997/\" title=\"\">cholera</a> claimed more lives than the <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-toll/\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a>. But we are saying so much about coronavirus and so little about cholera because coronavirus has broken the unwritten rule that dangerous infections should not befall those in the west.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.who.int/gho/epidemic_diseases/cholera/cholera_009.jpg?ua=1\" title=\"\">map</a> of the places still struggling with cholera shows <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/maintaining-the-momentum-against-cholera/\" title=\"\">47 countries</a> \u2013 in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. This might seem to confirm that tropical countries are bound to nurture this bacteria, because of their warm climates and high population density. But the experience of the Marshall Islands, a remote Pacific archipelago that suffered a cholera outbreak at the end of 2000 and start of 2001, shows that there is nothing inevitable about where the disease takes its toll. As the University of Hawaii researchers Seiji Yamada and Wesley Palmer <a href=\"https://www.medicinasocial.info/index.php/socialmedicine/article/viewFile/12/211\" title=\"\">have shown</a>, two neighbouring islands there experienced very different fates \u2013 despite having similar climates and being just four miles apart.</p> <p>The US maintains a military base on Kwajalein Island, where the menial labour is carried out by low-paid workers who live on <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2016/07/116493/micronesia-ebeye-island-missile-test-photos#slide-1\" title=\"\">another nearby island, Ebeye</a>. Many of them are descended from refugees from other islands in the archipelago who were displaced by US weapons testing in the 40s and 50s. The housing and infrastructure provided to them on Ebeye by the military is not much better than a slum. The average household is home to <a href=\"https://www.tuftsgloballeadership.org/blog/isolation-and-disparity-kwajalein-atoll-noah-rose\" title=\"\">nine people</a>, so infections spread rapidly. The sewers pour their contents into lagoons where people swim and fish, and when it rains they overflow into the streets.</p> <p>At the time of the outbreak, there was no running water on Ebeye. Furthermore, since the land there was not fit for agriculture, traditional Marshallese ingredients were unavailable, and nearly all food was imported, unhealthy and expensive, leaving many malnourished. It was a ship bringing food to the island that is thought to have started the outbreak of 2000-2001.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2694bc371e8dbc130396fda3a396a24368d8d48d/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Reiss/USGS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Kwajalein Island, meanwhile, the residents are almost exclusively American expats who work for private military contractors. They live in detached villas with amenities like those of a beach resort, and the population density is 20 times less than that on Ebeye. Once the outbreak had begun, workers were only allowed to commute from Ebeye to Kwajalein if they could prove that they had received vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. During the cholera outbreak, there were 400 cases and six deaths on Ebeye. However, on Kwajalein there was not a single case.</p> <p>What made contracting cholera so likely on Ebeye and so unlikely on Kwajalein has nothing to do with climate or geography. There is no biological or environmental reason why cholera cannot be eradicated for good in Ebeye, and Bihar, and right across the world. It is not the knowhow that is lacking, but rather the political will to extend these benefits to all people.</p> <p>It is now 200 years since the cholera pandemics began, more than 150 years since the bacteria was identified, and 60 years since an inexpensive treatment and vaccination regime was developed. And yet still this contagion is plaguing some countries as if none of that progress had ever happened. That is the real lesson of cholera.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>There are <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/the-new-coronavirus-could-circulate-forever-says-experts\" title=\"\">fears</a> that coronavirus is now distributed so widely that, like cholera, it may be here for the long haul. It is not yet known whether this current coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, will eventually mutate to cause milder, cold-like symptoms, like the <a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/could-we-be-living-with-covid-19-forever\" title=\"\">four endemic coronaviruses</a>; or instead go the way of the first Sars coronavirus and remain as a deadly, but contained, infection. In either scenario, Sars-CoV-2 or a similar future virus could, like cholera, be eliminated only from the richer parts of the world, and left to circulate, with deadly consequences, in the world\u2019s poorest regions.</p> <p>The world will eventually recover a semblance of normality by adopting the same three techniques we used against cholera: prevention of transmission, targeted treatments and global cooperation between nations. But as we saw with cholera, all three strategies can exacerbate global divides, if they are applied selectively to protect only the richer half of the world.</p> <p>There are signs that this is happening already: from richer countries <a href=\"https://qz.com/africa/1805769/coronavirus-chinese-middlemen-deplete-africa-facemasks-supply/\" title=\"\">buying up</a> so much extra personal protective equipment that poor countries will be unable to obtain or afford enough to protect their health workers; to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/were-desperate-for-a-coronavirus-cure-but-at-what-cost-to-the-human-guinea-pigs-kenan-malik\" title=\"\">outsourcing</a> of coronavirus clinical trials to poor countries, like India, that will be less able to afford the vaccine once it is developed; to poor countries becoming blind spots in the world\u2019s gaze on coronavirus, because they lack the <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/openmovements/widening-data-divide-covid-19-and-global-south/\" title=\"\">digital infrastructure</a> necessary to collect comprehensive data about their outbreaks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b411833015e0d8712b89b42b5a361903d5a1fa9/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An oral cholera vaccination being given in Bangladesh in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is hardly news that we live in an unequal world. In the 90s, global health experts began to refer to the so-called \u201c10/90 gap\u201d, based on the fact that only 10% of health research funding was addressing the health problems that affected 90% of the world\u2019s population. At the time, diarrhoeal diseases accounted for 7.2% of global disease burden, but attracted only 0.06% of health research investment. The 10/90 gap has remained largely unchanged. But with this new pandemic, we have an opportunity to put that right.</p> <p>Just as cholera gave birth to global health, coronavirus should trigger its latest reboot. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2013/10/08/richard-smith-moving-from-global-heath-3-0-to-global-health-4-0/\" title=\"\">has compared</a> the stages of global health since the first cholera pandemics to the updates of an operating system. I welcome what he calls \u201cGlobal Health 4.0\u201d: namely, research and policy led by researchers and activists from poor countries. And while the WHO has not always lived up to its lofty goals, nor managed to achieve eradication of cholera as it did for smallpox, the solution is not to weaken it, as per Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/trump-decision-cut-who-funding-international-vandalism-coronavirus\" title=\"\">removal of funding</a>, but the opposite: it needs much more funding, and more independence from corporate donors, if it is to help tackle the socio-economic conditions that make us sick.</p> <p>Besides the basic moral argument for a system of public health and international cooperation that benefits all people, it is also in everyone\u2019s interests, because as long as infections blight poor countries, they will continue to pose a threat to the west, too. The Nigerian global health scholar Obijiofor Aginam <a href=\"https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&amp;context=ijgls\" title=\"\">has written</a> that \u201cenormous sacrifices must then be made by the developed world to confront mutual vulnerability\u201d. Coronavirus has reminded us, once again, of this mutual vulnerability.</p> <p>To prevent further pandemics, Aginam calls for a \u201ccommunitarian globalism\u201d: a bottom-up approach, \u201cbased on ideals of fairness, justice, and equitable distribution of scarce but moderate global resources\u201d. We have already seen glimpses of this kind of solidarity in the current crisis: from the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/aggressive-testing-contact-tracing-cooked-meals-how-the-indian-state-of-kerala-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve/2020/04/10/3352e470-783e-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html\" title=\"\">communist government in Kerala</a> giving food and shelter to migrant workers; to the <a href=\"https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/3/30/somalia-sends-20-doctors-to-help-italys-coronavirus-effort\" title=\"\">Somalian doctors</a> offering their help in crisis zones such as Italy; to <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/cuba-time-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">Cuba allowing</a> an infected British cruise ship to dock to receive timely medical care by its doctors.</p> <p>There are, of course, important differences between coronavirus and cholera. The fact that coronavirus has a higher transmission rate than cholera, for instance, will make curbing its spread particularly challenging. But the lesson from cholera holds nonetheless. If we allow global health to be funded and governed by the old colonial logic that is embedded in its current structures, then the story will play out as it did for cholera.</p> <p>For now, I will continue to worry about my patients and colleagues in England, and how many of them will succumb to this virus. But while there are certainly better and worse ways to respond to the crisis here in the short term, history will judge us not just on who dies from coronavirus today, but in the centuries to come.</p> <p>For when my patients die during a pandemic in one of the richest countries in the world, it is of course a tragedy, but I can take comfort in the fact that it is an exceptional one, and that every effort is being made to prevent further such deaths. A much bigger moral failing would be if there are still people in the poorest parts of the earth dying of coronavirus in 2200. In 50 years\u2019 time, when I take the road north through Bihar to my ancestral home, I hope I will be able to buy a bunch of bananas in Hajipur without wearing a mask, and fill my nostrils with their sweetness.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Governments were caught out when Covid-19 hit, having overlooked the need to be able to test for new diseases because they were focused on drugs and vaccines for those they already knew about.</p> <p>Now there are fears that the rush to supply wealthier countries pressing for more tests may destabilise the fight against HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, illnesses that kill millions, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. </p> <p>\u201cSome companies are planning to reduce or stop malaria, HIV and TB test production,\u201d said Dr Catharina Boehme, the chief executive of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (Find) and an adviser to the World Health Organization. \u201cThey are shifting their production to Covid-19 tests.\u201d</p> <p>Boehme said companies could get about 18 cents for a rapid malaria test and $10 for a Covid-19 test.</p> <p>The Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria said it was concerned about \u201cany action that might reduce the availability of tests or treatment for HIV, TB or malaria\u201d. </p> <p>Its executive director, Peter Sands, said: \u201cGiven the risk that Covid-19 undermines our continued progress in the fight against existing epidemics, this is not the time to be to doing anything that weakens our ability to diagnose and treat those infected with HIV, TB and malaria in a timely and cost-effective way. Doing so would cost lives.\u201d</p> <p>Diagnostics has been the poor relation to drugs and vaccines for years, as governments are now realising to their cost. The handful of countries that had specialised in diagnostics, including South Korea and Singapore, have had remarkable success in containing their epidemics. They were at a massive advantage.</p> <p>\u201cSouth Korea and Singapore both have a super strong diagnostics industry. Samsung, for example, has a diagnostics branch. A lot of the tech companies that we know more from mobile phones and so on have diagnostic branches,\u201d said Boehme. South Korea has factories that make tests for US and European companies.</p> <p>In Singapore, Sars was a wake-up call. In the aftermath, the government recognised an opportunity and invested in the diagnostics industry. Diagnostics are much more complicated than drugs and vaccines. India, which mass-produces cheap generic drugs for the world, does not have big diagnostics production.</p> <p>Germany, which has done more tests than any other country, got off to a flying start thanks to the virologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/virologist-christian-drosten-germany-coronavirus-expert-interview\">Christian Drosten</a>, who produced the first test for Covid-19, backed by the WHO. In the UK, Public Health England took longer. Usually the Centers for Disease Control in the US is first off the blocks with new tests, but its did not work. It failed to pick up enough cases and also produced false positives.</p> <p>Germany had a large and excellent laboratory network and the advantage of being decentralised, so it could respond to outbreaks with extensive testing done on on a regional and local basis.</p> <p>By the time the UK decided to ramp up testing, it had similar problems as developing nations. There were stock-outs of testing kits and chemicals. </p> <p>Smaller nations had less trouble obtaining what they needed. \u201cThe UK is one of the largest countries. If they hadn\u2019t ordered large enough amounts early enough, they would have lost out,\u201d said Boehme.</p> <p>One of the handful of big companies with a US- and European-approved Covid-19 test is the BGI Group, a Chinese company that established testing in Wuhan at the start of the pandemic and then set up labs and testing in 11 other cities, which helped China get control of the outbreak. It was also involved in producing Ebola tests for Africa.</p> <p>It supplies coronavirus tests to Sweden, and one of its companies, MGI, recently agreed to supply 2m tests to France. MGI has also offered to help the UK. \u201cWe want to help. Our manufacturing capacity now is 2m tests per day and we are ramping up to meet demand as we see it,\u201d said Perla El Hage, MGI\u2019s district sales manager for northern and western Europe.</p> <p>Find is working with the WHO, Unicef, the World Food Programme and the Gates and Clinton foundations to obtain Covid-19 tests for low-income countries. It has a storage facility in Dubai. BGI is one of the companies that has helped, but the scale of need is a challenge.</p> <p>\u201cWe need an estimated 1bn tests in the next 12 months for low- and middle-income countries,\u201d said Boehme. \u201cRapid diagnostic tests would be the ideal in terms of ease of use and price, but right now there is still a WHO recommendation against them because we lack evidence.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-testing\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-testing&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-testing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The diagnostic tests identify an antigen in the virus, rather than the antibodies that the immune system may produce to fight it off. Like the antibody tests, they can be handheld tests that do not need lab processing. \u201cWe need tests that are at least 90% sensitive. The ongoing evaluation studies will show where we are. The sooner we can get these tests out, the better,\u201d said Boehme.</p> <p>Diagnostics are finally having their moment. On Monday there will be an international pledging conference for donor countries to promise funds for vaccines and work on epidemic preparedness. This time, it will include diagnostics. There is recognition of the crucial part they play in controlling a global pandemic, and acknowledgement that most countries have been very ill-prepared.</p>",

  "<p>My life of a millennial GP used to be simple \u2013 look after patients, then go home and enjoy life. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic changed all of that. General practice is being attacked from all fronts \u2013 the years of neglect by successive federal governments leaving primary care struggling to cope with the challenges of a pandemic. There is an irony to the government thanking our frontline workers, promising that there are stockpiles of magical personal protective equipment (PPE) somewhere just waiting to be handed out, contrasting with the bleak reality of seeing face to face consults often without a mask, gown or goggles.</p> \n<p>To date my surgery has received 100 surgical face masks and 20 N95 masks. This was two months ago.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/pathology-giants-seek-50-rent-reduction-from-hard-pressed-australian-gps-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">Pathology giants seek 50% rent reduction from hard-pressed Australian GPs amid coronavirus crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>GPs are constantly reminded that we are part of the frontline, that we should be testing for Covid-19, that we should be seeing common colds and flus and picking up the pieces of deteriorating mental health and burden of cancelled elective surgeries. It was ambitious to expect private small businesses (GP clinics) and self-employed contractors (individual GPs) to move with the rapidly changing environment without clear government support.</p> \n<p>This has only been possible through the innovation of practice owners and doctors in sourcing their own protective equipment, including respirators and face shields from Bunnings, and banding together to support each other through conflicting guidelines form state and federal health departments.</p> \n<p>The vast majority of my patients have been highly cooperative, respectful and accepting of their civic duty to ensure the safety of not only themselves but the community. There have been exceptions though: patients who demand to be tested despite not meeting guidelines; employers demanding clearance certificates when told that is not possible; patients abusing reception staff when told the flu shot is not in stock yet or otherwise demanding that they be able to have it for free when clearly not eligible. Perhaps the most disappointing is patients ignorantly or wilfully exposing other patients and the staff to potential infection by not being truthful when asked screening questions, but telling you of their sore throat, runny nose or cough only in the consulting room. This is why some GPs choose not to see patients face to face. They have their own families and health to look after too.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>How efficient would more prevention be in our healthcare system?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>One positive out of this pandemic has been the introduction of telehealth consults. It has allowed our vulnerable doctors to continue practising from home and our vulnerable patients to continue receiving care without putting themselves at risk. It has been something that has been called for by doctors of all specialties for years. </p> \n<p>Disappointingly, along with the new telehealth item numbers, I have noticed my Facebook feed littered with ads for telehealth GPs offering anything from a men\u2019s health check to referrals, scripts or medical certificates. To them it is an opportunity for business but in reality it is just further fragmentation of care. Of course the convenience is appealing, but is it safe?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bc33b85f-c1a3-4934-922b-785c4f77d9a5\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I have always been cranky with my receptionists when they fit in a patient for \u201cjust a script\u201d, \u201cjust a medical certificate\u201d or \u201cjust a referral\u201d. To me it is an opportunity for preventative care, to do blood pressures, check on routine bloods and cancer screening and to address little problems before they become bigger ones. These are opportunities that could not have been done with pop-up telehealth services but I am glad to be able to continue to do so as a GP. This continuity of care is highlighted by how efficient a telehealth consult is on a regular patient. Similarly, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia\u2019s advocacy to push community pharmacists to do flu shots, prescribe the contraceptive pill, or antibiotics for a urinary tract infection, are further attempts to fragment care \u2013 an appealing business decision at the expense of patient care.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/australias-small-medical-practices-on-brink-of-collapse-amid-coronavirus\">potential collapse of GP practices with the downturn in patients</a> has been highlighted in the media recently. This is not an issue unique to Covid-19 but one that it has accelerated. Medicare item numbers for GP consults were frozen from 2013 to 2018, with increases afterwards that are tokenistic at best. It is the reason why practices struggle to maintain bulk billing rates, as the burden of paying for increasing overheads, staff and medical supplies means that charging a gap is necessary for survival. Even when telehealth was introduced it was forbidden to charge a gap \u2013 effectively halving practice incomes on top of the downturn in patients.

On Friday morning Bauer announced the $40m deal, which will unite the two rivals after decades of competition, had gone ahead. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission did not oppose the merger, saying in March that it was \u201cunlikely to substantially lessen competition in any market\u201d despite the close rivalry between Woman\u2019s Day (Bauer) and New Idea (Pacific), and Take 5 (Bauer) and That\u2019s Life!

They will be paid until the end of next week, and can take their annual leave, but otherwise will be unpaid.</p> <h2><strong>Staff left out of jobkeeper</strong></h2> <p>There was another sting in the tail for the Bauer staff who were stood down.

The company\u2019s global structure means the employees don\u2019t qualify.</p> <p>Sources say the company chose the four titles because they are not profitable without advertising, as they have smaller circulations than the stronger titles such as Australian Women\u2019s Weekly, Take 5, TV Week and Woman\u2019s Day.</p> <p>While the websites will continue to operate, Bauer said rather ominously that any \u201cdecision to resume print publication will be made once the trading environment improves\u201d.

  "<p>The US pharmaceutical company Gilead is finalising the location of five hospitals in Australia to receive the highly sought-after experimental coronavirus drug remdesivir.</p> <p>The only confirmed location is St Vincent\u2019s hospital in Sydney, a major tertiary hospital and the centre of many of the New South Wales outbreak areas.

The US clinical trial registry also shows that Gilead altered the primary outcome measures of the trial halfway through. It broadened its definition of \u201crecovery\u201d and included patients who were still in hospital and who were at home but requiring oxygen in its group of recovered patients. Changing the primary outcomes of a study is often viewed by scientists with scepticism in any clinical trial, as it is often done to improve the significance of results after the initial outcomes proved disappointing. This is known as \u201cfishing for significance\u201d. Nine members of the US panel that establishes treatment guidelines <a href=\"https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/panel-financial-disclosure/\">have a financial interest in Gilead</a>.</p> <p>A separate study from China published in the prestigious medical journal the Lancet showed no statistically clinical benefit in Covid-19 patients in health improvement or mortality after they were given remdesivir. But the researchers tested a smaller number of patients than the US trial and concluded that their findings would require confirmation from larger studies. The study was stopped early by the data safety monitoring board because of difficulty recruiting patients.</p> <p>Even if the drug does ultimately prove effective, it is likely to be used in a similar way to the influenza drug Tamiflu, shortening the duration of illness but not curing it. The US study showed patients given remdesivir improved only moderately, after an average of 11 days, compared with an average of 15 days for those not given the treatment.</p> <p>Dr Gaetan Burgio, head of the transgenesis facility at the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National University in Canberra, said the studies so far revealed remdesivir \u201cis not a silver bullet against Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is therefore more critical than ever to keep social distancing, wearing masks or follow other preventive measures to limit the spread and eliminate the virus,\u201d Burgio said.</p> <p>Prof Sarah Palmer, the co-director of the Centre for Virus Research at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research in Sydney, said: \u201cThere is still a lot to learn about this disease.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot base our medical response on this one promising study. This drug is still in early clinical trials and is not currently widely available. It is possible depending upon a wide range of issues including, production, licensing, urgency that it will become available in Australia in the future.\u201d</p>",

On Wednesday, Maloney was appointed to the select committee on the coronavirus crisis, a new oversight committee.<br><br>Here\u2019s Patel\u2019s statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Carolyn Maloney spent decades as an anti-vaccine movement leader giving validity to a dangerous creed threatening public health and the most vulnerable. </em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><em>The history of Maloney\u2019s anti-vaccine stances is long and dangerous: she authored ani-vaccine legislation; angrily berated a CDC Director during a congressional hearing because the CDC Director would not agree that vaccines cause autism; led a radical group of activists in a \u2018Green the Vaccine\u2019 rally outside of the steps of Congress; hosted radical anti-vaccine activists in Congress; and regularly claimed vaccines were as dangerous as smoking. <br></em></p> <p><em>It is dangerous and unthinkable to elevate her anti-science voice during the coronavirus crisis. The world is waiting on a vaccine to bring this horror to an end. This is no time to hand the mic to someone who endangers public health by questioning science. Appointing her to this position begs the question: How is a committee tasked with overseeing the development of a COVID-19 vaccine credible if Maloney, an anti-vaccine activist that questions the CDC\u2019s scientific findings on vaccines, is one of its leaders? <br></em></p> <p><em>Now more than ever we need elected officials who trust doctors, medicine, and science.

In a 2012 congressional testimony on autism, according to <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/03/11/maloney-no-longer-believes-vaccines-cause-autism/\">the New York Post</a>, Maloney said:<br><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And you\u2019ve got to listen, you know, to \u2014 I remember smoking.

Although non-US citizens were prohibited from entering the country if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, American citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members were exempt.

And in China, where officials shut down travel both in and out of Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 outbreak began, the travel ban barely slowed the spread of diseases, according to a report published in Science.</p> <p>But there is no evidence that travel restrictions ultimately stopped the spread of coronavirus, or significantly reduced the contagion\u2019s death toll. </p> <p>Read more: </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-travel-ban-europe-us\">Will Trump's coronavirus travel ban work?
