But it\u2019s gradually evolved and you realise: \u2018This can work now.\u2019</p> \n   <p>When we turned up here for the first time we said: \u2018Wow, this is a big empty space, it\u2019s got water, it\u2019s got electricity, it\u2019s got a roof, and nobody\u2019s shooting at you.</p> \n   <p>So actually this is achievable \u2013 that\u2019s not necessarily the case in other theatres we\u2019ve been working in.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The 52-year-old said it was \u201cincredibly impressive\u201d that a high-quality intensive care unit had been set up in what was, in effect, a warehouse.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Somebody said you\u2019re on the train and laying the tracks ahead of you as you are going along \u2013 and that\u2019s absolutely right, you just have to make sure the train doesn\u2019t go too quickly and run away with you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Part of the success, he says, has been through dedication to the welfare of staff, many of whom are working \u201cpretty exhausting\u201d 12-hour shifts. Nightingale workers had borrowed a technique deployed on military operations where staff are paired with a buddy at the start of their shift, encouraging them to look out for one another throughout. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you have eyes with each other when you first go on a shift, you introduce yourselves, and speak to each other after the shift. If they get upset, have a difficult time with a patient or a death, they sit down and have a cup of tea. It worked very well in the past in the military and it\u2019s working very well here,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"780c85dc-9ed5-46a3-83d5-1027c68f2804\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H6pDcV2Lnno?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T13:02:24.066Z\">at 2.02pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9aa8498f08b7689b030bc6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:14:15.598Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning from the UK, folks. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simon-murphy\">Simon Murphy</a> </strong>here, taking over the global live blog now to take you through today\u2019s coronavirus coverage as the world continues to battle the pandemic. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:56:37.700Z\">at 8.56am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9a98918f08bade1f2957e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T06:14:07.698Z\">7.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Teachers, nurses and other workers who are regularly exposed to the public must now take a coronavirus test if they want to leave Wuhan, China has ruled.<br><br>The order comes after the central city, where the coronavirus emerged late last year, lifted a 70-day lockdown that all but ended the epidemic there. <br><br>People in Wuhan working in nursing, education, security and other sectors with high exposure to the public must take a nucleic acid test before leaving, the National Health Commission said. <br><br>Since the city relaxed its lockdown restrictions people who arrived in there before Chinese New Year, when the virus was peaking in China, are allowed to go back to their homes. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95d57265faf4481a7f3f1445960b65d8b106eefd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95d57265faf4481a7f3f1445960b65d8b106eefd/52_149_2913_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The junction of the Han River and the Yangtze River on April 17, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

In Brisbane\u2019s metro south public health unit, which serves a population of about 1.2 million south of the Brisbane river, the team doing this work has grown to 100 people, triple its size before the pandemic.</p> \n<h2>How it begins</h2> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get them to tell us a story,\u201d says Dr Shopna Bag. \u201cWhere did it all start?\u201d</p> \n<p>Bag is the director of the public health unit for the western Sydney local health district, which covers areas including Cumberland, Parramatta and Blacktown.</p> \n<p>The unit is based on the Cumberland hospital campus but works with all hospitals in the district, including neighbouring Westmead, as well as local health centres and pharmacies.</p> \n<p>The team includes a communicable diseases manager, surveillance nurses, public health nurses and public health officers. Since the arrival of Covid-19, it has had responsibility for joining the dots in cases such as an outbreak at the Rose of Sharon childcare centre in Blacktown.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We\u2019re trying to get them to tell us a story. Where did it all start?</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dr Shopna Bag</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Case investigation and contact tracing work begins at the point of diagnosis. The unit receives a notification from a laboratory or the health department of a newly confirmed case. That case is assigned to a team member, often a nurse, who then calls the patient.</p> \n<p>In many cases, this phone call is the moment the patient learns they have coronavirus. For the clinician on the other side of the call, their first priority is the patient\u2019s mental welfare and physical health.</p> \n<p>\u201cSometimes people are expecting the result, other times it\u2019s a surprise,\u201d says Dr Bhakti Vasant, a public health physician in Brisbane\u2019s metro south public health unit.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important we gauge what people are feeling over the phone and try to build rapport.\u201d</p> \n<p>The clinician will run through a questionnaire to correctly identify the patient. That is followed by a symptom check. How is the patient feeling today? Are they experiencing any respiratory difficulties? Are they in a hospital or at home in isolation? Do they have any chronic illnesses that place them in a higher risk category of Covid-19 patients?</p> \n<p>Vasant says there have been some cases where staff have had to immediately call an ambulance based on that first phone call.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf they\u2019re short of breath or reporting chest pain we do not muck around,\u201d she says.</p> \n<h2>The interview</h2> \n<p>Once the caller establishes the patient is in isolation and well enough to speak, more detailed questioning can begin.</p> \n<p>While its purpose is interrogatory, the interview is kept as relaxed as possible, Bag says. For this reason, clinicians doing this type of work need multiple qualities: an eye for detail, emotional intelligence, and the ability to listen and make people feel comfortable. Unsurprisingly, they are often natural conversationalists, but with the ability to tease out information and follow threads.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying not to bombard them with questions, even though we need to tick a box,\u201d Bag says.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do it in a way that says \u2018just tell us the story\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The caller asks the patient questions about when they first started to feel unwell. For some Covid-19 patients, the initial symptoms can be so mild they are mistaken for something else, such as hayfever.</p> \n<p>The caller talks to the patient about every cough, fever, ache, anything that felt a little off and together they identify the date the patient first began to show symptoms.</p> \n<p>This is done for two reasons. The first is to build a timeline back to the original source of the infection.</p> \n<p>The second is that the date of symptom onset determines the period in which the patient is considered contagious.</p> \n<p>Patients with Covid-19 are considered contagious 24 hours before they become symptomatic and this date is used as the starting point to identify close contacts who may have been exposed.</p> \n<h2>The timeline</h2> \n<p>The case investigator then works with the patient to build a timeline.</p> \n<p>This line of questioning can be a long process says Reid, who is the team investigations manager in the ACT\u2019s health protection service.</p> \n<p>It is about retracing the patient\u2019s steps, \u201cday-by day, minute-by-minute\u201d, covering every moment of the 14 days up to the first day of symptoms.</p> \n<p>They\u2019ll use a range of tools, including the calendar on the patient\u2019s mobile phone, if they have one, to try to reconstruct those two weeks. Sometimes, they\u2019ll have the patient try to write a timeline for those 14 days.</p> \n<p>There are specific questions, such as has the patient travelled internationally or interstate? Where did they go, what mode of transport did they use? If they took a flight somewhere, did they then catch a taxi or Uber? Had they been at work, the gym, a wedding or birthday party?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sometimes it will take multiple calls as the patient starts to recall their movements.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t stop until we find a source,\u201d Reid says.</p> \n<p>In some instances, a public health unit might receive several cases at once for which there appears to be a common source, such as a cruise ship with a known outbreak or an institution such as a school or church with other confirmed cases.</p> \n<p>But Bag says it is important not to make assumptions even if the source might seem obvious.

This is anyone who has had 15 minutes of face-to-face contact with the patient in their infectious period, or who has spent two hours in an enclosed space with them.</p> \n<p>Case investigators will seek information such as flight numbers and seat rows for patients who have travelled. They can then request a flight manifest from the airline to begin the work of identifying people sitting nearby.</p> \n<p>In the interview, the patient will be asked to remember who they\u2019ve spent time with, at work, at the gym, any parties, religious services or nights out. Who do they live with? The greatest risks of exposure are in the household setting, so identifying household members is a priority in contact tracing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-five-months-on-what-scientists-now-know-about-covid-19\">Coronavirus: five months on, what scientists now know about Covid-19</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A list is put together and then contact tracers get to work tracking down and notifying those people.</p> \n<p>In some cases, the patient will be able to supply names and numbers and those individuals might already be expecting a call.

It makes you reflect on your whole life and it really has ... it\u2019s mentally very difficult, it\u2019s emotionally difficult, economically it\u2019s disastrous. The market goes down, your retirement funds go down, you\u2019re not getting a paycheck. It is as tumultuous a time as we have ever seen. But in the midst of this, there is no time for politics.

Stay tuned for up-to-the-minute news on US politics and the pandemic.</p> <p>There are widespread concerns about the growing occurrence of sporadic protests around the nation. These flared up earlier in the week in several states, most notably Michigan and Minnesota, against the continuance of stay-at-home orders by governors (which follow federal guidelines) as they try to contain the disease.

  "<p>Amazon will tell the world soon just how much money it has made from the \u201cunprecedented demand shift\u201d to its site from millions of people under lockdown conditions around the world.</p> <p>The retailer, which is run by the world\u2019s richest man, Jeff Bezos, will release its sales and profit figures for the first three months of the year (including the first few weeks of the lockdown in the UK and much of Europe and the US) on 30 April.</p> <p>Analysts forecast Amazon to report first-quarter revenues of $73bn (\u00a358bn). That would be up nearly 22% on the same quarter last year, and works out as sales of $10,000 every second, day and night.</p> <p>Sales at Amazon had already been increasing, but analysts at Bank of America say the lockdown has fuelled an \u201cunprecedented demand shift\u201d to online sellers.</p> <p>While most businesses have been hit hard by the impact of the pandemic and the looming recession, shares in Amazon have risen to a record high as hundreds of millions of people stuck indoors turn to the delivery giant to keep them fed and entertained.</p> <p>Josh Brown, chief executive of Ritholtz Wealth Management, said: \u201cAmazon became a utility in this crisis \u2013 defensive, reliable, indispensable.\u201d</p> <p>Analysts at the US investment bank Cowen likened the impact of the lockdown to the Black Friday shopping frenzy in November, or Amazon\u2019s own Prime Day sale in July. \u201cAmazon has seen an \u2018enormous increase in demand\u2019 as shoppers are forced to stay home, essentially creating an extended Prime Day/Black Friday type of situation,\u201d they wrote.</p> <p>Amazon\u2019s share price is up 42% in the past month, hitting a record high above $2,400 last week. One month ago they were changing hands at $1,689.</p> <p>At these prices the business is valued at $1.2tn, making it the third biggest US company after Microsoft ($1.35tn) and Apple ($1.25tn).</p> <p>The soaring share price has added to Bezos\u2019s already massive fortune. The man<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/25/jeff-bezos-the-boy-who-wanted-to-colonise-space\" title=\"\"> who started Amazon in his garage in 1994</a> and still owns 11% of the company\u2019s shares saw his paper fortune swell by $13bn this week alone to $145bn. He is now worth $40bn more than the second-richest person, Bill Gates, and holds almost double the wealth of third-placed Warren Buffett.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Amazon will remain one of the most important businesses during this crisis</p> <footer> <cite>Joshua Warner, IG Index</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bezos, who has donated $100m (\u00a380m) to the food bank charity Feeding America, has told staff he is concentrating on developing testing that should help Amazon staff keep working. In his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday, Bezos said Amazon had assembled a team of scientists and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build its own testing laboratory soon.</p> <p>\u201cRegular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Amazon is also rapidly hiring staff to keep up with demand from shoppers. The company said on Monday it was hiring an extra 75,000 staff to help it to process the increase in orders. Those new recruits come on top of 100,000 taken on already since the coronavirus crisis hit western economies last month. The additional workers will take Amazon\u2019s global workforce to nearly 1 million.</p> <p>Joshua Warner, an analyst at the London-based online trading firm IG Index, said: \u201cAmazon shines from all angles during the coronavirus crisis. Ultimately, Amazon will remain one of the most important businesses during this crisis, providing key services including food, entertainment and shopping at a time when consumers have fewer retailers to choose from.</p> <p>\u201cAmazon stock has rocketed to a new record high,\u201d he added. \u201cOf all the firms that might stand to benefit, Amazon is a clear winner.\u201d</p> <p> \u2022 This article was amended to correct the date for Amazon\u2019s reporting of its quarterly earnings. The earnings report is scheduled for 30 April. </p>",
  "<p>Paterson Riley was not thinking decades ahead or even months ahead when in 1972 he opened <a href=\"https://www.thegreatfroglondon.com/\" title=\"\">the Great Frog</a>, a small alternative jewellers off London\u2019s Carnaby Street. All the New Zealander wanted to do was make a quick buck, which is funny because hand-making jewellery isn\u2019t the easiest route to that, particularly when you\u2019re not a jeweller. But having acquired the shop in some hazy 1970s deal that was never entirely clear to the rest of his family, and realising that jewellery was what sold best there, jewellery is what he sold. \u201cAnd if a customer asked, \u2018Can you make me one like this?\u2019 he said, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d laughs his son, Reino Lehtonen-Riley, today. \u201cHe taught himself to make jewellery, because he needed the money. He never turned down a sale.\u201d</p> <p>Almost half a century later and Reino is running an international jewellery brand, best known for its handmade gothic designs in sterling silver or gold \u2013 grinning skull rings with hulking gemstones, ace of spades ear studs and dagger pendants. The Great Frog has been worn by Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lemmy\" title=\"\">Lemmy</a> and any number of heavy metal royalty you can think of, not to mention the Rolling Stones, Iggy Pop, Jay-Z, Lady Gaga, Kate Moss, Alexa Chung and Jared Leto.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9be8733874b8af7f0806ec35c766788602b0b202\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9be8733874b8af7f0806ec35c766788602b0b202/0_202_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord of the rings: Lemmy wearing a selection of silver jewellery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord of the rings: Lemmy wearing a selection of silver jewellery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Petersen/Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout the 70s and 80s, the shops \u2013 there was also one in Harrow and both were run by Paterson and his wife, Carol Lehtonen-Riley \u2013 came to the attention of bikers, goths, rockers, musicians and any one who harboured dreams of wearing a leather jacket.

It quickly became the ultimate accessory for the counter-culture. \u201cYou\u2019d see a certain type of person with tattoos and long hair walking down the road and you knew where they were going,\u201d says Reino. Family life was alternative and haphazard, too. \u201cThere were always a lot of adults around. They showed me how to fix bikes and forage for mushrooms \u2013 and my dad showed me how to make jewellery. It was normal to me, but you look back and realise it was like growing up in a Wes Anderson film \u2013 turning up at school aged 10 wearing cowboy boots and a fringed leather jacket,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting picked up by a Hells Angels biker on his chopper or by a car that\u2019s painted matt black to look like a hearse. These things were massively embarrassing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8cb20acfe590dfc872b4907e60ced34b03047e03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cb20acfe590dfc872b4907e60ced34b03047e03/230_283_1511_1472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"motorhead-ace-of-spades-ring-angled\" width=\"1000\" height=\"974\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I do all the carving and design in the same way it\u2019s been done since Roman times\u2019: Reino Lehtonen-Riley</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was then only a matter of time then before the teenage Reino developed a taste for the exact opposite of his parents\u2019 lifestyle and look. He took refuge in a short back and sides and a suburban preppie uniform of lilac polo shirts and chinos. He chose to study engineering at college. \u201cMy dad would look at me and say, \u2018You\u2019re no son of mine.\u2019\u201d Reino ended up in Australia working for Giorgio Armani \u2013 which is about as far from heavy metal jewellery as you can get in fashion. But it gave him a chance to learn more about retail on an entirely different scale to the Great Frog, and that gave him a useful perspective when Paterson called him back to England to help him close down the failing shop.</p> <p>Reino looked at the debts and realised they weren\u2019t that big. \u201cI knew it could be salvaged if we cut everything right back,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew the business and how to make jewellery, and I looked at the heritage \u2013 I\u2019d find these bags of press cuttings and hear my dad\u2019s stories \u2013 and I knew we had this amazing history. So we honed it down to the good stuff.\u201d Which makes it sound easy, but many years of inter-generational tension were to follow. \u201cEvery inch was hard. It was a huge personal battle between me and my dad. He thought I was losing the soul of the business. He was like: \u2018People want skulls! More bats! More fangs!

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Spain\u2019s PM to ask for extension of lockdown to 9 May</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, said he would ask parliament for a third 15-day extension of the lockdown imposed to curb one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks of coronavirus, taking the restrictions up to 9 May.</p> <p>Sanchez said he wanted to relax restrictions on children, who would be allowed out of their homes after 27 April, though that allowance would be \u201climited and subject to conditions to avoid contagion\u201d. He did not go into further details.</p> <h2>Restrictions to be lifted in some US states</h2> <p>Donald Trump, the US president, said Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to reopen on Monday while still observing coronavirus-related precautions, and Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday.</p> <p>Some state governors have warned that they will not act prematurely to reopen their economies until there is more testing for the virus, however. Business leaders have also told Trump the country needs to have widespread testing in place before their companies can return to normal operations.</p> <h2>Turkey\u2019s coronavirus cases overtake Iran to become highest in Middle East</h2> <p>Turkey\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases have risen to 82,329, Fahrettin Koca, the country\u2019s health minister, said.

  "<p>Term one at Australian schools did not so much end as unravel. Its final weeks were described by the New South Wales Teachers Federation as \u201cone of the most difficult school terms for the profession in living memory\u201d.</p> \n<p>Last weekend, the federal education minister, Dan Tehan, acknowledged arrangements will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/are-schools-open-closed-term-2-australia-coronavirus-easter-holidays\">differ across states and territories</a> in term two. \u201cThe <a href=\"https://ministers.dese.gov.au/tehan/minister-education-dan-tehan-and-chief-medical-officer-professor-brendan-murphy-press\">nationally consistent approach</a> is that, when it comes to parents who have to work, when it comes to vulnerable children, schools have to be open, and have to make sure that they provide a safe learning environment for those children.\u201d</p> \n<p>When the bulk of students return, Tehan and the NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, are suggesting a staggered approach. \u201cWe could consider a return of year 12 and kindergarten, followed by year seven and year six, and progressively pad that out,\u201d Gavrielatos <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/year-12-kindy-should-get-priority-when-school-goes-back-teachers-federation-20200409-p54inb.html\">said last week</a>.</p> \n<p>Until then, for many of Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4221.0\">four million students,</a> school is at home \u2013 but it\u2019s not home-schooling per se. \u201cHome-schooling is when you make, or buy, your own curriculum,\u201d says Rebecca English, a professor at Queensland University of Technology\u2019s faculty of education. \u201c[These families] are simply facilitating their children\u2019s learning at home.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/are-schools-open-closed-term-2-australia-coronavirus-easter-holidays\">Are schools open or closed for term 2 amid coronavirus in Australia?

The Victorian government is <a href=\"https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/victorian-students-to-learn-from-home-as-vce-timelines-revised/\">loaning</a> around 6,000 devices to students in need, and providing SIM cards or dongles to others. NSW has a <a href=\"https://education.nsw.gov.au/teaching-and-learning/curriculum/learning-from-home/leading-from-home/digital-equity-solutions#Assess0\">similar scheme</a>, prioritising year 12 students.

Matt Levinson lives in the Sydney suburb of Rozelle with his wife, Polly, a part-time physiotherapist at a hospital, and their children, Archer, nine, and Nina, 11. The couple took their children out of Rozelle public school three weeks ago when attendance in NSW <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-27/coronavirus-schools-disruption-as-covid19-causes-online-learning/12096560\">fell</a> to around 20%.</p> \n<p>Before Covid-19 struck, Levinson\u2019s job with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees was office-based but now he\u2019s at home. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job and I\u2019m so grateful for that,\u201d he says. But it\u2019s been stressful. \u201cThose moments when you\u2019re trying to get through work and be available to workmates as well as support your kids or, like, solve a technical problem with signing in to Zoom or [Google] classroom or whatever,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Space is tight in the family\u2019s cottage. \u201cWe got a second-hand desk for my daughter but my son and I are both at the kitchen table working. The learning environment is very much patched together.\u201d Meanwhile Levinson\u2019s work is \u201cabsolutely peaking\u201d, he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a worldwide crisis around preparing for the coronavirus response in refugee settlements.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf36de8058b425f6d9aaa7b5fad471bf89a7a2d5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf36de8058b425f6d9aaa7b5fad471bf89a7a2d5/0_77_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Levinson at home with his children Archer and Nina during coronavirus lockdowns\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Levinson at home with his children Archer and Nina during coronavirus lockdowns.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Levinson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Five Dock public school principal, Amanda Dawkins, understands parents\u2019 struggle. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are people out there thinking \u2018if I\u2019m not productive, I\u2019m going to lose the job\u2019.\u201d Dawkins says the wellbeing of Five Dock\u2019s school community, teachers and students is paramount and that her Monday virtual assemblies are to \u201ctry to keep kids connected at a time of great disconnect\u201d.</p> \n<p>The impact of isolation is everywhere, she says. \u201cTeachers have rung up and can\u2019t get parents off the phone because it\u2019s another adult to talk to. People are not used to being with their kids all the time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dawkins suspects some parents may have unrealistic expectations. \u201cIf they\u2019re expecting kids to be working six hours a day, good luck with that!\u201d she says. \u201cFor older children 30 to 45 minutes at a time is enough. For the little kids, it\u2019s 15 minutes. If they\u2019re getting wriggly or poking their sibling or there\u2019s a lot of sighing going on, it\u2019s time for a break.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve told families, if kids come back with the skills and knowledge they had when they left us, I\u2019m happy.

How will we manage the day?\u2019. Kids with agency are more likely to come along for the ride.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morning is best. \u201cKids start to lose the plot a bit after lunch,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if something isn\u2019t working, or they\u2019re not understanding the work, let it go. You always have tomorrow.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re struggling with the volume of work being sent home \u2013 and some of what I\u2019m hearing from the private schools is just incredibly onerous \u2013 then tell the teachers. They are still your touchstone if you get stuck with anything.\u201d</p> \n<p>High school teachers have up to 100 students across multiple classes,so be patient, English says. \u201cThis is the first time teachers have had to do this. Everyone\u2019s finding their feet and we need to be gentle with each other and with ourselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Samantha Thomas is the mother of a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old who attend a public high school in Melbourne. Thomas had arranged time off work to transition her children but was pleasantly surprised at the school\u2019s implementation of remote learning. \u201cIt\u2019s clear a really significant amount of work was done to create structured lessons that engage the kids,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been so smooth that I\u2019ve still been able to get quite a bit of work done myself.\u201d</p> \n<p>Key to her 12-year-old\u2019s success is how he\u2019s connected with a friend. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working as a pair \u2013 he\u2019s taken it onto himself to do that. It\u2019s been interesting to hear them help and motivate each other with work or things they don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s a really great skill for kids to learn as well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Both children workshopped a way to stay active by playing basketball in their lunch break. Again, says Thomas, it was their idea \u2013 not hers. \u201cAs a parent I probably underestimated their ability to problem solve and overcome challenges, including adapting to this new environment.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With children Nina and Archer, Levinson and his wife are encouraging longer-term projects steered by the children. \u201cTheir set work doesn\u2019t fill whole days and they can\u2019t go and play with their friends.

This time could potentially be a real boon. Everything is so siloed in school but I think we should be thinking more about integrating curriculum areas. We know from the research it\u2019s more interesting for students and teachers.</p> \n<p>Baking and gardening are examples, she says. \u201cWith baking a cake there\u2019s fractions and mass, mathematical concepts. Recipes are procedural texts and then you have elements of science, like, \u2018how does exposing this particular concoction to heat change it?\u2019. There is humanities and social sciences if you talk about your own baking experiences. You talk about intergenerationality and tell stories, which relates back to English.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dawkins says it will be interesting when all the students come back. \u201cThe kids at school have become quite close. It\u2019s really nice, they\u2019re playing together and working together.\u201d In general, she hopes the return will herald a time that is \u201csofter and less focused on the academic\u201d, she says. \u201cParents are getting to know their children, in some cases, and that\u2019s that\u2019s a really positive thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Levinson agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough but also a rare joy to have this time with my kids. I feel like I\u2019m seeing a totally different side of them, really understanding the way they work. When we go back to normality, assuming we do, this will be a time I will treasure.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>If you\u2019d told me a year ago I\u2019d one day be using Lego as a key teaching tool in the maths curriculum I\u2019d developed for my six-year-old son, I\u2019d have laughed in your face. Why on earth would I, a freelance journalist and TV critic, be teaching my child maths? Also: what is a curriculum?</p> <p>How quickly we\u2019ve all adapted to the new normal amid this Covid-19 chaos. I\u2019m just one of millions of Australian parents forced to step up and educate their progeny because of the state\u2019s strict lockdown laws; just one of millions who have found themselves fumbling through a bewildering online morning roll call, followed by a list of daily reading, writing and maths activities \u2013 and optional Lego challenges. We were already using the tiny Danish bricks as a tool to help with counting. Now, all of a sudden, they\u2019ve become an indispensable teaching aid.</p> <p>So you could say then that Nine\u2019s reality TV series Lego Masters has arrived back on our screens for its second season at just the right moment.

  "<p>In the Victorian high country town of Bright, hope for a strong recovery after a summer of devastating bushfires was given human form in the shape of the US singer Katy Perry.</p> <p>The pop star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2020/mar/11/racehorses-dog-sledges-and-a-jewish-feast-wednesdays-top-photos\">performed to a crowd of thousands at Bright on 11 March</a>, the first of a series of major events intended to bring tourists, and their wallets, back to fire-ravaged communities and put struggling businesses back on their feet.</p> <p>\u201cThe press coverage for Katy Perry we could not have purchased \u2013 it was just enormous,\u201d says the Alpine shire mayor, Peter Roper. \u201cIt was a really good, healing thing for the community to be able to take part in. I now know why she has got so many Instagram followers, she is really empathetic, a lovely person.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then, well, you know what happened next.\u201d</p> <p>Within hours of Perry\u2019s performance, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">World Health Organization declared a pandemic.</a> Two days later, the Australian government announced a ban on all mass gatherings of more than 500 people. The events that bushfire-affected communities throughout Victoria had planned were suddenly cancelled. Then came the ban on attending restaurants or cafes, and the ban on non-essential travel. The Easter school holidays, second only to the summer holidays in the number of tourists they bring to the coastal and highlands communities worst hit by the bushfires, were nixed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a1318d68a0e1279c9d9adbcd6b6fee148e0b65e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a1318d68a0e1279c9d9adbcd6b6fee148e0b65e/0_335_5057_3036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katy Perry meets locals before the Fight On concert for bushfire-affected communities at Pioneer Park Recreation Reserve in Bright\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katy Perry meets locals before the Fight On concert for bushfire-affected communities in Bright.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ross/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe bushfires cost us $90m,\u201d Roper says. \u201cI have not even bothered to work out what the Covid-19 is going to cost us because every day something new happens.\u201d</p> <p>When Guardian Australia spoke to tourism operators in bushfire-affected towns in January, their hope rested on a strong Easter. Local governments were promoting shop-and-stay holidays and city residents were promising to return to holiday towns such as Eden and Mallacoota with their wallets open. Instead, two months later, Sydney and Canberra residents have been told to stay away from their holiday houses on the NSW south coast lest they bring the coronavirus with them.</p> <p>Neil Triggs owns a brewery in Bruthen, in East Gippsland, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/09/life-will-go-on-battered-by-bushfire-east-gippsland-starts-to-pick-up-the-pieces\">lost his home in nearby Sarsfield in the bushfires</a>.

Thirty-three people also lost their lives.</p> <p>The total area burned was just over 10m hectares, or 1.6% of Australia\u2019s total landmass, across six states and territories.</p> <p>No one expected it would so swiftly be overshadowed by another global catastrophe.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute double-whammy,\u201d says the Indi MP, Helen Haines. \u201cPeople affected by bushfires are so generous and so resilient.

The first hearing of the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements on Thursday was held via webcast.</p> <p>And this week Haines held a local roundtable with the national bushfire recovery coordinator, Andrew Colvin, and 70 participants split across two days on Zoom.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a major rethink,\u201d says Haines. \u201cA linchpin of the first six months of bushfire recovery was around tourism and events, and that\u2019s gone.\u201d</p> <p>She has urged small businesses to take up available bushfire grants to help their businesses survive the shutdown, but says the inability to make an application in person, in regions that have both poor internet access and low digital literacy, was affecting the rollout of funds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/09/life-will-go-on-battered-by-bushfire-east-gippsland-starts-to-pick-up-the-pieces\">'Life will go on': battered by bushfire, East Gippsland starts to pick up the pieces</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others \u2013 particularly farmers in the Upper Murray region, where tens of thousands of cattle were lost \u2013 were ashamed to apply for grants, saying others had it worse than them, or were concerned it would make them look like a bad manager.</p> <p>\u201cBut in reality, they are very close to the bone,\u201d says Haines.</p> <p>The uptake of the $10,000 small business support grant has been 30 times greater in New South Wales than in Victoria.</p> <p>About 10,000 people across 17 eligible local government areas have applied in NSW and $100m in grants have been delivered. In Victoria, as of Thursday, just 331 applications have been received from the three eligible local government areas in that state, of which 267, worth $2.67m, have been paid out.</p> <p>A spokesman for Bushfire Recovery Victoria said the agency had simplified the application process after receiving community feedback that the process, which previously required businesses to provide proof of lost earnings in the form of a bank statement or BAS statement, was \u201csomewhat difficult\u201d. Including that information is now optional.</p> <p>\u201cWe therefore anticipate a big uptick in applications now this new, fast and easy process is in place,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> <p>Haines says the coronavirus control measures had only increased the need to get funds delivered to affected communities as soon as possible.</p> <p>\u201cI have had people say to me, in terms of their mental health: we do not need counselling, we need cash,\u201d she says. \u201cOur mental health would be a hell of a lot better if we got that cash straight away, and in the bank.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The IMF this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/apr/14/stock-markets-china-trade-global-recession-imf-forecasts-covid-19-business-live\">released projections</a> for the world economy over the next two years that were both optimistic and pessimistic.</p> <p>When the projections were released, I messaged a fellow economics journalist and suggested they were pretty optimistic \u2013 he replied that he hoped they would be correct because they were predicting it would only be the worst downturn <em>since</em> the Great Depression.</p> <p>Optimism comes in strange forms these days.</p> <p>The positive outlook of the IMF is that, while they predict Australia\u2019s GDP will fall by 6.7% this year (the worst fall since the Great Depression), they also predict it will rebound next year to rise by 6.1% (the best result since 1984 and second-strongest for 50 years).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/freezing-public-servant-wages-in-response-to-coronavirus-is-just-a-sop\">Freezing Australian public servant wages over coronavirus is just a sop | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That assessment suggested the IMF was predicting a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery.</p> <p>There is no real science to any of this, but economists and commentators like to talk about recessions in terms of the shapes of letters.</p> <p>\u201cV\u201d means basically an equally sharp fall and recovery, which is the most desired type (if you can desire a recession).

And yet not all is good.</p> <p>While it expects the economy to grow almost as fast in 2021 as it did in 1984, unlike then, it expects the unemployment rate to rise \u2013 from 7.6% this year to 8.9% by the end of next year.</p> <p>This is where the IMF is both optimistic and pessimistic.</p> <p>There is a pretty solid relationship between GDP growth and unemployment (known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okun%27s_law\">Okun\u2019s Law</a>) whereby the faster GDP grows the more the unemployment rate falls.</p> <p>Over the past 50 years, we have needed the economy to grow by around 3.2% to keep the unemployment rate steady. In the past 20 years or so this has come down a bit, so now around 3% is good enough.</p> <p>As a general rule, for every 1% that the economy grows above or below 3%, the unemployment rate will fall or rise 0.5%pts.</p> <p>So, for example, given the current unemployment rate is 5.2%, if the economy was to grow by only 2% in a year, you would expect the unemployment rate to rise 0.5%pts to 5.7%.</p> <p>Using the past 50 years as a guide, if the economy was to shrink by 6.7% in a year, as the IMF predicts, then the unemployment rate would be expected to rise by around 4.5%pts \u2013 which would take us up to 9.7%. And yet the IMF predicts unemployment this year to rise only to 7.6%.</p> <p>That is optimistic and takes into account the government\u2019s jobkeeper policy, which will see some people who would normally be classified as unemployed notionally still working.</p> <p>But there the optimism ends.</p> <p>While the IMF expects the economy to grow by 6.1% in 2021 \u2013 which would normally mean the unemployment rate should fall by around 1.5%pts \u2013 it predicts the unemployment rate to rise another 1.3%pts to 8.9%.</p> <p>What this means is that while production might \u201csnap back\u201d (to use the prime minister\u2019s phrase) we are likely in for a much tougher recovery on the employment front. Mining production may again ramp up, but labour-heavy sectors like tourism, hospitality and retail will be much slower to return to where we were just three months ago.</p> <p>It means reducing government stimulus will also need to be done with care because while a \u201cV\u201d shape recession is hoped for, rushing the recovery and abruptly cutting stimulus can very easily see the \u201cL\u201d shape become a reality.</p> <ul> <li><p>Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

The Liberty guys would do whatever they can to ensure that 10 teams are on the grid and competing next year.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to protect their own business I believe they would help to facilitate, which means paying, to ensure that those teams would be around to compete next year.\u201d</p> <p>Horner said F1\u2019s ongoing attempts to impose a lower budget cap \u2013 set at $175m in 2021 \u2013 is a misdirection for the sport, which is thinking too conservatively in its short-term efforts to control the damaging effects of the global pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/15/f1-decisive-action-budget-crisis-mclaren-andreas-seidl\">McLaren have argued for a decrease to $100m</a>, while F1\u2019s big three \u2013 Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari \u2013 spend more than $400m annually.</p> <p>Horner, however, says that some teams have used the budget cap debate as a chance to push their own agendas. \u201cTeams are competitive beasts, of course they are looking to use an angle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cap is a discussion about competitiveness, not about money. It\u2019s about trying to bring the top teams down to a level where the midfield teams feel they can compete. The reality is that whatever the level of spend there will always be teams that run at the front and teams that run at the back.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, the latest meeting failed to reach an agreement, with the idea of a cap of $145m, moving to $130m after a year, on the table. The big three argue their operations and development costs could not be compared with those of smaller teams and Horner insists his team cannot go below $140m. He is in favour of a two-tier cap, but also believes F1 should be more adventurous in considering how to deal with the short-term fiscal threat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/f1-teams-fail-to-agree-budget-cap-reduction-as-race-cancellations-bite\">F1 fails to agree budget reduction as smaller teams at risk of being lost</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf we were really serious about reducing the cost, particularly for the small teams, I would be in full favour of supplying for the next two years a full customer car,\u201d he said. \u201cThe smaller teams wouldn\u2019t need any R&amp;D. They would run just as race teams and they would reduce their costs enormously.\u201d</p> <p>The concept of customer cars is at odds with the sport\u2019s character of every team building their own prototypes. This has not always been the case, however, and Horner argued that the sport had to think more radically. \u201cWith the modern 3D photographic technology all teams utilise they are all trying to copy each other\u2019s cars anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cTimes change, things move.

There must be no question of casting health and economic security against each other \u2013 each is essential to the other.</p> <p>The only way to end a pandemic and have confidence in easing lockdowns is with three vital tools: tests, treatments and vaccines. Rapid diagnostic tests so that we can track the virus, isolate those infected and shield the vulnerable. Effective medicines to save lives and reduce the severity and impact of the disease on our health systems. And vaccines to protect people and prevent transmission.</p> <p>Without these tools, we risk a rolling cycle of lockdowns and distancing measures as outbreaks ebb and flow around the world for months, if not years, to come.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"534cfdb58639fe3e71acf1213b491b0cbec02e96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/534cfdb58639fe3e71acf1213b491b0cbec02e96/0_15_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump has withdrawn US funding for the World Health Organization.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leah Millis/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These tools will only come from scientific research and innovation. Only 100 days since the virus\u2019s genome was sequenced, clinical trials are already testing well over 100 potential vaccines and drugs.

If secured from governments and private sector donations in the next few weeks, this money can help achieve the scale of research and development we need.

More will be needed to ensure that no matter where they are developed, all tests, treatments and vaccines are available to everyone in the world who needs them and at an affordable price. For as long as Covid-19 is out of control somewhere, it is a threat to us all.</p> <p>Science is the exit strategy, but as the European commission has recognised with its planned pledging conference, it will take a monumental global effort to tackle this virus. Governments, businesses and organisations across the whole of society, many not usually involved in public health, have to play essential roles.</p> <p>We cannot afford to pay any more attention to our geographic, social and political borders than the virus does.

Covid-19 gives the party the opportunity it needs. Funds and states are operating in a market where the tendency towards monopoly was already established.</p> <p>The 2008 crash, like recessions before it, concentrated economic power, as large firms used their resources and access to finance to ensure their survival. But, unlike in the last century, a multitude of rival businesses did not emerge once recession had passed, to provide competition and new employment opportunities for workers wanting to raise their wages by switching firms. In 2016, according to the Resolution Foundation, Britain\u2019s 100 biggest firms <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/comment/time-to-concentrate-on-our-capitalism/\">accounted for 23% of total revenue</a> across the economy, up by a quarter since 2004.

Big governments \u2013 and this crisis is making governments bigger than ever \u2013 will welcome them, because they want the convenience of dealing with big businesses, not with tens of thousands of small and medium-size firms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Complaints about tax-exile billionaires wanting other people\u2019s money are a warning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Do you begin to see how popular fury might build?

Big business trampling over all who might challenge it.

Then there were human villains: bankers and captured regulators who broke the financial system, northern Europeans who congratulated themselves as they let southern Europe collapse. Now there\u2019s just an invisible infectious agent that wants only to replicate itself. The similarities remain striking, for all that. Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, like leaders across the west, weren\u2019t interested in jailing bankers or making them pay back their bonuses. Their sole concern was to stop the collapse of the banking system. The morality of the bailout could wait \u2013 forever, as it turned out. Everywhere in the west, the public reaction was the same. Democracy was a racket. Taxpayers had to rescue the richest people in the world and then suffer years of stagnant wages and cut public services to meet the bill. If you need a one-line explanation for populism, this is the best there is.</p> <p>Yet again, vast amounts of public money are being committed, but instead of stagnation we face catastrophe. Nervous commentators reference how the Great Depression of the 1930s fuelled nazism and communism, as 2008 fuelled populism, and dread what awaits us. They should know there is no necessary link between economic and political failure. Far from enabling tyranny, the economic crisis of the 1970s, for instance, saw the end of the rightwing tyrannies in Spain, Portugal and Greece and the beginning of the decline and fall of the Soviet empire.

  "<p>Covid-19 is a human disaster. However, for one group of animals, there may be a silver lining. Pangolins are one of the most heavily trafficked animals in the world, and as a result they are endangered. But in the past few weeks they have been linked to the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 disease in China. The evidence is inconclusive, but it has already prompted the Chinese government to take action. If more actions against the wildlife trade follow, the incident could prove to be a turning point for pangolin conservation.</p> <p>A key question is where Covid-19 came from. Many animals carry coronaviruses and are potential sources of infection. That is important to know, if only because it should help us prevent future outbreaks. Several ideas have been proposed, but arguably the most dramatic is that pangolins were the source.</p> <h2><strong>World\u2019s most trafficked mammal</strong></h2> <p>Pangolins look like scaly anteaters. Uniquely among mammals, their bodies are covered in hard protective scales made of keratin: the same material as our nails. They feed on insects such as ants and termites, and are often nocturnal and shy. While they look like anteaters, they are not closely related to them, and their closest living relatives are actually carnivorans: the group that includes wolves and cats.</p> <p>There are eight species of <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/pangolin\">pangolin</a>. Four live in Africa and four in Asia. All are at risk of extinction, according to the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). Two of the African species are <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12766/123586126\">considered</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12765/123585768\">vulnerable</a> and two <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12767/123586469\">are</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12762/123584478\">endangered</a>. Of the Asian species, one is <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12761/123583998\">endangered</a> while the other three <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12764/123585318\">are</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12763/123584856\">critically</a> <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/136497/123586862\">endangered</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>If animals are in closely packed, unsanitary conditions with many people nearby it is easier for a virus to jump species</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Pangolins are <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/11855-Podcast-Why-are-pangolins-so-prized-in-China-\">illegally hunted and traded</a> for <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/11538-Pangolins-The-multimillion-dollar-mammal\">two main reasons</a>.

Two scientists there, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2004160486_Yongyi_Shen\">Yongyi Shen</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_0mQSasAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Lihua Xiao</a>, were said to have compared coronaviruses from pangolins and from humans infected in the outbreak. The viruses\u2019 genetic sequences were said to be 99% similar. One co-author, Wu Chen of Guangzhou Zoo, had previously helped show that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11110979\">Sunda pangolins carry coronaviruses</a>.</p> <p>However, the results had not been published at that stage, so other scientists could not examine them in detail. Meanwhile, there were many other possibilities. The virus could have come from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-00166-6\">an animal and seafood market in Wuhan</a>, where many species were held. Animals in such markets are often kept in closely packed, unsanitary conditions, with many people nearby: a perfect opportunity for a virus to jump species. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7\">Many pointed the finger at bats</a>: the virus is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30251-8\">genetically similar</a> to those in bats, and it would not be the first time a disease passed from bats to humans.

On 20 February the researchers posted <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.951335\">a preliminary version of the study</a> on the preprint site bioRxiv. The conclusions were radically different to what was described at the press conference. While the pangolin virus was \u201cgenetically related\u201d to the one infecting humans, it was \u201cunlikely to be directly linked to the outbreak because of the substantial sequence differences\u201d. The 99% similarity was only in one region of the genome. Across the entire genome, the similarity was only 90.3%. There had been an \u201c<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-00548-w\">embarrassing miscommunication between the bioinformatics group and the lab group of the study</a>\u201d. When contacted by the <em>Observer</em>, Xiao declined to comment.</p> <h2><strong>A halt to the wildlife trade?</strong></h2> <p>However, the Chinese government was already lurching into action. On 24 February, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/coronavirus-china-animals-wild-eat-ban-wildlife-market-pangolin-dogs-cats-a9358496.html\">China announced an immediate ban on trading and eating many wild animals, including pangolins</a>. Officials began <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24532723-900-china-has-shut-all-of-its-wild-animal-markets-it-was-long-overdue/\">shutting down wild animal markets</a> across the country.</p> <p>This was the latest in a series of steps that ought to reduce the pangolin trade. Back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/28/pangolins-thrown-a-lifeline-at-global-wildlife-summit-with-total-trade-ban\">the international trade in pangolins was entirely banned</a> by the 183 nations that signed up to the <a href=\"https://cites.org/eng\">Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites). All eight pangolin species were placed in Appendix I of the Convention, giving them the strictest protection currently possible.</p> <p>However, so far this does not seem to have resulted in a drop in the number of pangolins traded, says <a href=\"https://www.traffic.org/about-us/our-organisation/our-staff/\">Xu Ling</a>, China director at wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic. <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/wwf-response-to-cites-agenda-items-on-pangolins\">The trade continues</a> but the nature of the shipments has changed. \u201cBefore 2016 we could find frozen pangolin bodies, the meat smuggled in from other parts of south-east Asia to China,\u201d says Ling. Nowadays most shipments are purely pangolin scales. Often they come from Africa, after being <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-pangolins-idUSKBN1W40S5\">illicitly shipped out via Nigeria</a>.</p> <p>More recently, in August 2019, China\u2019s state insurance providers announced that they would <a href=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/asia/news/breaking-news/chinese-insurers-to-stop-covering-pangolinbased-medicines-176735.aspx\">stop covering medicines made from pangolin scales</a>. <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/11880-China-s-state-insurers-have-stopped-covering-pangolin-medicines\">The move took effect in January 2020</a>.</p> <p>Against this background, it is unclear what impact China\u2019s new ban on eating wild meat will have on pangolins. \u201cEven without this ban, pangolin meat consumption was forbidden in China,\u201d says Ling, as pangolins had protected status. This was reflected in the shift to importing scales. These are only legal if they come from certified sources but, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/science-environment-51726617\">as so often happens</a>, the traders find ways around that. In the longer term, the loss of insurance funding may undercut the scale market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b953afa8156989e2e58c299ddf030de6aaddb55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b953afa8156989e2e58c299ddf030de6aaddb55/0_324_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner reading \u201cWe are all pangolins\u201d hangs on a blacony in Bordeaux, southwestern France, on March 19\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner reading \u201cWe are all pangolins\u201d hangs on a blacony in Bordeaux, southwestern France, on March 19</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The truth about pangolins and Covid-19</strong></h2> <p>Meanwhile, the idea that pangolins played a role in the emergence of Covid-19 has not gone away.</p> <p>On 17 March, a team led by <a href=\"https://andersen-lab.com/people/\">Kristian Andersen</a> at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, published <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9\">a detailed analysis of the virus\u2019s possible origin</a> in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. They say the ultimate source is likely to be bats, just as it was for the two other coronavirus outbreaks of recent years: Sars and Mers. Bats are a known reservoir of coronaviruses. Furthermore, intermediate horseshoe bats are known to carry <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7\">a virus called RaTG13, whose genome is 96% identical to that of Sars</a><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7\">-CoV-2</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the bat serves as the reservoir for this,\u201d says Andersen. The question is how the virus travelled from bats to humans. \u201cWe are entertaining two different scenarios.\u201d</p> <p>The key question is how the virus acquired certain sequences of its genome, which allow it to bind strongly to human cells and thus infect them. The bat virus does not have these sequences.</p> <p>One possibility is that the bat virus made the jump to humans several months before the outbreak was detected. These early viruses would not have been especially infectious or dangerous, but they could have mutated and evolved to acquire the key genetic sequences that made them infectious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>While the pangolin virus is less similar to Sars-CoV-2 than the bat virus, its genome has the crucial binding sequences.</p> <footer> <cite>Kristian Andersen, researcher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The alternative possibility is that there was an intermediate host. \u201cThat\u2019s where the pangolins come in,\u201d says Andersen. While the pangolin virus as a whole is less similar to Sars-CoV-2 than the bat virus, the pangolin virus genome does have the crucial binding sequences. This is what Shen, Xiao and their colleagues found \u2013 and it has now been supported by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.03.022\">a further study</a> from another Chinese group.</p> <p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2169-0\">a study published on 26 March in </a><em><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2169-0\">Nature</a></em> discovered viruses closely related to Sars-CoV-2 in pangolins that had been smuggled into China. These viruses had binding sequences similar to those in the human viruses.</p> <p>\u201cWhere it\u2019s really important is where they\u2019re identical,\u201d says Andersen. \u201cWhile the bat virus overall is more similar, in the regions where it really matters it\u2019s actually quite different.\u201d</p> <p>This suggests that the bat and pangolin viruses met, perhaps in the same host, and exchanged genes. Some of the bat viruses ended up with the key binding sequences from the pangolin viruses, enabling them to infect humans and unleash a pandemic. \u201cRecombination is frequent in these types of viruses,\u201d says Andersen. \u201cIt\u2019s speculative, but it\u2019s highly likely that that\u2019s how we ended up with this new virus.\u201d</p> <p>A similar story played out before the Sars outbreak of 2002-2004. The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506735102\">original source</a> of the virus was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1118391\">wild bats</a>, and in 2017 researchers managed to identify <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698\">a cave in China where the bats carry viruses that are virtually identical to Sars</a>. However, the virus was probably passed to humans via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/24/china.sars\">civets</a>, which are cat-like animals, leading to China imposing <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.301.5636.1031a\">a temporary ban on selling civets</a>. The more recent Mers outbreak probably moved from bats to humans via camels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95a635223e482f58b2444eca6c3f1246f9d4f6af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95a635223e482f58b2444eca6c3f1246f9d4f6af/0_294_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A seizure by the Singaporean authorities of over 12 tonnes of pangolin scales, April 9, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A seizure by the Singaporean authorities of over 12 tonnes of pangolin scales, April 9, 2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Parks Board/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, says Andersen, we cannot yet be sure which scenario is correct. Even if there was an intermediate host, it may not have been pangolins.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot conclude if pangolins are indeed [the] intermediate species,\u201d agrees virologist <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arinjay_Banerjee\">Arinjay Banerjee</a> of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.</p> <h2><strong>Ending demand</strong></h2> <p>The question of whether pangolins contributed to the Covid-19 outbreak will not be settled any time soon. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to be a long, drawn-out question,\u201d says Andersen. Resolving the origin of Sars took years.</p> <p>But it may be crucial to ending the pangolin trade, because doing so requires two things. The first is strict enforcement of the rules, which China seems to want to do \u2013 it was stepping up enforcement even before the outbreak. The second is for people to stop buying pangolin products. If there is no demand, the illegal trade will become unprofitable, and suppliers will abandon it.</p> <p>\u201cJust the fact there\u2019s been all this publicity about the potential link to pangolins will probably lead to plummeting demand for them,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.traffic.org/about-us/our-organisation/our-staff/\">Richard Thomas</a>, head of communications at Traffic in Cambridge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>More than 90% of Chinese say they would support a total ban on the trade in wild animals, no matter what the purpose</p> <footer> <cite>Chinese conservation survey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is evidence that he is right. According to <a href=\"https://www.iccs.org.uk/person/yuhan-li\">Yuhan Li</a> of the University of Oxford, Chinese conservation organisations have been circulating a questionnaire on social media to see how people\u2019s attitudes have shifted. More than 100,000 people have responded, and <a href=\"https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/blog/chinas-announcement-on-wildlife-trade-whats-new-and-what-does-it-mean/\">more than 90% say they would support a total ban on the trade in wild animals</a>, no matter what the intended purpose. It is unclear if people will stick to this once the Covid-19 crisis has passed, but Ling is planning a campaign to strengthen opposition.</p> <p>The realisation that <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/coronavirus-has-finally-made-us-recognise-the-illegal-wildlife-trade-is-a-public-health-issue-133673\">wildlife markets allow diseases to spread to people</a> may spur action. When China announced the ban, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) called it \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wwfchina.org/?5881/WWF-Statement-on-revision-of-Wild-Animals-Protection-Law-in-China\">a timely, necessary and critical step</a>\u201d \u2013 not just for safeguarding the wild animals, but for human health. \u201cThis public health crisis must serve as a wake-up call to end the unsustainable use of endangered animals and their parts, whether as exotic pets, for food consumption or for their perceived medicinal value.\u201d</p> <p>In the best-case scenario, it will not just be pangolins that benefit. Reducing the demand for illegally traded wildlife will help many species \u2013 and protect us all from future pandemics into the bargain.</p>",

The rise was slightly lower than Friday, when an additional 585 deaths were recorded. The number of overall coronavirus cases rose to 191,726 on Saturday from 188,068 on Friday, the country\u2019s health ministry added.</p> <h2>UK\u2019s Covid-19 hospital death toll surpasses 15,000</h2> <p>In the UK, the official Covid-19 death toll has passed 15,000 \u2013 with 888 new fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours. It means as of 5pm on Friday, of those hospitalised in the UK who have tested positive for coronavirus, 15,464 people have died.</p> <p>Robert Jenrick, the local government secretary, said during the UK\u2019s daily briefing that a significant consignment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/nhs-frontline-staff-may-refuse-to-work-over-lack-of-coronavirus-ppe-says-union-unison\">PPE is due to arrive from Turkey on Sunday</a>, which will include 400,000 gowns.</p> <h2><strong>Bangladesh garment workers pack streets to demand wages during coronavirus lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Hundreds of workers in Bangladesh have taken to the streets in defiance of physical distancing rules to demand unpaid wages during the Covid-19 shutdown.</p> <p>The country, which is the world\u2019s second-largest clothing producer after China, is predicted to lose about $6bn (\u00a34.8bn) of export revenues this financial year as retailers and brands across the world cancel orders.</p> <p>The government sent troops out into the streets to help enforce a shutdown on travel and restrictions on gatherings.</p> <h2>New York daily death toll at two-week low</h2> <p>Deaths in New York State rose by 540 on Friday, the lowest daily death tally since the beginning of April.</p> <p>Andrew Cuomo, the state\u2019s governor, said new hospital admissions stayed around the 2,000-patient mark, which he said was still an \u201coverwhelming number\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Cuomo said \u201cthis is no time for division\u201d and that the pandemic was the \u201cgreatest challenge since world war two\u201d following an attack on Twitter by US president Donald Trump.</p> <h2>Some shops in Iran have reopened as country\u2019s daily death toll fell to 73</h2> <p>Iran allowed some businesses in the capital Tehran to reopen on Saturday as the country\u2019s daily death toll from coronavirus fell to 73, its lowest in more than a month.</p> <p>So-called low-risk businesses \u2013 including many shops, factories and workshops \u2013 resumed operations in Tehran, a week after reopening in the rest of the country, state television said.</p> <h2>Croatia extends its lockdown for another 15 days</h2> <p>Croatia is extending its coronavirus lockdown for another 15 days, but a minister says the country is exploring the possibility of gradually easing restrictions.</p> <p>Shops, bars, restaurants and schools were closed a month ago, with public transport also stopped, leaving open only food stores, pharmacies and petrol stations.

Those of us lucky enough \u2013 so far \u2013 to be personally untouched by death and suffering are inevitably wondering: when can we stop living in fear? What can we do to end this physical isolation?</p> <p>To this end, technology companies have put on their \u201ckind capitalism\u201d hats and launched into fix-it mode.

The only catch, the techno-capitalists tell us, is that <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/10/coronavirus-pandemic-surveillance-privacy-big-data/\">we have to trust them and change our privacy expectations</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/tech-coronavirus-surveilance-state-digital-disrupt\">The tech \u2018solutions\u2019 for coronavirus take the surveillance state to the next level | Evgeny Morozov</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Globally, governments and their private sector partners have already turned to physical- and <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2020/03/rise-bio-surveillance-state\">bio-surveillance</a> to contain the pandemic. The Russian government is reportedly using facial surveillance technology to <a href=\"https://news.trust.org/item/20200319132732-2c3av\">\u201ccatch\u201d those who may have violated quarantine orders</a>. Various European countries have embraced the use of tech tools including AI-powered \u201clie-detector tests\u201d and drones for \u201cmigration management\u201d and \u201cpopulation control\u201d; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/opinion/coronavirus-surveillance-privacy-rights.html\">alarmed</a> human rights specialists worry about a discriminatory impact on already vulnerable refugees.</p> <p>In the US, Google and Apple have joined forces to create their own panoptic solution. Together, these tech rivals promise to leverage their existing control over <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-10/apple-google-bring-covid-19-contact-tracing-to-3-billion-people\">3 billion</a> people\u2019s operating systems and phones to \u201ccontact trace\u201d, enabling third parties (governments and private entities) to know if users have crossed paths with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19.</p> <p>While some of this may sound hopeful, the intertwining of our existing massive surveillance infrastructure with public health goals should sound many alarms. The developing notion that biometric and location data are now health data is itself misleading. The dangerous conflation glosses over the real problems and differential outcomes that arise when our public health infrastructure becomes linked to profit-based data gathering.</p> <p>By re-packaging their surveillance systems as public health services, technology companies and state authorities are softening opposition to surveillance capitalism, even re-purposing it as a social good, and undermining existing critique. A Customs and Border Protection commissioner, for example, recently <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/\">re-framed the much criticized use of face surveillance at the border as a \u201chygienic\u201d technology</a> that can protect travelers from Covid-19.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We can use this moment to contain the virus while critically interrogating the totalitarian possibilities embedded in unbridled data collection</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The false dichotomy between health and privacy also masks the critical role that contact tracing and other forms of surveillance and data collection have already played in exacerbating the very real disparate impacts of this pandemic on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/coronavirus-race.html\">particular minority communities</a>. In the pre-pandemic world, the personal data that enables contact tracing was used by <a href=\"https://www.cognizant.com/InsightsWhitepapers/US-Consumer-Banks-and-the-Potential-of-Location-Based-Offers-codex1279.pdf\">banks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90395905/experian-just-invested-in-a-location-data-company\">credit score agencies</a> to help tag, measure and rank us. This scoring in turn <a href=\"https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/classification-situations.pdf\">classified us, entrenching existing socio-economic inequalities</a> by controlling access to housing, loans and even health insurance.</p> <p>So, while surveillance has some potential to mitigate the pandemic, it also has the very real potential to produce anti-democratic, discriminatory practices and structures at a broad, global scale. Once a technology is built and data gathered, it can be used for many purposes beyond that for which it was originally intended. NSO Group, a corporate spyware firm infamous for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/opinion/whatsapp-nso-group-spy.html\">enabling the surveillance of journalists and activists</a>, is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/surveillance-company-nso-supplying-data-analysis-to-stop-virus\">reportedly re-purposing its technology to contract trace</a>. How will the data they collect be stored? When will it be discarded? How else might it be used?</p> <p>There are two paths before us. We can blindly accept that technology capitalism will liberate us from this pandemic and the physical isolation that has come with it. Or we can use this moment to responsibly contain the virus while critically interrogating the totalitarian possibilities embedded in unbridled data collection. If we choose to remain critical, then we must demand massive restrictions on collection, the construction of data walls, and the maintenance of existing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/30/san-francisco-ban-facial-recognition-surveillance\">biometric surveillance bans</a>. We must also ensure that any data collected be used only to combat the spread of the virus and be deleted in a timely manner.</p> <p>Even in a pandemic \u2013 perhaps especially in a pandemic \u2013 data collection, classification, management and use are inherently political. No matter how much we long to return to \u201cnormal,\u201d we must be weary of becoming further imprisoned by the for-profit use of our data. In both controlling the pandemic and rebuilding our worlds, we must remember not to trade our physical isolation for the cages of surveillance capitalism.</p> <ul> <li><p>Veena Dubal is an associate professor of law at the University of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a>, Hastings</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Isolation draws us into a closer relationship with the telly but food TV offers more than just a chance to catch up on recipes and techniques. Over recent years, programmes have moved away from \u201cstand and stir\u201d and are now an excellent excuse for all manner of science, cultural history, humour, escapism and pure entertainment.</p> <h2>1 Anthony Bourdain</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=anthony+bourdain&amp;i=instant-video&amp;crid=2Y3D0VKSXGDVC&amp;sprefix=anthony+%2Cinstant-video%2C154&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_4_8\">Amazon Prime</a>, 2002-2018</em></p> <p>I love a tight 27 minutes on thrifty ways with mince as much as the next food nerd but, with everyone else gone to bed and everything else going to hell, it\u2019s always going to be me and Anthony Bourdain. I love the early stuff such as <em>A Cook\u2019s Tour </em>(2002-3, Food Network/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/B074HVRJNT/ref=atv_dp_cnc_1_11\">Amazon Prime</a>) which see him reeling around Ho Chi Minh City, dressed like Joe Strummer and jabbering into a lo-fi, hand-held video camera. But there is so much more to choose from. <em>No Reservations</em><em> </em>(2005-12,Travel Channel/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Penang/dp/B07R3D818R/ref=sr_1_1?crid=197N7ORV9N6XD\">Amazon Prime</a>) allowed Bourdain nine seasons to develop his compelling combination of chill and total engagement with his subject. By around season four, any idea of \u201ccelebrity chef\u201d is subsumed in a search for challenging locations, fascinating and underrepresented people and increasingly honest examinations of his own flawed past.<em> Parts Unknown</em> (2013-18, CNN/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/detail/B07T1RCR4Z/ref=atv_dp_cnc_1_4\">Amazon Prime</a>) contains my two favourite episodes. New Jersey (season 5, episode 6) is an elegiac film that sees him visiting his childhood home with his brother, and in Rome (season 8, episode 9) he is guided around the city by Asia Argento, with whom he later formed a relationship.</p> <h2>2 Chef\u2019s Table</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80007945\">Netflix</a>, 2015-present</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76fc6891708e22224173ea68de6f8d8da6af094b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76fc6891708e22224173ea68de6f8d8da6af094b/0_1217_1867_1120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asma Kahn in series 6 of Chef\u2019s Table.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asma Kahn in series 6 of Chef\u2019s Table.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NETFLIX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did you enjoy <em>This Is Spinal Tap </em>or the <em>The Life of Rock with Brian Pern</em>? The comedy of spoof \u201crockumentary\u201d lies in the uncalibrated self-regard of the subjects and the breathless complicity of the film-maker, so you\u2019re going to love <em>Chef\u2019s Table</em>. From the bombastic Vivaldi over the titles to the shots of Dan Barber, running while philosophising, or Francis Mallmann on his private island, hewing logs and talking about the creative power of sex, it\u2019s difficult to imagine that the first series wasn\u2019t all an expensively executed troll. But that was back in 2015, when we wanted our chefs to be artist/gods/rockstars of their generation and American documentary-makers still had little enough irony to support the idea.</p> <p>As the series progressed they began to profile more female chefs and some of the resulting shows are outstanding. Jeong Kwan, cooking at the Chunjinam Hermitage in South Korea is therapeutic to watch, Cristina Martinez at the South Philly Barbacoa and Mashama Bailey at The Grey in Savannah, Georgia are inspiring, and our own Asma Khan is given space to properly expand on Indian food in the UK. Someone, somewhere turned down the ego dial.</p> <h2>3 The Mind of a Chef</h2> <p><em>PBS, 2012-2017</em><em> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/mindofachefseries/631307120709693/\">season 6 on Facebook</a></em></p> <p>Takes a similarly hagiographic approach as <em>Chef\u2019s Table</em> but allows each featured chef more space to cook. Gabrielle Hamilton \u2013 troubled, driven, phenomenally talented \u2013 comes across particularly well. It\u2019s probably to her credit that our own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/13/april-bloomfield-chef-new-york\">April Bloomfield</a> actually looks uncomfortable throughout her episodes, awkwardly attempting Delia-esque presentation while the directors try to extract some sort of life philosophy or grandiose soundbite out of her. It\u2019s actually charming and should make us proud.</p> <h2>4 The Taco Chronicles</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81040704\">Netflix</a>, 2019</em></p> <p>Carlos Perez Osorio\u2019s show will make you believe that there might actually be a future for intelligent food programmes on TV. Each of the six half-hour episodes covers a different type of taco in obsessive depth. The show is in Spanish and subtitled, a serious deep dive into the subject, but delivered with a brilliant tone \u2013 fantastically, poetically hyperbolic about street food, enthusiastic but self-aware.</p> <h2>5 Madhur Jaffrey\u2019s Flavours of India</h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p05rtvrt/madhur-jaffreys-flavours-of-india\">BBC iPlayer</a>, 1995</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f7e271072adf0010ef81b3342c04fa29b5ad4cca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7e271072adf0010ef81b3342c04fa29b5ad4cca/0_34_1712_2138/801.jpg\" alt=\"Madhur Jaffrey on the BBC\u2019s Flavours of India: \u2018Calm, dignified and utterly no-nonsense.\u2019\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Madhur Jaffrey on the BBC\u2019s Flavours of India: \u2018Calm, dignified and utterly no-nonsense.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC PHOTOLIBRARY</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>BBC iPlayer is a positive treasure vault of old favourites, offering a great deal of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b03j86yd/floyd-on-france\">Keith Floyd\u2019s </a>unhinged, plonk-fuelled pan-rattling and Ken Hom\u2019s masterful <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p05rsy31/ken-homs-chinese-cookery-rice\">Chinese Cooking</a></em>.

  "<h2>Johan Lundgren, chief executive, easyJet</h2> <p>For Lundgren, memories of one particular meeting underline just how swiftly coronavirus turned from a distant Chinese problem into an insurmountable block on aviation.</p> <p>It was 3 March and Lundgren was in Brussels for a summit of A4E \u2013 an airline association that includes carriers such as easyJet, Ryanair, BA, Lufthansa, and Air France-KLM. The main subjects for discussion were airspace management and green targets. With coronavirus restrictions at that point limited to northern Italy, Ryanair said plummeting demand would be a short-term blip.</p> <p>Lundgren says: \u201cI remember some companies were saying it wouldn\u2019t have a big impact. And I said, \u2018We don\u2019t know anything about this. It\u2019s very uncertain \u2013 you can never tell.\u2019 I wish I had been wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Four weeks later, easyJet\u2019s entire 337-strong fleet was grounded.</p> <p>\u201cFirst and foremost it was a public health issue, so the focus was on the wellbeing of our people and customers. It\u2019s one of those things: when the virus first hits you and you get the first reported case, it becomes very, very real.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, easyJet had only one reported coronavirus case among operating crew, and the airline does not know if they contracted the disease on board.</p> <p>The majority of easyJet employees around Europe have been put on furlough \u2013 just over half of them in the UK scheme. \u201cWe had around 14,000 staff, and now there are about 650 people working, almost all from home.\u201d</p> <p>He holds daily remote conferences with his team and tries to communicate with the whole company via Facebook\u2019s Workplace platform. He says those employees who have not been furloughed staff have never worked harder: \u201cPeople are flat out \u2026 It\u2019s the biggest crisis aviation has ever gone through.\u201d</p> <p>For Lundgren, the main focus is financial \u2013 \u201cgetting access to liquidity, and to reduce the cash burn so we can survive and manage a prolonged scenario\u201d. That has included renegotiating a \u00a34.5bn contract with Airbus for new aircraft \u2013 a deal that has been the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/easyjet-agrees-delay-with-airbus-on-delivery-of-24-new-aircraft\" title=\"\">broadsides from easyJet\u2019s founder and biggest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou</a>, who last week called for Lundgren to be sacked.</p> <p>The easyJet chief says keeping in touch with staff is vital: \u201cClearly there are a lot of people out there sitting at home, without work, concerned, who want to get back flying. You want to be sure that as we go through this crisis, you don\u2019t leave them out. But it\u2019s hard. We\u2019re not getting everything right.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/10/airlines-law-refunds-voucher-schemes-coronavirus\" title=\"\">EasyJet has been criticised for not automatically offering refunds</a>, and for being slow to cancel flights when restrictions meant passengers were unlikely to travel. Lundgren says the company has been doing its best: \u201cYou make sure you look after, as much as you can, your customers during this process \u2013 and that\u2019s difficult. We\u2019ve got customer call centres in countries affected by the lockdown, that have been operating with limited access when the demand has been very high.\u201d</p> <p>The airline is maintaining \u2013 rather than mothballing \u2013 its fleet, so the planes can be ready to fly again at 15 days\u2019 notice, and Lundgren says the airline is in daily communication with EASA, the European safety regulator, about measures that could be needed for flights to restart \u2013 from disinfecting planes to blocking off middle seats.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to do it in a way that\u2019s safe, orderly and matches the demand that\u2019s out there. But at the same time, no one knows what will happen.\u201d<br><strong>Gwyn Topham</strong></p> <h2>Philip Jansen, chief executive, BT</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e242186b3ff9987b3d2d622b3e0964c9ea878e3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e242186b3ff9987b3d2d622b3e0964c9ea878e3d/0_418_6916_4149/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT. \u2018My priorities were to keep customers connected and staff safe.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT. \u2018My priorities were to keep customers connected and staff safe.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The coronavirus outbreak hit home for Jansen when he became the first FTSE-100 boss to be <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/bt-chief-executive-philip-jansen-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\" title=\"\">publicly confirmed </a><a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/bt-chief-executive-philip-jansen-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\" title=\"\">as infected with the virus, in mid-March.</a></p> <p>At that time, BT had already started changing the way it worked in some territories. \u201cWe had started in China, Hong Kong, Italy and Spain at the end of February and early March, as social distancing and lockdowns were implemented,\u201d he says. \u201cThen it became clear that the virus was in the UK. We were a little bit ahead because of our experience in other countries.</p> <p>\u201cThe week I began to have symptoms, the advice was to come to work but keep your distance. I turned up to meetings with the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and new Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes \u2013 and deliberately didn\u2019t shake their hands.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the second week of March, when Jansen tested positive and self-isolated with his family at their second home in Devon, the UK had recorded only 11 deaths and almost 800 cases.</p> <p>\u201cI had mild symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cI was always up early, always working. My most important priorities were to keep customers connected and keep our staff safe.\u201d</p> <p>He continued to lead the company and his first job was to film a six-minute video for the 120,000 employees of BT, which includes mobile operator EE as well as Openreach, which runs the UK\u2019s broadband network.</p> <p>When the lockdown started, BT immediately saw a doubling of broadband usage as the country became housebound. Staff absence, due to self-isolation or sickness, is a particular problem. At times up to 20% of staff have been off work, and the company is currently down about 12%, he says.</p> <p>\u201cWe have 25,000 call-centre people, and we handle all the 999 calls \u2013 which have seen a massive spike. We have 30,000 engineers out there working on the broadband and phone network. They are all key workers, and at one stage we were 4,500 down.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most serious issues Jansen and other telecoms companies are dealing with is the spate of attacks on mobile phone masts by conspiracy theorists who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/14/arsonists-attack-phone-mast-serving-nhs-nightingale-hospital\" title=\"\">wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of the virus.</a></p> <p>\u201cWe have had 45 incidents, ranging from burning masts \u2013 about 18 \u2013 to barbed wire being put around fixed poles where people saw a shiny box and thought it was 5G kit when it wasn\u2019t at all,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have had people driving their cars at our Openreach engineers then swerving at the last minute to intimidate them, as well as verbal and physical abuse.\u201d</p> <p>He is scathing about the conspiracy theorists: \u201c It is more dangerous lying in the sunshine than walking past a 5G mast. It is unfounded nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>Jansen recognises that BT is not under the immense pressure that many businesses have found themselves under during lockdown. However, he says, its pay-TV operation is being hurt by there being no sport on air, and it will also be hit if many of the small businesses it provides telecoms services to do not survive.</p> <p>\u201cThe good news is everyone needs what we do,\u201d he says. People need connectivity more than ever before. But we are not immune.

He had, he says, the \u201cstrongest order book ever\u201d for his marquees, furniture and lighting.</p> <p>The company had been preparing to take on temporary staff and hire vans in April to take equipment to about six events per week, ranging from corporate meetings and outdoor opera to a food festival. Instead, he has lost \u00a3100,000 in cancelled and postponed bookings and has hurriedly tried to cut costs. \u201cOur income has just fallen off a cliff. We are doing some work for the NHS, but it doesn\u2019t really touch the sides.\u201d</p> <p>Morris\u2019s request for an overdraft extension from his bank \u2013 NatWest, part of Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 was refused. He has subsequently tried to apply for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/covid-19-bailout-loans-issued-uk-firms-banks\" title=\"\">government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (Cbils)</a>, but the bank has told him his business is not eligible as it is \u201cnot viable\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have invested heavily back in the business, so we have made a loss, but that\u2019s due to our investment. All our assets are fully owned, they are not financed,\u201d says Morris. He claims NatWest has \u201cstonewalled\u201d him and looked only at Trafalgar\u2019s accounts for the last six months, including the quiet winter period, which he says is unrepresentative.</p> <p>Morris had six weeks\u2019 worth of cash in the bank before the shutdown. But four weeks after trade disappeared, the money is now running out. He warns: \u201cWe are not in a unique position, we will be one of thousands.\u201d<br><strong>Joanna Partridge</strong></p> <h2>Neil Clifford, chief executive, Kurt Geiger</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49c5cb3f24d4dbb359ccb7ef5455734bd173b08e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49c5cb3f24d4dbb359ccb7ef5455734bd173b08e/0_127_1945_1166/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Clifford, Kurt Geiger CEO\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A sunny Easter would normally have meant strong sales of strappy sandals and trainers at Kurt Geiger shoe shops. Instead, sales are down by two-thirds after the company closed its stores a few days ahead of last month\u2019s high street lockdown.</p> <p>Chief executive Neil Clifford says online trade is up 10% \u2013 led by an 80% jump in sales of slippers as the nation stays indoors \u2013 but it\u2019s nowhere near enough to offset the lost store sales. \u201cIt\u2019s a shocker. I used to be depressed by a 10% drop; now I look and it\u2019s down 66%,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Clifford reckons it will take three years to rebuild to where Kurt Geiger started the year \u2013 on a high with record takings of nearly \u00a3400m, underlying profits of \u00a340m and 10 new shops planned.</p> <p>It is hoped shops will be able to reopen in June, and summer stock sold in July and August. But in the meantime Kurt Geiger has slashed costs where possible, freezing rents and benefiting from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/billions-in-loans-scrapping-of-rates-the-chancellors-help-for-businesses\" title=\"\">business rates </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/17/billions-in-loans-scrapping-of-rates-the-chancellors-help-for-businesses\" title=\"\">holiday</a>. It has had to cancel orders, delay shipments and try to repurpose materials, such as leather ordered for summer footwear, into styles appropriate for autumn. Despite that, it has mountains of stock which is unlikely to sell this year, though some will be held until next spring or summer.</p> <p>Clifford has been encouraging employees not required at work to volunteer for the NHS. He is offering 50% discounts for health workers and giving away 2 million pairs of shoes to NHS staff.</p> <p>He is also not drawing a salary until stores reopen, and expects to ask higher-paid staff to take a pay cut next month. But he is topping up the pay of the 83% of employees who are furloughed. Clifford says the firm has been able to do the right thing with support from its banker, Lloyds, and private equity backer Cinven. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to come out of this on the right side from a human perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gives the message to employees that everyone\u2019s together on this. But there is no manual for this event. It\u2019s not something you could Google \u2013 what to do in a pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>As the business fights these battles, it is also planning for a different future: Clifford believes this will accelerate the move to online.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clearly an awful time for everyone.

Suddenly, changes that would in pre-corona times have generated years of debate, dissent, hesitation, opposition and delay turn out to be possible overnight.</p> <p>Exhibit A in this context is the way in which hundreds of thousands of white-collar workers are suddenly able \u2013 indeed, required \u2013 to work from home.</p> <p>Exhibit B \u2013 more worrying \u2013 is the way governments are either <a href=\"https://pandemicbigbrother.online/en/\">already deploying</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/growth-in-surveillance-may-be-hard-to-scale-back-after-coronavirus-pandemic-experts-say\">actively considering</a>, surveillance technology of such intrusiveness that it would have caused outrage and furious protests even a month ago.</p> <p>Exhibit C is <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/apple-and-google-partner-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology\">the decision</a> of the two huge tech companies that control mobile phone technology \u2013 Apple with its iOS operating system and Google with Android \u2013 to create application programming interfaces (APIs) that will enable governments to build and deploy proximity-tracking apps on every smartphone in the world. This is remarkable in two ways. One, it involves cooperation between the two members of a global duopoly that would normally trigger antitrust suits \u2013 yet there hasn\u2019t been even a whimper from competition authorities. And two, the companies insist that if governments do not comply with the conditions that they \u2013 Apple and Google \u2013 are laying down, then they will withdraw the APIs. The specific condition is that apps using the APIs are not mandatory for citizens. They have to be opt-in. So here we have two powerful global corporations laying down the law to territorial sovereigns. Unthinkable a month ago. But now\u2026</p> <p>Signs of dramatic changes are everywhere \u2013 even in GP surgeries. The <em>New York Times</em> published an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/telemedicine-uk-coronavirus.html\">interesting report</a> on how the work of GPs in London is being transformed by the virus. \u201cWe\u2019re basically witnessing 10 years of change in one week,\u201d one GP told the paper. \u201cIt used to be that 95% of patient contact was face-to-face: you go to see your doctor, as it has been for decades, centuries. But that has changed completely.\u201d Before the virus, video appointments made up only 1% of annual appointments with British GPs and other practice staff. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/gps-told-to-switch-to-remote-consultations-to-combat-covid-19\">NHS has urged</a> thousands of clinics across the country to start switching to remote consultations and has fast-tracked approval of digital providers to ramp up their offerings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is still a serious digital divide and on the wrong side of it are many elderly people \u2013 who are the most at risk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of these providers is accuRx, which was already being used by many GPs as a trusted tool for sending text messages to patients. As the crisis deepened, accuRx built a video-calling system <em>over a weekend</em> after the virus arrived in the UK and has \u2013 according to the <em>NYT</em> report \u2013 quickly become \u201cthe go-to provider for online appointments, offering a stripped-down interface and the comfort of having long been in primary care clinics\u201d. Having watched one of their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aryAqMqdHg0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">instructional videos</a>, I can see why it\u2019s taken off. Zoom could learn a few tricks from them.</p> <p>While the pandemic continues to turn the world upside down, new realisations are beginning to dawn on us. As the tech analyst Ben Evans <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/4/13/covid-and-forced-experiments\">puts it</a>: \u201cWe\u2019re all online now, and, just as importantly, we\u2019re all willing to use this for any part of our lives, if you can work out the right experience and business model. Today, anyone will do anything online.\u201d</p> <p>Well, up to a point. While it\u2019s true that not being online suddenly puts one at a real disadvantage, community volunteers up and down the country are realising that there is still a serious digital divide: and on the wrong side of it are many elderly people \u2013 who are the most at risk from the virus.</p> <p>The most important implication of the breakneck changes currently under way, though, is that there\u2019s no going back to normality. That train has left the station. The coronavirus isn\u2019t going away. And even when there is a vaccine, the risk will endure, because climate change and the erosion of wildlife habitats will <a href=\"https://jembendell.com/2020/03/23/the-climate-for-corona-our-warming-world-is-more-vulnerable-to-pandemic/\">ensure a ready supply</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis\">zoonotic viruses</a>. Companies will have learned to build supply chains with resilience built in. White collar workers will have discovered that they don\u2019t have do as much commuting as before. Air travel will go back to being a luxury. And so on.</p> <p>A useful metaphor for the new normal will be what happens when driving a car on black ice. The worst thing to do is to slam on the brakes, because then you completely lose control. Instead you pump them \u2013 brake a little, then back off and repeat the process until back on gritty tarmac. Our immediate futures will be like that: a combination of what some people are beginning to call \u201cthe hammer and the dance\u201d \u2013 the hammer of successive lockdowns followed by digital dances in which we use surveillance and testing to find and control outbreaks. We are heading into a cautious, rather than a brave, new world \u2013 with Orwellian overtones. I wonder what Aldous Huxley would have made of that.</p> <h2>What I\u2019m reading</h2> <p><strong>Covid and forced experiments<br></strong>A long and <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/4/13/covid-and-forced-experiments\">thoughtful essay</a> by Benedict Evans.

  "<p><br>Early into his career, the journalist and former Wall Street trader Michael Lewis published a piece of what might be termed \u201cspeculative nonfiction\u201d, in which he imagined, in awful detail, the effects <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/03/michael-lewis-japan-201103\">of a devastating earthquake on Tokyo</a>. Fictional elements in Lewis\u2019s article were designed to magnify the impact of his traditional reporting, which argued that Tokyo was ill-prepared to handle such a visitation (one that was, Lewis argued, long overdue). The<em> Disaster Report </em>series of video games, which launched in 2003, is rooted in melodramatic entertainment, not rigorous journalism, but by placing you on the Tokyo streets during a major earthquake and its brutal aftershocks, the effect is equally chastening.</p> <p>In this<a href=\"https://disasterreport-game.com/\"> latest, long-awaited entry to the series </a>(development was temporarily halted following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/japan-earthquake-tsunami-questions-answers\">2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake</a>, the epicentre of which was 232 miles north-east of Tokyo) you play as a young out-of-town office worker. The game opens on a packed bus, moments before a grasshopper chorus of smartphone buzzes starts up as the government sends a city-wide text message alerting residents to the incoming disaster. At this point you must choose how to react from a number of options: continue to stand nonchalantly in the aisle, not wanting to embarrass yourself in front of strangers, or fall to hands and knees and steady yourself for the worst.</p> <p>The earthquake strikes, the bus flips, and you crawl from the wreckage into a city transformed by the ground it once stood firmly upon. As you pick your way through the city, aftershocks cause buildings to collapse, roads to crack open, fires to ignite and, of course, the death toll to rise. Along the way you meet a cast of characters who react in the precise variety of ways you might expect in the aftermath of such a disaster: the instagrammers snapping shots for the feed, the convenience store workers hiking the price of bottled water, the gawpers, the helpers, the wanderers, the purposeful.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty2SaWO6ifY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ty2SaWO6ifY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty2SaWO6ifY&amp;feature=emb_title\">Watch a trailer for Disaster Report IV</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The game has an idiosyncratic tone, at times approaching something like a public infomercial (when threatened by an aftershock, the game challenges you to choose whether to seek out open spaces, or resilient-looking structures for shelter), at other points like a daytime soap. As neither a svelte blockbuster nor a tightly focused indie game, <em>Disaster Report IV </em>belongs to an almost vanished class of game: the mid-budget romp. It struggles to match its ambitions from the position of this middle ground. The translation work is distractingly inadequate (as routine an English word as \u201cflooding\u201d, for example, is rendered as \u201cliquification\u201d). The designers\u2019 vision for arresting set pieces \u2013 toppling skyscrapers that kick up tsunamis of dust and all the rest \u2013 is almost never met by the programmers\u2019 technical capability. The experience is also littered with strange, meaningless design choices: this is, for example, one of the few games in which the protagonist is forced to visit the bathroom for essential toilet breaks.</p> <p>And yet for all these shortcomings, <em>Disaster Report IV </em>remains an unforgettable journey. As the rumble of an aftershock rolls in, the screams go up, and you frantically look around to see if and where the next wave of damage is likely to occur, the game offers a compelling, frightening glimpse of how it might feel to live through this particular natural disaster. (This is especially true of its virtual reality mode, unlocked midway through the adventure, which further situates the player inside the harrowing drama.)</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has shown that humans find foresight much harder to act upon than hindsight.

  "<h2>Jessica Glenza, health reporter</h2> <p>When I pictured covering a crisis as a reporter, and I assumed one day I would, I did not imagine it would be from my kitchen table. But here I am. Stuck in a chilly apartment in Jersey City as we all, reporters included, attempt physical distancing.</p> <p>When Covid-19 first struck New York, I would walk to a park near my apartment with a panoramic view of the city, look across the Hudson River, and remember people who were once part of my daily routine: the deli workers, the delivery men, the nurses and doctors.</p> <p>And one day I woke up to hear Covid-19 had reached its grim hand across the water and taken hold of my own community. My city councilman, Michael Yun, died \u2013 his storefront served constituents just a few city blocks from my home.</p> <p>Flowers, picture frames and memorial messages were stuck in the roll-down steel gate. His smile was still alive on the awning above the store. The shop was his magazine stand for decades before he became a politician.</p> <p>From this kitchen table, I\u2019ve talked to weeping emergency room doctors, angry nurses and stoic medical residents. I\u2019ve interviewed experts in bioethics, palliative care, health insurance and hospital financing.</p> <p>We all knew that America\u2019s patchwork, for-profit health system would be a frail match against a vicious disease such as Covid-19. But constant calls for reform were often chalked up to politics, and change was always delayed.</p> <p>Now, as a slow and bungled response from leaders in Washington DC continues to hamper any effort to recover, decades of poor health policy have been exposed.</p> <p>Picture this: in 1975, the population of the US was 215 million people. Today, it is 328 million. In roughly that time, the US has <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/089.pdf\">lost 567,000 hospital beds</a>, down from 1.4 million, because they were considered inefficient and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-13/why-u-s-hospitals-are-ill-prepared-for-coronavirus\">unprofitable</a>.</p> <p>This was directly related to how people pay for healthcare. As the number of hospital beds fell, emergency departments also closed because they were the only part of the hospital required to treat patients who couldn\u2019t pay. Which, it turns out, was a lot of people.</p> <p>On average, the cost of healthcare per person between 1960 and 2015 has outpaced wage growth by roughly 2.4% each year, according to <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/HistoricalNHEPaper.pdf\">government economists</a>. We\u2019ve also managed to exclude 9% of the entire population, or roughly 28 million people, from health insurance entirely, with catastrophic potential for people\u2019s finances.</p> <p>Is it any wonder, then, that it is unaffordable for Americans to see the doctor? That, last year, <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/data-note-americans-challenges-health-care-costs/\">half of Americans</a> delayed or skipped care because of prohibitive costs? That, in turn, those untreated chronic conditions leave people vulnerable to Covid-19? And that the most <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/disparities-policy/issue-brief/disparities-in-health-and-health-care-five-key-questions-and-answers/\">vulnerable among us</a>, both to Covid-19 and chronic health conditions, are the poor and people of colour?</p> <p>These questions, of course, are rhetorical. Because even as this pandemic leaves us shocked and terrified, the 10,000 horrific deaths in New York City alone are the predictable consequence of a healthcare system that leaves so many people on the sidelines.</p> <p>There are some other people I have talked to in this crisis: people with hope. Many emergency room doctors, nurses and researchers believe Americans may now see how urgent change is, and believe that maybe in disaster there is also opportunity.</p> <h2>Ed Pilkington, chief reporter</h2> <p>What does a reporter do when they are in lockdown and can\u2019t get out of the house to report? How can you write the first draft of history when you\u2019re not able to witness history in the making?</p> <p>Well, one answer I have discovered, as a Guardian reporter barely able to leave our Brooklyn home (my wife, Jessica, has a brain tumour, so we are being extra careful to avoid infection), is that you join your son for one of his online college classes.</p> <p>One evening, I was drawn into listening to a Zoom panel discussion at Georgetown University, where Felix is in his final year. One of the speakers was Ron Klain, who in 2014 was appointed by Barack Obama to be America\u2019s Ebola tsar. He was asked what he thought of the way Donald Trump was handling coronavirus, and he replied: \u201cThe response will be studied for generations as a textbook example of a disastrous, failed effort.\u201d</p> <p>It was like a eureka moment for me. Suddenly everything that I had been hearing and reading \u2013 Trump\u2019s downplaying of the crisis, his comparison of Covid-19 to flu, the botched federal effort over diagnostic testing \u2013 fell into place. We were living through a historic failure of leadership and governance.</p> <p>That electric realisation set me on the path towards writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">a series of pieces tracking Trump\u2019s epic mishandling of the pandemic</a> and its cost in American lives. I may not be able to leave the house, but with a little help from my son\u2019s online classes I hope I have found a way to contribute to our understanding \u2013 and anger \u2013 about the disaster that\u2019s unfolding here in the richest nation on Earth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebce546cbd8b68c0c7ade69d6fdb9bed93b9cf87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebce546cbd8b68c0c7ade69d6fdb9bed93b9cf87/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Park Avenue in Manhattan earlier this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Park Avenue in Manhattan earlier this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sonia Moskowitz Gordon/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Amanda Holpuch, reporter</h2> <p>The first time I walked outside in New York City, once people were sheltering in place, I felt an eerie sense of familiarity. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, was begging Donald Trump to send more ventilators to the city while the president was insisting the country would be back open by Easter. The mix of desolate streets, denial from the Trump White House and pleas from a political leader had happened two-and-a-half years earlier in Puerto Rico, after hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the island. One big difference was that, in Puerto Rico, I woke up every day trying to get deeper into the island to understand the extent of destruction while phone and internet service were almost completely shut down. Now I\u2019m stuck at home, depending on the phone and internet to let me know what is happening in the city I live in. <br><br>It makes a big difference, seeing people\u2019s faces and interviewing them in person. I\u2019ve been focused on the economic impact of the outbreak, so I do get a small taste of what that looks like when I walk past closed restaurants and shop at a grocery store where the city building inspectors are limiting how many people are inside. I\u2019m really looking forward to interviewing people in person again.<br><br>I\u2019m also deeply concerned that, a few months down the line, we\u2019re going to see the same sort of denial from the White House that has followed Hurricane Maria \u2013 Trump still hasn\u2019t acknowledged the actual death toll from the hurricanes.</p> <h2>Tom McCarthy, national affairs correspondent</h2> <p>I\u2019ve been working exclusively from my kitchen table, so all news collection has happened on the phone, by text or online. The challenge is to tell a national story while operating from this island. But working to our advantage, I\u2019ve found, is a real sense of urgency on the part of sources \u2013 experts in public health and emergency response. They want to get the message out: we need tests, we need contact tracing, we need equipment, we need leadership, and we need a plan. One public health expert whom I met on the phone last month texts me multiple times overnight; I awake to his links. Then home-schooling for my two daughters begins, with its own set of challenges.</p> <p>Ironically, physical distancing has offered windows into the lives of sources across the country that otherwise would never appear. Before, you had a sense of which sources were likely to know what and which analysts could speak most effectively in a public-facing way. Now you know who has a dog and who yells at their kids, and whose kids yell at the dog. It\u2019s been cheering, that part of it.</p> <h2><strong>Nina Lakhani, environmental justice reporter</strong></h2> <p>I was a freelancer for seven years before starting full time with the Guardian last October, and so have perhaps found working from home a bit easier than others.

It\u2019s a jarring read 25 years on, indicative of both a strange, leery, still-existing form of interview-writing that views female actors as horny objects and also of how a young Silverstone was treated and objectified at the time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/17/rita-wilson-tom-hanks-coronavirus-choloroquine-covid\">Rita Wilson on coronavirus and chloroquine: \u2018I was so ill I could hardly stand\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was the year she broke out big with Clueless, Amy Heckerling\u2019s sparkling teen comedy that transported the loose plot of Jane Austen\u2019s Emma to Beverly Hills and rocketed her into a position of global stardom that no one at that age would feel equipped to deal with. \u201cI was so overwhelmed by being famous because I was such a young girl and it was never really my intention,\u201d she tells me over the phone from her house in Los Angeles, just a few miles away from where her character Cher lived on screen.</p> <p>But the self-described \u201ctheatre nerd\u201d had suddenly become one of the cool kids, inundated with offers and attention, not all of it welcomed. She tells me she doesn\u2019t remember the wording of the profile in question (\u201cBut I remember the pictures!\u201d she adds) but does remember how she was seen by men at the time and also how she would respond. \u201cI felt empowered to be like \u2018oh no you don\u2019t!\u2019\u201d she tells me when faced with inappropriate behaviour.</p> <p>Silverstone, now 43, might live in the same city as she did back then (and literally in the same house as she bought in 1996) but her star is of a different kind now. She still acts, on screen and on stage, but also devotes her time to parenting, activism and writing (she published a vegan cookbook in 2011). Veganism and animal rights have become something of a crusade for her (<a href=\"https://www.peta.org/features/alicia-silverstone-rather-go-naked-wool/\">she\u2019s bared all for a number of Peta ads</a> and uses <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aliciasilverstone/?hl=en\">her Instagram page</a> to regularly remind her followers of the cruelty involved with the meat industry) but while she\u2019s keen to discuss the importance of a plant-based diet at length (\u201cWe\u2019re just killing people left and right with animal agriculture,\u201d she tells me with vigour), we\u2019re here to talk about movies.</p> <p>Specifically, her role in a scrappy new comedy called Bad Therapy, an indie about a couple experiencing problems in their relationship who seek help from a manipulative therapist. It\u2019s mildly diverting at best but touches upon some interesting observations, such as one scene where Silverstone\u2019s character bemoans having to be the person always taking care of her partner while not being taken care of herself.

Her first role came in 1993, playing a 14-year-old who develops an obsessive, almost fatal, attraction to an older man in The Crush, a fun, schlocky thriller that saw her named best villain at the MTV movie awards.</p> <p>\u201cI felt so connected to the material for some reason,\u201d she tells me, said material casting her as a violent and unhinged teen, before laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that says about my state of mind at the time!\u201d</p> <p>Silverstone was 15 when production started (she turned 16 on set) and for the entirety of the shoot she was living alone in an apartment in Vancouver, legally emancipating herself in order to dodge working restrictions for someone of her age.</p> <p>\u201cI think I probably missed some emotional steps that needed to happen in a normal situation of development,\u201d she admits. \u201cBut I also jumped light years ahead in other ways.

But at 18, it was a huge lifestyle change and one that started to sour her experience of Hollywood.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really just extreme how I was being talked to and talked about,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I just got really turned off by it.\u201d</p> <p>She was \u201cextremely isolated\u201d in her younger years and didn\u2019t have \u201ca ton of friends in the industry\u201d (in the aforementioned Rolling Stone interview at the time, she noted: \u201cThey say there\u2019s a young Hollywood out there, but I\u2019m not part of it\u201d) yet, professionally, was now at the top of every director\u2019s casting wishlist. At the height of her fame, she was handed a rare multimillion-dollar, three-year first look deal by Columbia with her production company attached, an opportunity that theoretically gave her more power than any other teen in Hollywood at the time. But at such a young age, how hard was it, I wondered, to get her voice heard and respected in such a male-dominated scene?</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately or fortunately, I do not know, I\u2019ve never had that problem with my work,\u201d she says. \u201cI have had it in my personal life, learning to have a voice in my real life has been harder than having a voice in my work life. Maybe it\u2019s because I had success at a young age and sometimes maybe to my detriment, when I should have been wrangled. I probably behaved not as well as I could have at times. Maybe I was too young to even notice. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it doesn\u2019t mean they always listened and doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t laughing behind your back. I just stupidly didn\u2019t have a very political point of view on it. I would sort of just light the house on fire by accident and not be aware of the consequences until it was over and be like, \u2018Oops maybe I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I ask if she can remember any particular examples.</p> <p>\u201cOh for sure but nothing I want to share,\u201d she laughs.</p> <p>Her biggest role came next, as Batgirl in Joel Schumacher\u2019s critically reviled misfire Batman &amp; Robin (\u201cThat definitely wasn\u2019t my favourite film-making experience,\u201d she confesses), a film that brought her less positive attention than the last, from a Razzie award to a depressing new focus on her weight (at the time tabloids would cruelly refer to her as Fatgirl, with some paparazzi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/feb/29/features.review\">chanting</a> it as they chased her for pics). \u201cThey would make fun of my body when I was younger,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was hurtful but I knew they were wrong.

I knew that it was not right to make fun of someone\u2019s body shape, that doesn\u2019t seem like the right thing to be doing to a human.\u201d</p> <p>She tells me that her clear idea of right and wrong (a lowpoint being a journalist asking for her bra size during an interview) meant that even when things around her grew toxic, she tried to learn from it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"997f0a270fcc42c47802e1447a45a71f56f035fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/997f0a270fcc42c47802e1447a45a71f56f035fa/0_128_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alicia Silverstone, George Clooney and Chris O\u2019Donnell in Batman &amp; Robin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alicia Silverstone, George Clooney and Chris O\u2019Donnell in Batman &amp; Robin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/WARNER BROS/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere were working circumstances that were less than favourable in terms of how things went down,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd no, I didn\u2019t say \u2018fuck you\u2019 and come out like a warrior but I would just walk away and go, OK I know what that is and I\u2019m done, I\u2019m not going near that again.\u201d She admits, though, that in her personal life, her strategy for dealing with male creepiness \u201cwas a lot more muddy\u201d but her confidence professionally meant that she started to veer away from doing what a young actor <em>should</em> do and instead focus on what she <em>wanted</em> to do.</p> <p>\u201cI stopped loving acting for a very long time,\u201d she says, adding that it was a role in a David Mamet play that reinvigorated her. \u201cMy body was just like, this is what I\u2019m meant to do, I love it so much, I need to find a way to do both, to be able to be an actress and be an activist at the same time so that\u2019s what I did.\u201d</p> <p>There was a big shift when she turned 30 as a new agent told her to only say yes if she loved something, an \u201cearth-shaking\u201d development in her life. Since then she\u2019s worked with Yorgos Lanthimos on The Killing of a Sacred Deer (\u201cI would just die to work with him again\u201d) and recently took on a small but horribly effective role in the icy horror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/04/the-lodge-review-dread-filled-chiller-with-a-devastating-twist\">The Lodge</a> from the directors of Goodnight Mommy. \u201cI really love those weird movies,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As with any interview at this surreal time, talk turns to the pandemic and Silverstone has been focused on \u201ceverything\u201d she can do. Rather than sing her part in a star-studded Imagine cover, she\u2019s been donating and calling attention to initiatives to help provide frontline responders with PPE and those on the breadline with food. \u201cI\u2019m an activist so I\u2019m kind of used to suffering in terms of what is going in with the world with the climate and looking at the abuse that\u2019s going on,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is very surreal and different but at the same time, I\u2019ve been dealing with this for 25 years.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s convinced that it\u2019s an awareness of the bigger picture that\u2019s led her to take the day-to-day name-calling or situations of disrespect in her stride (\u201cI always go to: there are bigger things in the world, there\u2019s bigger tragedies,\u201d she says earnestly). The two films she was supposed to be working on right now can wait, she\u2019s happy to spend time at home with her son, aware of the privilege that\u2019s allowed her to do so. We end our call with more impassioned talk of veganism (she\u2019s perhaps understandably ecstatic that her eight-year-old son\u2019s favourite food is kale) and it remains a topic that seems to spark more passion from her than film. But she\u2019s been acting now for almost 30 years. I ask her if the thrill does remain, if she wants to be doing this for another 30 years.</p> <p>\u201cI think I do really love acting still,\u201d she says, pausing for thought. \u201cI mean \u2026 I know I do!\u201d Any excitement for a Clueless reunion \u2013 would Cher be a lawyer or a politician or a publicist by now? \u2013 would best be parked, though. \u201cI hope to be doing theatre until I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Bad Therapy is out now to stream in the US with a UK date yet to be announced</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p><strong> </strong>The year I turned 11, my uncle Josiah Ssesanga was admitted to a hospital in Uganda with meningitis. It was 1994, and he was HIV positive. Between him and death stood a tattered post-civil war health system. </p> <p>Treatments for HIV and Aids existed in other parts of the world, but in Uganda they were mostly limited to those used in clinical trials. For my uncle\u2019s particular infection \u2013 cryptococcal meningitis \u2013 there was a drug called Fluconazole. But he didn\u2019t know it existed; regardless, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford it. and even among patients who took it, only 12% survived beyond six months.</p> <p>The day after his admission, \u201cpeople from some American project\u201d arrived with a mountain of paperwork, my aunt remembers. They were doing a clinical trial testing a more effective combination therapy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/macron-urges-on-trials-of-controversial-coronavirus-drug\">Macron calls for clinical trials of controversial coronavirus 'cure'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere were about three pages on possible side-effects of the drug. We were also warned that he would need to keep taking the drugs even if the project ended,\u201d my aunt says. \u201cBut for most of us, in that hour, our answer was yes. We were desperate. Anything to stop that pain.\u201d</p> <p>Cryptococcal meningitis causes very severe headaches. These headaches drove uncle Ssesanga out of his mind and he often needed to be physically restrained.</p> <p>Once on the trial, my uncle received a combination of two drugs with rapid results: in under two weeks, he was discharged from inpatient care. In the subsequent months, he completed his university degree and became an inspector of schools. He would return to the hospital to meet researchers and had to endure painful lumbar punctures to track his recovery. </p> <p>However, the clinical trial provided only a few months of therapy beyond the researchers\u2019 initial period of investigation. After that, my uncle was told to start paying for his pills. A week\u2019s supply alone cost more than he earned in a month. He quietly stopped the treatment.</p> <p>About a year later, a researcher came looking for him. She implored my relatives to get him back on treatment. But there was still not enough money. Two years later, he fell seriously ill and died in the harrowing way every Aids patient without access to antiretroviral therapy did.</p> <p>Today my family is proud that my uncle contributed to the development of combination therapy that restored hope and dignity to so many Aids patients globally. But we are still heartbroken that, for him and many other African patients, their contribution to these advances was unmarked and thankless.</p> <p>Now I fear that we will replay this painful script again as we face the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Recently, two French doctors <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP0bfBQ6zzc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">suggested that coronavirus</a> vaccine trials should be done in Africa: the continent with <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">the lowest numbers</a> of confirmed cases so far. Speaking on French TV, one said: \u201cIf I can be provocative, shouldn\u2019t we be doing this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation?\u201d </p> <p>Given the long history of medical racism and painful experiences like that of my family\u2019s, some Africans were <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/racism-row-french-doctors-suggest-virus-vaccine-test-africa-200404054304466.html\">understandably annoyed</a>, calling these comments racist and akin to treating people as \u201chuman guinea pigs\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52192184\">Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus</a>, the director general of the World Health Organization, described the doctors\u2019 comments as a hangover from a \u201ccolonial mentality\u201d, and said that \u201cAfrica can\u2019t and won\u2019t be a testing ground for any vaccine\u201d.</p> <p>And yet \u2013 as happened with the Aids pandemic \u2013 Africa will certainly be a testbed for some coronavirus therapies, vaccines or contagion controls. It already is. The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) has, for instance, put out an early \u20ac4.75m call <a href=\"https://www.edctp.org/call/mobilisation-of-funding-for-covid-19-research-in-sub-saharan-africa/\">for research proposals</a> on Covid-19 responses in Africa. And this is actually a good thing.</p> <p>Excluding the continent from ongoing pandemic research is not the answer. Clinical trials can be ethically done \u2013 and many African countries and institutions now have ethics review boards to oversee this research.</p> <p>The injustice is in how geopolitical power imbalances, through patent law, ration access to the drugs that come out of successful trials.<strong> </strong>In 1996, the United States began approving the powerful combination therapies to treat HIV and Aids that came out of studies like the one my uncle was part of. It was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/markschoofs/how-to-survive-yet-another-plague\">a watershed moment for US activists</a> (many of them marginalised gay men).</p> <p>But it should not have been only theirs. Patients across the developing world had also given their own blood, spinal fluid and sinew, to test and establish these therapies. For years, with the cover of western patent laws, drug companies priced medicines out of their reach. By 2000, when India\u2019s Cipla Pharmaceuticals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/18/aids.sarahboseley13\">defied these patents</a> to produce generic Aids drugs that countries in the global south could afford to purchase for their citizens, my uncle was long dead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/1980s-aids-pandemic-coronavirus-gay-community-survive\">Fear, bigotry and misinformation \u2013 this reminds me of the 1980s Aids pandemic | Edmund White</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The WHO\u2019s declaration that Africa won\u2019t be a testing ground for coronavirus vaccines ultimately overlooks a much bigger problem.

  "<p>The new archbishop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/uganda\">Uganda</a> has become the first primate of the country\u2019s Anglican church to embrace the use of modern contraceptives after urging women to be \u201cvery careful\u201d to avoid getting pregnant during the Covid-19 lockdown.</p> <p>The ninth archbishop of the church of Uganda, Stephen Kazimba Mugalu, said in a televised Sunday <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwvecqWz1gw\">sermon</a> he is \u201creally concerned\u201d that many women will get pregnant during the nationwide <a href=\"https://www.yowerikmuseveni.com/more-guidelines-covid19-preventive-measures-and-need-shut-down\">shutdown</a>. On Tuesday, President Yoweri Museveni <a href=\"https://www.yowerikmuseveni.com/fourth-address-covid19\">extended</a> the initial 14-day lockdown for a further three weeks.</p> <p>\u201cI am really concerned [that] after [this] coronavirus situation we will have many, many women who will be pregnant. Actually we need to be careful. I want to call upon you women don\u2019t forget to use your contraceptives because we don\u2019t want [you] to have unwanted pregnancies,\u201d said Kazimba, who was <a href=\"https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Stephen-Kazimba-enthroned-Archbishop/688334-5474548-xtdi8ez/index.html\">enthroned</a> as archbishop on 1 March.</p> <p>\u201cThese guys are there; they are eating and doing things [having sex]. Be careful because these men they don\u2019t care. You women [must] be careful.\u201d</p> <p>Women in Uganda have an average of <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN\">five children</a>, but just <a href=\"http://www.familyplanning2020.org/entities/80\">30% of women</a> use a modern form of contraception.</p> <p>Simon Richard Mugenyi, advocacy and communications manager at <a href=\"https://www.ippf.org/about-us/member-associations/uganda\">Reproductive Health Uganda</a>, welcomed the archbishop\u2019s comments.</p> <p>\u201cWe are happy with the church of Uganda stand on certain areas of reproductive health, including the use of contraceptives. For a long time, the church of Uganda has been progressive on these matters.</p> <p>\u201cOn his installation service, the archbishop spoke in support of sexuality education - one area that has received mixed reactions. And when he comes up and speaks about the reality - encouraging women who are sexually active not to forget their contraceptives \u2013 it show that the church is not living in denial,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe applaud the archbishop for speaking out on an issue that is being left out in the Covid-19 messaging, yet is so crucial.\u201d</p> <p>Alain Sibenaler, the country representative for the UN population fund (UNFPA) in Uganda, said: \u201cThe call is a reflection of the daily realities and the \u2018new normal\u2019 [of] life in Uganda and elsewhere. Couples, women and men still have sex during outbreaks and crises, but forgetting that can be deadly.\u201d</p> <p>Sibenaler added that the UNFPA had worked with the Inter-Religious Council of Uganda to tailor messages about sexual and reproductive health to suit respect different religious teachings.</p> <p>However, Asia Russell, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.healthgap.org/staff-board\">Health Global Access Project</a>, said: \u201cArchbishop Kazimba attacked abortion and LGBT Ugandans during his first chance to address the country as archbishop \u2013 fuelling hate and stigmatising women for seeking essential health services such as abortion, [which] is extremely troubling. His latest comment doesn\u2019t change that.\u201d</p> <p>Kazimba\u2019s comments have not been universally accepted by other members of the Christian community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-in-africa-what-happens-next\">Coronavirus in Africa: what happens next?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat is his [Kazimba\u2019s] view. It\u2019s immoral to do that. The stand of the Catholic church is clear. No artificial use of contraception,\u201d said John Baptist Odama, archbishop of the Gulu archdiocese.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t support any form of modern family planning methods. They are not right. It\u2019s unacceptable. Let them [women] learn to follow their cycles. Let them use natural family planning and spacing of children, which will not interfere with their [birth] systems and will not cause harm.\u201d</p> <p>Russell added that before the outbreak, Ugandan women were facing \u201ctremendous barriers\u201d to access safe, quality, comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare services.</p> <p>\u201cThe government\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown policies are twisting the knife in, leading to new crises. There has been a massive and egregious failure by the government to protect pregnant women who need health care services,\u201d said Russell.<br><br>Civil society is calling on the government to declare a blanket exemption on the travel ban for pregnant women, so they can seek proper obstetric care and prevent avoidable maternal deaths.</p>",

He was in isolation for the period in which he would have been infectious.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said the pin-prick test performed by Rio Tinto was <em>not</em> an acute diagnostic test or even a reliable means of screening for current Covid-19 infection.</p> \n  <p>He said the reason point-of-care testing had been banned as an acute diagnostic test under emergency provisions of the Public Health Act was because it measured the presence of antibodies to Covid-19 \u2013 not the virus itself. This could lead to results being misinterpreted, with both false negatives and false positives being common, as demonstrated by recent such testing.</p> \n  <p>Dr Robertson said public health officials were currently working to verify the results of the individual at an accredited laboratory because the validity of the point-of-care test was unknown.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T08:35:08.493Z\">at 9.35am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ab13f8f08bade1f29582b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:50:46.189Z\">8.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here\u2019s the Queensland premier:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AnnastaciaMP/status/1251303678864011266\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MeAt20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MeAt20</a> - in Queensland of course! <a href=\"https://t.co/QQDBc0Mrkd\">pic.twitter.com/QQDBc0Mrkd</a></p>\u2014 Annastacia Palaszczuk (@AnnastaciaMP) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnastaciaMP/status/1251303678864011266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T08:01:57.125Z\">at 9.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9aaae98f080ee11044736d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T07:25:52.213Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Over the past few days, the #MeAt20 challenge has taken off on Twitter.

One of the deaths that happened yesterday was a 42-year-old man who was a crew member on the Artania cruise ship, which is leaving Fremantle today on its way to the Philippines.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo that is by far our youngest person that has died in Australia from this disease, and a terrible tragedy for that man and his family,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cBut it is a reminder for us that this is not just an old person\u2019s disease. We are all in this together for a reason. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause it can affect any of us, and while it is true to say that the majority of cases, over 80%, are mild, some of them can be very severe. <strong>We still have 55 people across Australia in intensive care right now, some of those have been ventilated, some of them extremely sick. </strong>These are really strong reminders for us why we are taking this disease seriously and why, indeed, the whole world is taking this pandemic seriously. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are continuing to concentrate on the way out of where we are now. Australia has done extremely well compared with the rest of the world up to this point. But it is not a time for us to decrease the measures that we have in place. We have, for example, been one of the major testing countries for Covid-19 and a recent paper published by the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine \u2013 I am an alumnus of that institution \u2013 shows that we are at the highest level in terms of case ascertainment and making sure that the cases that are out there are being found. </p> \n  <p>\u201c<strong>We reached a milestone: we now have over 400,000 tests that have been done here in Australia, and so again, by sheer numbers, we are doing a lot of testing. </strong>But one of the challenges that was put back to the Australian health committee from the national cabinet on Thursday was for us to <strong>continue to look and consider what our testing strategy should be into the future. So that is part of our surveillance plan that we are developing, and we had a discussion about that today at our Australian health committee meeting with the other chief health offices. I chaired that meeting today and we discussed what that surveillance plan should look like and particularly what should we be doing in terms of expanding testing</strong> now that we have that capability to do so.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe other thing we discussed today at the committee meeting was about our rapid response capability. How should we, and how could we, respond to things like what is occurring in north-western Tasmania at the moment?\u201d</p> \n  <p>He is referring here to the healthcare worker in Tasmania with the virus who worked across with three aged-care facilities in the north-west, and as a result in the past 24 hours, almost 500 tests have been done on all the residents and the staff of those facilities.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T05:43:05.422Z\">at 6.43am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9a8a378f08b7689b030b83\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T05:11:00.104Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afternoon summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the key announcements and updates from today:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The <strong>federal government has said its Covid-19 tracing app will not be compulsory. </strong>The government services minister, Stuart Robert, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/18/australia-coronavirus-updates-live-investigations-into-aged-care-homes-amid-outbreaks-latest-news?page=with:block-5e9a69cd8f080ee1104472a4#block-5e9a69cd8f080ee1104472a4\">revealed details about how the app will work</a>, saying there will be no geolocation, surveillance, or tracking of people with the app, and that the federal government would not have access to any of the app\u2019s data.

Nothing more, nothing less. It is entirely voluntary. It will be available in the next week or two for Australians to use. And all it does is, it allows a manual process to be sped up digitally. </p> \n   <p>Right now if you test positive to coronavirus, health officials will sit down with you and ask you to trace back where you were and who you have been with. And it is really hard to try to remember the 90-year-old lady in the queue behind you at a shopping centre, or a family that was close by you for whatever purpose. </p> \n   <p>CovidTrace as an app digitises that and allows the tracing aspect to be sped up. <strong>The intent being, and what we really want, is for as many Australians as possible, well over 40%, to download the app. It works very simply. There is no geolocation, there is no surveillance, there is no tracking.</strong></p> \n   <p>The app simply connects with another [phone with the] app if those two phones are within 1.5 metres for 15 minutes. It simply swaps phone numbers and names. That information is held encrypted and securely on the individual\u2019s mobile phone. <strong>You control your own data and if you test positive to coronavirus, that information is given straight to state governments so they can contact individuals [who] may have come into contact with an infected person.</strong></p> \n   <p>Right now, a privacy impact assessment is being conducted. The privacy commissioner is involved, and all that will be made public. <strong>The source code will be made public,</strong> so all Australians can have absolute assurance, from the privacy right the way to the security, right the way to the individual elements, the bits and bytes of the code, that the app is simply a health app for individuals voluntarily used to help us trace those who may have been close to someone who has been infected by the virus. </p> \n   <p>So we want to be as transparent as we possibly can.

  "<p>The first arrests took place on the harbour at Yarmouth, the cobbled, picture-book port that lies on the Isle of Wight\u2019s quieter western side. It was a Sunday evening, 30 May 2010, almost a decade ago, but Nicky Green still sees it in Technicolor. She was working in Salty\u2019s, the family\u2019s restaurant just yards from the marina. \u201cIt was the bank holiday weekend and we were absolutely stacked,\u201d she says. Her parents were serving behind the bar, her daughter was waiting tables and her younger brother, Jamie, a 42-year-old fisherman, was out on the quay, just back from sea. \u201cI\u2019d called and asked him to bring in some lobsters,\u201d Nicky recalls. \u201cI was expecting him to walk through the door when someone told me he\u2019d been arrested.\u201d</p> <p>In the moment, she was too busy to follow it up. \u201cI was juggling the food, the crowds, the tables, and I knew Jamie was having an issue with some other fishermen \u2013 they were accusing each other of pinching lobster pots, and he was dodging the CID guy trying to deal with it. I thought this was fishermen bickering. I never on this Earth thought it was serious. How would I have ever imagined the gravity?\u201d</p> <p>But Jamie Green never came back. A year later, on 2 June 2011, Green, his crew of three \u2013 Scott Birtwistle, Daniel Payne and Zoran Dresic, as well as Jonathan Beere, a local scaffolder \u2013 were found guilty of conspiracy to import class A drugs. Their sentences, a combined total of 104 years, reflected the scale of the haul: a fisherman had found 250kg of cocaine worth an estimated \u00a353m roped together in holdalls and floating in the island\u2019s Freshwater Bay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a331751c8b6f9ce519d9679e5633c3b2193ad9d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a331751c8b6f9ce519d9679e5633c3b2193ad9d5/0_384_6436_3862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicky Green, whose brother Jamie was one of the five men found guilty of conspiracy to import class A drugs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicky Green, whose brother Jamie was one of the five men found guilty of conspiracy to import class A drugs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The men, now known as the Freshwater Five, were not typical multimillion-pound drug smugglers. They had no previous convictions relating to drugs or dishonesty, no forensic evidence linked them to the cocaine, and a Proceeds of Crime Act inquiry assessed their gains from criminality at zero. They did not lead lavish lifestyles, and how they planned to distribute such a quantity of drugs was not made clear. The case has rocked the island, dividing friends, family and fishermen. While Birtwistle and Payne are out on licence, the remaining three men are nine years into 24-year sentences. Now new evidence means their case is coming back to the appeal court, a chance for all five to clear their names.</p> <p>***</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a kid, Jamie was fishing mad \u2013 that\u2019s all he\u2019s done. He was a rufty-tufty fisherman who didn\u2019t suffer fools gladly\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A couple of miles across the Solent from the UK mainland, the Isle of Wight\u2019s private beaches, secluded inlets and narrow valleys have made it a smuggling base for centuries. It remains strangely isolated, a place where many juggle two or three jobs, since wages, employment and opportunities are all markedly lower than in the rest of the south-east. But for most, smuggling has been relegated to movies and history books. Today, the movement of drugs, firearms and people belongs to organised crime \u2013 which is partly why the Freshwater Five case stands out.</p> <p>Jamie Green, the central figure linking the men, was born and raised on the island; at trial, the prosecution accepted that he was \u201ca legitimate lobster fisherman\u201d. His parents founded Salty\u2019s more than 25 years ago, converting a garage first into a fish shop, then a bar and restaurant, which are now under new ownership. \u201cAs a kid, Jamie was fishing mad \u2013 that\u2019s all he has ever done,\u201d Nicky says. Green left school at 16, got his first boat at 17, and by 2010 owned the 39ft Galwad-y-Mor, supplying London restaurants and fishmongers, and exporting to mainland Europe.</p> <p>The family were well known in Yarmouth. Green had convictions for public order offences and drunkenness \u2013 and always pleaded guilty. \u201cHe was a rufty-tufty fisherman who didn\u2019t suffer fools gladly, and there are a lot of fools round Yarmouth,\u201d Nicky says. At the time of his arrest, Nikki, his wife of 21 years and the mother of their three children, was being treated for breast cancer.</p> <p>Birtwistle, the Galwad\u2019s only permanent crew member, saw Green as a mentor. Now 29, he has moved back home with his mother on the mainland in Selsey, a seaside town in Sussex. Calm and measured, he\u2019s balancing his wish to speak out with a wariness of not being believed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The police had intelligence that a drug delivery was arriving on a container ship to be picked up by a smaller boat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like Green, Birtwistle had always loved fishing. \u201cI loved the freedom. It didn\u2019t even feel like a job,\u201d he says. On leaving school, he placed an ad on findafishingboat.com. Green contacted him in December 2009, and within weeks Birtwistle had moved to the island to live in a caravan on Green\u2019s land and crew the Galwad. \u201cJamie knew his stuff and taught me so much,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Selsey, skippers take control and don\u2019t teach you anything in case you get your own boat and take their business. Jamie was different.\u201d</p> <p>Danny Payne, now 45, had known Green since his teens. Now back on the Isle of Wight, he\u2019s working on building sites, still adjusting to \u201clife outside\u201d. Payne had been a more reluctant crew member on that bank holiday trip. \u201cDo you know Quint, the shark hunter from Jaws?\u201d Payne asks. \u201cWell, that was Jamie. I used to call him Quint. He\u2019d bark and shout if you were doing it wrong, but he sure knows his way around a boat.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d worked for Jamie a lot over the years and used to enjoy it,\u201d he continues. \u201cMy dad was a submariner, and I\u2019ve always been around the sea. But by then, I was living with my girlfriend, we had a rescue dog and I didn\u2019t want to go out on the boat for days on end. I was doing more building work for nearly as much money, but I knew Nikki was ill and Jamie was having problems finding crew. It\u2019s ridiculously hard and always dangerous \u2013 even in the calmest weather, there\u2019s rope flying, the stink of rotting crab and fish and diesel. Most people only came once.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2c98038356acf9c9a1b8a9e8468b4fd963d6d85f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c98038356acf9c9a1b8a9e8468b4fd963d6d85f/0_395_6616_3970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freshwater Bay, Isle Of Wight, where 11 holdalls filled with cocaine worth \u00a353m were found floating in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freshwater Bay, Isle Of Wight, where 11 holdalls filled with cocaine worth \u00a353m were found floating in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zoran Dresic, 36 and from Montenegro, was the third crew member. Married with three children, he\u2019d worked in Austria and Italy before coming to the UK on a false passport just two days before. According to Dresic, he\u2019d been promised work by a friend of a friend. This was not unusual \u2013 the whole fishing industry uses foreign crew and the Yarmouth harbourmaster confirmed the Galwad\u2019s high turnover. However, the prosecution\u2019s case was that Dresic, who spoke no English and had little if any fishing experience, had come with the express purpose of overseeing a drug drop, and that the \u201cfriends of friends\u201d \u2013 two men who\u2019d delivered Dresic to the island before returning to the mainland and disappearing \u2013 were coconspirators.</p> <p>Green set sail with his crew on the afternoon of Saturday 29 May, heading to the shipping lanes where cargo ships head east to Europe or west to the United States. According to Green, the forecast was bad but expected to break around midnight, by which time they\u2019d have reached the five-mile central reservation between the lanes, less heavily fished and rich with spring tides. What he couldn\u2019t have known was that it was also the centre of a massive police operation that weekend, run by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and Middle Market Drugs Partnership (both of which have since been disbanded).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Galwad was searched and partly dismantled. Every inch of the boat was scanned, but no molecule of cocaine was found</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Operation Disorient had received intelligence that a drug delivery was arriving on a container ship, to be picked up by a smaller boat and taken ashore. Patrol ships and surveillance planes were looking out, and at some point the Galwad crossed their radar. Mid-channel, where the suspected transfer took place, in the dead of night in a force eight gale, there was nothing much to see. The Galwad\u2019s instruments show that the boat never stopped moving, though at 12.40am, for three and a half minutes, it reduced its speed from 5 knots to .57 of a knot. The prosecution claimed this was sufficient for Green and his crew to recover 11 holdalls of cocaine they believed had been jettisoned by a passing container ship, the MSC Oriane, travelling to Holland from Brazil. (The Oriane continued on; no trace of drugs were found on it. )</p> <p>How close these two vessels came has been hotly disputed, and at trial, one expert witness said he couldn\u2019t help but be \u201camused\u201d by the prosecution\u2019s claims. Anyone on the Oriane, travelling at 18 knots, would have risked ripping the holdalls apart if they chucked \u00a353m of cocaine into the sea. And on the Galwad, in the pitch black, in high winds, on rough seas, retrieving even one holdall in three and a half minutes would have been \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d683c333b2538fef66f99e24572d5e57c75836a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d683c333b2538fef66f99e24572d5e57c75836a9/0_200_6006_3604/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green\u2019s 39ft fishing boat, the Galwad-y- Mor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green\u2019s 39ft fishing boat, the Galwad-y-Mor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In any case, the Galwad eventually headed back towards the island. That Sunday was clear and bright. The boat stayed out all day \u2013 in full view of bank holiday crowds, plus two police officers on Tennyson Down, a grassy chalk cliff with panoramic sea views. Shortly before the Galwad arrived back in Yarmouth, these police officers radioed in an entry: \u201cSU116 (the Galwad\u2019s ID number) is moving westbound, six to seven items overboard at intervals.\u201d Green has claimed that, if these \u201citems overboard\u201d were anything, they were old bait and waste; the crew may have been clearing the boat at the end of the trip, though he doesn\u2019t recall doing so.</p> <p>On arrival in Yarmouth, baskets of lobster in their arms, they were arrested and the boat seized. Police were so certain drugs were on board that Green\u2019s original charge sheet cited \u201cpossession and intent to supply\u201d. The Galwad was searched and partly dismantled. Its tank was pumped, an itemiser \u2013 a highly sensitive piece of police equipment \u2013 scanned every inch of the boat, but no molecule of cocaine was found.</p> <p>The following morning, Monday 31 May, a lobster fisherman found 11 holdalls, each stacked with cocaine, strung together on a rope attached to a weighted buoy in Freshwater Bay. (It was an area too shallow for the Galwad to have reached, but the prosecution claimed the holdalls may have drifted.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The police told me I didn\u2019t have to be in prison, I could have a new identity \u2013 but I told them I didn\u2019t know anything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is where the investigation gets contentious. The court heard that on the Monday morning, in a police operation debrief, substantial amendments were made to the police log \u2013 so many that they became longer than the log itself. (In court, the log keeper claimed her radio had stopped working during the operation, which meant much had been missed.) The most critical amendment, and the only direct evidence linking the men to the drugs, was made by the two police officers from Tennyson Down. Contrary to strict protocol, they didn\u2019t attend the debrief, but made this amendment when they met the surveillance commander in a car park. It read: \u201cThe items appeared to be dark in colour and approximately the size of a large holdall. They were tied together on a line and were dispatched from the boat one after another, totalling 10-12. The last item was a red floating buoy.\u201d</p> <p>Had Green really deposited this enormous haul of cocaine when it was clear and sunny, in a bay where the shore and cliffs were heaving with people? Would an experienced fisherman leave the bags floating and drifting instead of carefully anchored and submerged? And having witnessed such a suspicious deposit, would police leave these items in the sea all night without even taking a photograph or noting the GPS? (In court, one of the police officers claimed they didn\u2019t have a camera.)</p> <p>No more evidence emerged. There were satellite calls made on the Galwad at sea that Saturday night \u2013 but their content is unknown. Although the cocaine was damp, suggesting leakage, no traces were found on the boat. And though a guilty plea would have substantially reduced their sentences, all five insisted they were innocent. Before the trial, police visited Payne in Parkhurst prison, offering freedom in exchange for information, but Payne insisted he had nothing to give. \u201cMy girlfriend had split up with me. They knew I was struggling,\u201d he says. \u201cThey told me I didn\u2019t have to be there, I could go wherever I wanted, I could have a new identity \u2013 but I told them I didn\u2019t know anything. That fishing trip was your normal bloody nightmare like every other fishing trip.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the figure most tenuously linked to all this was the fifth man, Jon Beere, who was arrested eight months later, then tried and convicted alongside the Galwad crew. Beere was 42, married for 18 years to Sue, a special needs support worker, and father of Elle, Maisie and Flynn. He ran a scaffolding business and though, according to Sue, Beere and Green weren\u2019t close, they\u2019d known each other for years \u201cas everyone on the island is connected\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"28a2afbd50a40daafbdbc475da92ee7a10875cd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28a2afbd50a40daafbdbc475da92ee7a10875cd9/1001_1156_4537_2722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sue Beere, the wife of Jonathan Beere, one of the convicted men, with Maisie and Flynn, two of their three children.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sue Beere, the wife of Jonathan Beere, one of the convicted men, with Maisie and Flynn, two of their three children.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For nine years, Sue has raised their children without Beere. \u201cWhen it happened, Jon had a scaffolding job on the harbourmaster\u2019s building in Yarmouth, right by Jamie\u2019s boat,\u201d she says. The case against Beere is that, on Friday 28 May, the day before the fishing trip, he\u2019d taken his distinctive pick-up on the hovercraft to Portsmouth, where he met Dresic, and delivered him, along with two associates who were helping him as they spoke English, to Green. The defence claimed that Green had been at sea, unable to collect this potential crew member, so he\u2019d called Beere from his boat and asked him to do it as a favour. This was the extent of the case against the scaffolder.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest joke is that for doing that, he was the land-based criminal mastermind, the \u2018organiser\u2019,\u201d Sue says. The prosecution failed to produce any phone records, emails, texts or other lines of communication between Beere and whoever was supplying the drugs from abroad, or any other network, other than these two men. \u201cJon\u2019s the most disorganised person I know,\u201d Sue continues. \u201cHis filing system is Tesco bags tied with a knot, or telephone numbers scribbled on scraps of paper. He used to drive his poor secretary round the twist. Jon was very much part of the community \u2013 he\u2019d do anything for anyone. He wouldn\u2019t just give you a lift, he\u2019d lend you his car. He was a decent bloke. I talk like he\u2019s dead! But it\u2019s so hard, because every aspect of life hasn\u2019t been the same since.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The Freshwater Five\u2019s trial took place in Kingston upon Thames, Soca\u2019s home turf, though the defence team had pushed for it to be held locally, or somewhere jurors might understand conditions at sea. \u201cDespite that, we still went into it believing it would all be resolved, that in a minute someone would see sense,\u201d Nicky Green says. \u201cYou\u2019re in this arena, you don\u2019t know the rules, and you don\u2019t see the steam train coming at you.\u201d Although the judge\u2019s final summary appeared to pour doubt on much of the evidence \u2013 referring to the \u201clarge number of additions and alterations\u201d to the police log and the \u201cextraordinary\u201d account from Tennyson Down \u2013 the jury reached a guilty verdict with a majority of 11 to one.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If it was a year in prison, I\u2019d have been devastated, but 24? How could I tell the children? How was I going to cope?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt was like one of those films where the whole tone changes, like someone has flicked a switch,\u201d Nicky says. \u201cThere was this huge rush of emotion. Sue was howling. Nikki was howling. You\u2019re picking up all these broken people around you.\u201d</p> <p>The sentences followed that same day, the harshest reserved for Green, Beere and Dresic, who were seen as more deeply involved. \u201cI remember hearing \u201824 years\u2019,\u201d Sue says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge number. If it had been a year, I\u2019d have been devastated, but 24? How was I going to tell the children? How was I going to cope? What about the business? What about the house? What about\u2026 us?\u201d</p> <p>How has she coped? \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve got through it, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d she says. \u201cSupport, love, family, friends \u2013 and believing in Jon. My dad does the \u2018blue jobs\u2019 \u2013 splitting the wood, fixing the car. My mum has been amazing with the children.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Jon was arrested, our eldest was doing her GCSEs and our youngest was still in playschool. He\u2019s missed Elle getting her GCSE results, he\u2019s missed the birth of Willow, his first grandchild. He\u2019s missed two graduations. Maisie\u2019s first communion. Flynn\u2019s first day at primary. His last day at primary. Jon has never seen Flynn play football, and Flynn\u2019s in the top team on the island. He missed his best friend\u2019s funeral last year. Births, marriages, deaths. Everything.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie Green has also missed family milestones. His children have grown up, begun work, had children. One daughter now runs a local crab business (We\u2019ve Got Crabs) and his son, just 13 when Green was arrested, is now a North Sea skipper. Their mother Nikki died of cancer four years into Green\u2019s sentence. For 18 months, she was too sick to make the journey from Yarmouth to HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire \u2013 though Green was allowed to visit her once in a hospice. He also attended her funeral, handcuffed to a guard.</p> <p>\u201cThere were about 700 people there and every one of them tried to hug him,\u201d Nicky says. \u201cFair play to the prisoner officer \u2013 he did his best to get out the way, with arms flying everywhere.\u201d Green also gave the eulogy with the guard crouched behind the podium. Green has said that when his voice started to falter, the guard quietly urged him on, and told him he could do it.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The appeal has given some hope to the families. It\u2019s being fought by Emily Bolton, the English lawyer who founded the Innocence Project New Orleans (which has exonerated 36 people to date) and is now director of <a href=\"http://appeal.org.uk/\">Appeal</a>. For Bolton, working in the UK has been a shock. \u201cIt\u2019s far slower, there\u2019s less access to information, no one picks up the phone, there\u2019s no sense of urgency,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the US, we got someone out in one year \u2013 I\u2019ve been working on this case for six.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This has destroyed a big part of my life and I want to rectify that, but even if I clear my name, I\u2019ll have the stigma</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One piece of evidence that Bolton had been requesting since 2014 \u2013 and that forms the basis of this appeal \u2013 finally arrived at the end of 2019. It involves the digital data taken from the onboard computer of the police cutter that was tracking the Galwad that night. The data had reportedly not been disclosed or used at trial, but shows two things. One is that in the shipping lanes around the time of the \u201chandover\u201d, the Oriane was heading south, moving further from the Galwad than had been suggested in court.</p> <p>More significantly for Bolton, back at Freshwater Bay at the time of the \u201cdeposit\u201d, it showed a mystery vessel heading towards the exact location where the drugs were later found, after the Galwad had passed through the area. \u201cThat was either the ultimate suspect panicking and dumping the drugs because police were everywhere, or a police boat going to search the area the Galwad had left and finding nothing,\u201d Bolton says. \u201cEither of those should have been disclosed at trial \u2013 and if it had been, I\u2019ve no doubt the men would not have been convicted.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s cautiously optimistic. \u201cI think the evidence is strong,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s digital, not something subject to human interference \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t wake up at 4am worrying about it. The families have been through so much, the idea that we might lose is absolutely chilling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fce1cbeaf3adcac5df53adb72cb48509fa3460a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fce1cbeaf3adcac5df53adb72cb48509fa3460a/235_442_6132_3679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scott Birtwistle, 29, another crew member who isout on licence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott Birtwistle, 29, another crew member who is out on licence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the men themselves, there\u2019s hope mixed with dread mixed with disbelief.

But Birtwistle and Payne have lower expectations. \u201cThis has destroyed a big part of my life and I want to rectify what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Birtwistle says, \u201cbut even if I clear my name, I\u2019ll always have the stigma.\u201d Payne abandoned hope years ago. \u201cIt was not doing me any good mentally,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you continue to think about it, you\u2019d go mad.

  "<p>Next month, I will have been at the Guardian for a midlife crisis-inducing 20 years. No party, for obvious reasons, but I will mark the occasion by sitting alone in a dark room and watching the grains of sand slip ever faster through the hourglass of my life. Rock on!</p> <p>I recently looked back on what no one refers to as my juvenilia, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/jun/21/fashion.hadleyfreeman\" title=\"\">the first article I ever got into the paper was about my early teenage years when I had anorexia nervosa</a>. Now, with my platinum anniversary coming up, I shall bring you the sequel, about what happened in my late teenage years, because I seem to be reliving them, and so, as I shall shortly explain, are all of you.</p> <p>When I was 17, and about to leave hospital for the seventh time in four years, my doctor told me it was time to stop \u2013 and this is the technical term \u2013 dicking around. If I lost weight again, she said, she wouldn\u2019t allow me to accept my place at university the following autumn, which I\u2019d somehow got, despite having hardly any GCSEs and precious little guarantee of A-levels. (To this day, I\u2019m 100% certain that offer was a pity offer, and my university ended up having to put up with me for three years because their casual bet went very wrong. Well, who among us hasn\u2019t ended up in a relationship or two that way?) So, I stopped dicking around. But all the anxiety that I once channelled into not eating \u2013 where could it go now? Enter, stage right, my next dance partner: Mr Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.</p> <p>There was handwashing, of course. I washed my hands so much, my knuckles bled for years and are still, over two decades later, ridged with scars. I feared other people hugely, as Lord only knows what they were contaminated with, and maintained a strict distance from them, inwardly raging at anyone who breached it, crossing the road to avoid big groups. Mainly, though, I stayed home, as the outside world was too full of perils. But even home wasn\u2019t entirely safe: I anxiously watched which surfaces \u2013 counter tops, doorknobs \u2013 family members touched and would then frantically wipe them down, like a grande dame, pointedly tidying up after my scruffy guests. Coats and shoes were a nightmare, food packaging even worse. And, obviously, no one could ever touch me. Any of this now sounding weirdly familiar, Britain?</p> <p>A psychologist later suggested that my anorexia had been another form of OCD, and maybe that\u2019s true. But what all of it \u2013 the not eating, the cleaning \u2013 felt like to me was a means of taking the fun out of life, which I succeeded at spectacularly. So, as I look around today\u2019s fun-free, anxious world, I increasingly wonder if I\u2019m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/23/back-to-the-future-writer-bad-guy-biff-was-based-on-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Biff Tannen from Back To The Future 2</a>, the tyrant who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4m848bh1iY\" title=\"\">commandeers the time travelling car and turns the future into a mirror image of his own twisted psyche</a>. Now that everyone is physical distancing and in self-isolation, I assume that at some point, in 1996, I accidentally got into a DeLorean and rendered 2020 in the image of my teenage self. And for that, I am enormously sorry.</p> <p>But this also means I can tell you what will happen afterwards, because I have lived it. My imprisonment was self-imposed as I fought an imaginary enemy. Today\u2019s stakes are obviously higher, the rippling aftereffects a little more global than me no longer moving seats in the cinema because someone sat too close. (Only three seats away! How dare they?) But I can tell you how it feels when you no longer need to keep the world at a fearful arm\u2019s length: it feels amazing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/28/hadley-freeman-in-these-strange-times-relax-in-the-90s\">In these strange times, there\u2019s no better place to relax than the 90s | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has been almost 15 years since I last insisted on bringing my own utensils to restaurants, and still I thrill at the freedoms of normal life: spontaneously leaving my home without spending 20 minutes beforehand covering my hands and face like a serial killer; letting myself be hugged and hugging back. A few summers ago, I met some friends for a picnic in the park. We stayed there all day, sharing food, lying in the grass. As the day slipped into evening, someone suggested going to the pub, and off we went. To everyone else, this was just a normal summer\u2019s day, but it made me almost cry with happiness. When you have been through self-isolation, there will always be a part of you afterwards that stands to the side of yourself, marvelling at the life you can now lead.</p> <p>At the worst point of my OCD, doctors told me I was being self-destructive. Now, in a deliciously ironic twist maybe only I can enjoy, they are recommending those same quirks as lifesaving essentials. Validation has never been so unexpected. But none of this has triggered a relapse in me, because there\u2019s some hard core inside of me that is so happy to be free of the self-imposed imprisonment that not even an externally imposed one can respark it. I acknowledge the real risks around us, now, but I shut my ears when my mind starts to whisper about the false ones. Because I know how good it feels to be free. One day, all of us will feel that freedom once more, and you will never take it for granted again.</p>",

Instead of searching through outer space, the project leaders invite people to connect with nature and solve environmental problems closer to home.</p> <p>\u201cCitizen science helps scientists and researchers analyse huge data sets which they simply couldn\u2019t manage by themselves, helping to save them hours of time and contributing to scientific breakthroughs,\u201d said Katherine Mathieson, chief executive of the British Science Association, which is helping to coordinate some of the UK-based initiatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic way to know you are making a positive difference without even having to leave your own home.\u201d</p> <h2>Coronavirus</h2> <p>Covid-19 is inevitably one of the most pressing research areas. Despite the efforts of governments and scientists around the world, data on the virus is still patchy, ranging from the very thorough in places such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-testing-how-some-countries-germany-south-korea-got-ahead-of-the-rest\">Iceland</a>, where a high proportion of people have been tested, to the alarmingly opaque, as the spread in many developing countries is likely be taking place without the tracking available in countries with better healthcare.</p> <p>Doctors and researchers at King\u2019s College London and Guys and St Thomas\u2019 hospitals are asking people to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/24/uk-app-aims-to-help-researchers-track-spread-of-coronavirus\">fill in data on their symptoms</a>, or lack of them, through an<a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/\"> app</a>. The results around the UK are encouraging so far, as there has been a fall in the number of people aged 20-69 recording active symptoms, down to about 1.4 million people, from 1.9 million on 1 April. This is no substitute for proper testing, but will provide scientists with valuable data on the possible incidence and spread of the virus.</p> <h2>Earth Day</h2> <p>Fifty years ago, an estimated 20 million people took to the streets in the US and around the world to protest against the rampant destruction of the natural environment, the extinction of species, toxic pollution, and the despoliation of pristine habitats. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/06/guardianobituaries.environment\">Earth Day on 22 April 1970</a> marked the first major demonstration of a new environmentalism that sought to recognise the harm we were doing through untrammelled industrialism.</p> <p>The results of that protest are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/07/save-the-planet-guide-fighting-climate-crisis-veganism-flying-earth-emergency-action\"> still being felt</a>, in legislation enacted to safeguard the environment, in the global climate movement and in conservation efforts. But planned demonstrations for the 50th anniversary \u2013 aimed at spurring a new generation of environmental activism \u2013 have had to be curtailed.</p> <p>Earth Day is now going online instead, and everyone with a smart phone or internet connection can take part. Two projects are currently active, on plastic and air quality, with more to follow, including tracking declining insect populations.</p> <p>Taking pictures of <a href=\"https://earthchallenge2020.earthday.org/pages/plastics\">plastic litter</a> and uploading them will allow for greater tracking of the plastic waste problem than has been possible up to now. Knowing what kind of litter is prevalent and where will help in formulating plastic waste reduction policies. The added bonus is that any cleaning up of plastic litter you do on your daily exercise outdoors will also be tracked.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\">Air quality has improved under the coronavirus lockdowns</a>, but that is likely to be short-lived as restrictions are lifted. The Earth Day <a href=\"https://earthchallenge2020.earthday.org/pages/airquality\">air quality app</a> invites people to photograph their horizon daily and send it in, to be processed centrally to gain a clearer picture of air pollution around the world.</p> <h2>Animal magic</h2> <p>Anyone itching for a bit of escapism without forbidden travel can spend some quality time in central America, courtesy of the Spotting Spider Monkeys project.</p> <p>Spider monkeys are fascinating creatures, very long-lived primates that are slow to reproduce, with each female on average having only one infant every three years. Huge areas of the monkeys\u2019 habitat are being lost to agriculture and other encroachment, with palm oil production one of the leading causes. All spider monkey species are now classed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/18/over-half-of-worlds-wild-primate-species-face-extinction-report-reveals\">threatened with extinction</a>.</p> <p>Researchers are now using drones to track spider monkeys through the forest, and using the footage they are developing an artificial intelligence algorithm capable of finding spider monkeys on its own. Before it can get to that stage, however, the systems needs to be fed thousands of images tagged for the presence of spider monkeys, to train the algorithm. This would take years, without the input of citizen scientists who are being <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/rossmcwhirter/spotting-spider-monkeys\">asked to look at the images</a> from surveillance cameras and point to the presence of spider monkeys.</p> <p>This will also help researchers track the pattern of habitat loss and deforestation, which are threats to other species as well as the monkeys.</p> <h2>Blooming April</h2> <p>Leaving home only once a day for exercise might seem to give little opportunity for outdoor citizen science projects, but you too can do your bit. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/spring-blossom-images-unite-uk-nature-lovers-amid-corona-crisis\">Photographing blossom on your daily walk</a> will help the National Trust compile a changing gallery of pictures from around the country to delight those who can\u2019t make it to see the spring blooms in person.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people have now joined up with the charity\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/blossom-watch\">#BlossomWatch</a>, either by sending in pictures or looking at what others have contributed. The project was launched last month to emulate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/apr/01/japanese-cherry-blossom-in-full-bloom-in-pictures\">hanami</a>, the Japanese custom of celebrating the fleeting sight and scent of blossom.</p> <p>Next year, the National Trust will develop the project further and produce a map to track the blossom across the UK, with a scientific purpose \u2013 it will help track climate change, and shed light on the pollinating insect who rely on blossom, and the birds who feed on them in turn.</p> <p>On similar lines, the <a href=\"https://naturescalendar.woodlandtrust.org.uk/\">Nature\u2019s Calendar website</a> run by the Woodland Trust allows people to record when they see their first butterfly or birds of the spring. With 2.9m records currently, it is the biggest biological record of its kind in the UK and ripe for more.</p> <h2>City Nature Challenge</h2> <p>Coronavirus lockdowns have cleared the streets of our cities of traffic and people and sent nature and wildlife <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/animals-cities-coronavirus-lockdowns-deer-raccoons\">bounding</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/20/dolphins-and-fish-nature-moves-into-spaces-left-empty-by-italian-coronavirus-quarantine-video\">splashing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/29/uk-wildlife-enjoys-humans-lockdown-but-concerns-raised-over-conservation\">scurrying</a> to fill the vacuum. The City Nature Challenge has run for five years, but this year promises to be different.</p> <p>Participants photograph any form of wildlife \u2013 from interesting fungi or even slime mould, to insects and birds, to the traces of animals \u2013 droppings, fur, feathers, shells or even carcases. They are uploaded via the <a href=\"https://www.inaturalist.org/\">iNaturalist</a> app and the online community helps to identify them.</p> <p>It takes place from 24 to 27 April, with the results to be announced on 4 May. The observations gathered become open-source data that will help scientists gauge patterns of global change in natural ecosystems and wildlife.</p> <h2>Rainy days</h2> <p>One for the rainy days is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/26/call-isolated-britons-help-digitise-historical-rainfall-data\">project from Reading University</a>, which will help researchers shed new light on the climate crisis by making local rainfall records of the past digitally accessible, so they can be fed into computer models. Some of Britain\u2019s rainfall and temperature records go back centuries, and this has been invaluable in drawing up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jun/10/data-store-drought\">detailed pictures</a> of the past climate, and thus computer models used to forecast climate change.</p> <p>But some of these vast hoards of data are still marooned in reams of old-fashioned paper records, and thus effectively unusable. Now scientists at the University of Reading are planning to rescue these obscure rain gauge records, using citizen scientists to do the work. Under the <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue\">Rainfall Rescue</a> project, volunteers will fill the gaps in British digital weather records between the 1820s and the 1950s by transcribing observations from scans of the old paper records.</p> <p>Rainfall is already proving popular: in the first 24 hours after the launch, 450,000 tasks had been completed, reports Ed Hawkins, a professor of climate science at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the University of Reading. \u201cThese records will help scientists better understand how and why rainfall varies so much in different locations across the UK. With much of the population facing long spells indoors due to Covid-19, the chance to be part of a serious science project may provide a welcome distraction.\u201d</p> <h2>Lighting up the world</h2> <p>Coronavirus has highlighted the plight of people in developing countries who struggle with the basics of life, and whose precarious existence could topple over into disaster. One of the ways in which development organisations are hoping to improve people\u2019s lives is through providing safe access to power, for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/mar/06/fossil-fuels-poverty\"> clean cooking</a> and for lighting, that will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/11/260-million-school-global-fund-child-marriage-trafficking-labour\">help children with their learning</a> and adults to earn extra money.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/alycialeonard/power-to-the-people\">Power To </a><a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/alycialeonard/power-to-the-people\">the People project</a> will help train artificial intelligence algorithms to spot buildings from photographs of rural areas in developing countries, which in turn will allow them to be connected to the power grid.</p> <h2>Baby burbling</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/30/neuroscientists-decode-brain-speech-signals-into-actual-sentences\">Human speech</a> is one of the abiding scientific mysteries, and language development is a fascinating study. Scientists have been recording baby speech, from children aged between three months and four years, whose parents have agreed for them to wear a recorder for several hours each day.</p> <p>The resulting clips can record some of the first sounds babies make. But by their nature, the recordings also capture a lot of background noise, such as parental speech, television or other sources of sound.</p> <p>Armchair researchers can <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/chiarasemenzin/maturity-of-baby-sounds\">listen to the recordings</a> and identify short clips by their type of sound, to detect which are worth further study. What could be more cheering in isolation than to listen to babies experimenting with speech for the first time?</p> <h2>TB or not TB</h2> <p>Coronavirus may be the most pressing health issue globally, but other diseases have not gone away. Tuberculosis is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/nov/14/why-is-the-world-losing-fight-against-history-most-lethal-disease-tb-tuberculosis\">on the rise again</a>, as new drug-resistant bacteria have surged among the poor and vulnerable around the world.</p> <p>Over the next five years, researchers will be collecting more than 100,00 samples from infected patients, and they want to work on testing which antibiotics are still effective, to understand how and where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/29/antibiotic-resistance-as-big-threat-climate-change-chief-medic-sally-davies\">resistance is growing</a>. Nearly 20,000 volunteers have <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mrniaboc/bash-the-bug\">signed up already</a>.</p> <h2>Pick up a penguin</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/penguintom79/penguin-watch/about/research\">Penguin Watch</a> allows sharp-eyed citizen scientists to mark penguins in footage taken in the Antarctic from cameras set up by zoologists near colonies in the region. Penguins are under threat from the climate crisis, pollution, disturbance and fisheries.</p> <p>Monitoring has been inhibited by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/09/sound-of-icebergs-melting-journey-into-antarctic-jonathan-watts-greenpeace\">difficulty of gaining access to such remote areas</a>, and the ability to crunch through the data that has been collected.</p> <p>Researchers at Oxford University are using <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/penguintom79/penguin-watch\">people\u2019s penguin spotting assistance</a> to trawl through the collected data and enabling them to gauge the crucial timing of key events in the penguin\u2019s yearly cycle, and tell whether they are changing under the influence of global heating.</p>",
  "<p>When it looked like the UK would go on lockdown, final year student Jia Wei Lee knew she had to stay in her student house in Wales, away from her home country of Malaysia. It was a difficult decision, but with a dissertation to write and a student visa to worry about, Lee decided to isolate in Treforest, where she studies biology and conservation at the University of Wales.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re a community but we are separated by walls. I realised that I didn\u2019t want to dwell on suffering,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to bring this community closer together \u2013 breaking the virtual barriers between everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Lee started <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/feelinglightindarkness/\">posting videos on social media</a> to share life hacks \u2013 some useful (like tips for folding clothes in three seconds) and some not so conventionally helpful (how to make a slingshot from a rubber band).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/26/how-to-study-at-home-during-coronavirus-by-online-students-and-tutors\">How to study at home during coronavirus \u2013\u00a0by online students and tutors</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s one of the ways Lee has learned to cope on lockdown, as just one of thousands of students in the UK who are now isolating in university halls and student accommodation.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/life-under-lockdown-coronavirus-in-the-uk\">around one in seven</a> people experiencing distress associated with lockdown, we asked students and psychologists for their tips on how to get through this difficult period.</p> <h2><strong>Create a routine ...</strong></h2> <p>Setting a routine is vital for your wellbeing. Professor Kevin Morgan, sleep expert at Loughborough University, warns that you shouldn\u2019t use sleep \u201cas a counter-product to boredom\u201d. He says it\u2019s critical to get out of bed at a normal time in the morning.</p> <p> Although all the usual life cues are gone \u2013 like lectures, or meeting friends \u2013 we need to keep the things that synchronise our body clocks, Morgan says, such as meal times, recreation, and winding down in the evening.</p> <p>Keeping a routine not only helps with sleep but will keep you motivated, says survival psychologist Dr Sarita Robinson, from the University of Central Lancashire. \u201cPeople in extreme environments can survive and come out mentally intact because they have appropriate coping mechanisms. A structured plan can be really helpful in keeping you motivated, so you don\u2019t just fall away into feeling listless and depressed.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2026 and include time to study</strong></h2> <p>Build studying into your routine. Mike Leaf, a final year geoscience student at Keele University, advises giving yourself deadlines. Setting yourself a goal of finishing a chapter of a project by the weekend, for example, will \u201ckeep you focused without guidance from supervisors.\u201d</p> <p>Lee says she checks in with friends to keep on task. She calls them her accountability buddies. \u201cWe motivate each other to finish our aims for the day.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Set goals, but no pressure</strong></h2> <p>Try not to put too much pressure on yourself to achieve. This is an unprecedented time, and \u201cit\u2019s absolutely OK to not be OK at the moment,\u201d Robinson says. It\u2019s good to have goals, she adds \u2013 \u201cbut my goals aren\u2019t things like I\u2019m going to write a high-impact journal. My goals are finishing that jigsaw, or spending an hour learning how to dance the Charleston. Low-level goals keep you motivated.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t be afraid to reach out</strong></h2> <p>See what support is on offer at your university or students\u2019 union. Robinson says: \u201cIt\u2019s about reassuring students that we\u2019re here for them. There is a lot of support, especially for international students unable to travel home, or students estranged from families.\u201d</p> <p>Call your friends and family, and arrange virtual pub quizzes or games. \u201cIf you\u2019re a person who enjoys social contact, then it\u2019s about trying to find a new way to connect,\u201d she adds.</p> <h2><strong>Stay active</strong></h2> <p>Morgan says the key is to get outside to exercise. \u201cGet out and do a sensible amount of exercise when the sun is bright. Tell your physiology that it\u2019s daylight. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking you can exercise yourself to sleep \u2013 you can\u2019t, but what you can do is relieve some of the stresses that would otherwise accumulate through a confined environment.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/20/what-should-uk-students-do-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">What should UK students do during the coronavirus outbreak?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Exercise doesn\u2019t have to be a workout. \u201cIt can mean moderate walking. It can simply mean being outdoors, raising your heart rate at about 50%,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Lee adds: \u201cWhenever I feel anxious, I make sure to get out of the house and take my one hour of exercise. I can take a breather. It\u2019s about listening to your body.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Get in touch with nature \u2013 inside or out</strong></h2> <p>The mental health benefits from interacting with green space are huge. If you can, go for a walk in a park or garden. But if that\u2019s not possible, bring the garden inside instead. \u201cTry virtual tours,\u201d suggests Robinson. \u201dJust looking at green scenery has been shown to be beneficial. Growing things is also very therapeutic.\u201d</p> <p>Extensive research suggests gardening helps reduce anxiety and stress-related symptoms. You can still grow plants if you\u2019re living in one room in block halls. Herbs such as coriander or rosemary are good for windowsills, and you can even get a (free) houseplant after eating an avocado. Fill a glass with water, and <a href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/gardening/a26064095/how-to-grow-avocado-tree/\">put toothpicks in the avocado stone to suspend </a><a href=\"https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/gardening/a26064095/how-to-grow-avocado-tree/\"> it on the rim, so the bottom half rests in water</a>. Make sure it has sunlight, and when the stone sprouts, pot some compost and watch it grow.</p> <h2><strong>Change perspective ...</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIf you start thinking that you\u2019re stuck in your room, that can be quite demoralising. Rephrase it to \u2018I\u2019m safe in my room, I\u2019ve got opportunities to do things that I can concentrate on,\u2019\u201d Robinson says.</p> <h2><strong>... and try new things</strong></h2> <p>Many exercise classes, social activities, concerts, and theatre shows are taking place online, so there will always be something to keep you busy. See if your favourite artist or comedian is livestreaming a gig. Or use this time to discover new experiences, whether it\u2019s cooking, gaming, or going to the theatre (virtually). There are resources to help you find these new and mostly free experiences. For example, <a href=\"https://www.cheapskatelondon.com/\">Cheapskate newsletter</a>, which normally lists affordable things to do in London, is now collating the week\u2019s best free indoor activities, from digital art tours to \u201ce-life drawing\u201d workshops.</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus crisis has led to a surge of interest in no-frills direct cremations, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/14/its-grief-upon-grief-the-harsh-reality-of-funerals-in-lockdown\" title=\"\">families attempt to navigate the rules on</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/14/its-grief-upon-grief-the-harsh-reality-of-funerals-in-lockdown\" title=\"\">physical distancing</a>.</p> <p>While weddings have been banned to help curb the spread of Covid-19, funerals can still take place \u2013 but various restrictions mean that in many cases a traditional service will not be possible. </p> <p>On 31 March, Public Health England advised funeral directors and faith leaders to limit the number of mourners. Only members of the deceased person\u2019s household or close relatives can attend. If the individual does not have any family, then a \u201cmodest number of friends\u201d can be there, but at no point should mourners breach the two-metre rule. Attendees should also avoid face-to-face or physical contact \u2013 for example, hugging, unless they live in the same house.</p> <p>However, there is huge disparity across the country over how councils are enforcing the rules. For example, Coventry introduced a limit of just five family members at services. In other areas there is a maximum of 10 people, while some crematoriums have announced that all relatives are barred from services.</p> <p>After a row about a clampdown at York crematorium, <a href=\"https://www.york.gov.uk/news/article/143/confirmation-of-guidance-for-york-crematorium?fbclid=IwAR1eWawZD_7roNIO1u7JMWRFJVZWQEKIXCXYB8AwKFVj5k67XFZuG7Y1o40#crem7\" title=\"\">the</a> <a href=\"https://www.york.gov.uk/news/article/143/confirmation-of-guidance-for-york-crematorium?fbclid=IwAR1eWawZD_7roNIO1u7JMWRFJVZWQEKIXCXYB8AwKFVj5k67XFZuG7Y1o40#crem7\" title=\"\">council said</a> <a href=\"https://www.york.gov.uk/news/article/143/confirmation-of-guidance-for-york-crematorium?fbclid=IwAR1eWawZD_7roNIO1u7JMWRFJVZWQEKIXCXYB8AwKFVj5k67XFZuG7Y1o40#crem7\" title=\"\">a</a> <a href=\"https://www.york.gov.uk/news/article/143/confirmation-of-guidance-for-york-crematorium?fbclid=IwAR1eWawZD_7roNIO1u7JMWRFJVZWQEKIXCXYB8AwKFVj5k67XFZuG7Y1o40#crem7\" title=\"\">faith officiant</a> <a href=\"https://www.york.gov.uk/news/article/143/confirmation-of-guidance-for-york-crematorium?fbclid=IwAR1eWawZD_7roNIO1u7JMWRFJVZWQEKIXCXYB8AwKFVj5k67XFZuG7Y1o40#crem7\" title=\"\">would be</a> <a href=\"https://www.york.gov.uk/news/article/143/confirmation-of-guidance-for-york-crematorium?fbclid=IwAR1eWawZD_7roNIO1u7JMWRFJVZWQEKIXCXYB8AwKFVj5k67XFZuG7Y1o40#crem7\" title=\"\">permitted</a>, but immediate family members must stay outside.</p> <p>Under these circumstances, it is perhaps not surprising that funeral directors are reporting a rise in inquiries about direct cremation.</p> <p>A direct cremation is a simple, low-cost option where, typically, there is no funeral service \u2013 no flowers, limos or hymns \u2013 and no family or friends present. In its most basic form it is simply a cremation, and prices start at less than \u00a31,000.</p> <p>This type of service leaves families free to organise a more personal send-off later \u2013 perhaps a memorial service, ash scattering or celebration of life \u2013 once the lockdown is over and everyone is able to attend.</p> <p>David Bowie has been credited with putting this type of straightforward, fuss-free funeral on the map. The singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-dies-of-cancer-aged-69-reports\" title=\"\">died of liver cancer</a> in January 2016 and was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/david-bowie-been-secretly-cremated-7174860\" title=\"\">secretly cremated</a> without any of his family or friends present after telling loved ones he did not want a funeral service. His ashes were later scattered in Bali.</p> <p>While about three-quarters of all UK funerals are cremations, direct cremation accounts for about only 5% of those, says Ashley Shepherd, the managing director of Over50choices, a comparison website specialising in products such as prepaid funeral plans.</p> <p>But he adds: \u201cPersonally, I think that will grow massively over the next few years.\u201d Web traffic relating to direct cremation at his firm increased by 50% between mid-March and the start of April. \u201cPeople are telling us they are more aware of death,\u201d says Shepherd. \u201cPeople are talking about it more.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9e43ec987e508c25bb76bf6d4e2d27845e6d57c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e43ec987e508c25bb76bf6d4e2d27845e6d57c2/198_316_1673_2092/800.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine Powell, co-founder of Pure Cremation\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Powell, co-founder of Pure Cremation, says mass coronavirus cremations will not be necessary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pure Cremation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Catherine Powell, the co-founder of the direct cremation specialist Pure Cremation, says demand for the service doubled between February and March. Sales of the company\u2019s prepaid funeral plan have soared. As a result of the pandemic, \u201cpeople are realising they are mortal and perhaps should talk about their wishes\u201d, says Powell.</p> <p>As with standard funerals, there is a great deal of variation in price and what you get for your money. According to the insurer <a href=\"https://www.sunlife.co.uk/funeral-costs/\" title=\"\">SunLife</a>, the average price for a direct cremation is \u00a31,626, compared with the typical cost of a standard cremation or a burial: \u00a33,858 and \u00a34,975 respectively.</p> <p>One of the cheapest providers we could find was Simplicity Cremations, which charges \u00a3995 for an unattended direct cremation. Returning the ashes to the family costs an extra \u00a375, and in some cases there may be other costs, too.</p> <p>Pure Cremation, which has a crematorium in Hampshire, charges \u00a31,195.

For that price, no family or friends would be present.

  "<p>Next month the Conservatives will have been in power for 10 years. British parties who manage that anniversary are usually unpopular by the time it comes.</p> <p>In 1989, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government lost its poll lead for good. By 2007 Tony Blair was no longer a dominant premier. Accumulating mistakes, personal burn-out, the difficulty of finding fresh goals and voters\u2019 boredom with the status quo; all usually ensure that even parties with able leaders weaken and fall from power after three or four terms.

Since then, their poll lead has swollen further. They are widely expected to win a fifth election, whenever it comes. No British party has done that since the early 1800s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/after-coronavirus-boris-johnsons-tories-will-be-a-very-different-party\">After coronavirus, Boris Johnson's Tories will be a very different party | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This Tory ascendancy has been maintained despite a record in office since 2010 that is arguably worse than those of the UK\u2019s most infamous modern governments, the overwhelmed Conservative and Labour administrations of the 1970s. The Tories have called and lost the EU referendum, pushed Scotland and Northern Ireland towards leaving the UK, pursued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/coronavirus-epidemic-decade-austerity-public-services\">austerity policies</a> that hugely damaged public services and society \u2013 without reducing government debt as promised \u2013 and presided over the worst wage growth for two centuries. Now they appear to be mishandling coronavirus catastrophically. Labour has never been allowed to forget its smaller failure to halt the winter of discontent, more than 40 years ago, when strikes notoriously delayed the burial of some people who had died of natural causes. After coronavirus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/18/boris-johnson-cast-in-the-wrong-role-as-the-coronavirus-pm\">Britain may associate the Conservatives</a> with far worse horrors. </p> <p>But that is not happening yet. Surveys show some mild public disapproval of their performance during the crisis. Yet there remains a general acceptance that, for the foreseeable future, for good or ill, the Tories will be our masters. Such feelings can be self-fulfilling. In 1954, the French sociologist Maurice Duverger wrote: \u201cA dominant party is that which public opinion believes to be dominant.\u201d</p> <p>And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/after-coronavirus-boris-johnsons-tories-will-be-a-very-different-party\">Boris Johnson\u2019s administration</a> seems to be seeking a more complete dominance than previous British governments. It demands compliance rather than frankness from Whitehall. It excludes critical journalists from official briefings. It avoids scrutiny by parliament: the Commons has sat for one full month in Johnson\u2019s first 10 as premier. Meanwhile, the Tories have repeatedly claimed to represent \u201cthe people\u201d, as if no other party can.</p> <p>In all these ways, the UK may be moving closer to becoming a one-party state. Not a totalitarian one, but a democratic one, like postwar Italy or Japan, where one party is in power for decades, on its own or in coalitions, absorbing ideas and policies from rival parties, shamelessly moving rightwards or leftwards according to circumstances, and winning the pragmatic support of ever more interest groups. The life of a single party \u2013 its ideological trajectory, factional struggles and leadership contests \u2013 becomes almost the whole of politics.</p> <p>For some voters, one-party democracy is a relief. It saves them having to think much about politics, from having to evaluate other parties. Last year\u2019s Tory victory owed a lot to this impulse: voting in a third general election in four years, some people were tired of having to consider Labour\u2019s alternatives, and settled for what they knew.</p> <p>In the UK, one-party democracy does exist in non-Tory forms \u2013 thanks to devolution policies enacted by Labour. Wales has been continuously governed by Labour (sometimes in coalitions) since 1999, Scotland by the SNP since 2007. And concerns about the UK\u2019s tendency to produce democratic monocultures pre-date the present Tory era. Twenty years ago, under Blair, the political scientist Colin Crouch coined the phrase \u201cpost-democracy\u201d to describe the contraction of electoral politics to \u201ca small range of issues\u201d, selected \u201cby rival teams of professionals\u201d, while more fundamental questions were settled in private by big business and deferential politicians.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000\">Coronavirus live news: China denies cover-up as Wuhan death toll revised up by 50%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In one sense, our democracy is healthier now. Labour and the Tories disagree much more profoundly than they did during the Blair years \u2013 voters have a proper choice. But in other ways, what we have now is worse: a political system dominated not by \u201cprofessionals\u201d \u2013 New Labour\u2019s bland but often competent and hard-working ministers \u2013 but by amateurish Tory figures.</p> <p>Will this one-party democracy last?

Labour has a prosecutor for a new leader. And the Tories, for all their electoral supremacy, still look ill-equipped to deal with the crises that will return to prominence after coronavirus: over the climate, the viability of modern capitalism, and how to create a society that works for all age groups, rather than mainly the old and middle-aged. These questions are likely to be too divisive to be settled inside one party.</p> <p>When the Conservative era eventually ends, it may do so spectacularly.

The latest version was agreed in 2005 by 196 countries, and it provides the legal framework for the work of the WHO.</p> \n<p>However, Taiwan says its participation is fragmentary and selective, largely because Chinese obstruction. A Taipei government statement pointed out that it reported its first confirmed coronavirus case on 21 January through the IHR system, but was not invited to participate in the three emergency committee meetings held in January, where its voice may have made a difference.</p> \n<p>Taiwanese experts were among the first to visit Wuhan, in the first half of January, and its containment measures later proved effective. Singapore, meanwhile, had two representatives on the committee.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak is a reminder to all the world once again, that politics has barred Taiwan from contact and communication with WHO and global public health experts, and this can only gravely damage global cooperation in epidemic prevention and control,\u201d the statement said.</p> \n<p>Tedros has also drawn criticism for his tireless praise of China and Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership, hailing Beijing\u2019s transparency despite the critical early weeks left when the authorities tried to cover up the extent of the problem in Wuhan. The director general\u2019s defenders say such diplomatic flattery is the price of ensuring Chinese cooperation with information and WHO site visits. Tedros also complimented Trump in a March 23 tweet, claiming he was doing \u201ca great job in the fight against Covid-19\u201d, and Trump was also effusive in praising Xi in the first weeks of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re making it seem like he\u2019s a crony of China, but he\u2019s caught in the middle of a super power struggle competition,\u201d Gostin said.</p> \n<p>The WHO also provided ammunition to its detractors when, on 14 January, it put out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152?s=20\">a tweet</a> citing preliminary Chinese studies finding \u201cno clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was issued on the same day the WHO\u2019s technical lead on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove (a US immunologist) gave a press briefing in Geneva warning of precisely the opposite \u2013 the potential for rapid spread. Concerned that her briefing conflicted with the initial Chinese findings, a middle-ranking official told the social media team to put out a tweet to balance the Van Kerkhove briefing. In so doing, the WHO exposed itself to the charge of contributing to an air of complacency. But the tweet was factually true and does not appear to have been part of a deliberate strategy.</p> \n<p>Again and again, the events of January reflected the difficulties Tedros and his organisation faced in negotiating a path between two hostile superpowers, and the egos of their leaders, without any independent powers to enforce compliance and information sharing.</p> \n<p>However, what mistakes that may have been made in charting that course have little to do with the lethal fiasco that unfolded in the US in the two months after the WHO raised an international alarm.</p>",

This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots.<br></p> \n  <p>But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. </p> \n  <p>The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several \u2018peaks\u2019 at different times across the country.

It said that all deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 needed to be recorded, whether they occurred in hospitals, homes or care homes.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, health ministry figures put the total number of cases in Spain at 188,068 \u2013 up 5,252 from the previous day. That suggests an overnight increase in new cases of 2.9%, which is well in line with recent daily increases \u2013 and markedly down from the 38% daily rise seen when the state of emergency was declared in Spain just over a month ago.</p> \n  <p>The same set of figures show an overnight death toll of 348 \u2013 well down on recent days. But speaking at his daily press conference, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies put the overnight death toll at 585.</p> \n  <p>The new recording and reporting criteria also seem to have skewed the number of cured people. On Thursday, the health ministry said that 74,797 people across Spain had recovered. Twenty-four hours later, the total had dropped to 72,963.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a problem with one autonomous region that was using two sources of information, and we\u2019ve come across some information that lacks the consistency we try to ensure when we offer figures,\u201d Fernando Sim\u00f3n told reporters.</p> \n  <p>Sim\u00f3n said the new data meant that past statistics needed to be revised and warned that it would be hard to gauge the coronavirus\u2019s true impact \u201cuntil the epidemic is over\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Official figures from the health ministry are based only on deaths of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus. But a lot of people are likely to have died from the virus without having been tested, meaning their deaths do not figure in the official count. </p> \n  <p>This is particularly the case in care homes, where thousands of people have died untested, but showing symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. According to figures analysed by El Pa\u00eds, <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-04-16/spanish-social-service-residences-have-seen-at-least-11600-coronavirus-deaths.html\">at least 11,600 people have died of the virus \u2013 or displaying symptoms associated with it \u2013 in Spanish care homes</a>.</p> \n  <p>Those deaths would account for almost two-thirds of the nationwide fatalities.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T13:33:53.287Z\">at 2.33pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9995b68f08cf571cdb2dec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T11:42:31.834Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Jamaican bobsledder Sam Clayton Jr, who inspired the popular Cool Runnings movie, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/sam-clayton-dies-coronavirus-jamaica-bobsleigh-team-cool-runnings-1498502\">died late last month of coronavirus</a>. </p> \n  <p>The 58-year-old was part of the Jamaican bobsleigh team that qualified for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. </p> \n  <p>Clayton is survived by his wife, Annie, a daughter, three sons and three grandchildren.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T13:34:14.022Z\">at 2.34pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9992848f08ea7431f44a44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T11:38:13.059Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some <strong>European</strong> countries are beginning to ease lockdown restrictions on social life, transport and cross-border travel.
